### Summary

Hurricane Melissa, now a Category 5 storm, is threatening Jamaica with catastrophic damage due to its slow movement, extreme rainfall, and powerful winds. Officials from the Meteorological Service of Jamaica and the US National Hurricane Center warn of widespread flooding, landslides, and storm surges, particularly in coastal areas like Port Royal and western Saint Elizabeth. Despite a slight chance it may miss the island, the government has ordered mandatory evacuations and opened over 650 shelters. The storm is being compared to the deadly 1988 Hurricane Gilbert, and officials note that climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of such storms. The article underscores Jamaica’s vulnerability despite contributing minimally to global greenhouse gas emissions, and highlights the urgent need for climate adaptation funding, especially from wealthier nations, as part of a broader regional risk.

### Key Takeaways
  - Hurricane Melissa has intensified to a Category 5 storm with sustained winds exceeding 250km/h (157mph), making it one of the most powerful hurricanes in recent history.
  - The storm is moving slowly at only 7km/h (4mph), increasing the risk of catastrophic flooding, landslides, and storm surges due to prolonged exposure.
  - Jamaica has issued mandatory evacuations for vulnerable coastal communities, including Port Royal, Clarendon, Saint Catherine, and Saint Andrew, due to severe rainfall and flooding risks.
  - The US National Hurricane Center (NHC) warns that the combination of extreme rainfall and slow storm speed could result in a 'catastrophic event' in Jamaica.
  - Jamaica’s government has opened over 650 shelters to accommodate residents fleeing the storm, with officials urging citizens to prepare for days-long impacts.
  - Historically, Hurricane Gilbert (1988) caused over 40 deaths in Jamaica, and officials are comparing Melissa to that storm due to its intensity and potential for similar devastation.
  - Hurricane Melissa is the 13th named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June to November.
  - Climate change is contributing to more frequent and severe tropical storms, including heavier rainfall and slower storm movement, due to warming oceans and air temperatures.

- <small>tags: `climate change, carbon bombs, fossil fuels, carbon emissions, Paris Agreement, climate finance, environmental NGOs, barclays, exxon mobil, cop28, energy transition, global warming`</small>

### Summary

A report by four environmental NGOs — Lingo, Data for Good, Reclaim Finance, and Eclaircies — reveals that 28 new 'carbon bomb' fossil fuel projects have been launched since 2021, despite global commitments under the Paris Agreement to limit warming to 1.5°C. These projects, defined as those emitting over one billion tonnes of CO2, are now part of a broader pattern where over 2,300 smaller projects with high emissions have been approved or initiated. China is the largest contributor, accounting for 43% of such projects, while Western oil majors have the highest numbers of individual projects. The report notes that global banks, especially Barclays, have financed over $1.6 trillion in these projects, with Barclays alone providing $33.7 billion to companies like Eni, ExxonMobil, and TotalEnergies. Combined, the emissions from these projects exceed the global carbon budget required to stay below 1.5°C of warming, contradicting the climate goals set at COP28 and raising alarms about the continued role of financial institutions in accelerating climate change.

### Summary

Scott Adams, creator of the long-running comic strip 'Dilbert', publicly requested help from President Donald Trump to schedule a critical IV treatment for metastasized prostate cancer, which he had been diagnosed with in May. The treatment, Pluvicto—a newly FDA-approved drug—was approved by his healthcare provider, Kaiser of Northern California, but scheduling delays have left Adams without timely access. Trump responded by stating he is 'on it,' aligning with his previous support for the 'Right to Try Act' that empowers patients to access experimental therapies. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy also voiced support. This incident raises broader questions about political involvement in medical access, the responsibilities of healthcare institutions, and the legacy of Adams' controversial remarks that led to the end of the 'Dilbert' strip in 2023.

### Key Takeaways
  - President Donald Trump publicly pledged to help Scott Adams obtain scheduled treatment for metastasized prostate cancer, despite the treatment being FDA-approved but delayed in scheduling.
  - Scott Adams, creator of the long-running comic strip 'Dilbert', revealed he has metastasized prostate cancer and requested help from the President to schedule an IV infusion of the drug Pluvicto.
  - Adams had previously disclosed his cancer diagnosis in a YouTube interview in May, and noted that he shares the same type of cancer as former President Joe Biden.
  - Trump's response, 'on it', reflects his prior advocacy for patients seeking access to experimental or emergency treatments through the 'Right to Try Act' signed during his first term.
  - The White House has not provided details on how Trump intends to intervene in scheduling the medical appointment.

## Trump’s HHS Orders State Medicaid Programs to Help Find Undocumented Immigrants - <small>`cnn`</small>

- **Health & Public Safety**
- <small>tags: `immigration, Medicaid, healthcare policy, Trump administration, CMS, federal government, undocumented immigrants, political controversy, public health, state-federal relations, healthcare access`</small>

### Summary

The Trump administration, through the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), directed state Medicaid programs to verify the immigration status of enrolled individuals, resulting in over 170,000 names being sent to five states and Washington, D.C. The move, initiated in August 2024, is framed by CMS Administrator Mehmet Oz as evidence of federal taxpayer misuse of funds for undocumented immigrants, citing spending figures such as $1.5 million in Colorado. However, state officials including those from Colorado, California, and Washington, D.C., dispute these claims, stating the figures are based on preliminary or incorrect data. Advocates and health experts argue that the policy is duplicative, burdensome, and politically motivated, potentially causing eligible individuals to lose coverage due to missed deadlines or administrative errors. The action also occurs amid legal challenges, including a federal judge’s order to halt data sharing between CMS and the Department of Homeland Security. Experts note that individuals covered under Emergency Medicaid are included in the checks, which are not required under federal law. The broader context includes the enforcement of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which introduced new work requirements and eligibility checks in Medicaid. This policy is seen as an extension of the administration’s anti-immigrant agenda, especially in Democratic-led states where it has been met with public and legal resistance.

### Key Takeaways
  - The Trump administration directed Medicaid states to verify the immigration status of enrollees, resulting in over 170,000 names being sent to five states and Washington, D.C.
  - States like Colorado, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Utah reported receiving significant numbers of names — totaling over 170,000 — to be reviewed for eligibility.
  - The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) administrator Mehmet Oz claimed federal taxpayer dollars were being spent on Medicaid for undocumented immigrants, citing $1.5 million in Colorado and other state figures, though these claims were disputed by state officials.
  - States with Democratic leadership, including Colorado, California, Illinois, and Washington, D.C., responded with criticism, stating the figures were overstated or based on preliminary data.
  - The policy is seen by health advocates as duplicative, burdensome, and politically motivated, potentially causing eligible individuals to lose coverage due to missed paperwork deadlines.
  - CMS states that the verification process was initiated under federal law permitting states to verify eligibility where immigration status cannot be confirmed via databases, but the process may include individuals covered under Emergency Medicaid, which is available regardless of immigration status.
  - The effort may be politically driven, as states with Democratic leadership are not aligned with Trump’s immigration policies, and the action could be interpreted as an anti-immigrant agenda.
  - States are already required to verify citizenship or immigration status for Medicaid applicants, but CMS’s directive adds a new, broader verification process, increasing administrative workload and risk of disenrollment.
  - A federal judge previously blocked the sharing of Medicaid data with DHS in June, indicating legal challenges to the administration’s immigration enforcement actions.
  - Health policy experts and advocates argue that the policy lacks evidence of significant misuse of funds and is more politically symbolic than substantively effective.

### Summary

The article highlights how the United States is facing a growing elder care crisis driven by longer lifespans and declining birth rates, leading to fewer family members to care for aging relatives. It features the personal story of Maurice White and Renee DeVigne, who have cared for their mother Evelyn White (now 104) and other family elders for decades, illustrating both the emotional depth and practical challenges of multigenerational caregiving. The article underscores systemic issues, including a severe shortage of professional caregivers, rising costs of care (with home health aides costing over $68,000 annually), and the impact of immigration policies that have reduced the availability of skilled long-term care workers. Cultural factors, such as stronger family ties in Black and Hispanic communities, are presented as both a strength and a challenge, especially as aging populations grow. Experts like Ai-jen Poo and Beverly Morgan warn that the current system is unsustainable and call for a cultural and policy shift toward shared societal responsibility in elder care — including better wages for caregivers, affordable access to care, and a reimagined care model that values human connection over individual burden.

- <small>tags: `sleep, teenagers, circadian rhythm, daylight saving time, school start times, public health, sleep deprivation, parenting, adolescent biology`</small>

### Summary

The return to standard time in November 2025 provides a unique opportunity for teens to adjust their sleep schedules by increasing morning light exposure, which can help reset their circadian clocks. Experts including Dr. Stephanie Crowley, Dr. Sanjay Patel, and Mary Carskadon explain that teens naturally experience delayed sleep onset due to biological changes in their circadian and homeostatic sleep systems. With three out of four high school students not getting enough sleep, and school schedules, extracurriculars, and homework further exacerbating the problem, researchers advocate for systemic changes such as later school start times, reduced homework, and eliminating daylight saving time. Parents are encouraged to maintain consistent wake-up times, avoid late-night screen use, and model healthy sleep behaviors to support their teens’ sleep health.

### Key Takeaways
  - Three out of four high school students do not get enough sleep according to CDC data.
  - Teens experience delayed sleep onset and reduced sleep drive due to biological changes in the circadian and homeostatic sleep systems.

## Shopping for ACA health plans this open enrollment? Here's what to know - <small>`npr`</small>

- [source](https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5591404)
- _Published: 2025-10-31 05:00:00-04:00_
- **Health & Public Safety**
- <small>tags: `ACA, health insurance, premium tax credits, open enrollment, healthcare policy, government shutdown, KFF, premium increases, catastrophic plans, bronze plans, Congress, subsidy expiration, marketplace enrollment`</small>

### Summary

This article provides a comprehensive guide for individuals shopping for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces during the 2025 open enrollment period. It emphasizes that the enhanced premium tax credits, which have kept health plan premiums affordable for over 92% of enrollees, will expire at the end of 2025 unless Congress extends them. Without such an extension, average premiums are projected to more than double, with a 26% increase by 2026, potentially placing a financial strain on millions. The article advises consumers to stay informed about congressional developments, update their personal information (especially income and household size), avoid automatic re-enrollment, and carefully evaluate plan prices—especially focusing on the 'sticker price' without subsidies. It recommends bronze plans as a more affordable alternative to catastrophic plans, which have high deductibles. Key dates such as enrollment deadlines (Dec. 15 and Jan. 15) and the end of the subsidy window (Dec. 31, 2025) are highlighted. The political uncertainty surrounding subsidy renewal is tied to a broader congressional dispute that intensified during the 2025 government shutdown, making timely and informed decision-making critical for consumers.

### Key Takeaways
  - The enhanced premium tax credits under the Affordable Care Act, which have been in place since 2021 and were extended in 2022, will expire at the end of 2025 unless Congress acts, creating significant financial uncertainty for over 24 million ACA marketplace enrollees.
  - If the enhanced tax credits do not continue, average out-of-pocket premiums for subsidized enrollees are projected to more than double, with a 26% average increase by 2026, according to KFF.
  - A family of four earning $75,000 in 2025 would face a projected annual premium of $5,865 for a silver plan in 2026 — more than double the $2,498 they would pay under current subsidies.
  - Consumers are advised to update their income and household size information on marketplace accounts, particularly to avoid over-receiving subsidies in 2025 due to a change in HR 1 (the One Big Beautiful Bill Act) that removes caps on repayment for overestimated income.
  - Automatic re-enrollment is strongly discouraged due to the uncertainty of future subsidies, especially for individuals whose income exceeds 400% of the federal poverty level (about $63,000 in 2025).
  - When shopping, consumers should focus on the 'sticker price' of plans, and if the price is not affordable without enhanced tax credits, consider a lower-premium plan such as a bronze or catastrophic plan, though catastrophic plans have high deductibles ($10,600 for individuals, $21,200 for families in 2026).
  - Bronze plans are required to cover preventive care at no cost and may cover some doctor visits before the deductible, and are generally recommended over being uninsured.
  - Marketplaces may not send consumers notices of net premiums, especially in the 28 federally facilitated marketplaces, so consumers must monitor legislative developments and check their accounts frequently.
  - Consumers should delay payment of premiums until after they have reviewed their options and are confident in their decision, and may be eligible for adjustments if a last-minute congressional deal occurs.
  - The political debate over extending the enhanced tax credits is central to ongoing conflicts between Republicans and Democrats in Congress, and is tied to the government shutdown that began in late 2025.

## Could COVID-19 mRNA vaccines also fight cancer? - <small>`aljazeera`</small>

- [source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/27/could-covid-19-mrna-vaccines-help-fight-cancer)

- **Health & Public Safety**
- <small>tags: `mRNA vaccine, cancer treatment, immunotherapy, immune system, vaccine breakthrough, pandemic research, oncology, public health, scientific discovery, clinical trials`</small>

### Summary

New studies reveal that mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, developed during the pandemic, may significantly improve survival rates in cancer patients by activating the immune system to detect and attack tumors—especially in 'cold' tumors that were previously resistant. The findings, based on analysis of over 1,000 patients receiving immunotherapy between 2019 and 2023, show that vaccinated patients lived up to 37.3 months (nearly double) compared to 20.6 months for unvaccinated patients with advanced lung cancer. In metastatic melanoma, vaccinated patients had median survival exceeding three years, compared to just over two years for unvaccinated patients. The mechanism appears to involve activation of dendritic cells, which then recruit T cells to target tumors. While mRNA vaccines do not generate new tumor-fighting T cells, they may enhance immune surveillance. These results are still preliminary and are being validated in a Phase 3 clinical trial. If confirmed, this could lead to the development of a universal, off-the-shelf cancer vaccine, fundamentally altering oncologic care.

### Key Takeaways
  - mRNA COVID-19 vaccines may enhance immune system activity against cancer, particularly in patients with 'cold' tumors that were previously difficult to treat.
  - Patients who received mRNA vaccines before starting immunotherapy lived significantly longer, with survival rates nearly doubling in advanced lung cancer cases.
  - The effect was consistent across different vaccine manufacturers, doses, and timeframes, indicating robustness of findings.
  - mRNA vaccines appear to 'wake up' the immune system by activating dendritic cells, leading to better tumor recognition and T-cell recruitment.
  - Combining mRNA vaccines with immune checkpoint inhibitors (like PD-1 inhibitors) creates a synergistic effect: immune system is alert and cancer’s protective shield (PD-L1) is disabled.
  - While the vaccines do not generate new tumor-fighting T cells, they may improve the immune system’s ability to detect tumors and deploy existing T cells.
  - Findings are still preliminary and under validation through ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials.
  - Researchers suggest the possibility of a universal, off-the-shelf cancer vaccine based on mRNA technology.
  - The discovery emerged from the pandemic-era rollout of mRNA vaccines, which provided an unexpected opportunity for cancer research.

### Summary

Robert F. Kennedy Jr., U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary, has partially walked back his earlier claim that Tylenol use during pregnancy causes autism, stating that while there is a 'very suggestive' association, it is not sufficient to conclude causation. This shift comes amid growing scientific and public health consensus that no consistent link exists between Tylenol and autism, as affirmed by the World Health Organization and major medical bodies. The controversy was reignited when Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed a lawsuit against Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue, alleging deceptive marketing of Tylenol as the only safe painkiller for pregnant women—a claim he ties to misinformation spread by both Donald Trump and Kennedy. Despite Kennedy’s previous statements and mischaracterizations of medical studies, experts stress that Tylenol remains a safe option for pregnant women when used under medical supervision, and that untreated fever or pain can pose greater risks than the medication itself.

### Key Takeaways
  - Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has partially retracted his claim that Tylenol causes autism in children, acknowledging that the link is 'very suggestive' but not 'definitive'.
  - The World Health Organization and other health agencies have consistently stated there is no consistent association between Tylenol and autism, despite extensive research.
  - Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has filed a lawsuit against Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue, alleging deceptive marketing of Tylenol as the only safe painkiller for pregnant women, citing claims by Trump and Kennedy.
  - Both Donald Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have made scientifically unsubstantiated claims linking Tylenol to autism, contributing to public misinformation.
  - Kennedy previously claimed that male circumcision increases autism risk due to Tylenol use, a mischaracterization of studies.
  - Kenvue and medical experts emphasize that acetaminophen (Tylenol) is the safest pain reliever for pregnant women and that unaddressed pain and fever can pose greater risks to pregnancy.
  - The public health community and major health organizations continue to advise pregnant women to consult physicians before taking pain relievers.

### Summary

Pakistan launched a national HPV vaccination campaign in September 2025, aiming to vaccinate over 13 million girls aged 9 to 14 to combat cervical cancer, which kills eight women daily in the country. Despite being supported by the WHO and GAVI, the campaign faced significant public resistance due to misinformation, including conspiracy theories about infertility and foreign espionage tied to the 2011 CIA operation in Abbottabad. The vaccine, Cecolin, is a single-dose, safe, and non-infectious vaccine made from recombinant proteins. Initial uptake was low—only 78% of the target group vaccinated—leading to a four-day extension of the campaign. High-profile actions, such as the federal health minister vaccinating his daughter, helped increase public trust. The campaign is set to expand to other provinces by 2026 and 2027, with future plans to include boys and men. Experts emphasize that the vaccine is safe, effective, and essential for preventing cervical cancer, especially in a context where sexual violence and early exposure to HPV are real risks.

### Key Takeaways
  - Pakistan launched its first national HPV vaccination campaign in September 2025, targeting 13 million girls aged 9 to 14, with the goal of preventing cervical cancer, which kills eight women daily in the country.
  - The campaign faced significant public backlash due to conspiracy theories, including claims that the vaccine causes infertility or is tied to foreign espionage, especially following the CIA’s 2011 Abbottabad operation using a fake hepatitis B campaign.
  - The vaccine used is Cecolin, a single-dose HPV vaccine developed in China, containing recombinant L1 capsid proteins that mimic the virus structure without carrying viral DNA or causing infection.
  - Despite initial resistance and low uptake—only 78% of the target group vaccinated—officials report the campaign as a success due to increased public engagement after high-profile actions like the federal health minister’s daughter being vaccinated.
  - The campaign is being phased out to other provinces: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2026, Balochistan and Gilgit-Baltistan in 2027, with future plans to vaccinate boys and men to provide comprehensive protection.
  - Vaccine hesitancy is rooted in cultural norms, misinformation, and historical distrust of vaccines, including false narratives from the CIA’s Abbottabad operation and online conspiracy theories claiming the vaccine causes infertility or leads to sexual activity in children.
  - Experts emphasize that the vaccine is safe, effective, and preventive, with side effects being mild and temporary, and that HPV infection often remains asymptomatic for years, increasing the risk of cervical cancer.

- <small>tags: `dental hygiene, gum disease, tooth enamel, fluoride, myths busted, oral health, BBC What's Up Docs, University of Birmingham, interdental brushes, mindful brushing`</small>

### Summary

The article challenges common dental hygiene beliefs, such as brushing twice a day, by emphasizing that quality and proper technique are more important than frequency. Experts, including Dr Praveen Sharma of the University of Birmingham and BBC's Dr Xand and Dr Chris van Tulleken, advise that brushing once a day—especially at night—can be effective if done thoroughly, including flossing or using interdental brushes. They warn against brushing immediately after acidic meals, recommending a 30-minute wait or rinsing with water first to protect tooth enamel. The article also clarifies that fluoride is the key ingredient in toothpaste, and that brand or price do not matter as long as fluoride is present. Finally, it promotes mindful brushing, encouraging users to focus on the sensation of bristles rather than distractions like phone use.

### Key Takeaways
  - Brushing teeth twice a day is not always optimal; quality and technique matter more than frequency.
  - The key factor in preventing gum disease is brushing with proper technique, especially at the gum-to-tooth junction.

### Summary

A major jewellery heist at the Louvre museum in Paris, France, occurred on 19 October 2025, when four individuals, all from the impoverished Seine-Saint-Denis region, carried out a daylight theft using a stolen mechanical lift and disc cutter to breach display cases in the Galerie d'Apollon.

- <small>tags: `health, weight-loss, drug safety, TikTok, youth health, sibutramine, Russia, online safety, eating disorders, public health crisis, illegal drugs, social media influence`</small>

### Summary

A weight-loss pill called Molecule, containing the banned substance sibutramine, has gone viral on Russian TikTok, where teenagers share videos of their supposed 'weight-loss journeys'. Despite being illegal and banned in many countries due to serious health risks like heart attacks, strokes, and severe psychological effects—including anxiety, hallucinations, and appetite loss—Molecule is still widely sold online at low cost. Multiple cases of hospitalizations among minors, including school-aged children, have emerged, with at least three requiring medical care. The drug is marketed as containing natural ingredients, but testing revealed it contains sibutramine, a substance with known dangers. Sellers use deceptive branding and rebranding (e.g., as 'Atom') and falsely claim production in Germany or China. Authorities have struggled to regulate the drug due to its online disguise and evasion tactics. Experts warn that self-medication, especially among youth with eating disorders, is extremely dangerous. Influencers and medical professionals are now raising public awareness, urging caution. Though some platforms have removed listings, the drug remains prevalent due to social media promotion and low cost.

### Key Takeaways
  - Molecule, a weight-loss pill containing sibutramine, became viral on Russian TikTok, with teenagers sharing their 'weight-loss journeys' and promoting the drug online.

### Summary

As the open enrollment period for the Affordable Care Act marketplace begins, Americans face potentially catastrophic increases in healthcare costs due to the expiration of tax credits, with average premiums rising by 114% and some individuals, like Stacy Cox from Utah, facing a 338% increase. Without subsidies, millions—including those with chronic conditions—risk losing health coverage, with experts estimating between four and five million could fall into coverage gaps. Political parties are divided: Democrats are urging subsidy extensions to end the government shutdown, while Republicans argue for a delayed resolution. Some conservative lawmakers, like Marjorie Taylor Greene, support the subsidies, while others oppose them. Meanwhile, the government shutdown also threatens food aid through SNAP, prompting courts to require emergency funding and prompting Trump to demand legal clarification on how to legally fund the program.

### Key Takeaways
  - Without subsidies, health insurance premiums are expected to rise by 114% on average, potentially adding $1,000 annually to household costs.
  - About 24 million people currently buy health insurance through the ACA marketplace, many of whom rely on tax credits to afford coverage.

  - Stacy Cox and her husband, small business owners in Utah, face a 338% increase in premiums, from $495 to $2,168 monthly, leading them to consider emergency insurance that does not cover routine care.
  - Experts estimate between four and five million people may lose healthcare coverage entirely due to inability to afford insurance without subsidies.
  - Democrats are pushing to extend subsidies in exchange for ending the government shutdown, while Republicans argue the issue should be addressed after the shutdown ends.
  - Some conservative lawmakers, including Marjorie Taylor Greene, support maintaining tax credits despite opposing Obamacare.
  - The government shutdown has also led to uncertainty over the funding of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), with courts ruling that the Trump administration must use emergency funds to cover benefits.

### Summary

The U.S., under President Donald Trump, has conducted 14 such strikes since September 2025, killing at least 61 people, with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announcing the latest. The UN argues that lethal force is only justifiable as a last resort in cases of imminent threat, and such actions occur outside active hostilities. This has sparked regional alarm, particularly concerning potential U.S. intervention in Venezuela under President Nicolás Maduro, who faces drug-related charges in the U.S.

## Turkish court sentences hotel owner and 10 others to life for deadly fire that killed 78 - <small>`cnn`</small>

### Summary

A Turkish court sentenced hotel owner Halit Ergul and 10 others—including his wife, daughters, hotel managers, a deputy mayor, and a deputy fire chief—to life in prison for severe negligence leading to a deadly fire at the Grand Kartal Hotel in Kartalkaya ski resort, Bolu, on January 21, 2025. The fire, which killed 78 people (including 34 children) and injured 133 others, began when a spark from an electric grill ignited a garbage bin, rupturing a liquefied petroleum gas hose. Critical safety failures—such as missing smoke extraction, alarms, sprinklers, emergency lighting, and poor evacuation planning—allowed the fire to spread rapidly. Stairwells and elevator shafts acted as chimneys, worsening the fire’s spread. The defendants were convicted of negligence with 'probable intent to kill' and received additional 25-year sentences for the 44 other fatalities. The verdict, which followed public outcry and demonstrations by victims' families, underscores systemic failures in hotel safety standards and raises urgent questions about accountability in tourism infrastructure.

### Summary

A recent report by the United Nations Human Rights Office has highlighted concerns over the treatment of migrants and asylum seekers in several countries, especially in the context of rising border controls and stricter immigration policies. The report emphasizes the need for stronger international cooperation to protect vulnerable populations and ensure adherence to international human rights standards. It calls for greater transparency and accountability in immigration enforcement, and urges states to uphold the principle of non-refoulement, which prohibits returning individuals to countries where they might face harm.

## They were promised a lifeline to 'graduate' from poverty. Then it was taken away - <small>`npr`</small>

### Summary

In February 2025, the U.S. government terminated the Graduating to Resilience Scale Activity (GRSA) program, which had provided $205 cash and business coaching to 8,100 South Sudanese refugees and 3,500 Ugandans in Palabek camp to escape extreme poverty. The program, funded with a $15 million grant from the U.S. government to AVSI Foundation, was intended to help participants become self-sufficient, with past studies showing increased income after 24 months. The abrupt cancellation, part of a broader foreign aid overhaul under the Trump administration, devastated participants who saw it as their only path to economic stability. Individuals like Akim Joseph Yanga and Santa Angwech describe a sudden collapse of hope, resulting in increased domestic violence, theft, and suicide attempts. Local leaders like Fivi Akullu and former coach Okot Bosco argue that such abrupt cuts harm both recipients and the long-term stability of host communities, while also undermining U.S. global influence through eroded trust and resilience.

### Key Takeaways
  - The U.S. government abruptly canceled a $15 million aid program in February 2025, removing critical financial and coaching support from 8,100 South Sudanese refugees and 3,500 Ugandans in Palabek camp.
  - The program, known as the Graduating to Resilience Scale Activity (GRSA), offered $205 per participant plus business coaching to help people escape extreme poverty, where average incomes are below $753 annually.
  - The cancellation led to widespread emotional distress, including increased domestic violence, theft, and suicide attempts among refugees and local residents.
  - Participants viewed the program as a lifeline — especially single mothers and displaced individuals with no prior income or business training.
  - Local leaders and former coaches, like Okot Bosco, argue that U.S. aid benefits America through strengthened global stability and trust, even if the benefits are not immediately visible.

### Summary

Despite a US-brokered ceasefire, Palestinians in Gaza continue to face severe suffering from hunger, cold, and ongoing military attacks, with over 500 bodies retrieved from rubble since the truce began. Israeli drone strikes, including one in northern Gaza’s Shujayea neighborhood, have killed civilians, and Israel claims these were in response to individuals crossing ceasefire lines—without evidence.

### Summary

Hurricane Melissa, the strongest storm to hit Jamaica in modern history, struck western Jamaica with category five force, resulting in at least 28 deaths, widespread destruction, and severe shortages of food, water, power, and communication. Coastal communities such as Westmoreland and St Elizabeth face total devastation, with roads blocked by debris and residents isolated and desperate. The Jamaican government, led by Prime Minister Andrew Holness and Transportation Minister Daryl Vaz, has responded by deploying over 200 StarLink devices to restore internet access and prioritizing debris clearance and essential services. Despite these efforts, delays in aid delivery and logistical challenges have left many, including residents in Whitehouse and fishing communities like Morris’s village, without food or shelter. Resilience and faith are central themes among survivors, who remain hopeful despite overwhelming loss. International assistance from the US and UK is now entering the country, marking a critical step toward recovery.

- <small>tags: `school shooting, teacher safety, child neglect, school gun policy, PTSD, civil trial, criminal trial, school safety, student violence, teacher testimony`</small>

### Summary

Abby Zwerner, a teacher at Richneck Elementary School in Newport News, was shot in the hand and chest by a 6-year-old student on January 6, 2023, while reading with her class. The incident occurred despite multiple warnings about the student’s possession of a gun. Zwerner has filed a $40 million civil lawsuit against former assistant principal Ebony Parker, claiming Parker failed to act on known threats. Parker also faces eight felony counts of child neglect in a criminal trial. The case highlights the broader national issue of school safety and accountability. Zwerner suffers severe physical and psychological trauma, including permanent hand injury and diagnosed PTSD, leading to social withdrawal and fear of public spaces. The defense has attempted to discredit her claims by citing her attendance at events and school activities, but Zwerner maintains that her injuries and emotional condition remain severe. Experts note that the civil trial may serve as a precursor to the criminal proceedings, with the latter focusing more directly on Parker’s knowledge of the threat and her duty to protect students.

### Summary

Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam al-Muslimin (JNIM), a jihadist group affiliated with al Qaeda, is advancing toward Bamako, the capital of Mali, using fuel blockades, road ambushes, and attacks on military convoys. The group has seized weapons from government forces and is employing drones and coordinated attacks across hundreds of kilometers, demonstrating increased operational sophistication. Fuel shortages have severely impacted daily life in Bamako, with long lines at gas stations and schools closed. Despite increased military patrols and helicopter strikes by the Malian junta and Russian mercenaries, including Wagner Group and the Africa Corps, JNIM continues to gain ground. The Russian presence has alienated local populations, with reports of summary executions of ethnic Fulani men. The crisis is spreading regionally, with JNIM claiming attacks in Burkina Faso, Niger, and even northern Nigeria. Analysts warn that Mali could become the first country in over four decades to be ruled by an al Qaeda-affiliated regime, with Burkina Faso at highest risk of contagion. The situation is undermining regional stability and exposing the fragility of Sahel governance.

### Key Takeaways

### Summary

The US military, under the Trump administration, launched a campaign of 15 lethal strikes in the Caribbean and Pacific between September 2 and November 1, 2025, killing 64 people and destroying 16 boats. These strikes targeted vessels allegedly operated by designated terrorist groups such as Tren de Aragua and Colombian-based cartels, with the administration claiming the actions constitute an 'armed conflict' against drug traffickers who are labeled as 'unlawful combatants.' Despite no public evidence of narcotics or direct affiliations, the campaign expanded geographically and included a survivor repatriation process that raised serious concerns about due process and civilian harm. The actions triggered strong diplomatic reactions from Venezuela and Colombia, with both nations condemning the strikes as extrajudicial and potentially illegal. The lack of transparency, the absence of verified evidence, and the classification of traffickers as terrorists without legal prosecution have drawn criticism from human rights groups and members of Congress, raising broader questions about the legality, proportionality, and international implications of such military operations.

### Summary

The US military conducted a lethal strike in the Caribbean Sea on November 2, 2025, killing three men allegedly involved in drug trafficking. This marks the 15th such strike since early September, with a total of 64 deaths across the Caribbean and Pacific. The operation, directed by President Trump and executed under the authority of Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, targets vessels operated by so-called Designated Terrorist Organizations (DTOs), which are framed as posing an imminent threat to American citizens.

## Fighting intensifies around key town in Ukraine amid fresh attacks on Russian energy - <small>`cnn`</small>

- <small>tags: `Ukraine-Russia War, Pokrovsk Conflict, Energy Sabotage, Military Operations, Strategic Cities, Counter-Offensives, Geopolitical Tensions, Energy Infrastructure, Ceasefire Efforts`</small>

### Summary

Fighting is intensifying around Pokrovsk, a key transportation hub in eastern Ukraine, as Russian forces advance and attempt to encircle Ukrainian positions, while Ukrainian special forces conduct successful landings and counterattacks. The Russian Defense Ministry claims to have eliminated a Ukrainian special forces unit, but Ukrainian intelligence and military units dispute this, asserting that Ukrainian forces have maintained and improved their positions and killed 85 Russian troops in the past week. The fall of Pokrovsk would be the largest urban loss since Bakhmut in May 2023 and would bring Russian forces closer to Kramatorsk and Kostiantynivka. Simultaneously, Ukraine has launched a sustained campaign targeting Russian energy infrastructure, including the destruction of the Koltsevoy oil pipeline near Ramenskoye, which supplies fuel to Russian occupation forces. This sabotage, carried out by a sabotage team, has reportedly caused significant disruption to Russian refining capacity, with Ukraine claiming up to 20% of Russian refining capacity is out of action. Despite these efforts, Russia continues to assert control and maintain its strategic goals, including sovereignty over Donetsk. Meanwhile, international efforts to broker a ceasefire—such as those led by former President Donald Trump—have failed, with Russia insisting on addressing root causes like NATO expansion and the 'Nazification' of Ukraine.

### Key Takeaways
  - Fighting is intensifying around Pokrovsk, a strategic transportation hub in eastern Ukraine, with Russian forces advancing and attempting to encircle Ukrainian positions.
  - The Russian Defense Ministry claims to have eliminated a Ukrainian special forces unit in a helicopter landing near Pokrovsk, but Ukrainian intelligence and the 7th Aerial Assault Corps dispute this, stating that Ukrainian forces successfully landed and are improving their tactical positions.
  - Ukrainian forces report killing 85 Russian soldiers in Pokrovsk over the past week and maintaining logistics and supply routes, despite enemy attempts to infiltrate residential areas and cut off supply lines.
  - Pokrovsk is critical because its capture would be the largest urban loss since Bakhmut in May 2023, and it lies on key road and rail lines toward Kramatorsk and Kostiantynivka.
  - Ukrainian saboteurs blew up three fuel pipelines in the Moscow region, including the Koltsevoy oil pipeline, which supplies fuel to Russian occupation forces, in an operation involving sabotage teams using explosives.
  - The attack is part of a sustained Ukrainian campaign targeting Russian energy infrastructure, with Ukraine claiming that such strikes have caused more damage than economic sanctions.
  - Ukraine claims up to 20% of Russian refining capacity is down, leading to fuel shortages and increased reliance on Belarus for imports.
  - The U.S. President Donald Trump’s efforts to broker a ceasefire have failed, with Russia insisting that deeper political issues—like NATO expansion and perceived 'Nazification' of Ukraine—must be resolved before any truce.
  - Russia maintains that its original goals—especially sovereignty over Donetsk and other eastern regions—are non-negotiable and central to its 'Special Military Operation'.

## Pentagon shifts to Pacific strikes seeking stronger link between targets and US drug trafficking - <small>`cnn`</small>

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/pentagon-strikes-pacific-drug-trafficking)

- <small>tags: `U.S. military, drug trafficking, Pentagon strategy, Pacific Ocean, Caribbean Sea, fentanyl, cocaine, Nicolás Maduro, Venezuela, intelligence, legal justification, Congress oversight, military strikes, transparency, counter-narcotics, war powers`</small>

### Summary

The Pentagon has shifted its military strike operations from the Caribbean Sea to the eastern Pacific Ocean in response to intelligence indicating stronger links between drug trafficking from Colombia and Mexico and the U.S. market. While the administration claims the strikes target fentanyl and are part of a broader effort to combat illicit drug flows, there is no evidence that fentanyl is being actively intercepted, and officials cannot verify the success of the operations—lacking metrics on drug flow, price changes, or tactical adaptation. The strikes do not require positive identification of individuals on vessels, and the legal justification, including the Justice Department’s OLC memo, has been withheld from Congress, raising serious concerns about transparency, accountability, and the legality of the actions. Lawmakers, including both Democrats and Republicans, have demanded clarification, with critics accusing the administration of a 'partisan stunt' that undermines congressional oversight and military accountability.

### Key Takeaways
  - The Pentagon has shifted military strikes from the Caribbean Sea to the eastern Pacific Ocean to target suspected drug traffickers with stronger evidence linking them to U.S. cocaine markets.
  - Intelligence suggests that Colombia and Mexico are more significant sources of cocaine for the U.S. than Venezuela, challenging claims linking Venezuela to major drug trafficking.
  - The Trump administration has claimed the strikes target fentanyl, citing a narrative that every boat carries 'bags of white powder' and that each strike prevents 25,000 deaths—however, data shows fentanyl killed more Americans than cocaine in 2023, and there is no evidence that these operations are addressing fentanyl.
  - The military does not positively identify individuals on vessels before launching strikes, citing legal constraints around evidentiary burden and court proceedings.
  - There is no established metric to measure the success of the strikes—no data on drug flow, price changes, or tactical adaptation to traffickers' new methods.
  - Congress has been denied access to critical legal documents, including the Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) memo justifying the strikes, raising concerns about transparency and legality.
  - Military lawyers have been absent from congressional briefings, undermining the discussion of legal authority and accountability.

The assassination of Carlos Manzo, an outspoken anti-crime mayor in Uruapan, Michoacán, Mexico, during a Day of the Dead festival, has ignited a national outcry and prompted President Claudia Sheinbaum to pledge full justice and zero impunity. Manzo, elected in September 2024, had repeatedly called for stronger federal security and criticized the government’s failure to protect him, despite receiving federal protection since late 2024. Two suspects were arrested, and one was dead, following the attack. Security Minister Omar Harfuch blamed the vulnerability of the event and affirmed the government’s commitment to prevent future killings. The incident reflects broader patterns of violence against independent politicians and journalists in Mexico, particularly in economically sensitive regions like Michoacán, where the avocado industry is a target for organized crime.

## Justice Department Tells Congress Trump Doesn’t Need Its Approval for Military Strikes on Alleged Drug Boats - <small>`cnn`</small>

### Summary

The U.S. Justice Department, led by OLC head T. Elliot Gaiser, has told Congress that the Trump administration can conduct lethal military strikes on alleged drug-smuggling vessels in the Caribbean and Pacific Ocean without needing congressional approval or a declaration of war. This position rests on the legal argument that drug cartels are equivalent to terrorists and that the strikes, which have killed at least 64 people since September 2025, do not constitute 'hostilities' under the 1973 War Powers Resolution. President Trump’s executive order designating certain drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations gives the military broader authority to target them, including potential operations inside Venezuela. Critics, including legal experts and lawmakers, have raised concerns about violations of U.S. and international law and a lack of transparency in the legal justification. The administration claims the 60-day War Powers clock does not apply, and the military actions are not retaliatory. The article highlights a significant shift in executive power, blurring the line between law enforcement and military action in drug interdiction.

### Key Takeaways
  - The Justice Department, under T. Elliot Gaiser, has advised Congress that the Trump administration can conduct lethal military strikes on alleged drug boats without needing congressional approval or a declaration of war.
  - The Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) opinion equates drug cartels with terrorists, arguing that drug trafficking causes deaths in the U.S. and thus constitutes hostilities under international law, thereby bypassing the War Powers Resolution.
  - At least 15 military strikes have been conducted since September 2025, killing 64 people, with the most recent occurring in the Caribbean on a Saturday.
  - The military strikes are not being conducted in response to attacks on the U.S., which supports the argument that they do not constitute a state of war.
  - Legal experts and lawmakers, including Democrats and one Republican, have raised concerns about potential violations of U.S. and international law and the lack of transparency in the administration's legal justification.
  - President Donald Trump issued an executive order at the start of his second term designating certain drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, expanding military authority to target them.
  - The strikes may extend to targeting cocaine facilities and drug trafficking routes inside Venezuela, under pressure on Nicolás Maduro's regime.

### Summary

Secretary Pete Hegseth has implemented a policy requiring Defense Department personnel to seek prior approval from the Office of Legislative Affairs before discussing sensitive topics—including military strikes on suspected drug boats in Latin America, budget plans, critical minerals, AUKUS, Havana Syndrome, and electromagnetic spectrum operations—with Congress. The Pentagon frames this as an internal process to improve accuracy and transparency, but critics, including Republican Rep. Don Bacon and Senate Armed Services Committee leaders Sen. Roger Wicker and Sen. Jack Reed, argue it creates a barrier between military leaders and lawmakers, undermines communication, and reflects a broader pattern of information control. Congress has expressed frustration over unanswered inquiries about military operations in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific, highlighting a growing tension between the Pentagon and legislative oversight.

  - Congress, particularly Senate Armed Services Committee leaders Sen. Roger Wicker and Sen. Jack Reed, has expressed frustration over lack of answers about military operations in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific, with letters to Hegseth going unanswered.

## Evanston Mayor Opens Investigations After Federal Agents Are Filmed Punching Man During Arrest - <small>`cnn`</small>

### Summary

In Evanston, Illinois, on November 1, 2025, federal agents were filmed punching a man during an immigration enforcement operation, prompting outrage from local officials and residents. Mayor Daniel Biss opened two investigations—into the alleged physical violence against bystanders and a claimed deliberate car crash—disputing the Department of Homeland Security’s narrative that the agents were responding to a hostile crowd. The DHS claimed the agents were reacting to a red vehicle crashing into their vehicle and verbal abuse, but the mayor alleged the crash was intentional and that the agents then assaulted an innocent man, who was not taken to medical care. Videos captured by Andrew Wymer showed agents pinning and repeatedly striking the man, dragging him away without medical assistance. The incident sparked strong condemnation from local leaders, including Governor J.B. Pritzker and U.S. Representative Jan Schakowsky, who criticized the inhumane tactics. Biss called on federal officials, including Gregory Bovino and Kristi Noem, to leave the city, arguing that the operation targeted dissent rather than enforcing immigration laws. The city now has the badge numbers of the agents involved, enabling potential accountability through state and federal legal channels.

## Native American Leaders Warn That Government Shutdown and Layoffs Are Making Crisis Worse for Tribal Communities - <small>`cnn`</small>

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/politics/shutdown-native-communities)
- _Published: 2025-11-02 12:11:00-05:00_
- **Politics & Governance**
- <small>tags: `government shutdown, Native American communities, reductions in force (RIFs), treaty obligations, SNAP benefits, food insecurity, education disruption, Alaska, typhoon Halong, federal transparency, tribal sovereignty`</small>

### Summary

Native American leaders, including Kerry Bird of the National Indian Education Association, Senator Lisa Murkowski, and Sarah Harris of the Mohegan Tribe, have raised urgent concerns that mass federal layoffs and benefit delays during a government shutdown are severely harming Native communities. They argue that the U.S. government has a binding treaty obligation to support tribal nations in areas such as education, health, food security, and housing, and that the shutdown—particularly through reductions in force (RIFs) in agencies like the Bureau of Indian Education, BIA, and Indian Health Service—is violating these commitments. The lack of transparency and the timing of the crisis, especially in Alaska with typhoon damage and winter food shortages, have intensified the crisis. While federal judges have ordered emergency SNAP funding to continue, the broader impact—especially on vulnerable populations like children in early education and elders in food-insecure villages—remains dire. Senator Catherine Cortez Masto and Brian Schatz emphasize that Native programs are not discretionary spending but legal and trust-based duties that must be upheld, regardless of political or fiscal shutdowns.

### Key Takeaways
  - Mass layoffs (reductions in force or RIFs) in federal agencies are disrupting essential services like education, health, food security, and early childhood programs in Native communities.
  - Native American leaders argue that the federal government has a legal and treaty obligation to support tribal nations, and that shutdowns and layoffs violate those commitments.
  - The lack of transparency and uncertainty during the shutdown has made it difficult for tribal leaders to plan for long-term needs, especially in areas like food security and education.
  - Even non-tribal-specific programs like SNAP, LIHEAP, and Head Start are disproportionately affecting Native populations due to their reliance on these services.
  - The impact is especially severe in Alaska, where typhoon damage, winter food shortages, and power outages have compounded the crisis.
  - Federal judges ruled that emergency funds must be used to maintain SNAP benefits, but this does not fully resolve the broader crisis of trust and program discontinuity.

## Trade deals and $90 billion in tariff revenue: What’s riding on the landmark Supreme Court case kicking off this week - <small>`cnn`</small>

- <small>tags: `Supreme Court, tariffs, International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), trade policy, President Donald Trump, economic policy, China, India, Brazil, Section 232 tariffs, trade agreements, tariff revenue, refunds, national security, customs and trade`</small>

### Summary

The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments over whether President Donald Trump had the legal authority to impose high tariffs on trading partners — including India, Brazil, and China — using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). As of September 2025, U.S. businesses have collectively paid nearly $90 billion in IEEPA-related tariffs, which could be subject to refunds if the court rules against Trump. The tariffs were used as a key tool to pressure foreign nations into signing trade agreements, and their invalidation could prompt renegotiations and retaliatory measures. While Trump retains authority over other tariffs via Section 232, the IEEPA mechanism — which allowed unilateral, rapid tariff imposition — is at risk, potentially reshaping U.S. trade policy and economic strategy.

### Key Takeaways
  - The Supreme Court will determine whether President Donald Trump had legal authority to impose tariffs using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).
  - As of September 23, businesses had paid nearly $90 billion in IEEPA tariffs, representing more than half of the total tariff revenue collected during the 2025 fiscal year.
  - If the Supreme Court rules against Trump, companies may be eligible for refunds, though the process would be complex and not all businesses would necessarily qualify.
  - The IEEPA tariffs have been a key leverage tool used by Trump to pressure trading partners into signing trade agreements, which could be undermined if the tariffs are deemed illegal.
  - Trump’s tariff agenda includes both IEEPA tariffs and Section 232 tariffs; while Section 232 tariffs are legally distinct and would remain enforceable, the IEEPA mechanism — which allows unilateral, rapid tariff imposition — is at risk.
  - The outcome of the case could trigger renegotiation of trade agreements and prompt retaliatory tariffs from trading partners, especially if the U.S. is no longer able to impose high tariffs unilaterally.

### Named Entities
- **Supreme Court**
    - The highest judicial body in the United States, currently hearing arguments about the legality of Trump’s tariff policies under IEEPA.
    - The Supreme Court’s decision will determine whether President Trump’s use of the IEEPA to impose tariffs is legally valid, making it central to the article’s central issue.
- **President Donald Trump**
    - The U.S. President who initiated the use of IEEPA tariffs and has framed the case as one of the most important in the country’s history.

- **International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA)**
    - A U.S. law that grants the President authority to impose tariffs during declared emergencies, which Trump invoked to impose high tariffs on countries like China, India, and Brazil.
    - The legality of Trump’s use of IEEPA to impose tariffs is the central legal issue in the Supreme Court case, making it the core of the article’s analysis.
- **India**
    - A major trading partner that faced tariffs as high as 50% under Trump’s IEEPA policies.
    - India is cited as a key trading partner whose import tax rates were raised under IEEPA tariffs, illustrating the global reach and impact of Trump’s trade strategy.
- **Brazil**

    - Brazil is cited as a key trading partner whose import tax rates were raised under IEEPA tariffs, illustrating the global reach and impact of Trump’s trade strategy.

- **Section 232 tariffs**

    - While not directly challenged in this case, Section 232 tariffs are mentioned as a parallel tool in Trump’s tariff strategy that remains unaffected by the Supreme Court’s decision on IEEPA.
- **US Customs and Border Patrol**
    - A federal agency that collects data on tariff payments.
    - US Customs and Border Patrol provided data showing that nearly $90 billion in tariffs were paid by businesses as of September 23, 2025.

  - **From _2025-01-01_ to _2025-09-30_**

### Summary

Prince Andrew, once a prominent royal figure, is being exiled to the historic Sandringham estate following weeks of public outrage over allegations that he had sexual relationships with Virginia Giuffre while being trafficked by convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. As a result, he has lost his royal titles, honors, and military rank, and is required to surrender his 75-year lease at Royal Lodge. The move is being orchestrated by King Charles III, who is taking steps to protect the monarchy’s reputation.

Several properties on the estate—including York Cottage, Gardens House, and The Folly—are considered possible living options. The relocation will be privately financed by Charles, with no public cost involved. Sarah Ferguson is also relocating but will not join Andrew. The two corgis, Muick and Sandy, from Queen Elizabeth II’s time, will remain with the family, though their final destination is not specified.

As Mamdani is poised to become the city’s first Muslim mayor and youngest in a century, Duwaji would become the first member of Gen Z to serve as New York City’s first lady. Her artistic background, Syrian heritage, and advocacy for Middle Eastern women and Palestinian rights give her a distinct voice that aligns with her husband’s political messaging.

### Summary

The article explores the deep division within the Jewish community in New York City over the mayoral election, centered on Zohran Mamdani’s pro-Palestinian and critical stance toward Israel. While Mamdani won the Democratic primary, his positions—such as refusing to condemn Hamas, calling Israel’s actions a 'genocide,' and pledging to arrest Netanyahu—have provoked strong backlash from conservative Jewish leaders and institutions, including over 1,100 rabbis. Despite endorsements from prominent Jewish Democrats like Brad Lander and Jerry Nadler, many Jewish voters, especially older ones, view his views as a threat to Jewish security and identity. Younger, progressive Jews, however, see his policies on affordability and social justice as more important. Polling shows a majority of Jewish likely voters still support Andrew Cuomo over Mamdani, highlighting a generational and ideological split. The article underscores how the election reflects broader tensions within American Jewry about identity, politics, and the role of Israel in American democracy.

### Summary

Elections across multiple states on Tuesday, November 2, 2025, are critical for assessing public sentiment toward Donald Trump’s second presidency and the Democratic Party’s ability to rebuild after a period of political setbacks.

In Virginia, the gubernatorial race pits Abigail Spanberger against Winsome Earle-Sears, with Democrats emphasizing the national backlash against Trump’s policies and shutdowns. California’s Proposition 50 vote determines whether a Democratic redistricting plan will be adopted, potentially altering House control in 2026. Meanwhile, Pennsylvania voters decide on the retention of three Democratic Supreme Court justices, with implications for future redistricting and judicial decisions. The Texas House special election in the 18th district, marked by a jungle primary and high-profile candidates, reflects broader GOP efforts to expand influence in key Democratic areas.

## Democrats Are Winning the Shutdown Politics. Can They Stop Now? - <small>`cnn`</small>

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/politics/democrats-shutdown-politics)
- _Published: 2025-11-02 05:00:00-04:00_
- **Politics & Governance**
- <small>tags: `government shutdown, Democrats, Republican leadership, public opinion, Obamacare, federal worker firings, Snap program, political polling, political strategy, constitutional crisis`</small>

### Summary

The 2025 government shutdown has evolved into a politically significant standoff where Democrats are gaining momentum despite the crisis. While Republicans initially framed the shutdown as a strategic move to defund Obamacare — a strategy dismissed by leaders like Mitch McConnell and John Boehner — the current situation reveals a deeper failure in GOP leadership. Public opinion remains heavily critical of Republicans, with polling showing double-digit blame margins and strong disapproval of Trump’s decision to fire thousands of federal workers. The administration's actions, including Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins' dismissive statements about food stamps and refusal to comply with court orders, have damaged credibility and fueled Democratic unity. A surge in Democratic voter approval — from 40% to 58% in a Quinnipiac poll — suggests a powerful internal rally. Moreover, Democrats face a critical challenge: internal frustration over perceived lack of resistance to Trump, with 41% citing 'not fighting hard enough' as their main reason for disapproval. Despite potential economic impacts like rising Obamacare premiums, the political landscape favors Democrats, making it increasingly unlikely they will back down. This represents a shift from traditional shutdown politics — where one side yields — to a prolonged crisis that is reinforcing party cohesion and public skepticism of Republican tactics.

### Key Takeaways
  - The current government shutdown is not a simple back-and-forth political negotiation but a deeply politicized standoff with significant public backlash against Republican actions.
  - Democrats are gaining political momentum despite the shutdown, as polling shows sustained public blame placed on Republicans and widespread disapproval of Trump-era federal worker firings.
  - The administration’s decision to fire thousands of federal workers during the shutdown backfired politically, as public opinion strongly disapproves of the action by a 63%-21% margin.
  - Republican leadership, including Trump and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, made erratic statements, such as calling food stamp programs a failure and refusing to honor court-ordered emergency funding, undermining their credibility.
  - Democrats are increasingly united, with a notable rise in approval of their congressional leadership — from 40% to 58% in a Quinnipiac poll — suggesting a potential rallying effect from the crisis.
  - Public frustration with Democrats' perceived lack of resistance to the Trump administration is a major concern, with 41% of frustrated Democrats citing 'not fighting hard enough' as their primary reason.
  - The debate over enhanced Obamacare subsidies remains popular, with over 70% of Americans supporting the policy extension, giving Democrats a strong policy platform.
  - The political dynamics are shifting: Republicans appear to be losing control of the narrative, while Democrats are gaining leverage in both public opinion and party cohesion.

### Summary

Millions of Americans, particularly those in households with children, the elderly, or individuals with disabilities, are at risk of delayed SNAP food assistance due to a government shutdown. Two federal judges have ruled that the Trump administration must use emergency funds to at least partially cover benefits scheduled for November 1, with 3 million recipients expected on that date and up to 26.6 million by November 10. The USDA reports that nearly 42 million Americans rely on SNAP, with high participation in New Mexico, Louisiana, and the District of Columbia. Households receive an average of $350 monthly, and most have incomes below the federal poverty line. With limited alternatives and food pantries under strain, the disruption adds significant pressure on already overburdened emergency food systems, especially in states like Texas where over 3.5 million people rely on SNAP. Though states have pledged emergency funding, it falls far short of federal costs, highlighting the need for sustained federal support to maintain food security.

## Two Federal Judges Require Trump Administration to Use Emergency Funds to Partially Cover Food Stamp Benefits - <small>`cnn`</small>

- <small>tags: `government shutdown, SNAP benefits, food insecurity, federal judiciary, emergency funds, Trump administration, USDA, social safety net, legal intervention, public health`</small>

### Summary

Two federal judges, John McConnell in Rhode Island and Indira Talwani in Massachusetts, ruled that the Trump administration must use emergency contingency funds to partially cover food stamp (SNAP) benefits for tens of millions of Americans during the ongoing government shutdown. The judges rejected the USDA's claim that it cannot use the $5.3 billion contingency fund, emphasizing that a government shutdown does not eliminate the need for SNAP operations. While the funds are insufficient to cover full monthly costs, the orders require the USDA to make partial payments by November 1 and to supplement with additional funds if possible. President Donald Trump responded by instructing his legal team to seek legal pathways to fund SNAP, stating he would act as he did for military pay. The administration opposes using a separate $17 billion fund, citing concerns about child nutrition programs, but courts have mandated the use of contingency funds to prevent irreparable harm to vulnerable families. Despite the rulings, millions of recipients will face delays in receiving benefits due to administrative processing times, and the situation highlights the judiciary’s increasing role in protecting essential public services during governmental crises.

## Will SNAP benefits be paid in November? Here’s what we know about the judges’ rulings - <small>`cnn`</small>

- **Politics & Governance**
- <small>tags: `federal government shutdown, SNAP benefits, food stamp delays, emergency funds, USDA, judicial rulings, Trump administration, funding shortfall, partial payments, wic program, state-level implementation`</small>

### Summary

During the federal government shutdown, two federal judges have ruled that the USDA must use emergency funds to provide at least partial SNAP benefits to nearly 42 million Americans in November. The USDA’s contingency fund, with only $5.3 billion remaining, is insufficient to cover the $8.2 to $9 billion monthly cost of SNAP benefits, prompting legal debate over whether to use additional funds from tariff revenue. While judges have ordered partial payments to be made by Monday, November 6, the administration has discretion to provide full benefits using legal authority, which would be faster and less error-prone than system changes required to reduce benefits. States are currently unable to issue benefits due to a USDA letter on October 10, and many face technical and logistical challenges in adjusting their systems to deliver smaller payments. President Donald Trump has pledged to fund the benefits if legally authorized, echoing past commitments to pay military and law enforcement. Recipients may receive retroactive payments if only partial benefits are issued, and the full rollout of assistance will depend on the USDA’s decision and state-level implementation capacity.

### Key Takeaways
  - Federal judges have ordered the USDA to use emergency funds to provide at least partial SNAP benefits to tens of millions of Americans in November due to the federal government shutdown.
  - The USDA’s contingency fund has only $5.3 billion left, while SNAP benefits for the month are estimated at $8.2 to $9 billion, leaving a significant funding gap.
  - The administration has the legal authority to use $17 billion in tariff revenue for SNAP, but legal and procedural hurdles exist, particularly due to concerns about harming child nutrition programs.
  - Partial payments would require system-wide changes across state agencies, many of which use outdated systems, increasing risk of errors and delays, with some states needing weeks or months to adapt.
  - If the USDA opts for partial payments, recipients may receive retroactive payments once the government reopens.
  - President Donald Trump stated he would provide funding if legally authorized, echoing his commitment to pay military and law enforcement personnel during shutdowns.
  - Two federal judges — Indira Talwani in Boston and John McConnell in Rhode Island — issued rulings requiring partial payments from the contingency fund and allowing the USDA discretion to use additional funds for full benefits.
  - States stopped issuing benefits after receiving a letter from the USDA on October 10, leading to a delay in assistance for millions of SNAP recipients.

### Summary

The Trump administration has restricted journalists from accessing the White House press secretary’s 'Upper Press' office without prior appointment, citing security concerns. This policy, which also bars access to communications director Steven Cheung’s office, contradicts decades of tradition and undermines press freedom. Critics, including the White House Correspondents’ Association, argue it limits transparency, accountability, and the public’s right to know. The move follows a broader pattern of media suppression during Trump’s second term, including blocking the Associated Press from events, halting transcript releases, and restricting Pentagon press access under Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. Historical parallels exist with Bill Clinton’s administration, where similar restrictions were overturned due to public backlash, indicating recurring tensions between executive power and media access.

The demand stems from public outrage over Epstein’s sex trafficking case and a desire to provide justice to survivors and prevent future abuse. While UK authorities like the Independent Office for Police Conduct have initiated an assessment of potential referrals, the Metropolitan Police concluded in 2016 that other jurisdictions were better suited to investigate such allegations, and thus declined to pursue action. The situation underscores growing international pressure on Andrew to disclose information, with suggestions that he could testify remotely with legal counsel.

## Hotly contested mayoral election isn’t just about the candidates. The NYPD’s future is also at stake - <small>`cnn`</small>

### Summary

The 2025 New York mayoral election is not only a political contest between candidates Zohran Mamdani, Andrew Cuomo, and Curtis Sliwa, but also a pivotal moment for the future of the NYPD. If Mamdani wins, he has announced his intention to retain current Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch, despite significant policy disagreements—such as over the gang database, the Strategic Response Group, and disciplinary oversight. Tisch, known for her assertive leadership and restructuring of the department during a period of scandal and turnover, brings stability, which both law enforcement officials and business leaders value. However, Mamdani promotes a shift toward community-based mental health solutions, including a new Department of Community Safety, to reduce reliance on police. While such initiatives are seen as progressive, they face practical and safety-related challenges, including staffing shortages, low pay, and risk of misjudgment during emergency calls. The article also highlights broader concerns, including possible federal intervention via the National Guard, which Mamdani opposes and Bratton argues is unnecessary given the city’s low crime and effective policing. Ultimately, the election outcome could determine whether the NYPD continues under a stable, experienced commissioner or undergoes a period of radical reform with uncertain consequences.

### Key Takeaways
  - The 2025 New York mayoral election pits Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani against independent candidate Andrew Cuomo and Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa.
  - If Zohran Mamdani wins, he plans to retain current NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch, despite ideological differences on policing strategies such as the gang database, protest response units, and officer disciplinary oversight.
  - Jessica Tisch has opposed key policies advocated by Mamdani, including disbanding the Strategic Response Group and shifting disciplinary decisions to the Civilian Complaint Review Board.
  - Former NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton notes that Tisch’s retention would provide stability for officers and the department during a politically turbulent transition.
  - Mamdani’s proposed new Department of Community Safety would focus on mental health and violence interruption, aiming to reduce reliance on police for emotionally disturbed individuals.
  - Concerns remain about the feasibility of deploying mental health professionals on 911 calls due to safety risks and staffing shortages.
  - The NYPD currently has fewer than 35,000 officers, with a monthly turnover of approximately 300 officers, and recruitment remains a challenge despite relaxed eligibility standards.
  - The article references historical instability in NYPD leadership, including the rapid turnover of top officials during Mayor Eric Adams' administration.
  - There is a looming threat of federal intervention, with Mamdani suggesting legal action against President Donald Trump’s potential use of the National Guard in major cities.
  - Bratton asserts that the NYPD’s size and low crime rates make federal military involvement unnecessary, and that Tisch’s influence provides a stabilizing force against political pressure from other cities.

## What early voting data says about NYC, Virginia and New Jersey elections - <small>`cnn`</small>

### Summary

Early voting data from New Jersey, Virginia, and New York City in early November 2025 shows a shift in voter dynamics favoring Democratic candidates. In New Jersey, Democrats outperform Republicans in both mail and in-person early voting, giving U.S. Rep. Mikie Sherrill a stronger position than Kamala Harris had in 2024. In New York City, older voters have turned out more than during the primary, but younger voters are catching up, with Zohran Mamdani benefiting from strong youth support and a shifting geographic distribution of votes. In Virginia, despite Republican-leaning in-person voting in some areas, the increased share of mail ballots—where Democrats perform better—has made the pre-election electorate more Democratic-leaning, and gaps between Trump- and Harris-won counties have narrowed due to expanded voting access in Democratic-leaning counties like Arlington and Fairfax. While these trends suggest favorable positions for Democratic candidates, the article emphasizes that early voting data only offers insight and does not predict final Election Day outcomes.

### Key Takeaways
  - Democratic candidates for governor in New Jersey and Virginia are in stronger positions than Kamala Harris was at the same point last year, due to higher Democratic turnout in mail and early in-person voting.
  - In New York City, older Democratic voters have shown higher turnout than in the primary, but younger voters are increasingly participating, signaling a shift toward a younger electorate that favors Zohran Mamdani.

  - The geographic distribution of early votes in Virginia shows narrowing gaps between Trump- and Harris-won counties, with more voting locations opening in Democratic-leaning areas like Arlington and Fairfax.

## Trump’s unusual tariff strategy puts America’s allies in a near-impossible situation - <small>`cnn`</small>

### Summary

President Donald Trump has escalated the use of tariffs as a political weapon, imposing them not only on trade imbalances but also on political criticism, media content, and human rights issues. Examples include a 10% tariff increase on Canada over an Ontario ad quoting Ronald Reagan, 50% tariffs on Brazil due to political prosecution of Jair Bolsonaro, retaliatory actions against Colombia and South Africa, and significant economic harm to Brazil’s coffee exports. This strategy creates a near-impossible dilemma for global allies, who must constantly negotiate under threat of sudden retaliation. While China has managed to counter Trump effectively through diplomacy, the U.S. Supreme Court is set to evaluate whether Trump’s use of tariffs as leverage constitutes an illegal exercise of emergency powers, potentially limiting the scope of this policy.

### Key Takeaways
  - President Donald Trump frequently uses tariffs as a political and economic tool, even for non-trade-related issues such as political criticism or media content.
  - Tariff threats are not based on traditional trade imbalances but on perceived political or ideological offenses, creating unpredictability in international trade relations.
  - Countries face a 'near-impossible situation' because they must negotiate with transactional mindset and anticipate sudden retaliatory tariffs from the U.S. at any time.
  - The Brazilian Specialty Coffee Association reports a 70% drop in coffee exports due to tariffs, and the IMF warns of a broader economic slowdown in Brazil, demonstrating real economic impact.
  - Colombia’s President Gustavo Petro faced political backlash and economic pressure after criticizing Trump’s actions in drug operations, illustrating how tariffs can disrupt fragile democracies.
  - Trump’s tariffs on South Africa were justified based on land reform and treatment of white farmers, showing a blend of economic and geopolitical motivations.
  - China is the only country that has successfully resisted Trump’s tariff threats, achieving reduced tariffs through strategic diplomacy and maintaining domestic influence.
  - The U.S. Supreme Court is scheduled to hear Trump’s appeal on the legality of using tariffs as leverage under emergency powers, which could restrict his authority if the court rules against him.
  - Trump’s tariff strategy undermines traditional trade policy norms and introduces a high degree of unpredictability and risk for global allies and partners.

### Summary

A federal judge, Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, ruled that President Donald Trump lacks constitutional authority to require documentary proof of citizenship on the federal voter registration form, citing violations of the separation of powers. The decision, which permanently bars the U.S. Election Assistance Commission from implementing the requirement, was supported by civil rights groups and the Democratic National Committee. The ruling reinforces the principle that election regulation is a state and congressional responsibility, not a presidential one. Previous attempts at citizenship verification in states like Kansas and New Hampshire have led to voter confusion and disenfranchisement, while evidence shows noncitizen voting is rare. The lawsuit continues, with ongoing challenges to other provisions of Trump’s election executive order, including the postmarked ballot rule.

## Federal Judge to Rule on National Guard Deployment in Portland Amid Legal and Political Tensions - <small>`cnn`</small>

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/us/portland-national-guard-deployment-trial)

- **Politics & Governance**
- <small>tags: `National Guard, Portland, ICE facility, Trump administration, Federal vs. state sovereignty, Legal dispute, Protest security, Law enforcement, Judicial authority, Political crisis`</small>

### Summary

A federal trial in Portland is concluding with a pivotal decision on whether the National Guard can be deployed to protect the ICE facility amid ongoing protests. U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut issued a restraining order blocking troop deployment, but federal officials admitted troops were already present at the facility after her order, raising serious questions about contempt and executive overreach. The Trump administration claims the protests involve coordinated violence and a threat to federal agents, citing incidents like a June 14 riot where demonstrators threw rocks and attempted to breach the building. However, state and local attorneys argue that the situation is misrepresented, that protests are largely peaceful, and that Portland’s sanctuary laws restrict local law enforcement from intervening. Officials from the Federal Protective Service and the National Guard testified they were not consulted or briefed on conditions in Portland, and federal use of force—including tear gas—has reportedly injured local officers and increased tensions. The outcome of the trial will determine the balance of federal authority versus state sovereignty and set a precedent for future national security deployments during public protests.

### Key Takeaways
  - The federal government admitted that National Guard troops were at the Portland ICE facility after Judge Karin Immergut issued her restraining order, raising serious questions about compliance with judicial orders.
  - The Trump administration claimed that protests outside the ICE facility involved coordinated violence and required military intervention, but state and city attorneys argue that the situation is misrepresented and that law enforcement has managed most incidents peacefully.

- <small>tags: `immigration, ICE raids, Nebraska, undocumented immigrants, Cornhusker Clink, Trump administration, labor shortage, immigrant workforce, political polarization, civil liberties, meatpacking industry, family separation, anti-immigrant policies`</small>

### Summary

The article details how the expansion of federal immigration enforcement in Nebraska—marked by a large ICE raid at a meatpacking plant in June 2025 and the opening of the 'Cornhusker Clink' detention center in McCook—is disrupting long-standing immigrant communities. Alejandra, an undocumented mother of four, represents the fear and anxiety many in rural Nebraska face, as immigration raids and political alignment with the Trump administration create a climate of fear. The meatpacking industry, which relies on immigrant labor, is experiencing critical labor shortages and declining worker morale. Critics, including civil rights groups and state lawmakers, argue that the new facility undermines community support, increases isolation, and contradicts Nebraska’s history of welcoming immigrants. The article underscores a growing crisis: immigrant families are self-deporting, economic stability is at risk, and the state is becoming a symbol of federal anti-immigrant policy, even in the absence of a physical border.

### Key Takeaways
  - The opening of the 'Cornhusker Clink' ICE detention center in McCook, Nebraska, represents a significant expansion of federal immigration enforcement in a traditionally low-profile, non-border state.
  - Nebraska’s immigrant workforce, particularly in meatpacking and rural communities, has long supported local economies and social stability, yet recent ICE operations and political shifts are creating widespread fear and labor shortages.

  - The remote location of the facility and lack of public transportation increase isolation and hinder access to legal representation, raising civil rights concerns among advocates.
  - Despite Nebraska’s history of welcoming immigrants—especially through refugee resettlement—political alignment with Trump’s immigration policies is reshaping public sentiment and threatening rural Latino communities and the meatpacking industry.

## Fact check: Trump’s false claims about his poll numbers - <small>`cnn`</small>

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/poll-numbers-trump-fact-check)

- **Politics & Governance**
- <small>tags: `polling data, Donald Trump, presidential approval, political misinformation, fact-check, media reporting, U.S. politics`</small>

### Summary

The article refutes claims made by President Donald Trump that he has the highest poll numbers ever and that he has better approval than any previous president. It presents multiple polling averages from the New York Times, CNN, G. Elliott Morris, and Nate Silver, showing a significant decline in Trump’s net approval from early in his second term — which has dropped to negative-10 to negative-15 points — compared to his peak approval levels. Historical data shows that even presidents like Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and Joe Biden achieved higher approval ratings at comparable points in their terms. The article also notes that while Trump enjoys high approval among Republicans, his overall national approval is not at a personal best or record-setting level, making his assertions factually incorrect.

### Key Takeaways
  - Trump claimed his approval ratings were at personal highs and better than any previous president’s, but polling data shows a significant decline in his net approval from positive to negative.
  - Multiple independent polling averages — including those from The New York Times, CNN’s Poll of Polls, G. Elliott Morris, and Nate Silver — indicate Trump’s net approval is around negative 10 to negative 15 points, far below his peak levels.
  - Barack Obama reached 69% approval in early 2009, George W. Bush hit 90% after 9/11, and Joe Biden achieved 57% approval in early 2021 — all better than Trump’s current numbers.
  - Historical data from Nate Silver shows that every president elected after World War II had better approval ratings than Trump on the equivalent date of their first terms.
  - Trump’s approval remains high among Republicans (often near 90%), but he did not specify this group and his claim of a personal best or record-setting numbers for any president is factually incorrect.
  - Trump’s second term average approval (third quarter of second term) is lower than any president elected to two terms since Eisenhower, except for Nixon.

## Newly unsealed Epstein records shed light on years of his financial transactions with Wall St. figures - <small>`cnn`</small>

### Summary

Newly unsealed court records reveal that JPMorgan Chase filed over 100 suspicious activity reports (SARs) between 2002 and 2019 concerning Jeffrey Epstein’s financial transactions, totaling over $1 billion in dealings with Wall Street figures, Russian banks, and others. Despite closing Epstein’s accounts in 2013, the bank continued to file SARs until 2019, highlighting ongoing awareness of suspicious activity.

### Summary

Ohio’s Republican-dominated redistricting commission adopted a new congressional map that could help Republicans gain two seats in the 2026 U.S. House elections, a move that aligns with President Donald Trump’s efforts to preserve a congressional majority. Meanwhile, Virginia’s Democratic-led General Assembly advanced a constitutional amendment that would allow lawmakers to bypass a bipartisan redistricting commission and draw maps favoring their party, citing national concerns about gerrymandering. Critics, including Ohio residents and Democrats, have denounced the changes as undemocratic and gerrymandered, particularly in districts like those held by Democrats Greg Landsman and Marcy Kaptur. The political contest reflects a national battle over fair representation, with Democrats seeking to block Republican-led gerrymandering and Republicans attempting to consolidate power. The outcomes in these states will have direct implications for the 2026 House election, where Democrats need just three seats to take control and counter Trump’s legislative agenda.

  - Republican state Auditor Keith Farber defended the Ohio map by citing geographic disparities between urban and rural populations, arguing that a balanced map would require splitting counties and townships.
  - Virginia Democrats argue that redistricting is necessary to counteract the influence of Trump’s gerrymandering efforts in Republican-controlled states, framing their action as a defense of democratic integrity.
  - The proposed Virginia constitutional amendment requires approval by the General Assembly and then a statewide referendum, meaning it remains subject to public vote.
  - The political battle over redistricting reflects a broader national conflict between parties over fair representation, with Democrats seeking to prevent further gerrymandering and Republicans pushing to consolidate advantages in their districts.

## Pentagon Cleared Giving Ukraine Long-Range Tomahawk Missiles, Leaving Final Decision to Trump - <small>`cnn`</small>

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/pentagon-tomahawks-trump-ukraine)

- **Politics & Governance**
- <small>tags: `Ukraine War, Long-range missiles, US foreign policy, Defense policy, Trump administration, Zelensky, Tomahawk missile, Geopolitical tensions, Military aid, Russia`</small>

### Summary

The Pentagon has approved the White House to consider providing Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk missiles, as it determines the move would not deplete US stockpiles. However, the final decision rests with President Donald Trump, who initially expressed reluctance due to national security concerns but later reversed his position. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has persistently urged the US to supply such missiles to target deep within Russian territory, particularly energy infrastructure. Despite the Pentagon's clearance, significant logistical and training challenges remain—especially Ukraine’s lack of naval capability to launch the missiles, which would require land-based launchers or alternative solutions. Ukrainian engineers have previously developed workarounds with foreign-supplied missiles, suggesting feasibility. The decision is also influenced by diplomatic considerations, including Russia’s President Vladimir Putin warning of damage to US-Russia relations. While the US and European allies see the move as a strategic step toward ending the war, operational readiness and political will remain critical hurdles.

### Key Takeaways
  - The Pentagon has cleared the White House to provide Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk missiles, citing no negative impact on US stockpiles, but the final decision rests with President Donald Trump.
  - President Donald Trump initially expressed reluctance to provide the missiles, citing national security concerns over US stockpiles, but reversed his position shortly before a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
  - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been advocating for long-range missiles to target deep within Russian territory, particularly energy infrastructure, to improve Ukraine’s military effectiveness.
  - A major operational challenge is that Ukraine lacks a navy capable of launching Tomahawks from ships or submarines; land-based launchers would need to be provided or alternative methods developed.
  - Ukrainian engineers have previously developed workarounds to use foreign-supplied missiles (like the UK’s Storm Shadow) in modified Soviet-era aircraft, suggesting possible solutions for Tomahawk deployment.
  - European allies believe the US now has fewer excuses not to provide the missiles, reflecting confidence in US defense policy consistency.
  - Trump's decision may have been influenced by his phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who warned that Tomahawk strikes could damage the US-Russia relationship, even if militarily insignificant.
  - While the Pentagon has no concerns about stockpiles, significant operational and training hurdles remain for Ukraine to effectively deploy the missiles.

### Named Entities
- **Pentagon**
    - The US Department of Defense's central command for military strategy and policy
    - The Pentagon assessed that providing Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine would not impact US stockpiles, enabling the White House to consider the distribution.

### Summary

Republican leaders, including Senate Majority Leader John Thune and House Speaker Mike Johnson, are firmly rejecting President Donald Trump’s call to end the Senate filibuster, despite the ongoing government shutdown. The filibuster, which requires 60 votes to end debate, is seen as a critical safeguard that promotes compromise and protects minority rights. Even though eliminating it would only require 51 votes, multiple Republican senators, including John Curtis and Roger Marshall, oppose the move, calling it a threat to democratic principles. Trump’s late-night post on Truth Social expressing anger at the shutdown is interpreted not as a policy shift, but as a personal reaction. The resistance reflects a deep division within the GOP, with no consensus on changing Senate rules, signaling that the filibuster remains a powerful institutional check on legislative power.

### Key Takeaways

  - The filibuster allows a minority of senators (at least 41) to block legislation, ensuring compromise and protecting minority rights.

  - At least a dozen Republican senators oppose eliminating the filibuster, and leaders like Sen. John Curtis and Roger Marshall call it a critical safeguard for minority rights and democratic principles.
  - Trump's late-night post on Truth Social expressing anger at the shutdown is seen as a personal outburst, not a policy shift supported by GOP leadership.

### Summary

In October 2025, King Charles publicly stripped his brother Andrew Mountbatten Windsor of his royal titles and privileges, including the title Duke of York, following sustained public outrage over Andrew’s alleged ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. This move, described by experts as unprecedented, follows the publication of Virginia Giuffre’s posthumous memoir and a long history of controversy. Though Andrew remains eighth in line to the throne and will receive financial support and a house at Sandringham, he will be relocated from Royal Lodge in Windsor after the Christmas holidays. The decision is seen as a significant damage-control measure by the monarchy, supported by political leaders like Kemi Badenoch, yet criticized by anti-monarchy groups who argue it fails to address accountability or justice for abuse allegations. Historians note the event's uniqueness compared to past royal title revocations, which were often tied to political or marital issues rather than serious ethical lapses.

### Summary

The move, which includes removing Andrew’s titles such as Duke of York, Earl of Inverness, and Garter Knight, marks the first such action in over a century and reflects widespread public outrage over his financial dealings, including a $1 million purchase of Royal Lodge with negligible rent. While Andrew remains in the line of succession, he will move to private accommodation on the Sandringham estate, funded by the King, with relocation expected after Christmas.

The shutdown has reached its 35-day mark, with critical consequences such as the end of food aid for millions and operational stress on air traffic controllers, prompting the White House to intervene.

## Trump Just Kneecapped the GOP’s Shutdown Strategy - <small>`cnn`</small>

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/donald-trump-end-shutdown-filibuster)

- <small>tags: `government shutdown, filibuster, Donald Trump, Republican Party, political strategy, public opinion, bipartisan politics, legislative procedure, political dysfunction`</small>

### Summary

President Donald Trump has again disrupted Republican efforts to resolve a prolonged government shutdown by urging the GOP-led Senate to invoke the 'nuclear option' — eliminating the filibuster to allow party-line votes. While technically feasible, this move is widely seen as counterproductive, as it undermines GOP leaders' credibility and strengthens Democrats' argument that Republicans could have ended the shutdown at any time. Republican leaders like John Thune, John Barrasso, and Mike Johnson oppose the change, citing risks such as allowing Democrats to expand statehood or pack the Supreme Court. The move also comes amid public opinion that still heavily blames Republicans for the shutdown, despite Democrats having initiated the concession request. Trump's repeated pattern of late, disruptive demands — including in 2018 and during the debt ceiling debate — has created frustration among GOP officials, who see it as politically unhelpful and damaging to bipartisan negotiations.

### Key Takeaways
  - President Donald Trump urged Republican congressional leaders to invoke the 'nuclear option' to end the government shutdown by eliminating the Senate filibuster, a move that would allow party-line votes.
  - This intervention is widely seen as unhelpful and counterproductive, as it undermines GOP leaders' credibility and legitimizes the claim that Republicans could have ended the shutdown at any time.
  - Republican leaders such as Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Senator John Barrasso, and House Speaker Mike Johnson have expressed strong opposition to eliminating the filibuster, citing concerns about democratic safeguards and executive overreach.
  - Trump’s repeated history of late, disruptive demands during shutdown negotiations — such as in 2018 and during the December 2024 debt ceiling discussions — demonstrates a pattern of undermining bipartisan efforts.
  - Despite the technical feasibility of ending the shutdown via the nuclear option, Republican leaders argue there are significant risks, including enabling Democratic control of Puerto Rico and DC as states, or packing the Supreme Court.
  - Public opinion remains largely critical of Republicans, with a Washington Post-ABC News poll showing 45% blaming Trump and GOP leaders for the shutdown, compared to 33% blaming Democrats.
  - The intervention has placed Republican leaders in a difficult position: explaining why they have not taken the action Trump proposed, even though it is technically within their power.

The royal family claims this action marks a decisive end to years of public outrage, but many believe the consequences fall short of adequate accountability, especially given the severity of the allegations and the perception of disproportionate punishment.

### Key Takeaways

## Bitter Washington Blame Game Rages as Pain Grips Needy Americans - <small>`cnn`</small>

- **Politics & Governance**
- <small>tags: `federal shutdown, filibuster, Obamacare subsidies, SNAP benefits, political deadlock, judicial intervention, healthcare policy, constitutional crisis, Congressional dysfunction, Washington political drama`</small>

### Summary

The United States is experiencing a prolonged federal shutdown due to a political deadlock between Democrats and Republicans over the extension of Obamacare subsidies. Democrats refuse to extend funding unless Republicans agree to maintain enhanced health care subsidies, which would prevent millions from facing soaring medical costs. Republicans are willing to negotiate only after the government is reopened, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of inaction. The shutdown threatens to deplete SNAP benefits, risking food insecurity for over 40 million Americans, and has led to widespread political blame and personal attacks. A federal judge, Indira Talwani, has indicated she may intervene to prevent the deaths from hunger, highlighting the constitutional failure of Congress. While there is cautious optimism from Senate Majority Leader John Thune about increased dialogue, no tangible progress has been made. The situation reflects a deeper breakdown in American political institutions, where ideological rigidity prevents basic governance functions, and any resolution may come only through a politically risky compromise or a judicial intervention.

## Trump Orders U.S. to Resume Nuclear Testing, Sparks Global Concern Ahead of China Summit - <small>`cnn`</small>

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/us-nuclear-testing-trump-advisers)

- **Politics & Governance**
- <small>tags: `nuclear testing, Donald Trump, China, Russia, U.S. foreign policy, arms control, geopolitical tension, security policy, international treaties, nuclear weapons, nonproliferation`</small>

### Summary

In a surprise move just before a high-stakes summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping, President Donald Trump directed the Pentagon to resume nuclear testing after a 33-year moratorium, citing growing nuclear capabilities in other nations, especially China. The directive, made via social media on Truth Social, caught even his closest advisers off guard and raised serious questions about feasibility, legality, and intent. Historically, nuclear testing is managed by the Department of Energy, and experts argue that modern computer simulations are sufficient to maintain weapon reliability. Trump claimed the decision was necessary to verify functionality and counter global nuclear expansion, though he did not specify where or how the tests would occur. Officials, including Vice Admiral Richard Correll and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, expressed skepticism or caution, noting that no operational plans or approvals exist. Critics warn that such a move could inadvertently encourage China to resume testing, undermining U.S. strategic goals and violating international arms control treaties. Despite Trump's long-standing rhetoric about nuclear weapons, including taunting North Korea and making bold statements, this announcement reflects a more volatile and unpredictable approach to foreign policy, raising significant concerns about global stability, arms control, and the role of nuclear deterrence in international relations.

### Key Takeaways
  - President Donald Trump directed the Pentagon to resume nuclear testing after a 33-year pause, citing global nuclear capabilities including China’s.
  - The directive surprised even Trump’s advisers and was not widely shared ahead of time.
  - Historically, nuclear testing is managed by the Department of Energy, not the Pentagon, and computer simulations are sufficient for maintaining weapon reliability.
  - Trump stated that the U.S. has more nuclear weapons than any other country and emphasized the need to verify functionality, though he did not specify the type or location of testing.
  - Trump claimed the decision was in response to actions by Russia and other nations, though China and Russia have not conducted nuclear explosive tests in decades.
  - Critics argue that resuming nuclear testing could encourage China to resume testing, thereby advancing China’s nuclear capabilities rather than deterring them.
  - There is no technical or operational readiness for immediate testing, and it would violate international treaties banning atmospheric nuclear testing.
  - The U.S. has not changed its nuclear modernization policy, which aims to counter China’s nuclear buildup, and a test could disrupt that strategic focus.
  - Trump has a history of using nuclear weapons as a rhetorical tool, including taunting North Korea and making bold statements about nuclear capabilities.
  - Military officials, including Vice Admiral Richard Correll, have expressed doubt that the president’s statement meant actual testing, and none of the current officials are prepared to act on it immediately.

### Summary

In Tanzania, a disputed presidential election has triggered widespread protests as critics allege that President Samia Suluhu Hassan’s campaign was conducted without meaningful opposition, leading to accusations of authoritarianism. The ruling Chama cha Mapinduzi (CCM) party is accused of using legal, administrative, and extrajudicial measures to block opposition candidates, including the imprisonment of Tundu Lissu and barring Luhaga Mpina from running. The government has also restricted internet access, banned key social media platforms like X and JamiiForums, and deployed the military to suppress protests, marking a significant departure from Tanzania’s usual political stability. This situation stands in contrast to regional peers like Uganda, Kenya, Mozambique, and Madagascar, where similar electoral disputes have led to youth-led protests and regime changes. Tanzania is thus emerging as an outlier in East Africa, where state repression appears to be intensifying in response to democratic challenges.

### Key Takeaways

## Dutch Centrist D66 Party Confirmed as Election Winner, ANP Says - <small>`cnn`</small>

- <small>tags: `Dutch election, Rob Jetten, D66, Geert Wilders, PVV, coalition government, political shift, youngest prime minister, pro-EU politics`</small>

### Summary

In the 2025 Dutch general election, the centrist, pro-EU D66 party secured the highest vote share with approximately 18%, marking a significant shift from the previous election. This victory puts its 38-year-old leader, Rob Jetten, on course to become the youngest-ever prime minister in the Netherlands. Despite a narrow and tightly contested race—where the far-right Freedom Party (PVV), led by Geert Wilders, briefly led at the end of the count—D66 is now expected to lead coalition talks. However, with only 18% of the vote, D66 will need at least three coalition partners to form a majority in the 150-seat Lower House of Parliament. The party's surge in support is attributed to a robust campaign and increased advertising spending, while Wilders lost much of the support that propelled his 2023 victory. Although mainstream parties have ruled out cooperation with PVV, Wilders has stated he will seek a coalition if his party is the top vote-getter. Final confirmation of the results will come on Monday with the counting of overseas mail ballots, and party leaders are expected to discuss next steps on Tuesday.

### Key Takeaways

## ‘The money does not exist’: Why the buyouts for college football coaches are setting off alarm bells - <small>`cnn`</small>

- <small>tags: `college football, coach buyouts, financial crisis, fiscal responsibility, revenue sharing, Louisiana, Penn State, Governor Jeff Landry, college athletics spending, athletic department finances, coaching contracts, student-athlete revenue, sports governance, public accountability, financial sustainability, university budgeting`</small>

### Summary

The article explores the growing financial crisis in college football due to massive buyouts for fired head coaches, with Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry publicly criticizing LSU’s $53 million buyout for head coach Brian Kelly. This action highlights broader concerns about fiscal responsibility, as 10 FBS schools have fired coaches since September 2025, resulting in a total of $169 million in buyouts. The article emphasizes that the funds for these buyouts do not exist, as revenue growth in football departments has outpaced spending, with spending rising 113% at Penn State and 44% at LSU while revenue grew only 83% and 40% respectively. Even support staff like coordinators are due severance, and schools are increasingly relying on donors or private investment, which is not sustainable. The $2.8 billion House settlement requiring revenue sharing with athletes adds further financial strain, leading to alarm among university boards. The article concludes that college football spending has outpaced revenue, creating a system that is financially unstable, politically controversial, and potentially unsustainable in the long term.

### Key Takeaways
  - The money does not exist: College football programs are now facing a financial crisis where buyout payments for fired coaches are being made without a clear source of funding.
  - Governor Jeff Landry of Louisiana publicly criticized the $53 million buyout owed to LSU head coach Brian Kelly, calling attention to fiscal responsibility and taxpayer burden.
  - A total of 10 FBS schools have fired head coaches since September 2025, with combined buyouts totaling $169 million, raising concerns about unsustainable spending.
  - Coaching contracts now include guaranteed buyouts, with some reaching $105 million (e.g., Kirby Smart at Georgia), making it difficult for schools to restructure or replace coaches without financial collapse.
  - Revenue growth in football departments has outpaced spending, with Penn State and LSU seeing spending increases of 113% and 44% respectively, while revenue growth lagged at 83% and 40%.
  - Even support staff such as coordinators (e.g., Joe Sloan at LSU, Jim Knowles at Penn State) are owed substantial severance, compounding the financial burden.
  - Private equity interest in college athletics has stalled due to financial concerns, and schools are increasingly relying on donor funding, which may not be sustainable.
  - Virginia Tech’s $229 million athletics investment and limited student fee increases raise alarms about financial overreach and lack of transparency.
  - The article illustrates a systemic issue: college football spending has outpaced revenue, leading to financial instability and public skepticism about the sustainability of current models.

## Western intelligence says Iran is rearming despite UN sanctions, with China’s help - <small>`cnn`</small>

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/middleeast/iran-rebuilding-ballistic-weapons-program-intl)
- _Published: 2025-10-31 09:07:00-04:00_
- **Politics & Governance**
- <small>tags: `Iran, China, Ballistic Missiles, UN Sanctions, Sodium Perchlorate, Snapback Mechanism, JCPOA, Missile Proliferation, Geopolitical Tensions, Nonproliferation`</small>

### Summary

Iran is reportedly rearming its ballistic missile program despite the reinstatement of UN sanctions via the 'snapback' mechanism, which was triggered after a 12-day conflict with Israel. European intelligence sources indicate that China is supplying Iran with 2,000 tons of sodium perchlorate—a key precursor in missile propellant—through a network of cargo ships, including the MV Basht, Elyana, and Artavand. These shipments began in late September 2025 and continue into October, with some ships operating covertly or under sanctions. The United States has sanctioned several Chinese and Iranian entities involved in the procurement, but China and Russia argue that the sanctions are illegal and unconstructive, citing a lack of explicit prohibition on sodium perchlorate. Experts note that while the chemical is not explicitly banned, it falls under broader restrictions on materials contributing to nuclear weapon delivery systems. This development marks a significant escalation in Iran’s re-arming efforts, likely driven by the destruction of missiles during the conflict with Israel. The situation reflects a strategic pause where all sides—Iran, Israel, and the US—are rebuilding military capabilities, raising concerns about regional stability and nonproliferation.

### Key Takeaways
  - Iran appears to be rebuilding its ballistic missile program despite new UN sanctions, using Chinese-supplied sodium perchlorate as a key precursor.
  - China is facilitating the supply of sodium perchlorate, despite being a critic of the sanctions re-imposition, possibly due to legal ambiguity and strategic alignment with Iran.
  - The shipments of 2,000 tons of sodium perchlorate are sufficient to produce approximately 500 missiles, suggesting a substantial effort to replace war-damaged or used missiles.
  - Several cargo ships involved in these shipments, including MV Basht, Elyana, and Artavand, are either sanctioned or operate under covert operations, indicating an opaque and possibly illicit supply chain.
  - The lack of explicit mention of sodium perchlorate in UN sanctions documents allows China to argue that it is not violating the ban, based on interpretive flexibility in the regulations.
  - China and Russia jointly opposed the snapback mechanism, calling it unconstructive and a setback to diplomatic efforts, highlighting a broader geopolitical stance against sanctions pressure.
  - The re-arming effort is seen as part of a broader strategic pause, with all parties—including Iran, Israel, and the US—seeking to rebuild military capabilities after conflict.

## How this week's elections in Virginia became about ... everything - <small>`npr`</small>

- <small>tags: `Virginia gubernatorial election, political violence, federal government shutdown, Elon Musk DOGE layoffs, redistricting, transgender youth policies, Abigail Spanberger, Winsome Earle-Sears, Jay Jones, Glenn Youngkin, political extremism`</small>

### Summary

The 2025 Virginia gubernatorial race has transformed from a traditional policy contest into a multifaceted political referendum on issues including the federal government shutdown, federal worker layoffs tied to Elon Musk’s DOGE initiative, allegations of political violence from text messages involving Democratic attorney general nominee Jay Jones, and the controversial topic of redistricting. Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic nominee, leads in polls and frames her campaign around protecting federal workers and opposing political extremism. Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, the Republican nominee, defends her record of economic growth and criticizes the shutdown as being driven by 'waste and abuse.' The Virginia legislature has proposed a constitutional amendment to allow redistricting ahead of the 2026 midterms, a move that could only succeed if Democrats retain control of state government. Despite years of Republican focus on transgender youth policies, recent polling indicates this issue is only a top concern for 3% of voters. Ultimately, the election reflects a broader national anxiety over political instability, worker treatment, and the direction of federal policy.

### Key Takeaways
  - The Virginia gubernatorial race has evolved from a traditional policy contest into a broad referendum on political violence, federal worker layoffs, redistricting, and transgender youth policies.

  - Virginia lawmakers proposed a constitutional amendment to allow redistricting ahead of the 2026 midterms, a move that depends on maintaining Democratic control of the House of Delegates, which hinges on Spanberger’s victory.
  - Transgender youth issues, once a key GOP platform, now appear to be a fringe concern — polling shows only 3% of Virginia voters prioritize it, though it remains a major campaign issue for Republicans.

### Summary

Zohran Mamdani, a 34-year-old Democratic Socialist and state assemblyman, has emerged as a national political figure after winning a surprise primary victory in New York, where he campaigned on bold economic policies focused on housing affordability, rent control, and reducing the cost of basic services like groceries and transportation. Despite living in conservative states like Mississippi and Florida, young voters across the country — particularly Gen Z and millennials — have found his message deeply resonant, viewing it as a challenge to political status quo and a reflection of their real-life economic struggles. While critics on both the left and right question the feasibility of his proposals, youth voter sentiment remains strong, fueled by disillusionment with traditional politics. The article highlights how Mamdani’s appeal extends far beyond New York, inspiring hope that similar economic reforms could be adopted in other communities, especially in rural and midwestern areas.

### Summary

President Donald Trump has expanded a national campaign to deploy U.S. National Guard and military troops to major U.S. cities, including Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, Chicago, Memphis, and Portland, as part of a broader strategy to portray Republicans as decisive crime fighters and Democrats as soft on crime. Despite FBI data showing a 4.5% decline in violent crime, a Gallup poll reveals that 49% of Americans believe crime has increased, reflecting a growing public fear rooted in lived experience rather than statistics. The White House has transformed a localized D.C. initiative into a nationwide political effort, framing crime as a top issue for Republicans, especially in the upcoming midterms. Critics, including Democrats and legal experts, argue that the deployments constitute an illegal military occupation and undermine civilian governance. Experts emphasize that public perceptions of safety are more influenced by personal experiences than crime data, and that Trump’s use of militarized urban enforcement aligns with a broader Republican strategy to appeal to conservative and suburban voters.

### Summary

South Korea is caught between the rising influence of the United States and China, with shifting trade, security, and economic dynamics reshaping its foreign policy. While South Korea continues to maintain economic ties with China, especially as the largest importer of South Korean goods, growing competition in key industries like electric vehicles and electronics, combined with public anti-China sentiment, has led to a strategic realignment toward the U.S. This shift was reinforced by a recent $350 billion investment deal between South Korea and the U.S., and by the diplomatic meeting between President Trump and President Xi at APEC in November 2025. Despite official statements of cooperation, unresolved tensions remain over THAAD, Hanwha Ocean sanctions, and South Korea’s nuclear submarine program. Experts warn that the multilateral nature of forums like APEC is being undermined by the U.S. shift toward protectionism and the resulting geopolitical imbalance, placing smaller regional players like South Korea in a difficult balancing act.

### Summary

Two federal judges, Indira Talwani in Boston and John J. McConnell Jr. in Rhode Island, ordered the Trump administration to use emergency funds to resume SNAP benefits for millions of Americans facing food insecurity. Judge Talwani required the administration to decide on partial payments by Monday, while Judge McConnell issued a temporary restraining order and mandated an immediate compliance plan. Despite the administration's earlier claims of lacking funds and legal authority, the courts ruled that emergency funds are legally accessible and must be used. President Trump expressed willingness to provide benefits if given proper legal direction, though the exact scope and timing of aid remain uncertain. The lawsuits, filed by Democratic-led states and local entities, highlight deep public concern over the humanitarian and economic consequences of suspending the nation’s largest anti-hunger program during a government shutdown.

### Summary

With the federal government in a shutdown, SNAP benefits — used by over 40 million Americans — are at risk of being suspended or delayed, sparking a nationwide crisis in food security. Federal judges in Rhode Island and Massachusetts have ordered the White House to use emergency funds to cover SNAP, but no clear plan has been implemented, creating uncertainty. President Trump has directed legal action to resolve the issue, though he warns of delays due to state-level processing. A coalition of Democratic governors and attorneys general are suing to prevent benefit cuts, arguing they are not legally permissible. Food banks like Roadrunner in New Mexico and Central Texas Food Bank warn of a public health emergency, noting that SNAP provides nine times more food support than the entire national food bank network. Meanwhile, private companies such as Flashfood and Too Good To Go are seeing a surge in users, responding to the sudden spike in need. The crisis is further compounded by political gridlock, with Democrats demanding that Republicans extend healthcare subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, which will expire at year-end. Republican leaders, including Senate Majority Leader John Thune, have criticized Democrats for treating the issue as a political game, highlighting the deepening divide over how to fund essential social programs.

## Supreme Court to Decide If Trump Overstepped Legal Authority in Using Tariffs - <small>`apnews`</small>

- <small>tags: `tariffs, foreign policy, U.S. politics, Supreme Court, President Donald Trump, International Emergency Economic Powers Act, Canada, Brazil, European Union, legal authority, diplomacy, geopolitics, economic policy`</small>

### Summary

President Donald Trump has employed tariffs as a central instrument of foreign policy during his second term, using them to pressure countries into making policy changes — such as securing ceasefires, curbing drug trafficking, or responding to political actions like Canada’s anti-tariff ad — and to exert influence in diplomatic negotiations like those with the European Union. This approach, which departs from traditional methods of foreign policy and uses tariffs as a broad, aggressive tool, has drawn legal scrutiny. Lower courts have ruled that Trump lacked authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), prompting the Supreme Court to hear arguments on whether he overstepped federal law. The outcome of this case could reshape how U.S. presidents use executive powers in foreign affairs, with potential consequences for global diplomacy, trade relationships, and economic stability.

### Key Takeaways
  - President Donald Trump has used tariffs as a foreign policy tool, not just an economic measure, to pressure foreign nations into compliance with U.S. demands.
  - The use of tariffs by Trump has been unprecedented in modern U.S. presidential history, with critics calling it a 'sledgehammer' approach rather than the traditional 'scalpel' method used by previous administrations.
  - The Supreme Court is currently reviewing whether Trump's actions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) constitute a lawful exercise of presidential power.
  - Tariff threats have been used to secure ceasefires in wars, pressure countries to curb drug and human trafficking, and respond to political actions such as Canada's television ad.
  - Trump has faced legal challenges from two lower courts, which found he lacked statutory authority under IEEPA to impose tariffs without congressional approval.
  - The White House maintains that the tariffs are lawful under emergency powers, and continues to prepare contingency plans if the Supreme Court rules against him.
  - Experts note that such broad use of tariffs could strain diplomatic relationships, lead to protectionism, and prompt foreign governments to shift alliances toward China.
  - The Supreme Court’s decision may have significant geopolitical and economic consequences, potentially altering how foreign policy and trade negotiations are conducted in the future.

## Trump Threatens Military Action in Nigeria Over Alleged Christian Persecution - <small>`apnews`</small>

### Summary

U.S. President Donald Trump has escalated tensions with Nigeria by threatening to halt all U.S. aid and potentially launch military action against the country, citing allegations that it fails to protect Christians from persecution by radical Islamists. He instructed the Pentagon to begin planning for possible military intervention, including airstrikes or troop deployment, if the situation worsens. Nigerian President Bola Ahmed Tinubu and foreign affairs spokesperson Kimiebi Ebienfa have strongly rejected these claims, asserting that Nigeria upholds religious tolerance and that most attacks on civilians are not targeted at Christians but rather affect both Muslim and Christian communities. The article notes that Nigeria was previously designated as a Country of Particular Concern in 2020, removed in 2023, and is now facing renewed scrutiny due to Trump’s aggressive rhetoric. Experts caution that the narrative of Christian persecution in Nigeria is oversimplified, as the majority of violent attacks in the country are directed at Muslims, particularly in the north, and that Nigeria’s religious demographics are roughly equal between Christians and Muslims. This incident underscores a growing geopolitical and diplomatic rift between the U.S. and Nigeria over religious freedom narratives and military posturing.

### Key Takeaways
  - U.S. President Donald Trump has accused Nigeria of failing to protect Christians from persecution, claiming that radical Islamists are responsible for mass killings.

  - While religiously motivated attacks do occur, most victims in Nigeria are Muslims, especially in the Muslim-majority northern regions, indicating that the narrative of Christian persecution is misleading or exaggerated.
  - Nigeria’s religious demographics are roughly equal between Christians and Muslims, highlighting the complexity of sectarian violence and the challenges of framing persecution in binary terms.

## Funding Delays in Safety Net Programs Threaten Low-Income Households Amid Federal Government Shutdown - <small>`apnews`</small>

### Summary

As the federal government shutdown enters its fifth week, low-income families across the United States are facing severe hardship due to delayed funding for critical safety net programs. The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which helps millions pay for heating and cooling, is being delayed in states like Pennsylvania, Minnesota, and Connecticut due to lack of federal appropriations. This delay threatens the ability of vulnerable households—especially the elderly, disabled, and low-income renters—to afford basic heating, with some relying on heating oil that cannot be replenished without federal funds. While states like Connecticut are using reserves to mitigate the crisis, others face longer delays. The crisis is compounded by concurrent delays in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), raising concerns about widespread poverty and winter survival. Experts warn that such a convergence of funding shortfalls is unprecedented, and that the shutdown—alongside political decisions such as staff firings—has significantly slowed program operations, potentially leading to delays into January.

### Key Takeaways
  - Low-income households across the U.S. face severe risks due to delayed federal funding for heating and food assistance programs amid a government shutdown.
  - The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) is particularly vulnerable, with states like Pennsylvania, Minnesota, and Connecticut postponing payments, threatening heating access for hundreds of thousands of vulnerable residents.
  - The shutdown has caused a crisis in the administration of LIHEAP, with some states unable to distribute funds despite having programs in place, and staff reductions may further delay operations.
  - Families relying on heating oil or propane face unique risks because private fuel suppliers are not obligated to continue deliveries without federal reimbursement, unlike regulated utilities.
  - The intersection of multiple safety net programs (LIHEAP, SNAP, Social Security) being delayed simultaneously exacerbates hardship for low-income individuals and elderly populations.

## Colombia’s ELN rebels face US drug threats amid push for peace talks - <small>`aljazeera`</small>

### Summary

In the volatile Catatumbo region of northern Colombia, the National Liberation Army (ELN), the country’s largest remaining guerrilla force, maintains strong control amid ongoing conflict with a dissident FARC faction and increasing international pressure. The ELN claims it does not engage in drug trafficking, instead asserting historical rights to tax coca crops in its controlled territories. Despite President Gustavo Petro’s push for total peace, negotiations have been suspended due to violence and have now been restarted. Meanwhile, US military operations targeting drug vessels in the Caribbean and Pacific, including attacks on suspected ELN-linked vessels, have intensified regional tensions. The US, under former President Donald Trump, has labeled ELN fighters as 'narco-terrorists' and threatened attacks, which the ELN views as acts of imperialism and a violation of sovereignty. This has heightened fears of a broader regional conflict, especially if the US escalates military actions against Venezuela under President Nicolas Maduro. The ELN warns of potential resistance across Latin America, and the situation underscores how a domestic Colombian conflict is now being shaped by external geopolitical forces, threatening to turn into a wider regional crisis.

### Key Takeaways
  - The ELN remains Colombia's largest remaining guerrilla force and controls key border territory in the Catatumbo region, where it faces both internal and external threats.

## Hamas rejects US accusation it looted aid trucks in Gaza - <small>`aljazeera`</small>

### Summary

Hamas has denied US Central Command's claim that it looted aid trucks in the Gaza Strip, particularly in Khan Younis on October 31, 2023. The US published drone footage allegedly showing the incident, asserting it was part of a humanitarian convoy; however, Hamas rejected this as fabricated, politically motivated, and an effort to justify reduced aid and cover up the international community's failure to end the blockade. Hamas argues that over 1,000 of its security forces were killed and hundreds wounded trying to protect aid convoys, and that no credible reports of looting exist. It blames the US for adopting the Israeli narrative and deepening the humanitarian crisis, while noting that only about 135 humanitarian trucks enter Gaza daily—far below international efforts. The controversy arises within the broader context of the ceasefire agreement established in October 2023 under Donald Trump’s 20-point plan, which included prisoner exchanges and a plan for Gaza’s reconstruction. Since October 2023, Israel’s war on Gaza has claimed over 68,500 lives and wounded more than 170,600, highlighting the severity of the ongoing crisis and the political and humanitarian implications of aid delivery disputes.

### Key Takeaways

  - The US CENTCOM published drone footage allegedly showing a looting incident in Khan Younis on October 31, 2023, during a humanitarian convoy.
  - Hamas asserts that more than 1,000 of its security personnel were killed and hundreds wounded while protecting aid convoys, indicating that looting is not attributable to Hamas.
  - Hamas claims that no reports or complaints from aid drivers or institutions have been filed about looting, suggesting the footage is fabricated.
  - The US drone was operating under the ceasefire monitoring mandate, which is meant to ensure compliance with the 20-point ceasefire plan led by Donald Trump.
  - Hamas criticizes the US for aligning with the Israeli narrative and reducing humanitarian aid, accusing it of bias and complicity in the blockade of Gaza.
  - The average number of humanitarian aid trucks entering Gaza daily is less than 135, with the majority being commercial trucks carrying goods Palestinians cannot afford.
  - Since October 2023, Israel’s war on Gaza has resulted in over 68,500 deaths and over 170,600 injuries, underscoring the scale of the human cost.

### Summary

President Donald Trump is set to host Syria’s interim leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, at the White House in early November, marking the first visit by a Syrian president to the U.S. capital in over 80 years.

### Summary

The article explores how Xinjiang, once considered a dangerous and politically volatile region in China, has been rebranded into a major tourist destination through massive government investment and state-controlled media narratives. Despite allegations of cultural erasure, forced assimilation, and human rights abuses by international organizations, tourism has surged—doubling from 2018 to 2024—with over 300 million visitors and tourism revenue reaching 360 billion yuan. Government efforts include promoting state-funded dramas like 'To the Wonder', opening international hotels such as Hilton and Marriott, and organizing carefully curated tours. Tourists like Anna and Sun Shengyao report positive experiences of natural beauty and cultural displays, often unaware of the deeper political and cultural tensions. However, critics like Uyghur-American activist Irade Kashgary argue that the region is being sold as a sanitized tourist spectacle, erasing authentic Uyghur culture and religion.

### Summary

A federal government shutdown has led to widespread flight delays and cancellations at US airports, primarily due to a shortage of air traffic controllers who are working without pay.

## Andrew fixed palace visit for firm with £1.4m deal with ex-wife - <small>`bbc`</small>

### Summary

The article reveals that Jay Bloom and Michael Evers, entrepreneurs from a cryptocurrency mining firm, were granted access to Buckingham Palace and St James's Palace by Prince Andrew in 2019, including a private tour of the palace and meetings with royal family members. Sarah Ferguson, then Duchess of York, served as a brand ambassador for Bloom’s Pegasus Group Holdings, which planned to mine Bitcoin using solar generators in Arizona—a venture that failed after acquiring only 615 of 16,000 units and generating just $33,779 in cryptocurrency. The project collapsed, leading to investor lawsuits and a $4.1 million award. The company’s financial and business connections to the royal family, including payments of over £200,000 to Sarah Ferguson and £60,500 to Prince Andrew via Adrian Gleave’s Alphabet Capital, have raised serious questions about misuse of royal privileges and financial transparency. The revelations have intensified scrutiny of Prince Andrew’s business ties, especially following his connection to Jeffrey Epstein, resulting in the formal process of stripping him of his royal titles and his Windsor mansion.

## World awaits landmark US Supreme Court decision on Trump's tariffs - <small>`bbc`</small>

- [source](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4jyk9jyv3o)

- **Politics & Governance**
- <small>tags: `Supreme Court, Donald Trump, tariffs, International Emergency Economic Powers Act, U.S. trade policy, constitutional law, small businesses, global trade, emergency powers, business disruption, political controversy`</small>

### Summary

The U.S. Supreme Court is set to hear arguments in a landmark case challenging President Donald Trump's sweeping global tariffs, which were implemented under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The tariffs, justified as responses to a trade deficit and emergency conditions, have drawn legal criticism for potentially violating the Constitution by allowing the president to impose taxes without congressional authorization. Over 200 Democrats and one Republican, including Senator Lisa Murkowski, have filed a legal brief arguing that the IEEPA does not authorize tariff imposition. Businesses such as Learning Resources and Cooperative Coffees have faced significant financial and operational disruptions, with some paying millions in tariffs and altering manufacturing and supply chains. International actors, including Swiss chocolatier Chocolats Camille Bloch, are also affected by the tariffs, which have eroded profits and undermined export viability. The case raises a broader constitutional question about the limits of presidential power in trade policy. Three lower courts have already ruled against the administration, and the Supreme Court is expected to issue a decision by January 2025, with a possible deadline of June 2025. If the court rules against the tariffs, the government may be required to refund billions in collected revenue, and future administrations may face legal and procedural challenges in using emergency powers. The outcome could reshape U.S. trade policy, international agreements, and business confidence in the stability of trade regulations.

### Key Takeaways
  - The Trump administration is facing a legal challenge from small businesses and several U.S. states over its use of the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose sweeping global tariffs.
  - The tariffs, which include rates ranging from 10% to 50% on goods from nearly every country, were justified under claims of a trade deficit and emergency conditions, but opponents argue the law does not authorize tariffs and that such actions violate constitutional boundaries.
  - Legal analysts and business leaders believe the case raises a critical constitutional question: how far does presidential power extend in trade policy, especially without congressional authorization?
  - More than 200 Democrats and one Republican (Senator Lisa Murkowski) have filed a legal brief arguing that the emergency powers under IEEPA do not permit the president to impose tariffs as a trade leverage tool.
  - Three lower courts have previously ruled against the administration, increasing the likelihood that the Supreme Court may overturn the tariffs.
  - The potential for financial losses is significant—companies like Learning Resources and Cooperative Coffees have already paid millions in tariffs, with some facing disruptions to supply chains and profitability.
  - If the Supreme Court rules against the tariffs, the U.S. government may be required to refund billions of dollars in collected taxes, impacting federal revenue and forcing businesses to recoup costs.
  - Even if tariffs are upheld, the precedent could allow future administrations to use emergency powers to impose tariffs with minimal process, undermining stability in trade negotiations.
  - The case has already disrupted international trade agreements, such as the U.S.-EU deal, which may be delayed or stalled pending the court’s decision.

### Summary

NATO, under the leadership of Admiral Giuseppe Cavo Dragone, reaffirms its unwavering commitment to supporting Ukraine until a lasting peace is achieved, emphasizing that the war has become a strategic failure for Russia. Despite limited battlefield gains, Russia has failed to create a puppet government, and NATO members, including Finland and Sweden, have joined the alliance. The alliance is strengthening its air defences in response to frequent Russian drone incursions into Poland and Romania, with a new 'drone wall' initiative — Eastern Sentry — being developed and expected to be operational within months. While NATO acknowledges the threat to the Baltic states, it maintains that Article 5 will be invoked if an attack occurs, and that it is not threatened by Russia’s nuclear weapons like Burevestnik or Poseidon. The alliance also highlights that its collective defence spending is being increased to 5% of GDP by 2035, reflecting a broader strategic shift toward self-reliance and deterrence, even amid growing opposition from some member states such as Slovakia and Hungary.

Public sentiment is sharply divided, with neighborhoods such as Flushing and Park Slope reflecting deeper ideological and generational divides.

## Food Stamp Cuts Expose Trump’s Strategy to Use Shutdown to Advance Agenda - <small>`nytimes`</small>

### Summary

The federal government's prolonged shutdown, spanning five weeks and extending into November 2025, exposed a core political strategy under the Trump administration: using fiscal inaction to advance ideological goals by selectively preserving military and law enforcement spending while cutting or withholding funds from essential social programs like SNAP, Head Start, and LIHEAP. Despite having billions in available funds, the administration delayed or refused to allocate money for food assistance, citing legal and political justifications. Federal courts ultimately ruled that the administration had acted unlawfully, ordering emergency funds to be used to sustain SNAP benefits. The situation underscores a broader pattern of executive overreach in budgeting, where vulnerable populations are disproportionately affected, and where political priorities—such as military spending and tax cuts—take precedence over public welfare. This strategy has sparked widespread criticism from Democrats, advocacy groups, and legal experts, raising concerns about the constitutionality of executive spending and the resilience of the nation’s social safety net during periods of gridlock.

### Key Takeaways
  - The Trump administration delayed or blocked funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), despite having billions in available funds, exposing a pattern of politically motivated budgeting that prioritizes military and law enforcement over vulnerable populations.
  - The White House attempted to redirect funds from non-essential programs — such as Head Start and Low Income Home Energy Assistance — to military and border operations, illustrating a broader fiscal ideology that targets anti-poverty initiatives.
  - Federal courts intervened, ruling that the administration's actions violated budgetary laws, and ordered the use of emergency funds to sustain SNAP benefits, highlighting legal challenges to executive overreach.
  - Vice President JD Vance and other officials claimed the shutdown was being managed responsibly, but the lack of support for low-income families contradicts claims of impartiality.
  - President Trump maintained that he would only release SNAP funds after a court ruling, reinforcing a narrative of selective relief and political leverage over public welfare programs.
  - The administration’s refusal to use tariff revenue or emergency reserves for SNAP, despite prior use in similar programs, indicates inconsistent application of emergency funding rules and potential legal violations.

### Summary

Greg Goode, a Republican state senator from Indiana, is undecided about supporting a redistricting plan that would shift Indiana’s congressional map to favor Republicans.

The debate is part of a national trend where states are redrawing maps outside the decennial cycle, with Indiana’s situation now under pressure from Governor Mike Braun’s call for a special legislative session.

### Summary

The U.S. attorney’s office in Washington has become a central battleground of political retaliation since Donald Trump returned to office. Under a series of politically appointed leaders — including Ed Martin and Jeanine Pirro — the office has seen waves of dismissals, resignations, and politically driven prosecutions.

Investigations into political opponents like James Comey, Letitia James, George Soros, and Norm Eisen have intensified, while the office's core missions in fraud, public corruption, and public safety have been compromised. Judicial bodies, including Magistrate Judge Zia M. Faruqui, have criticized the office for overuse of grand juries and pretrial detentions, and public backlash has grown.

## Inside NASA’s scramble to find a backup moon plan — and the wild ideas companies are pitching - <small>`cnn`</small>

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/science/nasa-moon-lunar-lander-options)

- <small>tags: `NASA, Artemis III, SpaceX, Starship, Blue Origin, lunar lander, moon mission, space competition, China, commercial space, human spaceflight, lunar base, technology development, space race`</small>

### Summary

NASA is under pressure to accelerate its Artemis III moon landing mission due to delays in SpaceX’s Starship development and rising competition from China. While Starship remains the official lunar lander in the plan, its unproven orbital capabilities and technical challenges — including the need for untested cryogenic refueling — have prompted NASA to consider alternative approaches. Companies like Blue Origin and Lockheed Martin are proposing faster, lower-risk designs using existing hardware, such as Orion spacecraft components. Blue Origin plans to combine its Mark 1 and Mark 2 lander designs with boost stages, while Lockheed Martin aims to build a two-stage lander using spare parts from Orion, avoiding risky in-orbit refueling. Experts warn that developing a new lander could take years and be extremely costly, and that NASA might be overestimating urgency in a race against China. The article ultimately questions whether the goal should be landing astronauts or building a sustainable lunar base — suggesting that long-term infrastructure, not speed, is the true objective of space exploration.

### Key Takeaways
  - NASA is reconsidering its lunar lander strategy after delays in SpaceX’s Starship development, prompting a broader industry-wide push for alternative designs.
  - The moon’s south pole is being prioritized due to the presence of water ice and abundant sunlight, which supports long-term lunar missions and strategic claims.
  - Starship faces significant technical hurdles, including untested cryogenic refueling and lack of orbital flight capability, raising doubts about its readiness by 2027.
  - Blue Origin is proposing a hybrid lander design using modified Mark 1 and Mark 2 vehicles, reducing reliance on complex refueling and enabling faster development.
  - Lockheed Martin is proposing a two-stage lunar lander using spare parts from the Orion spacecraft, leveraging existing hardware to minimize development time and avoid cryogenic refueling risks.
  - Industry experts caution that developing a new lander could take at least five years and may be too expensive and time-consuming — a potential 'red herring' that delays the core Artemis goals.
  - A key debate exists over whether NASA should prioritize landing astronauts on the moon or focus on establishing a permanent lunar base, with experts arguing sustainability over speed is more critical.
  - SpaceX emphasizes that Starship is essential for long-term lunar exploration and Mars missions, not just a symbolic landing, due to its massive cargo capacity and reusability.
  - NASA’s limited budget and past historical costs (e.g., Apollo-era lander at ~$30 billion adjusted) suggest that any new lunar lander program would be extremely costly and potentially unaffordable.
  - The political narrative of a 'space race' with China may drive urgency, but experts argue that the real goal should be sustainable infrastructure, not just first footsteps.

### Summary

In October 2025, mosquitoes were first detected in Iceland, ending its status as one of the world’s few mosquito-free regions. The species identified is Culiseta annulata, a cold-adapted mosquito native to the Palearctic region. The discovery, reported by insect enthusiast Bjorn Hjaltason and confirmed by the Natural Science Institute of Iceland, is likely due to climate change-driven warming, which has accelerated glacial melting and created more stagnant water habitats. While this species does not carry diseases, its presence signals a broader global trend where warming temperatures allow mosquitoes—particularly disease-carrying species—to expand into previously inhospitable areas. This shift poses a growing public health threat, as warmer climates enable diseases like dengue, chikungunya, and West Nile virus to spread into new regions. Experts, including entomologist Luke Tilley and medical microbiologist Yaw Afrane, emphasize that mosquitoes serve as key indicators of climate change. Historical sightings, such as one in the 1980s in Greenland, provide context, and recent detections in the UK underscore the increasing global risk. The event highlights both ecological and health implications, calling for improved monitoring and preparedness to prevent local transmission of mosquito-borne illnesses.

### Summary

As the U.S. government shutdown nears its one-month mark, millions of low-income families across the country are facing dire consequences due to the suspension of critical federal aid programs. The loss of SNAP benefits means families like the Kings in Cincinnati are forced to rely on canned and boxed foods, with some members like Annemarie feeling guilt for eating meals while children go hungry. Head Start programs, such as the one in Hillsboro, Ohio, are closing or furloughing staff, forcing parents like Lauren Lowe to quit jobs and risking child development. In rural areas like Oregon and Minnesota, the suspension of LIHEAP funding puts lives at risk as households face extreme cold without heat subsidies.

### Summary

An avalanche in Italy's Dolomite mountains, specifically on Cima Vertana in the Ortler Alps, killed five German climbers, including a 17-year-old girl and her father. The incident occurred at approximately 16:00 on Saturday when a fast-moving snow avalanche swept away three climbers, who died immediately. The bodies of the father and daughter were recovered on Sunday after a complex rescue operation involving helicopter airlifts and avalanche dog units. Rescue efforts were initially hampered by fog and low visibility, but conditions improved, allowing ground-based operations. Experts, including Olaf Reinstadler from the Sulden Mountain Rescue Service, suggest that recent snow drifts failing to bond with ice beneath may have triggered the avalanche. The event raises concerns about late afternoon climbing in alpine regions, even under favorable weather conditions, and highlights the risks associated with alpine tourism, especially when climbers are engaged in high-risk activities in vulnerable terrain.

## What Women Really Want: Work Boundaries - <small>`nytimes`</small>

- [source](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/02/opinion/women-work-force-flexibility-shifts.html)
- _Published: 2025-11-02 01:32:01-04:00_
- **Society & Culture**
- <small>tags: `work-life balance, gender equality, women in the workforce, work boundaries, flexible work, health care labor market, economic behavior, maternal responsibilities, workplace policy, gender wage gap`</small>

### Summary

The article argues that women, especially mothers, do not need remote work or flexible schedules but instead need clear work boundaries where work ends at a defined time. Drawing on a 2017 study by economists Alexandre Mas and Amanda Pallais, it shows that workers — including women — are willing to sacrifice significant income to avoid unpredictable, employer-discretion jobs. The article highlights the economic and social costs of 'greedy work,' where companies incentivize longer hours due to convex returns to hours, especially in team-based roles. It contrasts this with the success of rigid, predictable schedules in health care, such as nursing and obstetrics, where women thrive despite earlier assumptions about infeasibility. The piece concludes that companies can adopt work models with firm stop times, remote work after hours, and rotating on-call shifts to support work-life balance, improve retention, and allow personal planning — especially for women managing caregiving responsibilities.

### Key Takeaways
  - Women, especially mothers, do not need remote work or flexible schedules; they need clear work boundaries where work ends at a set time.
  - A 2017 study by Alexandre Mas and Amanda Pallais found that working mothers would give up 40% of their income to avoid employer discretion jobs, where bosses set hours at will.
  - The 'greedy work' pattern in high-income jobs creates incentives for companies to extend hours due to convex returns to hours.
  - Women still bear the majority of household and child care responsibilities, increasing work-life conflict.
  - Health care professions — especially nursing and obstetrics — demonstrate that rigid, predictable schedules support work-life balance and retention.
  - In obstetrics, women’s entry into the field increased from 7% in 1970 to over 60% today, despite initial assumptions that such a job required constant on-call availability.
  - Clear work boundaries allow people to plan personal lives, reduce childcare stress, and save money, especially in high-cost environments.
  - Companies can adopt predictable schedules with hard work stops, allow remote work after hours, and use rotating on-call shifts to maintain team culture without disrupting personal time.
