Dozens of pro-Palestinian protesters were taken into custody by the New York Police Department at Columbia University's Butler Library on Wednesday after a demonstration in the main library area caused substantial chaos and disrupted campus safety. The incident comes amid increased pressure from the Trump administration on universities to comply with their policy demands, including threatening to cancel grants and contracts, and revoke international student visas. Columbia University officials asked the NYPD to assist in securing the library due to the protesters' actions, which included violence and vandalism.

### Summary

This week's clashes between India and Pakistan, the most serious escalation in decades, have both nations claiming victory, despite ongoing tensions. India launched targeted military strikes on Pakistan, leading to Pakistan claiming it shot down its rival's fighter jets and launching its own attacks. Indian media praised their response, while Pakistani officials declared triumph for their apparent air raid. Analysts and military experts predict that the situation remains fluid and tense, with both sides potentially escalating further. Key analysts, including Michael Kugelman, believe that without a de-escalation or diplomatic intervention, the conflict could lead to a broader war. The US, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates have been mentioned as potential mediators, but the complex ties between these countries and both nations complicate this role. The conflict, which began after a terrorist attack in Indian-administered Kashmir, poses a significant risk due to prior conflicts over Kashmir and each nation's powerful military capabilities.

### Key Takeaways
  - There are claims of victory from both sides following the recent clashes between India and Pakistan.
  - The fear is that each side's next move could lead to an all-out conflict.

### Summary

On April 28, 2025, a significant communication and radar outage at Newark Liberty International Airport's Newark Approach Control facility caused air traffic controllers in Philadelphia to guide planes around Newark's airspace, highlighting the deteriorating technology of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). This incident is part of a long-standing pattern of FAA equipment issues, which have been criticized by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), which assessed 138 FAA systems and found 51 unsustainable and 54 potentially unsustainable systems. The FAA, under the Biden administration, is reportedly working on upgrading the system, including adding three new high-bandwidth telecommunications connections and replacing copper wiring with fiberoptic technology. Additionally, staffing is being increased, and training is being enhanced. Despite these efforts, the FAA has faced challenges like a fire set to sabotage the FAA Chicago En Route Center in 2014, resulting in significant delays and shutdowns. The issue of outdated technology is also highlighted, with some advocating for the transition to newer, more reliable systems like Starlink. The problem at Newark Airport is also linked to the FAA’s decision to move approach controllers from Long Island to Philadelphia, which has exacerbated staffing issues and contributed to previous delays and shutdowns. The article underscores the ongoing need for modernization and improvements in FAA's air traffic control infrastructure to ensure the safety and efficiency of the national airspace system.

- _Published: 2025-05-08 20:06:00-20:06_

### Summary

CNN's Stephen Collinson has written an analysis suggesting that the Trump administration is not leading an emergency effort to ease the crisis between India and Pakistan. The article states that the latest fighting, beyond Kashmir, may test the administration's ability to convene international diplomacy and reflects on the limited involvement of the current administration in global crises. Collinson points out that the Trump administration is less inclined to play a traditional global leadership role and that its response to the crisis has been passive. The article also mentions the impact of Trump's close relationship with Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India and the shift in U.S.-Pakistan relations since the end of the war on terror. The piece discusses the potential for international efforts to end the crisis, with Qatari mediation being one possible avenue, but also notes that without further escalation, such efforts are unlikely to be led by the United States.

### Summary

A federal judge in Minnesota ordered the release of an international student, Mohammed Hoque, who was detained by the Department of Homeland Security for expressing support for Palestinian human rights. The student, a Bangladeshi national who entered the United States on a valid F-1 visa in 2021, was arrested outside his home in March 2021 after class. The judge found that the Trump administration failed to show it was not targeting Hoque for his political speech. Hoque's case is part of a larger trend of recent student visa cancellations and revocations of statuses from SEVIS, affecting thousands of students across the United States. The judge criticized the government for changing charges against Hoque and said the lack of clarity supported his claims of being targeted for his speech, not any illegal activity. The case will now move forward along with the immigration proceedings that the Department of Homeland Security has started against Hoque.

To make a decision, Boasberg is asking the Trump administration to provide evidence by May 7th, and then the migrants' lawyers will have the opportunity to request any additional discovery to support their case. The issue is particularly relevant as it involves the Alien Enemies Act, a wartime authority that Trump used to deport the migrants. Boasberg's investigation aims to clarify the legal status of these migrants, who are seeking to be returned to the US to challenge the administration's use of the act.

- _Published: 2025-05-07 18:51:00-04:00_

### Summary

The House Republican Party is experiencing intense internal conflicts over President Trump's proposed 'big beautiful bill', with tensions particularly high over the issue of Medicaid. Speaker Mike Johnson is pushing for a House vote before Memorial Day, but this has sparked sharp disagreements within the conference. Moderate Republicans, who are hesitant to cut social safety net benefits, are clashing with hardliners who want to slash spending, especially on Medicaid. The battle is complicated by the need to satisfy Trump's agenda while also addressing the party's fiscal goals, creating a complex and often contentious negotiation. Some Republicans, including those from swing districts, have expressed reluctance to cut Medicaid, while others have demanded trillions in spending cuts that many centrists are unwilling to support. The tensions extend to the Senate, where some Republicans are concerned about the potential for larger spending cuts, potentially undermining the bill's chances of passing both chambers of Congress.

## As House Republicans Eye Budget Cuts, Medicaid and CHIP Programs Face Uncertainty

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/07/politics/enrollment-medicaid-republican-representatives-dg)
- _Published: 2025-05-07 18:45:00-20:00_

### Summary

A major budget package proposed by House Republicans could see billions shaved from programs like Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), which support millions of vulnerable Americans. Most US adults oppose such cuts, as indicated by recent KFF poll results. The Medicaid program is especially critical for individuals, including children, senior citizens, people with disabilities, and adults without dependents. More than 60 House Republicans represent districts with higher-than-average Medicaid enrollment, making them more likely to face pressure to oppose the cuts. Senate Republicans, including Lisa Murkowski and Bill Cassidy, also support Medicaid access. However, Republican senators like Josh Hawley are skeptical of significant cuts that would affect vulnerable populations, and some have already opposed budget cuts to Medicaid. The impact of these budget cuts will depend on the relative strength of Republican districts in terms of Medicaid enrollment, with districts that heavily rely on Medicaid facing greater political pressure.

Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man, died on January 10, 2023, after being brutally beaten by five officers during a routine stop.

### Summary

A federal judge ruled that deporting migrants to Libya or Saudi Arabia would violate his previous order if they were not provided with written notice and an opportunity to contest beforehand. Immigrant advocacy groups filed an emergency motion to block the removal of migrants to Libya. The Trump administration had previously communicated with Libya to have the country take migrants from the U.S. However, the State Department and Libyan officials denied any agreements about deportations. The decision to send migrants to Libya, where the UN has previously criticized harsh treatment, escalates the Trump administration's deportation policies, which have faced backlash. The State Department declined to comment on the deportation plans, stating they do not discuss the details of their diplomatic communications with other governments.

### Summary

Despite the economic challenges, the Fed highlighted a robust labor market that could continue to support economic growth.

Jerome Powell emphasized that the labor market remained resilient, and the Fed would wait for further data to make any policy decisions regarding borrowing costs.

## Privacy concerns swirl around HHS plan to build Medicare, Medicaid database on autism

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/07/health/autism-database-hhs-medicare-medicaid-privacy)
- _Published: 2025-05-07 15:02:00-20:00_

### Summary

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) unveiled a pilot program to build a database on Medicare and Medicaid data to search for autism causes by September, sparking privacy concerns and legal challenges. The proposed database, aimed at understanding the scope and burden of autism, includes insurance claims, medical records, and data from wearable technology. This initiative has led to swift rebukes from advocacy groups and doctors who raised red flags about privacy and the lack of community input. The pilot program will initially focus on autism spectrum disorder and will establish a secure data exchange mechanism. However, experts and autism advocates have questioned the timeline and the potential misuse of the data, leading to widespread fear and hesitation among the autism community. The HHS has defended the initiative, emphasizing its intention to advance science, improve care, and support families. Despite HHS's assurances, there are still concerns about the privacy of personal identifiers and the potential for misuse of the data, which could lead to chilling effects on medical care and the fear of providers. The HHS has also faced criticism from other autism advocates for the way Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has spoken about the condition, including his comments about the need for financial burden and the potential for discrimination. The lack of clarity around the use of data and patient consent has exacerbated these concerns, leading to a 'flood' of concerned calls and texts from the autism community.

## Ford will raise the sticker price on cars imported from Mexico. It just said it didn’t expect significant US price hikes

- _Published: 2025-05-07 20:54:00-04:00_

### Summary

Ford has announced an increase in the sticker prices of its three US models imported from Mexico, with the prices rising by up to $2,000 per vehicle. This price hike was made just days after Ford executives indicated they didn't expect significant price increases in the industry. The company attributed the price increase to a combination of tariff costs and their usual mid-year pricing actions. Ford's increased prices start applying to vehicles built after May 2, which will begin arriving at dealerships in several weeks. The announced tariff on imported vehicles and parts, combined with Ford's usual pricing strategies, led to this price hike. Despite the price increase, Ford CFO Sherry House stated they expected the overall industry car prices to increase by about 1% to 1.5% in the second half of the year, attributing this to the tariff costs that Ford estimated to be about $1.5 billion through the rest of the year. This price increase affects models like the Ford Mustang Mach-E, Maverick, and Bronco Sport, which together make up about 17% of Ford's first quarter US sales.

## Will hurricane season start early this year? Recent trends suggest yes

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/07/weather/hurricane-season-early-start)
- _Published: 2025-05-07 14:39:00-20:39_

### Summary

Recent trends suggest that the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season may start early, contrary to the traditional calendar of June 1 through November 30. Forecasting models have indicated potential for storm development, especially in the western Caribbean, where conditions are more favorable. In the past seven years, at least one named storm has formed before June 1, with only three years having early storms from 2005 to 2014. The National Hurricane Center has started issuing tropical weather outlooks two weeks earlier, beginning May 15, to account for this possibility. Early storms can occur due to warm waters in the Atlantic, Caribbean, or Gulf basins, which absorb 90% of the world's surplus heat and provide energy for tropical systems. The article notes that this early start to the season does not necessarily mean more storms, but it could be a busy one with an above-average 17 named storms predicted. Climate change and warming oceans contribute to the possibility of an early start, as they can warm the waters, making them more conducive for storm formation. This year's early storm activity is influenced by El Niño and La Niña, which can impact the frequency and intensity of storms in both the Atlantic and Pacific basins.

### Key Takeaways
  - There is a possibility that the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season may start early.
  - Early storms in the season could be due to unusually warm waters in the Atlantic, Caribbean, or Gulf basins.
  - A head start in the season does not necessarily mean there will be more storms overall.

- _Published: 2025-05-07 13:10:00-20:10_

### Summary

A federal appeals court has ruled that the Trump administration must transfer Tufts University student Rümeysa Öztürk from an immigration detention center in Louisiana back to Vermont, where she will attend a bail hearing to determine the legality of her detention. The court's decision was made in response to the government's efforts to detain and deport Öztürk, who was accused of writing an op-ed criticizing Tufts' response to a student government's call for the university to divest from companies with ties to Israel during the Gaza conflict. The court found the government's appeal lacking in evidence and the Vermont court the proper venue for hearing Öztürk's First Amendment claims. The court also noted the government's failure to show potential harm from transferring Öztürk and emphasized the importance of her participation in her legal proceedings. This decision marks a significant victory for Öztürk's legal team and highlights ongoing issues of political targeting in immigration detentions.

## Apple looks to add AI search to Safari in potential blow for Google

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/07/tech/apple-ai-search-safari-potential-blow-for-google)
- _Published: 2025-05-07 13:04:00.000Z_

### Summary

Apple is reportedly considering reshaping Safari, its web browser, to include AI-powered search engines, a move that could challenge Google's dominant position in the search market. This potential change is reported to have been mentioned by Apple's executive Eddy Cue during a testimony in a U.S. Justice Department antitrust case against Alphabet (Google's parent company). The information suggests that searches on Safari may have fallen, likely due to users preferring AI-powered alternatives. This move is seen as a significant blow to Google's revenues and could increase pressure on the company, especially as it faces competition from AI startups like OpenAI and Perplexity. Apple already has a deal with OpenAI to offer ChatGPT in Siri, while it is seeking to include Google's Gemini AI technology in its latest devices. If Apple adds AI providers to its search options, it could alter the landscape of search engines, potentially leading to a shift in ad spending from Google to other search providers.

## GOP candidate drops closely watched challenge in North Carolina Supreme Court election

- _Published: 2025-05-07 12:59:00-20:59_

### Summary

Republican North Carolina judge Jefferson Griffin has dropped his challenge to the results of the Supreme Court race, certifying Justice Allison Riggs' victory and dismissing his claims of clerical errors and other technicalities leading to his loss. The challenge was significant as it highlighted potential issues with election processes and the possibility of disenfranchising voters, with Griffin seeking to challenge a much broader pool of ballots. A federal judge ruled against his challenge, emphasizing the importance of upholding constitutional due process in elections. The state supreme court's rulings, which were challenged by Griffin, included requiring overseas voters who had not provided photo ID to do so, and disqualifying ballots cast by overseas voters who had marked on a form. Despite these rulings, Griffin's challenge was ultimately dropped, with the state election board now issuing a certificate of election to Riggs on Tuesday. Republican-leaning courts sided with Griffin on some of his arguments, while a federal judge ruled against him, upholding the will of the voters and preventing the potential disenfranchisement of thousands of overseas voters.

## Did South Korea’s legendary female free divers evolve for a life underwater? Scientists find new evidence

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/07/science/haenyeo-south-korea-divers-evolution)
- _Published: 2025-05-07 08:49:00+00:00_

### Summary

Scientists from the University of Utah, along with colleagues in South Korea, Denmark, and the United States, have discovered unique genetic adaptations in Haenyeo, a matrilineal community of women free divers in Jeju Island, South Korea. These women dive year-round to collect seafood, diving as much as 60 feet without any breathing equipment. The genetic research found that Haenyeo have a genetic variation linked to lower blood pressure, which may be advantageous for their diving activities, especially during pregnancy. The study also revealed that Haenyeo have a slower heart rate than non-divers during the tests, indicating potential training for diving. Although the Haenyeo's genetic adaptations contribute to their diving abilities, they also have a slower heart rate, a factor that helps them conserve oxygen during a dive. The genetic variant associated with lower blood pressure could potentially lead to new drug development, underscoring the potential medical importance of this adaptation. The research highlights the importance of studying free diving communities, as such studies are rare in industrialized populations. The Haenyeo are celebrated for their exceptional diving prowess, with the discovery of these unique genetic adaptations adding to their already extraordinary reputation.

### Summary

The US President Donald Trump's top trade officials are set to meet with their Chinese counterparts in Geneva, Switzerland to de-escalate their ongoing trade war. This marks the first in-person meeting between the two countries' officials since the tariff escalation began in earnest in March. While a trade deal is not expected, the talks aim to establish conditions for one. The trade war has already caused significant damage to both economies, with the number of cargo ships from China to the US dropping by 60% in April, leading to shortages and price hikes. Despite tensions, both countries have signaled willingness to dialogue, but major concessions are needed for negotiations to begin. The future of the global economy is heavily reliant on the success of these talks, as high tariffs imposed by both countries have led to a near-halt in trade.

## Just the way it is.” Trump says Canada’s prime minister can do nothing to reduce tariffs today

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/06/business/trump-carney-tariffs)
- _Published: 2025-05-06 10:26:00-20:26_

### Summary

President Donald Trump, during his first meeting with new Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, stated that there is no change to tariffs on Canadian goods, insisting they will remain at 25%. Trump expressed dissatisfaction with Canada's perceived unfair subsidies to the U.S., citing an unsubstantiated claim of $200 billion of annual US subsidies to Canada. In contrast, Canada, being the top buyer of American goods, acknowledged the mutual benefits of trading, including sourcing raw materials and produce not available domestically. Despite the current trade imbalance, the two countries have found mutual advantages. However, Trump suggested that a deal to integrate Canada into the U.S. is unlikely to be achieved immediately, emphasizing a longer negotiation process. Meanwhile, Carney stressed that Canada is not for sale and encouraged negotiations to lower tariffs, acknowledging that discussions would need time and further discussions to reach an agreement.

### Key Takeaways

## Two more judges block the Trump administration’s use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport migrants

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/06/politics/judge-blocks-trump-administration-deport-migrants)
- _Published: 2025-05-06 19:00:00-20:00_

### Summary

Two more federal judges, Alvin Hellerstein and Charlotte Sweeney, have blocked the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act for deporting migrants, arguing that the wartime power should not be used due to lack of constitutional protections. Both judges found that the act violates due process rights and that the administration lacks evidence of an invasion or hostile foreign power requiring such use. The Alien Enemies Act has been invoked to deport Venezuelan migrants, including those from the Southern District of New York, and was also used by Trump to quickly deport migrants in Colorado. Hellerstein's decision is part of a broader trend of judicial reviews against the Trump administration's fast-moving deportation policies.

### Key Takeaways
  - Two more federal judges have blocked the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport migrants.
  - The Alien Enemies Act, giving detainees little due process, is found unconstitutional by at least two federal judges.

  - Hellerstein's and Sweeney's decisions add to court decisions that have curtailed the Trump administration's fast-moving deportation approach toward immigrants.

- **Donald Trump**

## The foods you pack in your kids’ lunch boxes may make an impact on whether they experience their first menstrual cycle too early, according to new research.

- _Published: 2025-05-06 20:50:00-20:50_

### Summary

A new study published in the Human Reproduction journal suggests that a more inflammatory diet can increase a child's likelihood of experiencing their first menstrual cycle earlier than usual, potentially leading to chronic health issues later in life. Researchers from the Fred Hutch Cancer Center analyzed data from more than 7,500 children ages 9 to 14 enrolled in the Growing Up Today Study (GUTS), a longitudinal study spanning from 1996 to 2008. The study found that eating a healthier diet was associated with an 8% reduced risk of early menstruation, while an inflammatory diet was linked to a 15% greater chance of it occurring within a month. The authors noted that this finding is not solely related to weight gain but also to other factors related to unhealthy eating patterns. The study recommends that all children and adolescents have access to healthy meal options, emphasizing the importance of school-based meals aligning with evidence-based guidelines. Dr. Natalie Muth, a pediatrician and registered dietitian, adds that changing eating habits can be challenging, but small steps towards healthier options are beneficial. Additional resources for parents seeking safer personal care products are provided, such as databases like SkinSafeProducts.com and the Environmental Working Group's Skin Deep database.

## Divided Supreme Court allows Trump administration to begin enforcing ban on transgender service members

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/06/politics/supreme-court-ban-transgender-service-members)
- _Published: 2025-05-06 17:37:00-04:00_

### Summary

The Supreme Court decided on Tuesday that the Trump administration can begin enforcing a ban on transgender service members in the military. The ban prohibits service members who have a current diagnosis or history of, or exhibit symptoms consistent with gender dysphoria from being processed for separation from military service, and also prohibits transgender individuals from joining any branch of the military. The ruling came after the administration argued that continuing to permit trans individuals to serve would negatively affect military readiness, cohesion, order, and discipline. However, federal judges reviewing legal challenges to the policy concluded that it violated the constitutional rights of transgender Americans. The Supreme Court decision was a major victory for President Donald Trump as it allowed the administration to proceed with the ban, despite a previous similar ban being reversed by President Joe Biden. The decision is pending a legal challenge in the US DC Circuit Court of Appeals, which is considering whether to let a preliminary injunction issued by US District Judge Ana Reyes take effect for now. The LGBTQ rights groups Lambda Legal and the Human Rights Campaign Foundation expressed disappointment with the Supreme Court's decision and warned that the loss of well-qualified service members will negatively impact military readiness, lethality, and unit cohesion.

### Key Takeaways
  - The Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to begin enforcing a ban on transgender service members in the military.
  - The decision was a major victory for President Donald Trump in his efforts to implement his second-term agenda.

## T. rex ancestors crossed from Asia to North America via land bridge 70 million years ago, study finds

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/06/science/t-rex-ancestors-asia-study-scli-intl)
- _Published: 2025-05-06 19:36:00-20:36_

### Summary

A new study led by Cassius Morrison, a doctoral student at University College London (UCL), suggests that the direct ancestor of Tyrannosaurus rex crossed the Bering Strait land bridge from Asia to North America around 70 million years ago. Using mathematical modeling and incorporating data from the fossil record, Morrison and his team concluded that tyrannosaurids, the dinosaur species closely related to T. rex, likely traveled across this land bridge. The finding tracks with previous research that indicated T. rex was more closely related to large carnivores in Asia rather than those in North America. The study also proposes that the rapid growth in body size of tyrannosaurids, including T. rex, during colder climates, possibly due to feather insulation or being more warm-blooded, contributed to their evolution into the largest of the meat-eating dinosaurs. The research was published in the journal Royal Society Open Science, providing a new perspective on the evolution and growth of these iconic creatures.

## Trump says US to stop strikes on Houthis in Yemen

### Summary

President Donald Trump announced on May 6, 2025, that the United States would cease its bombing campaign against the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, in response to the group's statement that they would no longer be attacking shipping lanes or Israel. This ceasefire is seen as a potential turning point, as it could pave the way for broader negotiations with Iran, including the ongoing nuclear talks between the US and Iran. The move comes after months of US military operations against the Houthi rebels, which have been challenging the US's ability to advance its operations. However, the ceasefire has faced opposition from Israel, which has escalated its airstrikes against the Houthi rebels. The Houthi leaders expressed their commitment to continuing their offensive against Israel, as well as their stance against the US's actions in Gaza. The ceasefire has also implications for the broader geopolitical tensions between the US, Iran, and Israel, as it could impact the ongoing negotiations over a nuclear deal.

  - US announces a ceasefire with the Houthi rebels in Yemen, ending a seven-week military campaign launched in March in response to their attacks on shipping lanes and Israel.

  - The move is unexpected, coming just hours after Israel carried out significant airstrikes in Yemen.

## Trump’s Oval Office meeting with Carney didn’t reach Zelensky-level tension. But it wasn’t all neighborliness

- _Published: 2025-05-06 17:53:00-20:53_

### Summary

The meeting between President Donald Trump and his new Canadian counterpart Mark Carney on a midday in the Oval Office did not reach the controversial level of tension seen in his meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Instead, it fell somewhere in between. The 95% of the meeting dominated by Trump's comments ranged from the Middle East, Barack Obama's presidential library, to the state of high-speed rail in California. The main issue discussed was Trump's ambition to make Canada the 51st US state, which Carney pushed back on. Carney stated Canada would not be annexed by its southern neighbor, essentially accomplishing what he came to Washington to do. Despite the issues, the meeting did not fall off the rails, and relations between Washington and Ottawa remained at their lowest point in memory, as Trump declared Canada was overly dependent on the United States on Truth Social, but seemed uninterested in a public fight during the Oval Office meeting. Trump later acknowledged that he had seen worse in terms of public fights in the Oval Office, referring to his fight with Zelensky as a much different situation.

### Key Takeaways
  - The meeting between President Donald Trump and his new Canadian counterpart Mark Carney was described as neither openly hostile nor outwardly chummy, but rather in the middle.
  - The meeting, held on a midday in the Oval Office, illustrated a new dynamic between the once-friendly nations with a 5,525-mile border.

  - The main issue discussed was Trump’s ambition to make Canada the 51st US state, which Carney pushed back on, stating Canada was not for sale.

  - Despite the issues, the meeting did not fall off the rails and relations remained at their lowest point in memory between Washington and Ottawa.

### Summary

A federal appeals court in New York ordered the Trump administration to transfer Rümeysa Öztürk, a Tufts University doctoral student, from a federal facility in Louisiana to a federal facility in Vermont. The court found that Vermont is the proper venue for adjudicating Öztürk's habeas petition due to her physical presence there.

## Economists warn Trump's research cuts could have dire consequences for GDP

- [source](https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5383918)
- _Published: 2025-05-08 05:00:00.000Z_

### Summary

Economists have warned that President Trump's proposed budget cuts for scientific research could have severe long-term effects on the U.S. economy. The budget, which includes substantial cuts to NASA's Science Mission Directorate and other federal agencies that fund scientific research, could lead to the shutdown of active spacecraft and have broader economic consequences. According to Andrew Fieldhouse, an economist at Texas A&M University, government R&D investments are linked to about 20 to 25 percent of U.S. private-sector productivity growth since World War II. However, economists such as Vasudeva Ramaswamy from American University argue that the private sector cannot replace the government's role in funding fundamental research. The cuts, if implemented, could potentially reduce the U.S. Gross Domestic Product by 4% as compared to the size of the contraction experienced during the Great Recession. Critics also argue that the cuts could lead to a shortfall in government revenue in the future due to a smaller economy.

## On a chilly March morning, Jason Storms stood on a patch of lawn across from a women's health clinic in Greenville, S.C. It's one of three clinics in that state that perform abortions. Dozens of other anti-abortion rights activists joined him, from Wisconsin, Florida and Mississippi. Storms had convened the group there for a conference to highlight what he felt to be the failures of the anti-abortion movement since Roe v. Wade was overturned. He said there should be no excuse for abortions still happening in a deep red, Bible Belt state like South Carolina. The abortion abolitionists are working on multiple fronts, including statehouses, grassroots pressure on state legislators, and local officials. They are pushing for hardline anti-abortion bills, criminalizing abortion and aiming to close the loophole that allows mothers to face legal immunity while doctors face felony charges. Despite the challenges, activists like Jason Storms believe that their approach could still succeed, as Republican legislators are more open to their policy prescriptions now that Roe v. Wade is no longer the law of the land. The article also highlights the broader cultural and religious imperative within this movement, which sees abortion as a threat to manhood, and aims to combat what they perceive as a crisis of masculinity. However, the article also notes that women are often absent from leadership roles and strategy sessions, and that the movement's messaging can be jarring to some women who once aligned with it.

### Summary

Republican-led states, including Arkansas and Florida, are implementing new restrictions on ballot measures to combat fraud, as seen in the passing of bills that require the full reading of ballot titles and the collection of signatures to show photo IDs. Opponents argue that these laws restrict voter rights and efforts to address issues not addressed by lawmakers. The Fairness Project, a group advocating for ballot measures, claims these laws are an attack on direct democracy and a broader failure in the relationship between representatives and voters.

## Cancer-causing chemicals are in many beauty products women use, a study finds

- [source](https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5389925)
- _Published: 2025-05-08 05:00:00-04:00_

### Summary

A study published by the journal Environmental Science & Technology Letters found that more than half of Black and Latina women in Los Angeles regularly use personal-care products containing a known carcinogen, formaldehyde and formaldehyde-releasing preservatives. Researchers collected data from 64 women over a week, photographing the ingredient lists of all the products they used, and found that 53% reported using products containing these chemicals. The study highlights the pressure women face to conform to white beauty standards, leading to the frequent use of harmful products. While the European Union banned formaldehyde as a cosmetic ingredient in 2009, the FDA has not acted on a proposal to ban it in hair straighteners. The research underscores the need for government oversight and regulation to ensure personal-care products are safe for all consumers, particularly those of color who are more frequently exposed to carcinogens in personal-care products.

- _Published: 2025-05-07 15:37:00-20:37_

### Summary

For two years, Stacey Wales kept a list of how she would address the killer of her brother, Christopher Pelkey, in court. When she finally wrote her victim impact statement, she turned to artificial intelligence to create a video of Pelkey addressing Horcasitas, the man who fatally shot him in 2021. Wales and her husband used several AI tools to digitally trim Pelkey's beard, insert his laugh, and use a photo of him looking straight to the camera.

The use of AI for this type of victim impact statement is believed to be novel, as it has never been done before in the U.S. court system.

- _Published: 2025-05-07 18:05:00-05:00_

### Summary

USDA Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins testified that the department is now actively recruiting to fill critical positions after agreeing to pay over 15,000 employees' salaries and benefits through September in exchange for their resignations. This move was part of a deferred resignation program initiated in late January and again in April to address the need for workforce reduction. However, the abrupt departure of employees and the urgent need to fill positions have raised questions, with some senators expressing concern over timing. Despite acknowledging some mistakes, Rollins emphasized that key positions were not filled during the second deferred resignation round. The information provided by employees and union representatives suggests that several hundred bargaining unit members in USDA's Plant Protection and Quarantine program could have accepted the deferred resignation offer in April, creating a discrepancy with USDA's statements.
