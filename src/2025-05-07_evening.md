## Ex-model takes the stand in Harvey Weinstein's retrial. The prior jury never heard about her

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/07/entertainment/ex-model-harvey-weinstein-retrial)
- _Published: 2025-05-07 18:01:00+00:00_

### Summary

The retrial of Harvey Weinstein has begun with the introduction of a key accuser, Kaja Sokola, who filed her complaint against Weinstein after the 2020 trial that resulted in his conviction. However, at that time, the jury was not informed about Sokola's claim. The current retrial is seen as a continuation of the #MeToo movement, as other accusers, including Miriam Haley and Jessica Mann, have also testified. Sokola claims that Weinstein forced oral sex on her in 2006 during a modeling trip, which she only came forward about years later. Weinstein's lawyers are questioning why she waited so long to come forward, while prosecutors argue that accusers were reluctant to speak up due to Weinstein's wealth and influence. This case highlights the controversy surrounding the Trump administration's impact on handling sexual misconduct allegations, as the #MeToo movement gained prominence in the entertainment industry during this period.

## Federal judge says Libya deportation flight could violate prior court order

- _Published: 2025-05-07 17:22:00-20:22_

### Summary

A federal judge, Judge Brian Murphy, ruled that deporting migrants to Libya would violate his previous order, as migrants would not be provided with written notice and an opportunity to contest the deportation. Immigrant advocacy groups filed an emergency motion to block the removal of migrants to Libya, but the Trump administration continues to move forward with plans to transport a group of undocumented immigrants to the country. The Department of Homeland Security is responsible for the administration's plans to deport migrants to Libya, making them a central figure in the ongoing controversy. The move to deport migrants to Libya is seen as a further escalation of the administration's deportation policies, which have faced political and legal backlash. The Libyan Ministry of Foreign Affairs has denied any agreement with US authorities regarding the deportation of migrants, while the State Department declined to comment on the deportation plans. Conversations about sending migrants to other African countries, such as Rwanda, continue, but there are no confirmed plans for flights to those countries right now. The potential use of US military flights to transport migrants to Libya has caused concern due to the country's ongoing civil conflict and harsh treatment of migrants.

## Washington, DC sees spike in homes for sale amid DOGE federal worker layoffs

- _Published: 2025-05-07 16:27:00-04:00_

### Summary

The number of Washington, D.C. homes for sale surged 25.1% year-over-year, the largest gain on record, according to a Redfin report. This spike in active listings was largely attributed to steep layoffs in the federal workforce, driven by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The uptick was observed in the city and surrounding suburbs, where federal workers live, with homes for sale surging in Alexandria, Virginia, Montgomery County, Maryland, and Loudoun County, Virginia. Despite the increase in listings, the article notes that the housing market remains tight, with the demand still outpacing the supply. The true number of federal workers laid off or targeted for layoffs is likely higher, as many have accepted 'buyout' offers that do not show up in federal unemployment data. As the housing crisis persists, more listings are needed to meet the current market demand.

## Attacks on Harvard by Trump administration have built for months.

### Summary

Since January 2023, President Donald Trump's administration has been aggressive in its efforts to address antisemitism at universities, particularly targeting Harvard University. In February 2023, a year after the Gaza war and protests on college campuses over the siege and Israel's retaliation, the then-president of Harvard University, Claudine Gay, was asked in a congressional hearing about the potential violation of Harvard’s rules against bullying and harassment if someone called for the genocide of Jews. This sparked widespread criticism and backlash, leading to her resignation. The Trump administration continued to issue executive orders and threats to withhold funding, making demands for changes in how universities handle antisemitism. Harvard, in response, launched a task force and strengthened its policies against antisemitism, but the administration continued its pressure. In April 2025, Harvard sued the Trump administration, claiming the demands violated the First Amendment and federal law. The controversy escalated with threats to revoke Harvard’s tax-exempt status, cut off federal research grants, and withdraw certification from the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, ultimately resulting in legal actions and internal reports by task forces at Harvard addressing the issues of antisemitism and discrimination.

## Cardinals fail to pick new pope on day one of the conclave

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/07/europe/conclave-vatican-day-one-no-pope-elected-intl)
- _Published: 2025-05-07 16:16:00-20:16_

### Summary

Black smoke billowed from the Sistine Chapel chimney on Wednesday, signaling the failure of the 133 voting cardinals to elect a new pope on the first day of the conclave. This conclave, a highly secretive process for electing a new pope, will continue with more voting rounds over the next three days. The process is in the midst of a debate between those who want to continue Pope Francis' reforms and those who advocate for a more traditional papacy. The conclave is also taking place amid ongoing clerical sexual abuse scandals within the Catholic Church, which many believe need to be addressed by deep reforms. With no formal list of papal candidates and much unpredictability due to the changes made by Pope Francis in appointing cardinals, the conclave is a critical event in the governance of the Roman Catholic Church. The next pope will be chosen by the end of the fifth day, or given a break for prayer and reflection if no new leader is selected by then.

### Key Takeaways
  - Cardinals failed to elect a new pope on the first day of the conclave.

- _Published: 2025-05-07 16:05:00-20:05_

### Summary

The Federal Reserve decided to maintain interest rates at a range of 4.25% to 4.5%, extending a holding pattern that began in January. The central bank warned of rising risks of stagflation, which involves both higher unemployment and inflation, in the face of President Donald Trump's trade policies. Jerome Powell, the Chair of the Federal Reserve, emphasized that despite signs of economic resilience in the labor market, the labor market is not putting upward pressure on prices. The Fed's stance on interest rates is based on the expectation that further data will guide their decision, with uncertainty about the impacts of the trade war. Powell highlighted the dual challenges of unemployment and inflation, noting that while the labor market remains resilient, consumer sentiment has deteriorated due to trade policy uncertainties. The Fed will consider unemployment and inflation rates, and will respond to economic conditions as they develop over time.

### Summary

The Trump administration has taken new steps to target federal funding to Harvard University, cutting off all new federal research grants unless the prestigious Ivy League institution enacts political policy changes. Education Secretary Linda McMahon issued a letter to Harvard University President Alan Garber, stating that the university has “consistent violations of its own legal duties” and has “failed to abide by its legal obligations, its ethical and fiduciary duties, its transparency responsibilities, and any semblance of academic rigor.” Harvard University has reacted strongly, denouncing the demands and stating it will continue to comply with the law and promote academic freedom. The administration also threatened to revoke Harvard's tax-exempt status and ban international students, though the administration is willing to negotiate if Harvard meets specific demands. This move has raised concerns about academic freedom and the role of federal funding in universities, with other institutions such as Columbia and Princeton also facing similar pressures from the Trump administration.

## Vance says Russia ‘asking for too much’ in concessions, while Trump says decisions ‘have to be made’ soon

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/07/politics/vance-russia-ukraine-talks)
- _Published: 2025-05-07 15:18:00-20:18_

### Summary

In a recent appearance at the Munich Leaders Meeting, Vice President JD Vance expressed concerns about Russia's demands for concessions to end the war in Ukraine, suggesting that the Russians are asking for too much. This stance comes as President Donald Trump remains frustrated with the lack of progress in negotiations, despite the administration's warning that there isn't indefinite tolerance for negotiations that do not progress. Vance called for Russia and Ukraine to sit down and talk directly to each other, emphasizing that the United States is willing to participate in these discussions. In contrast, the Trump administration's envoy to Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, said that the main impediment to progress in peace talks is President Putin's refusal to agree to a 30-day ceasefire. Kyiv has previously stated that it is willing to freeze the conflict along the current lines of contact as part of a potential ceasefire agreement. Despite this, Putin has proposed a three-day ceasefire around the anniversary of the end of World War II, which was rejected by Zelensky. JD Vance, however, reiterated that the United States and Europe are on the same team and that conversations about security should be conducted together. The article also mentions a previous fiery speech by JD Vance in Germany where he criticized European allies for turning away from shared values, such as free speech.

### Summary

The air traffic system at Newark Liberty International Airport experienced a catastrophic outage on April 28, 2025, described by an air traffic controller as the most dangerous situation a controller could face. This outage led to delays in over 1,000 flights and brought renewed scrutiny to the airport's outdated air traffic control system. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) responded by announcing immediate steps to improve the system's reliability, including the addition of three new high-bandwidth telecommunications connections and a backup system. The air traffic control system, which had previously used older technology such as floppy disks and copper wires, was found to be lacking in redundancy. Multiple controllers have taken trauma leave after the incident, indicating the psychological stress involved in the situation. The FAA also revealed that about 15 to 20 flights were being controlled by Newark Liberty approach controllers when communication and radar went down, highlighting the critical nature of the air traffic control system.

## Privacy concerns swirl around HHS plan to build Medicare, Medicaid database on autism

- _Published: 2025-05-07 15:02:00-04:00_

### Summary

The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has unveiled a pilot program allowing the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to access Medicare and Medicaid data to study autism. This initiative, led by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., aims to uncover the causes of autism by September. However, the project has sparked significant controversy due to privacy concerns, particularly from the autism community, which fears the misuse of personal health information. Advocates are concerned about the lack of transparency regarding how the data will be used and who will have access to it. The Autism Science Foundation and other organizations have reported receiving numerous calls, emails, and texts from concerned members of the autism community following initial statements from NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya. There are also reservations about the timeline, with some experts questioning whether a registry can effectively pinpoint autism causes within nine months. Critics argue that Kennedy's public statements about autism and people with disabilities have been contentious, raising concerns about the project's potential for political exploitation and the potential for data to be used to create fear among medical professionals and patients. Despite HHS's assurances about data privacy, the controversy persists as many in the autism community express fear about the potential misuse of their health information.

### Key Takeaways
  - HHS announced a pilot program for the National Institutes of Health to tap into Medicare and Medicaid data for research on autism. This initiative has raised concerns about privacy and data use.
  - The pilot program is intended to identify the causes of autism, but has sparked significant controversy among autism advocates, privacy experts, and the general public.

## Ford will raise the sticker price on cars imported from Mexico. It just said it didn’t expect significant US price hikes

- _Published: 2025-05-07 14:54:00.000Z_

### Summary

Ford is increasing the sticker prices for its three US models imported from Mexico by up to $2,000 each, starting from May 2. This move is in response to the tariffs currently imposed on imported vehicles, which has resulted in a $1.5 billion cost for Ford throughout the year. Despite the tariff on car imports and the additional tariff on imported parts, Ford claims they have not passed on the full cost of tariffs to customers, and their approach remains customer-focused. The price hike does not apply to vehicles already on dealers' lots but will be implemented for those built after May 2. Ford’s CFO, Sherry House, reassured that, although the tariffs will increase industry-wide pricing by about 1% to 1.5%, Ford's own pricing plans have not changed and they expect the increase to remain moderate.

## Will hurricane season start early this year? Recent trends suggest yes

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/07/weather/hurricane-season-early-start)
- _Published: 2025-05-07 14:39:00-04:00_

### Summary

Recent trends suggest that the Atlantic hurricane season may start early this year, potentially defying the usual June 1 to November 30 timeframe. Some forecasting models have indicated the possibility of storm development, especially in the western Caribbean, where conditions are more favorable. This follows a historical pattern where at least one named storm has formed before June 1 in seven of the past ten years, compared to only three years between 2005 and 2014 with early named storms. The National Hurricane Center decided in 2021 to start issuing tropical weather outlooks two weeks earlier on May 15, two weeks before the traditional season start. Early activity has largely been attributed to unusually warm waters in the Atlantic, Caribbean, or Gulf basins during the spring, which can lead to more energy available for hurricane growth. This year, hurricane researchers predict an above-average 17 named storms, with the season potentially beginning early due to the warm waters and other climate factors. The relationship between the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific basins, influenced by phenomena like El Niño and La Niña, may also contribute to early activity in the Atlantic, while the Pacific tends to be less active when the Atlantic is more active. However, it's important to note that early activity doesn't necessarily mean a higher number of storms this season.

### Summary

In a decision upheld by the federal appeals court, the Tufts University student Rümeysa Öztürk, who was detained in Louisiana, is to be transferred back to Vermont where she will attend hearings to determine if she was illegally detained. The government, which sought to keep Öztürk in Louisiana, failed to demonstrate that it could suffer harm from transferring her, and the judges agreed that Vermont is the proper venue for her First Amendment claims. The court's ruling is seen as a victory for Öztürk's legal team, who argued that her detention was unjustified and violated her rights as a student. The case highlights ongoing challenges with the Trump administration's approach to deporting non-citizens, particularly those involved in academic or political activities.

## Apple looks to add AI search to Safari in potential blow for Google

- _Published: 2025-05-07 13:04:00.000Z_

### Summary

Apple is exploring the integration of AI-powered search engines into Safari, its web browser, potentially threatening Google’s dominant market position in search advertising. This is based on an observation by Apple executive Eddy Cue that search results on Safari fell for the first time in a month, attributed to users turning to AI search engines. Google currently provides the default search engine on Safari, a position that Apple reportedly pays $20 billion annually for.

## GOP candidate drops closely watched challenge in North Carolina Supreme Court election

- _Published: 2025-05-07 12:59:00-04:00_

### Summary

A Republican North Carolina judge who launched an unprecedented legal challenge to his loss in a state Supreme Court race has dropped his appeal. Judge Jefferson Griffin announced that he will not appeal a federal court's ruling that certified the election in favor of Democratic opponent Justice Allison Riggs. The case had been closely watched for how it laid out a playbook for a losing candidate to challenge a defeat through technical arguments, instead of voting fraud. After two recounts showed Riggs's victory, Griffin sought to overturn tens of thousands of votes by arguing they were improperly cast due to apparent clerical errors. However, a federal judge ruled that the state Supreme Court violated the Constitution's due process protections by retroactively removing votes. As a result, the state election board will now issue a certificate of election to Riggs. Meanwhile, the state supreme court's earlier rulings on voter registration and voting rules were found to be unconstitutional by the federal judge. The GOP-leaning state courts and election officials, who had initially supported Griffin’s arguments, now face a challenge to their decision.

## Utah’s ban on fluoride in public water is a simple change that raises complicated new health risks, experts say

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/07/health/utah-fluoride-water-health)
- _Published: 2025-05-07 10:26:00-04:00_

### Summary

In Utah, a new law has taken effect banning fluoride in public water systems, leading to concerns among experts about the potential rise in avoidable oral health issues, particularly for young children from low-income families. While proponents of the ban argue it's an issue of 'individual choice' and there are alternative ways to access fluoride, experts and public health advocates argue that fluoride is a proven public health success story and that removing it from water could lead to higher rates of tooth decay. The transition from community water fluoridation to fluoride supplements is challenging, as it requires compliance and proper dosing, which may not be feasible for all families. The Utah Oral Health Coalition and other groups are working to inform residents about the ban and provide alternative fluoride solutions. The impact of this change is expected to be monitored in the coming years to assess its effectiveness and potential health implications.

### Summary

Scientists from South Korea, Denmark, and the United States have discovered unique genetic differences in Haenyeo, a matrilineal community of female free divers from Jeju Island, South Korea. These genetic variations include a genetic variant linked to lower blood pressure and a variant associated with cold and pain tolerance, which may help explain how Haenyeo manage the physiological stress of free diving for extended periods. The study, published in Cell Reports, revealed that Haenyeo divers have a faster heart rate reduction during dives, suggesting that training is a key factor in their ability to conserve oxygen. The findings could lead to new treatments for blood pressure disorders. The research also highlights the importance of studying free diving communities, as most medical and genetic studies are conducted in urban populations, unlike the nomadic and traditional lifestyles of these divers. Melissa Ann Ilardo, a geneticist involved in the study, hopes to continue her research to deepen understanding of the medical implications of Haenyeo divers' unique abilities.

## Trump’s crackdown on law firms is chilling the future of pro bono legal work

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/07/politics/trump-law-firm-crackdown-pro-bono-work)
- _Published: 2025-05-07 05:00:00.000Z_

### Summary

A crackdown by the Trump administration against major law firms that were aligned against him has led to a reduction in pro bono legal work, where hundreds of lawyers from large firms mobilize in humanitarian crises. This is due to the fear of potential consequences such as firings or prosecutions for taking on cases that could upset the administration. The story centers around the impact on firms that have settled with the Trump administration, where the settlement has included pledges to contribute to pro bono work in various areas but may not have the same level of support as in the past.

### Summary

Sotheby's has postponed the sale of a collection of gem relics linked to the Buddha, following India's government's call for their return. The jewels were discovered by William Claxton Peppé, a British colonial engineer, in northern India in 1898. India's Ministry of Culture has criticized the auction, stating it is an act of 'colonial violence' that promotes commercialization of sacred artifacts. The gem relics are considered sacred by many Buddhists and have historical significance as the first credible find of the Buddha's relics in modern times. Chris Peppé, a descendant of the discoverer, believes the gems should be donated to Buddhists. The postponement of the auction allows for discussions between the parties involved, but the fate of the gem relics remains uncertain.

### Summary

Another F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jet from the USS Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier has been lost at sea, marking the second jet lost from the carrier in just over a week. The incident remains under investigation, but two of the people familiar with the matter believe an arrestment failure occurred during the jet's landing, causing the pilot and weapons systems officer to eject. The jet crashed into the sea and has not been recovered. Separately, the Iran-backed Houthi rebel group allegedly fired upon the Truman on Tuesday, despite an apparent ceasefire announced by President Trump. US Naval assets in the Red Sea have repeatedly faced Houthi attacks since November 2023, including the use of Phalanx Close-In Weapon System by a destroyer to defend against Houthi missile attacks. The USS Harry S. Truman, in particular, has experienced problems during its Red Sea deployment, including a collision with a merchant ship near Egypt in February and another F/A-18 jet being accidentally fired upon by another US destroyer in December.

## The foods you pack in your kids’ lunch boxes may impact when they start menstruating, study suggests

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/06/health/nutrition-early-menstruation-wellness)
- _Published: 2025-05-06 17:50:00-20:50_

### Summary

A new study in the journal Human Reproduction indicates that a more inflammatory diet is associated with a 15% greater chance of a girl having her first menstrual cycle in the following month, while a healthier diet reduces this risk by 8%. The study, conducted on nearly 7,500 children aged 9 to 14, used the Alternative Healthy Eating Index and Empirical Dietary Inflammatory Pattern to measure the diets of participants. It found that the connection between diet and age at first menstruation was not solely influenced by body mass index (BMI). Key elements of a healthy diet, according to the study, include fruits, vegetables, healthy fats, whole grains, and nuts and legumes, while unhealthy or inflammatory diets include red and processed meats, refined grains, and sugar-sweetened beverages. The findings suggest that parents and caregivers should focus on promoting a healthy diet for their children, as it may influence long-term health outcomes. Dr. Holly Harris, the senior author of the study, notes that an early first period, which is impacted by both genetics and external factors, is associated with a higher risk of chronic conditions such as breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. She emphasizes the importance of access to healthy meal options and school-based meal guidelines to support this goal.

### Key Takeaways
  - Eating an inflammatory diet in late childhood and early adolescence is associated with a 15% greater chance of a girl having her first period in the next month, while a healthier diet reduces the risk by 8%.

## T. rex ancestors likely crossed land bridge from Asia to North America 70 million years ago, study finds

- _Published: 2025-05-06 19:36:00.000Z_

### Summary

A study led by Cassius Morrison, a doctoral student at University College London, suggests that T. rex's direct ancestors crossed from Asia to North America via a land bridge around 70 million years ago, arriving after the formation of the Bering Strait. The team used mathematical modeling and data from the fossil record to conclude that T. rex is more closely related to Tarbosaurus in Asia than to large predators in North America like Daspletosaurus. According to the study, T. rex experienced a rapid increase in size during a time of falling global temperatures, likely due to cooler climates, which provided opportunities for the dinosaur to grow and become a dominant predator. The study's findings highlight the influence of climate change on the evolution of T. rex and its dominance during the Cretaceous period.

### Summary

WeightWatchers, a 62-year-old program that revolutionized dieting for millions of people, filed for bankruptcy. The company, now known as WW International, entered Chapter 11 in response to over $1.5 billion in debt and a failing business strategy that has not kept pace with more convenient weight loss options. CEO Tara Comonte stated that the bankruptcy process would provide the company with the flexibility to accelerate innovation, reinvest in its members, and lead in the rapidly evolving weight management landscape. The filing follows a failed turnaround plan from former CEO Sima Sistani, who bought a telehealth platform that connected patients with doctors for weight-loss and diabetes drugs, and the departure of star investor Oprah Winfrey from the board. WW's history is tied to Jean Nidetch, who founded the company in 1963 with a philosophy of using an emotional approach to dieting and exercise.

### Summary

A multi-day air traffic control meltdown at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey resulted from a failure of copper wiring that transmits information between the FAA's radar facility in Westbury, New York, and Newark's control center. The outage impacted flights arriving at and departing from the airport, causing delays, cancellations, and cancellations exceeding 4 hours for some passengers. The incident highlighted the challenges of an outdated air traffic control system, contributing to staffing shortages and equipment failures, and compounded by the loss of radar and communication capabilities. Controllers were left to manage flights with only backup communication systems, leading to anxiety and trauma. United Airlines preemptively canceled 35 round trip flights to and from Newark to assist passengers. The U.S. Department of Transportation plans to overhaul the air traffic control system, aiming for a 'state-of-the-art' system to be in place in three to four years.

### Summary

President Donald Trump announced on May 6, 2025, that the United States would cease military strikes against the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. This decision was made in response to the Houthi rebels' statement that they no longer wish to engage in hostilities. The ceasefire, facilitated by Oman, aims to create a momentum for the ongoing US-Iran nuclear deal negotiations. While the ceasefire is expected to aid the US in its negotiations with Iran, it is unclear how it will impact Israel's ongoing operations against the Houthi rebels, who have fired missiles at Israel. The U.S. did not inform Israel about the ceasefire before announcing it in the Oval Office, which caused a significant reaction in the Israeli government.

  - The decision to end the strikes against the Houthi rebels in Yemen comes amid ongoing tensions with Israel, with the Houthi leaders stating that the ceasefire will only be evaluated on the ground, and they will continue their aggression against Israel until its military offensive in Gaza stops.
  - It is unclear how the ceasefire will impact Israeli military operations in Yemen, given that Israel has been carrying out days of escalating fighting with the Houthi rebels and has carried out multiple strikes against their targets.

Three Houston-area Democratic Representatives have sent a letter to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's acting head, Laura Grimm, highlighting the alarming staffing shortages at the National Weather Service's Houston-Galveston office just as hurricane season is about to begin. The letter points out that all management positions are currently vacant, including the meteorologist-in-charge, and that experienced meteorologists have been laid off, bought out, or retired. This has left the office under-resourced and at risk of failing to provide essential weather forecasts and warnings. The letter requests details on the timeline for filling these positions, as the agency is facing the possibility of reduced 24/7 operations if the problem isn't addressed promptly.

## US is shutting down Office of Palestinian Affairs and merging it into its embassy in Jerusalem

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/06/politics/us-shutting-down-office-of-palestinian-affairs)
- _Published: 2025-05-06 16:14:00-20:14_

### Summary

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the closure of the Office of Palestinian Affairs and its merger into the US embassy in Jerusalem. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce explained that this move aims to restore the unified US diplomatic mission that reports directly to the US ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee. The closure is claimed not to reflect any outreach to Palestinians or Gaza. This decision appears to be a step in sidelining Palestinian engagement with the US government, especially through the new Bureau. The announcement coincides with Israel's approval to expand its war in Gaza and comes after the first Trump administration shuttered the consulate general and closed its lines of communication with Palestinians. The Biden administration did not reopen the consulate general, which gave the Palestinian Authority a dedicated US representative and direct line to Washington. This move is seen as a further downgrading of US-Palestinian relations, especially amid the ongoing conflict in Gaza and Trump's earlier rhetoric about being good to Gaza.

### Summary

The imposition of tariffs by President Donald Trump on most Chinese imports has resulted in a dramatic drop in the volume of imports from China. This reduction in imports has caused shortages and price hikes for American consumers, particularly in goods that have been subject to the 145% tariff. The Port of Los Angeles has reported a 50% decrease in imports from China, and many retailers and importers have canceled orders or are storing their goods in Chinese warehouses to avoid the tariffs. The National Retail Federation predicts a 20% year-over-year decline in imports, while JP Morgan expects a 75% to 80% drop from China itself. Economists at Wells Fargo also predict that imports will continue to decline, with a decline of at least 20% year-over-year. This situation is expected to continue as more ships with goods subject to tariffs are expected to arrive in the coming weeks.

### Summary

A civil rights lawsuit has been filed in Florida on behalf of the family of a fatal shooting victim, Senior Airman Roger Fortson, by a Florida sheriff's deputy, Eddie Duran. The complaint alleges that Deputy Duran used excessive and unconstitutional deadly force when he shot Fortson just seconds after the Black 23-year-old opened his apartment door on May 3, 2024. Fortson’s family is represented by Ben Crump, a civil rights attorney who has been involved in a number of cases involving law enforcement killings of Black people, including those of Michael Brown, Breonna Taylor, Tyre Nichols, and George Floyd. Duran has pleaded not guilty to a charge of manslaughter with a firearm. The complaint also details alleged failures by the Okaloosa County Sheriff’s Office in training and supervision and claims staff at the apartment complex where Fortson lived provided misleading information that led to the fatal law enforcement response. Fortson, who was assigned to the 4th Special Operations Squadron at Hurlburt Field, was alone at the time, talking with his girlfriend on a FaceTime video call. Only then did the deputy yell, 'Drop the gun!'

## Trump admin plans to shut down money-saving Energy Star program soon, sources say

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/06/climate/energy-star-trump)
- _Published: 2025-05-06 15:21:00-20:21_

### Summary

The Trump administration is planning to shut down two key divisions within the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) focused on climate change and energy efficiency, including its consumer-facing Energy Star program. The EPA is planning to close its climate change division and climate protection partnership division, as well as its Energy Star program. This program, which launched by the Bush administration in 1992, is recognized by over 90% of US households and helps consumers find energy-efficient appliances. The changes are part of broader EPA organizational improvements and will impact several climate programs and reduce government measurements of fossil fuel emissions. Senate Appropriations Chair Susan Collins, a Republican from Maine, expressed confusion and concern over the Trump administration's decision to cut the Energy Star program. The program's elimination would contradict the administration's promise to reduce household energy costs, according to Paula Glover, president of the Alliance to Save Energy. However, the program's supporters argue that it has a significant return on investment, with every federal dollar invested in it yielding $350 in benefits. The Energy Star program helps consumers make informed decisions about energy-efficient appliances and is nearly universally supported by manufacturers, retailers, and consumers. The future of the program's certifications for appliances is not clear, as the EPA spokesperson did not respond to questions about their continuation.

## 3 former Memphis police officers found not guilty in the death of Tyre Nichols

- [source](https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5388488)
- _Published: 2025-05-07 16:16:00-04:00_

### Summary

A jury found three former Memphis, Tennessee police officers, Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, and Justin Smith, not guilty of all charges in the 2023 death of Tyre Nichols, including the most serious charge of second-degree murder. The officers were initially fired and charged with both federal and state crimes related to Nichols' death. Nichols, a 29-year-old father, was fatally beaten during a traffic stop in January 2023. Graphic video footage and other evidence showed the officers using excessive force against Nichols, including pepper spraying and using a stun gun. Despite the prosecution's claims that the officers used excessive force and failed to provide medical assistance, the defense argued that Nichols' death was due to his own aggressive behavior and the actions of another officer, Emmitt Martin, who repeatedly kicked and punched Nichols. The case is ongoing, with Nichols' family planning to sue the city of Memphis for $550 million. This verdict is part of the second trial for the officers, following their conviction in a previous federal case for witness tampering. The Nichols case has become a focal point in discussions about police reform in Memphis and the broader debate over policing and accountability.

### Summary

Stacey Wales, the sister of Christopher Pelkey, who was killed in a road rage incident in Chandler, Arizona, used artificial intelligence to create an AI-generated video of her brother's voice addressing his shooter at a sentencing hearing. Wales, who struggled to find the right words for a victim impact statement, turned to AI to create an authentic representation of her brother's voice. The AI avatar, named Chris, thanked those in Pelkey's life, including those who testified about him, and specifically addressed the shooter, Gabriel Paul Horcasitas, offering forgiveness. The video was presented during the sentencing hearing and received a positive response from the judge, Todd Lang.

### Summary

Judge Arun Subramanian completed the questioning of nearly 100 potential jurors for Sean 'Diddy' Combs' sex trafficking trial on Wednesday. The trial, which involves charges of sex trafficking, transporting to engage in prostitution, and racketeering conspiracy, began in the federal District Court for the Southern District of New York. The judge asked jurors about their personal experiences with topics such as sexual assault, domestic violence, and their ability to remain impartial, given the case's high profile. Potential jurors also had to answer questions about their knowledge of the allegations against Combs, including the controversial surveillance video showing him violently treating his ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura. The trial, which is expected to last eight weeks and is scheduled to begin with opening statements on May 12, faced challenges in finding impartial jurors due to Combs' fame and the extensive media coverage of the case. Jurors who admitted to being biased against wealthy celebrities or had personal experiences with sexual assault were dismissed. Some jurors were also dismissed for other reasons such as medical exemptions, lack of English proficiency, and scheduling conflicts. By Wednesday afternoon, 45 jurors had been selected to move forward, with the prosecution and defense narrowing the pool down to 12 jurors and six alternates for the trial.

## How a post #MeToo law opened the floodgates for allegations against Sean 'Diddy' Combs

### Summary

Sean 'Diddy' Combs, a music mogul, is facing a sex trafficking and racketeering trial and numerous civil lawsuits alleging sexual and physical abuse dating back over a decade. The lawsuits began with Cassie Ventura's November 2023 lawsuit, which opened a legal window for alleged survivors to file claims. This legal window was enabled by New York's Adult Survivors Act, which allowed alleged victims of sexual violence a one-year window to file civil claims even after the statute of limitations had lapsed. The act's expiration in November 2022 coincided with a surge in civil lawsuits filed against Combs, including those from several women. The lawsuits against Combs, including Ventura's, may have prompted federal law enforcement to launch a criminal investigation, which led to his indictment on charges that mirror Ventura's allegations. Since then, several more civil lawsuits have been filed against Combs, and it is likely that some of the alleged victims will be called as witnesses during his criminal trial. The attention on the legal proceedings against Combs has raised hopes for more lookback legislation to provide more protection for alleged survivors of abuse.

### Key Takeaways

## What to do if you don't have a REAL ID yet, and which documents still work

- [source](https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5379935)
- _Published: 2025-05-06 14:30:00-20:30_

### Summary

Starting on May 7, 2025, U.S. travelers will need a REAL ID, which requires more documentation than a standard driver's license or state ID, for domestic flights and entry into certain federal facilities. Clint Henderson, a travel editor at The Points Guy, explains that this change will occur in about a two-year window, giving airports discretion on a case-by-case basis to subject travelers to additional screening instead of requiring a REAL ID. Key points include travelers being able to bring passports or passport cards, Global Entry cards, NEXUS cards, FAST border-crossing cards, SENTRI cards, U.S. Department of Defense IDs, and enhanced driver's licenses. Tanya Broder, a representative from the National Immigration Law Center, highlights that those without legal status cannot obtain a REAL ID. While some states have been sending out enhanced driver's licenses, the new requirements may cause additional screenings and delays. This transition is part of the government's effort to enhance security and unify ID standards after 9/11 and the Oklahoma City bombing.

### Key Takeaways
  - Travelers will need a REAL ID, which requires more documentation than a standard driver's license or state ID, for domestic flights and entry into certain federal facilities starting May 7, 2025. REAL IDs will have a golden star symbol on the ID card to distinguish them from regular IDs. 
  - The transition period to the new ID requirements, allowing two years for airports to accommodate those who do not yet have a REAL ID, provides flexibility for travelers.
  - Travelers without a REAL ID can use alternative acceptable IDs such as passports, passport cards, Global Entry cards, NEXUS cards, FAST border-crossing cards, SENTRI cards, U.S. Department of Defense IDs, and enhanced driver's licenses issued by some states, as long as they meet the REAL ID requirements.
  - A two-year window exists to adapt to the new regulations and address potential logistical challenges like additional screenings and possible delays.
  - The Trump administration's rapid implementation of this law in 2017 was seen as an urgent response to security concerns after 9/11 and the Oklahoma City bombing.

## 20 years later, the Real ID deadline is here. Here's why it took so long

- [source](https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5387735)
- _Published: 2025-05-06 05:00:00.000Z_

### Summary

The article discusses the implementation of the 2005 Real ID law, which aimed to make state driver's licenses harder to counterfeit and require more information checks. Despite the law's complexities and resistance from many states, the deadline for compliance in airports is May 7, 2025. The article mentions the challenges faced by states in implementing the law, including resistance due to cost, privacy concerns, and the burden of additional documentation. It also touches on the impact of the law on immigrants, who may face additional barriers in obtaining compliant IDs. The article highlights the ongoing pushback and challenges in enforcing the Real ID Act, emphasizing the need for more time and resources to ensure compliance.

### Key Takeaways
  - The Real ID law was implemented in 2005 with the intention of making state driver's licenses harder to counterfeit and requiring more checks for the information on the cards. However, the implementation was complicated and faced resistance from many states due to cost, privacy concerns, and the burden of additional documentation. The law has led to a variety of 'flavors' of Real ID across states, with some states offering compliant licenses and others requiring additional steps for verification. The deadline for compliance in airports is May 7, 2025, affecting millions of U.S. citizens and immigrants.

## The Fed holds interest rates steady as Trump's tariffs spark uncertainty

- [source](https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5387499)
- _Published: 2025-05-07 14:09:00-20:09_

### Summary

The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady at 4.25% to 4.5% on Wednesday, as President Trump's tariffs continued to create economic uncertainty. Despite the president's repeated calls for the Fed to lower rates, the central bank maintained its benchmark borrowing rate in response to the increased inflation and growth concerns arising from the tariffs. The Fed is faced with the challenge of balancing potential inflation risks from the tariffs and the need to maintain a stable job market, which could lead to a 'bind' if tariffs push both inflation and unemployment up. Meanwhile, business surveys by the Institute for Supply Management reported widespread alarm that tariffs were disrupting supply chains and driving up prices, leading to higher prices for domestic producers.

## JD Vance's half-brother advances in his uphill quest to become Cincinnati's mayor

- [source](https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5389536)
- _Published: 2025-05-07 12:35:00-20:35_

### Summary

Cory Bowman, JD Vance's half-brother and the founding co-pastor of a local evangelical church, is running for Cincinnati mayor in a primary race. While running as a Republican, Bowman has received support from his half-brother, Vice President Biden, who served as a role model for his political aspirations. The race is unusual as it involves the first Republican candidate in 16 years and is also a nonpartisan race, with a history of Democratic mayors in Cincinnati. The race is considered challenging due to the long-standing Democratic alignment of the city's political system and the fact that it is a nonpartisan election, which makes it particularly significant for the mayor's office. Bowman's campaign focuses on issues such as money management, increasing public safety, improving infrastructure, lowering property taxes, and protecting children, including safeguarding the unborn. He is also emphasizing his ties to his roots in the city, where he believes he has the greatest memories and the best people. Despite the challenges, Bowman seems to embrace the opportunity to provide voters with a choice in the mayoral race and to bring a new perspective to the city's governance.

### Key Takeaways
  - JD Vance's half-brother, Cory Bowman, is running for Cincinnati mayor in a primary race with a Republican affiliation, facing a Democratic incumbent and a third Republican candidate.

  - While Bowman and his primary opponent, Brian Frank, are the first Republicans to run in Cincinnati's mayoral race in 16 years, the city has not had a Republican-aligned mayor in decades.
