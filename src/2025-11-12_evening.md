### Summary

The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 559 points to a record high of 47,927.96 on Tuesday, driven by optimism that the U.S. government shutdown would end by the end of the week. The Senate passed a stopgap funding bill, which is now moving to the House for approval and will be presented to President Donald Trump. This legislative progress reduced economic uncertainty and boosted investor confidence, leading to a rotation from tech stocks into more stable sectors like health care, energy, and consumer staples. Historical data shows that the S&P 500 typically gains 2.7% in the month after a shutdown ends, supporting the market’s positive trajectory. However, tech stocks faced setbacks: Nvidia declined after SoftBank announced it had sold its entire stake, and CoreWeave fell significantly due to disappointing guidance. Despite the Nasdaq’s pullback, broader market drivers such as Federal Reserve policy easing, strong corporate profits, and AI spending continue to support equity performance. Market sentiment, as indicated by CNN’s Fear and Greed Index, remained cautious, reflecting ongoing uncertainty even amid gains.

### Summary

Venezuela is experiencing a sharp resurgence of inflation—projected to reach over 600% by October 2026—driven by the devaluation of the bolivar, US sanctions on oil exports (particularly affecting Chevron’s operations), and growing economic instability amid political tensions with the United States. The bolivar has lost about 70% of its value in three months, leading to daily price hikes that erode purchasing power. Citizens, including drivers, street vendors, and families relying on remittances, report increasing financial hardship. In response, the government has cracked down on black markets and promoted cryptocurrency through the National Superintendence of Crypto Assets (Sunacrip), with platforms like Binance becoming widely used. Experts and citizens alike emphasize that inflation, once under control, has returned with full force, signaling a deepening crisis in Venezuela’s economy and society.

### Key Takeaways
  - Inflation in Venezuela is surging, with monthly rates estimated at 20%–30%, and projected to exceed 600% by October 2026.

### Summary

U.S. stocks hovered near record highs on Wednesday, driven by strong performance in artificial intelligence (AI) companies such as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which rallied 9% after CEO Lisa Su forecasted over 35% annual revenue growth due to accelerating AI momentum. However, market concerns about overvaluation persisted, as seen in Nvidia’s 4.6% monthly decline and Palantir’s 3.6% drop. Other stocks like Holdings saw gains from earnings surprises, while Circle Internet Group fell despite strong profits, highlighting sentiment-driven volatility. The broader market dynamics were shaped by expectations of a potential Federal Reserve interest rate cut in December, supported by a drop in the 10-year Treasury yield to 4.06%. Meanwhile, international markets responded positively, with Germany’s DAX and South Korea’s Kospi rising. Despite a slowing job market and high inflation, the AI-driven rally has pushed the S&P 500 and Dow Jones to record levels, sparking debate over whether this reflects sustainable growth or a repeat of the 2000 dot-com bubble.

## US ends penny-making run after more than 230 years - <small>`bbc`</small>

- <small>tags: `monetary policy, currency reform, economic efficiency, penny phase-out, digital transactions, global trends, Treasury Department, Philadelphia Mint, Abraham Lincoln, economy, consumer cost, penny cost, price rounding`</small>

### Summary

The United States is ending the production of pennies after more than 230 years, with the Philadelphia Mint producing the final batch on Wednesday. The move, driven by rising manufacturing costs—now nearly four cents per penny—and the decline in practical use due to electronic transactions, is expected to save about $56 million annually. Despite remaining in circulation, around 300 billion pennies will continue to be used, though 60% are stored at home. The decision reflects a global trend, as countries like Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the UK have also phased out low-denomination coins. However, the policy may raise consumer costs by $6 million a year due to price rounding. The nickel, which costs nearly 14 times its face value, poses a greater economic impact and is under consideration for future retirement.

### Summary

A 2025 New York Times survey of 350 U.S. teachers reveals that nearly all schools now provide students with personal devices from kindergarten through 12th grade, with Chromebooks being the most common. While technology enables personalized learning, online access, and real-time feedback, many teachers report increased distraction, student reliance on AI, and reduced focus and handwriting. Students in middle and high schools spend three or more hours daily on devices, with early learners using them for testing and AI tutoring. Despite benefits, educators and parents are growing concerned about screen time, digital addiction, and the erosion of foundational skills like reading, writing, and critical thinking. Although districts emphasize equity and access, especially for English language learners and low-income families, there is little instruction in basic digital skills, and many teachers are opting to use devices only for essential tasks, returning to paper-based learning when possible.

### Key Takeaways
  - Schools now provide devices to nearly all students from kindergarten through 12th grade, with 99% of teachers reporting school-provided devices.
  - Devices have increased student screen time, with middle and high school students spending three hours or more per day on devices.
  - While technology supports personalized learning, real-time feedback, and access to digital content, many teachers report increased distraction and reduced student engagement.
  - Students are increasingly relying on AI and Google search results, which may discourage deeper research and critical thinking.
  - Less than one-fifth of teachers say their districts teach students to type proficiently, indicating a gap in foundational digital skills.
  - Many teachers are returning to pencil-and-paper methods for core subjects, citing improved focus, handwriting, and imagination.
  - School districts emphasize technology as a tool for equity, especially for English language learners and low-income families, but lack consistent screen time policies or digital literacy instruction.

## So long, peak oil: World demand could now grow until 2050, a top agency says - <small>`cnn`</small>

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/business/oil-demand-2050-iea-intl)
- _Published: 2025-11-12 10:12:00-05:00_
- **Environment & Climate**
- <small>tags: `energy demand, peak oil, climate change, clean energy transition, IEA, LNG, data centers, artificial intelligence, Paris Agreement, U.S. energy policy`</small>

### Summary

The International Energy Agency (IEA) has revised its outlook to predict that global oil and natural gas demand will continue to grow until 2050, reversing earlier projections of a peak in oil demand this decade. This shift is based on current government policies, not climate goals, and reflects ongoing political resistance, particularly from the U.S. under President Donald Trump and his energy secretary Chris Wright, who labeled peak oil forecasts as 'nonsensical'. The IEA’s 'current policies scenario' projects oil demand to reach 113 million barrels per day by mid-century. Meanwhile, LNG export capacity is expected to surge by 2030, driven by rising power demand from data centers and artificial intelligence, with global data center investment projected to exceed oil supply investment. Despite global commitments under the Paris Climate Agreement to limit warming to 1.5°C, the IEA finds that all scenarios result in a failure to meet this target, underscoring a growing energy and climate policy gap.

### Summary

A growing campaign led by over 70 British lawmakers, including Labour’s David Taylor and Liberal Democrat’s Danny Chambers, is demanding the relocation of 15 Gentoo penguins from a basement enclosure at the Sea Life London Aquarium, where they have been held since May 2011. The penguins are reportedly denied access to daylight, fresh air, and sufficient space—only 6–7 feet deep compared to their wild diving depth of 600 feet. Animal advocates, including environmental campaigner Chris Packham, describe the conditions as inhumane and ‘completely obscene,’ with more than 37,000 people signing a petition. While Merlin Entertainments claims the enclosure is scientifically designed and safe, the government’s DEFRA has affirmed its commitment to strengthening animal welfare standards in zoos. The debate centers on whether captivity for public display is ethically justifiable when it fails to meet animals’ natural behavioral and physiological needs.

## It's Harder to Get Home Insurance. That's Changing Communities Across the U.S. - <small>`npr`</small>

- [source](https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5546754)

- <small>tags: `home insurance, climate change, insurance affordability, hurricanes, wildfires, hailstorms, disaster risk, home values, climate adaptation, insurance policy, property risk, central U.S., Gulf Coast, California, Nebraska, economic vulnerability, climate resilience`</small>

### Summary

Home insurance in the United States is becoming increasingly unaffordable due to a combination of climate change, more frequent and severe weather events, and rising inflation. Insurers are withdrawing from high-risk regions such as the Gulf Coast, California, and the Great Plains, especially after major storms or hail events. In Nebraska, a single hailstorm in 2024 caused over $100 million in damage, leading to widespread policy cancellations and insurance costs rising to nearly $6,400. In Florida, average insurance costs have soared to $5,800, with a 10% price increase linked to a 4.6% drop in home values. Communities like Lake County, California, are investing in wildfire mitigation through home retrofits and vegetation control, but insurers often fail to reflect these efforts in pricing. Experts emphasize the need for a shared database, such as the WUI Data Commons, to track community risk reduction and enable insurers to offer lower premiums to resilient areas. Without intervention, rising insurance costs threaten to trigger widespread foreclosures, decline in home values, and instability in the national housing market.

### Key Takeaways
  - Home insurance is becoming increasingly unaffordable across the U.S. due to rising climate-related disaster risks and inflation.
  - Insurance companies are dropping coverage in high-risk areas such as the Gulf Coast, California, and the Great Plains, especially after major storms or hail events.
  - In regions like Cozad, Nebraska, and Fort Myers, Florida, average insurance costs have surged—Nebraska at $6,400 and Florida at $5,800—exceeding the national average by thousands of dollars.
  - Rising insurance costs are depressing home values; a 10% increase in insurance costs leads to a 4.6% drop in housing prices, as found by Florida State University researchers.
  - Community-led wildfire mitigation projects, such as vegetation removal and home retrofitting, are being implemented in areas like Lake County, California, to reduce risk and improve insurability.
  - Insurance companies often do not collect or use data on community-level risk reduction efforts, limiting the effectiveness of these protective measures.
  - Proposed solutions include creating public databases (e.g., WUI Data Commons) to track and validate community risk reduction efforts, enabling insurers to offer lower premiums to resilient neighborhoods.
  - Experts warn that widespread insurance unaffordability could lead to increased foreclosures, reduced home values, and cascading effects on the national housing and mortgage markets.

### Summary

Iran is experiencing a worsening water crisis due to six consecutive years of drought, with rainfall dropping 81% below historical averages. Critical dams feeding Tehran — including the Lar, Latyan, Karaj, Taleqan, and Mamloo — are at less than 10% capacity, prompting President Masoud Pezeshkian to warn of possible city-wide evacuation. Experts, including Professor Farshid Vahedifard and Kaveh Madani, say the situation is due to decades of poor management, overreliance on dams, and misallocation of water to agriculture, which consumes over 90% of the supply despite contributing little to the economy. Infrastructure damage from the June war with Israel and unchecked groundwater extraction have further degraded the system. Wastage — both physical and illegal — accounts for about a third of water use. Authorities are implementing short-term rationing, with the energy minister proposing night-time shutdowns. A shift to resilience-based water management, including groundwater recharge and community participation, is urgently needed. The crisis is not only environmental but also social and political, with rising tensions and public distrust in governance.

### Key Takeaways
  - Iran is facing its sixth consecutive year of severe drought, with precipitation down 81% from historical averages.
  - 19 dams, including key ones feeding Tehran, are at less than 5% capacity; major reservoirs like Lar, Latyan, Karaj, Taleqan, and Mamloo are at around 10% capacity.
  - Tehran, home to 10 million people, could face mandatory water rationing or even evacuation if no rain occurs by next month.
  - Over 90% of Iran’s water supply is used by agriculture, which contributes only 12% to GDP and 14% to employment, highlighting inefficiency and misallocation.
  - Up to 30% of water is wasted due to infrastructure failures, illegal consumption, and outdated systems.
  - The war with Israel in June damaged infrastructure, contributing to current water shortages.
  - Experts warn that without substantial rain and snowfall, economic, social, and environmental consequences will be severe, including protests and regional instability.
  - Long-term mismanagement, overreliance on dams, and lack of sustainable planning have led to 'water bankruptcy' and related resource bankruptcies.
  - The government has launched short-term solutions like desalination and inter-basin transfers, but the system is described as 'almost unrecoverable' due to decades of poor policy and ignored warnings.
  - A shift from supply-based to resilience-based water management — including groundwater recharge, transparent data sharing, and community participation — is urgently needed.

## FDA and HHS Remove Black Box Warnings on Hormone Therapy for Menopause, Sparking Debate Over Evidence and Safety - <small>`cnn`</small>

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/health/fda-hormone-therapy-menopause-balance)

- <small>tags: `hormone therapy, menopause, black box warning, FDA decision, women's health, medical ethics, public trust, clinical evidence, systemic vs. local hormone therapy, risk-benefit analysis`</small>

### Summary

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Department of Health and Human Services have announced a major policy shift by removing most black box warnings from hormone therapy for menopause symptoms. This reversal stems from a 20-year history of fear and misinformation, initially triggered by the Women’s Health Initiative study in 2002, which led to a 2003 warning about increased risks of heart disease, breast cancer, and dementia. Now, under new leadership, Dr. Marty Makary and Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. argue that hormone therapy—especially transdermal and vaginal forms—offers significant health benefits, such as reducing heart disease, dementia, and hip fractures, and may extend life. However, medical experts—including Dr. Leslie Cho, Dr. Rebecca Thurston, and Dr. Cynthia Stuenkel—express concern that the decision oversimplifies risks, relies on outdated or cherry-picked studies, and fails to distinguish between systemic (e.g., pills) and localized (e.g., vaginal) forms. Critics argue that the FDA did not follow standard advisory processes, cited weak or misattributed evidence, and risks misleading patients and doctors into viewing hormone therapy as a universal cure. While the FDA emphasizes individualized medical decisions and open dialogue, experts call for a more balanced, nuanced approach that acknowledges both benefits and risks and promotes non-hormonal alternatives like Veozah and Lynkuet.

### Key Takeaways
  - The FDA, under Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary, and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced the removal of most black box warnings on hormone therapy for menopause, reversing a 2003 policy decision.
  - The decision is based on a review of recent scientific evidence and an expert panel discussion, though experts note that the evidence reviewed is not as comprehensive or balanced as typical FDA processes.
  - Hormone therapy, especially systemic forms like oral pills and transdermal patches, is not risk-free; critics point out that the benefits are overstated and that risks—especially for heart disease, blood clots, and breast cancer—remain significant.
  - Vaginal estrogens are considered safer and have been long advocated for removal of warnings due to localized action and minimal systemic exposure.
  - Experts emphasize the need for individualized risk-benefit assessments, warning against treating hormone therapy as a 'miracle drug' or a panacea for aging or menopausal symptoms.
  - Alternative non-hormonal treatments like Veozah and Lynkuet have been approved and represent important options for women seeking symptom management without hormonal exposure.

### Summary

Israeli authorities plan to deport at least 89 sick Palestinian patients, including children and elderly individuals, back to Gaza despite the fact that 94% of Gaza’s hospitals are damaged or destroyed and there is no functional healthcare system. Patients like Yamen Al-Najjar, who has a rare bleeding disorder, face imminent death due to lack of medical treatment. The World Health Organization and medical groups such as Physicians for Human Rights Israel (PHRI) have condemned the deportations as violations of international humanitarian law, arguing that Israel bears responsibility for the destruction of Gaza’s healthcare infrastructure and therefore must protect patients in safe, accessible medical facilities. Many patients, including newborns and those with chronic conditions, have been in East Jerusalem hospitals for years and are being forcibly returned under dire conditions. The decision echoes a previous attempt in March 2024, which was temporarily halted by a Supreme Court order and international media coverage. The article highlights both the humanitarian crisis and the moral and legal implications of deporting vulnerable individuals to a war-ruined, life-threatening environment.

### Summary

A multistate outbreak of listeria linked to recalled prepared pasta meals sold at major grocery chains including Albertsons, Kroger, Sprouts Farmers Market, and Trader Joe’s has resulted in at least 27 illnesses and six deaths, with one case involving a pregnant woman who lost her fetus. Listeria monocytogenes, a bacteria that can grow at refrigerator temperatures, poses a serious threat to vulnerable groups such as pregnant people, older adults, newborns, and those with weakened immune systems. Symptoms include flu-like illness and, in severe cases, meningitis or organ failure. Diagnosis relies on lab testing, and treatment often involves antibiotics. Health experts emphasize that the recalled products should be discarded immediately, even if unspoiled, and that home food safety practices—such as proper cooking, handwashing, cross-contamination prevention, and timely refrigeration—are essential to reducing risk. This outbreak highlights both the dangers of foodborne pathogens and the importance of public vigilance and adherence to food safety guidelines, especially during the holiday season.

### Summary

ByHeart, a U.S. baby formula company, has issued a nationwide recall of all its infant formula products, including cans and single-serve sticks, amid an ongoing investigation into a multistate outbreak of infant botulism. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are examining whether Clostridium botulinum spores in ByHeart’s Whole Nutrition formula are responsible for the illness. As of November 11, 2025, 15 infants across 12 states have been diagnosed with infant botulism after exposure to ByHeart formula, with all receiving intravenous BabyBIG treatment and no deaths reported. Preliminary lab results from California indicate the presence of the botulism bacterium in an open can of ByHeart formula. While no unopened product has tested positive, the disproportionate number of cases linked to ByHeart—despite its low market share—raises serious public health concerns. The company’s co-founders, Mia Funt and Ron Belldegrun, have pledged full transparency and urged consumers to discard all ByHeart products immediately.

### Key Takeaways

## New malaria drug could be a life-saver as the standard drug shows signs of weakness - <small>`npr`</small>

- [source](https://text.npr.org/g-s1-97487)
- _Published: 2025-11-12 16:59:00-05:00_
- **Health & Public Safety**
- <small>tags: `malaria, antimalarial drug, drug resistance, GanLum, artemisinin resistance, Africa, public health, Novartis, clinical trials, tropical medicine`</small>

### Summary

A new antimalarial drug, GanLum, composed of the novel compound ganaplacide and the established drug lumefantrine, has shown over 97% effectiveness in clinical trials across 12 African countries. Developed by Novartis after screening over 2.3 million molecules, ganaplacide is effective against all known malaria parasites, including those resistant to artemisinin. The drug performs as well as or better than current treatments, with similar side effects (except for more vomiting in the GanLum group), and has the added benefit of targeting the transmission stage of the parasite. While it still needs regulatory approval (estimated at 18 months), it represents a crucial tool to combat the growing threat of drug resistance, especially in Africa where artemisinin resistance is spreading. Experts from Medicines for Malaria Venture, Columbia University, and the University of Notre Dame highlight that GanLum could help prevent a repeat of past deaths from drug failure and extend the lifespan of existing treatments.

### Key Takeaways
  - A new malaria drug, GanLum, has shown over 97% effectiveness in clinical trials across 12 African countries, outperforming the current standard of care in some aspects.
  - GanLum is a combination drug consisting of ganaplacide (a newly discovered compound) and lumefantrine (an older, established antimalarial), targeting different stages of the parasite's life cycle.
  - Ganaplacide was discovered by scientists at Novartis through screening of over 2.3 million molecules, and is effective against all known forms of malaria parasites, including those resistant to artemisinin.
  - The drug shows potential to prevent transmission by targeting the stage responsible for spreading malaria between people, which is a major advantage over current treatments.
  - Clinical trials involving over 16,000 patients showed both GanLum and current artemisinin-based treatments were equally effective, with GanLum slightly more effective and similar side effect profiles, except for a higher rate of vomiting.
  - GanLum still requires additional regulatory approval, estimated to take about 18 months, before it can be widely distributed.
  - While GanLum may not fully replace artemisinin-based treatments in all regions, it could serve as a critical backup where artemisinin resistance has reduced treatment efficacy.
  - The development of GanLum is a vital step in preventing a resurgence of malaria-related deaths due to drug resistance, which has already caused millions of deaths in the past.

- **Health & Public Safety**
- <small>tags: `gender-affirming care, Catholic Church, transgender rights, religious policy, healthcare access, immigration, moral teachings, religious dissent, religious solidarity`</small>

### Summary

U.S. Catholic bishops have formally banned gender-affirming care for transgender patients in Catholic hospitals, following years of moral and theological debate. This decision builds on earlier Vatican and U.S. bishops' statements from 2023 and 2024, which condemned medical procedures that alter a person’s sex characteristics. While Catholic Health Association reaffirmed a commitment to treating transgender patients with dignity and respect, the policy shift restricts access to vital care, especially in rural areas where Catholic hospitals serve as primary medical providers. The ban is at odds with support from progressive religious groups, including the Unitarian Universalist Association, Episcopal Church, and others, who issued a joint statement affirming transgender rights amid rising state and administrative restrictions. Meanwhile, the bishops also issued a unified statement opposing mass deportation of immigrants, reflecting a broader concern for human dignity, pastoral care, and social justice.

### Key Takeaways
  - U.S. Catholic bishops formally banned gender-affirming care for transgender patients at Catholic hospitals, reinforcing a long-standing conservative stance on medical interventions related to gender identity.
  - The ban builds on earlier Vatican and U.S. bishops' documents from 2023 and 2024, which outlined moral objections to procedures that alter a person's sex characteristics.

## Could COVID-19 mRNA vaccines also fight cancer? - <small>`aljazeera`</small>

- [source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/27/could-covid-19-mrna-vaccines-help-fight-cancer)
- _Published: 2025-10-27 07:34:31+00:00_
- **Health & Public Safety**
- <small>tags: `mRNA vaccine, cancer treatment, immunotherapy, immunological response, vaccine repurposing, clinical trial, oncology, public health innovation, immune checkpoint inhibitors, cold tumors`</small>

### Summary

New research from the University of Florida and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center shows that mRNA COVID-19 vaccines may improve survival rates in cancer patients by activating the immune system to recognize and attack tumors—especially in 'cold' cancers that were previously resistant to treatment. Clinical data from over 1,000 patients revealed that those who received mRNA vaccines before starting immunotherapy lived significantly longer, with survival rates nearly doubling in advanced lung cancer and exceeding three years in metastatic melanoma cases. The study suggests the vaccine 'wakes up' immune cells like dendritic cells, enhancing T cell recruitment and enabling immune checkpoint inhibitors to work more effectively. While the mechanism is not fully understood, findings indicate that mRNA vaccines could form the basis of a universal, off-the-shelf cancer treatment. A Phase 3 clinical trial is underway to validate these results and determine whether mRNA vaccines should become part of standard cancer care, despite political challenges such as reduced funding under past U.S. administration policies.

### Key Takeaways
  - mRNA COVID-19 vaccines may enhance immune system recognition of cancer cells, particularly in 'cold' tumors that are typically difficult to treat.
  - Patients who received mRNA vaccines before starting immunotherapy showed significantly improved survival rates, including a nearly doubling of median survival in advanced lung cancer patients.
  - The effect is most pronounced in patients with immunologically 'cold' tumors, suggesting the vaccine 'wakes up' the immune system to detect and attack cancer.
  - Combining mRNA vaccines with immune checkpoint inhibitors (like PD-1 inhibitors) creates a synergistic effect, as the immune system is activated and the cancer’s protective shield is disabled.
  - While mRNA vaccines do not generate new tumor-fighting T cells, they may improve dendritic cell activity, leading to better recruitment and activation of existing T cells.
  - Early mouse studies show that mRNA vaccines can stimulate dendritic cells to signal T cells to attack tumors, slowing cancer growth.
  - The research team is launching a Phase 3 clinical trial to validate these findings and determine whether mRNA vaccines should become part of standard cancer care.

### Summary

Canada has lost its measles elimination status after a large, multi-jurisdictional outbreak began in October 2024, affecting all provinces and territories. The outbreak, linked to declining vaccination rates due to post-pandemic vaccine hesitancy and misinformation, has led to 5,000 cases and two deaths in Canada alone. This has caused the entire Americas region to lose its elimination status, with 12,596 cases reported across the region as of November 7, 2025, 95% of which are in Canada, Mexico, and the US. The US faces a deadline to prove outbreak control to retain its status, while Mexico reports over 5,000 cases and 23 deaths. Experts emphasize that vaccine hesitancy, fueled by myths like the MMR-autism link, and low immunization rates—down from 89.5% in 2019 to 82.5% in 2023—are key drivers. Herd immunity requires at least 95% vaccination coverage, and the global community is urged to act through public health outreach, vaccination programs, and political commitment to reverse the trend.

### Key Takeaways
  - Canada has lost its measles elimination status after a large, multi-jurisdictional outbreak began in October 2024, affecting all provinces and territories except Nunavut.

## Dozens of Venezuelans deported from US to notorious Salvadoran prison subjected to torture, rights groups claim in new report - <small>`cnn`</small>

### Summary

A joint report by Human Rights Watch and Cristosal reveals that dozens of Venezuelans deported from the United States to El Salvador’s Terrorism Confinement Center (Cecot) were subjected to severe torture, beatings, sexual violence, and psychological abuse. Testimonies from 40 of 252 deported individuals describe brutal conditions, including solitary confinement, denial of legal counsel, and punitive actions for minor infractions. Despite U.S. officials claiming the individuals were members of violent gangs like Tren de Aragua and MS-13, the report states that only 3% had violent U.S. convictions and half had no criminal records. The Salvadoran government maintains human rights compliance, but testimonies contradict this, with multiple detainees reporting suicidal ideation and attempts. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security defended the deportations, but the findings raise serious concerns about international complicity in human rights abuses and the use of punitive detention as a migration policy tool.

## How Trump-era funding cuts endanger efforts to empower Haiti’s farmers - <small>`aljazeera`</small>

- [source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/longform/2025/11/12/how-trump-era-funding-cuts-endanger-efforts-to-empower-haitis-farmers)
- _Published: 2025-11-12 22:54:52Z_
- **Human Rights & Immigration**
- <small>tags: `Haiti, World Food Programme, foreign aid, Trump administration, funding cuts, local sourcing, food security, small-scale farmers, humanitarian crisis, agricultural empowerment, United States foreign policy`</small>

### Summary

The article highlights how the Trump administration's significant cuts to U.S. foreign aid — including suspending USAID contracts and slashing funding to the World Food Programme (WFP) — threaten critical efforts to empower Haitian farmers. The WFP had successfully shifted over 70% of its school meals in Haiti to locally sourced produce, feeding 600,000 students and supporting more than 32,000 farmers. This transition, championed by figures like Jean-Martin Bauer, supports local agriculture, child education, and rural livelihoods. However, reduced funding means the WFP now faces a humanitarian crisis, with suspended operations, halved emergency rations, and uncertain future for local procurement. While the WFP remains committed to achieving 100% local sourcing by 2030, experts warn that without sustained funding, the gains could reverse. The article underscores a broader global trend in humanitarian aid toward local sourcing, but one now at risk due to political and economic instability in donor nations.

### Key Takeaways
  - The World Food Programme (WFP) is shifting from importing food to sourcing meals locally in Haiti, with over 32,000 farmers contributing to school meal programs that feed 600,000 students daily.
  - This transition supports local agriculture, farmer livelihoods, and children’s education by reducing hunger-related disruptions in learning.
  - Funding cuts under the Trump administration — including the suspension of USAID contracts and rescission of $4.9 billion in foreign aid — threaten these efforts, risking a reversal of progress toward local food procurement.
  - Experts warn that reduced funding may lead to more imported food, undermining the long-term goal of empowering Haitian farmers and strengthening local food systems.
  - Despite funding shortages, the WFP maintains its commitment to the Home-Grown School Meals Programme, aiming to expand to 70,000 more students and 7,000 additional farmers by this fall.
  - Jean-Martin Bauer, WFP’s food security expert, played a pivotal role in advocating for local sourcing, drawing from personal experiences on his uncle’s rice farm in Haiti.

### Summary

In response to a severe housing shortage in Berkshire County, Massachusetts, historic inns like the Thornewood Inn and Windflower have been converted into affordable boardinghouses by the Community Development Corporation of South Berkshire. These properties offer rent as low as $900 per month—significantly below the area’s average rent of $2,500—providing critical housing for workers in education and healthcare. Data from the UMass Donahue Institute shows a shrinking vacancy rate (down to 3.7% from 6.2% in 2018) and a near-doubling of evictions, highlighting the urgency of such initiatives. The success of these repurposed inns demonstrates a viable, community-driven solution to affordable housing in high-cost, tourist-driven towns.

### Summary

David Scott, the brother of John Scott, a man with severe spina bifida who died in 1973 at the Fernald School in Massachusetts, spent decades unaware of his brother’s existence. After discovering a list of unmarked graves at the school in 2021, David began a three-year quest to uncover his brother’s identity and history. With help from a local historian, Alex Green, and through interviews with former staff, David learned about John’s life, including his academic achievements and the harsh conditions he endured. Despite efforts to access official records, the state agency initially refused to provide them. A public appeal to Governor Maura Healey in 2024 ultimately led to the release of John’s medical files. The records revealed both John’s potential and the systemic neglect he faced. The story underscores the long-standing institutional abuse of people with disabilities, the erasure of their identities, and the importance of family, memory, and public accountability in seeking justice.

## Prosecutors turn over 130,000 pages of evidence in the killing of a Minnesota lawmaker - <small>`cnn`</small>

### Summary

In a major federal case, prosecutors have handed over over 130,000 pages of documents, more than 800 hours of audio and video, and over 2,000 photographs to the defense in the killing of former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark, as well as state Senator John Hoffman and his wife Yvette. Vance Boelter, 58, was captured near his home in Green Isle after a coordinated attack on their suburban homes on June 14, 2025, where he posed as a police officer. Boelter has pleaded not guilty to murder and attempted murder charges and claims he intended only to make citizen arrests based on an undercover investigation into alleged vaccine-related deaths. His defense team says they have spent nearly 110 hours just downloading the evidence and are still reviewing it, noting delays due to a federal government shutdown. Prosecutors have not set a trial date, and while Minnesota abolished capital punishment in 1911, the U.S. Attorney General, Pam Bondi, will decide whether to seek the death penalty. Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty has dismissed Boelter’s claims as unfounded, and a status conference is scheduled for February 12. The case is considered one of the largest in Minnesota’s history and raises questions about political motives and federal death penalty policy under the Trump administration.

### Summary

Families of 15 victims who died in the July 4, 2025, catastrophic flooding at Camp Mystic in Kerr County, Texas, have filed four lawsuits accusing the camp and its owners, including Richard and Tweety Eastland, of gross negligence. The lawsuits allege that the camp prioritized profit over safety by housing children in flood-prone cabins, failed to evacuate them despite known flood risks and prior warnings, and provided false safety instructions that misled children and parents. Key victims include young girls like Eloise 'Lulu' Peck and Ellen Getten, and counselors such as Katherine Ferruzzo. The camp denies negligence, claiming the flood was unprecedented and that evacuation efforts began promptly. In response to the tragedy, Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed new camp safety laws requiring outdoor sirens and warning systems in flood-prone areas. Camp Mystic plans to partially reopen next summer, with only the uphill section reopening. The incident has ignited national debate over safety standards in outdoor camps and prompted calls for systemic reforms.

### Summary

In March 2012, a crime scene at a Super 8 Motel in Moore, Oklahoma, revealed the name badge of Anthony Lennon, a man recently charged with possessing child sexual abuse material. His disappearance on the same day a $100,000 felony warrant was issued raised suspicion that he may have staged his own abduction. Over the next 13 years, Moore Police and the US Marshals Service pursued the case relentlessly, reopening investigations, conducting hundreds of miles of road trips, and filing search warrants. In 2020, the US Marshals Service reactivated the case, leading to a final breakthrough when they identified a man named 'Justin Phillips' in Canton, New York, as Lennon under a false identity. After fingerprint confirmation, officers made the arrest. Despite the capture, Lennon continues to use the alias, and his attorney maintains his client's presumption of innocence. The case underscores the challenges and perseverance required to bring a fugitive with technical expertise into custody, especially when evading justice for over a decade.

### Summary

Google has filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in New York targeting a criminal organization known as 'Lighthouse,' based in China, which operates a 'phishing-as-a-service' business by selling fake website templates to scammers. The Lighthouse network allegedly created over 32,000 phishing sites between 2023 and 2024 that mimic legitimate U.S. institutions such as the U.S. Postal Service, New York City government, and West Virginia DMV. Notably, more than 100 of these templates falsely include Google's logo, creating a deceptive appearance of legitimacy and potentially compromising millions of credit cards. Google does not know the identities of the individuals involved, referring to them as 'Does 1–25' and linking them to Telegram handles like 'Kun Lun,' who declined to comment. The lawsuit’s primary goal is not prosecution but deterrence, establishing a legal precedent that such operations are illegal and enabling Google to work with other platforms to dismantle the infrastructure. The case coincides with Google’s own legal challenges, including antitrust rulings, and comes alongside public support for three bipartisan bills targeting scam operations: the GUARD Act, Foreign Robocall Elimination Act, and SCAM Act.

## Federal Judge Plans to Release Some Immigrants Arrested in Chicago Area - <small>`nytimes`</small>

- <small>tags: `immigration enforcement, Operation Midway Blitz, consent decree, federal judiciary, Chicago, warrantless arrests, human rights, law and order, judicial oversight, immigrant rights`</small>

### Summary

A federal judge in Chicago, Jeffrey Cummings, has ordered the release of 615 immigrants arrested during Operation Midway Blitz, a large-scale enforcement campaign under the Trump administration. The ruling stems from a 2018 consent decree that prohibits warrantless arrests in Illinois and six other states, which the judge found had been repeatedly violated. The released individuals will be required to post bonds and undergo electronic monitoring, while still facing potential removal through immigration court. The Department of Homeland Security criticized the decision, claiming it endangers public safety, while plaintiff lawyers argue that the entire crackdown constitutes unlawful and abusive enforcement. The ruling reflects broader judicial scrutiny of immigration enforcement tactics, with other federal judges previously criticizing the use of force and poor detention conditions in Chicago-area facilities.

### Summary

In a military operation in Guaviare province, Colombia's defense forces conducted an air strike targeting a dissident faction of the Farc led by Iván Mordisco, resulting in at least 19 deaths. The attack followed a breakdown in peace negotiations and a deadly attack on a military facility in Cali. President Gustavo Petro, Colombia’s first left-wing leader, authorized the operation after assessing an imminent threat, despite previously opposing air strikes. Mordisco, a former Farc commander, is considered one of Colombia’s most dangerous drug traffickers and perpetrators of child recruitment. The incident intensified diplomatic tensions with the United States, which accused Petro of enabling drug trafficking and imposed sanctions, prompting Petro to suspend intelligence sharing and argue that the fight against drugs must respect human rights, especially in the Caribbean region.

  - Colombian President Gustavo Petro, Colombia’s first left-wing president, authorized the attack after claiming the group posed an imminent threat to public safety.
  - The operation followed a breakdown in peace talks, with Mordisco’s group walking out after six months, and after a deadly attack on a military facility in Cali in August.
  - The U.S. has accused Petro of enabling drug trafficking, leading to financial sanctions, and he has responded by suspending intelligence sharing with U.S. agencies.

## Seven migrants rescued after Mediterranean shipwreck leaves 42 presumed dead - <small>`bbc`</small>

### Summary

In a tragic incident on 3 November 2025, a migrant dinghy capsized off the coast of Zuwara, Libya, with 42 people presumed dead and only seven survivors—originally from Sudan, Nigeria, Cameroon, and Somalia—rescued near the al-Buri Oil Field after six days at sea. The event underscores the extreme dangers of the Central Mediterranean route, where over 1,000 deaths have been recorded in 2025 alone. Libya remains a primary departure point for migrants, with rising numbers of deaths and overcrowded, unseaworthy vessels. European search and rescue groups have suspended cooperation with Libya's coastguard, citing widespread human rights abuses such as torture, rape, and forced labor in detention camps, accusing the Libyan coastguard of being a decentralized network of armed militias funded by EU resources. This crisis reflects broader patterns of increased migration pressure due to deteriorating land routes into Europe and the humanitarian and political failures in the Mediterranean migration system.

# Politics & Governance

## The Epstein files petition now has its 218th signature. What happens next? - <small>`cnn`</small>

### Summary

Adelita Grijalva’s swearing-in as a U.S. Representative provided the final signature needed for a discharge petition to force a vote in the House on a bill requiring the release of Jeffrey Epstein case files. The petition, led by Republican Thomas Massie and Democrat Ro Khanna, relies on a procedural tool allowing any member to push a vote even if leadership opposes it. Although the House Speaker, Mike Johnson, has committed to bringing the bill to the floor next week, the effort faces significant hurdles, including resistance from President Donald Trump, the Senate’s Republican leadership (notably John Thune), and the argument that extensive documents have already been released by the House Oversight Committee. Even if the House passes the bill, it would face a high bar in the Senate, where 60 votes are needed and Republican opposition is likely. The effort underscores a broader political debate over transparency in criminal investigations and the balance between executive discretion and public accountability.

### Key Takeaways
  - Adelita Grijalva's swearing-in provided the 218th and final signature needed to trigger a discharge petition for a vote on the Jeffrey Epstein files release bill.
  - The discharge petition, led by Republican Thomas Massie and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, is a procedural tool allowing the House to vote on a bill even if leadership opposes it.
  - House Speaker Mike Johnson has committed to bringing the bill to the floor next week, despite earlier calling it a 'moot point' and citing existing oversight documents.
  - The bill would still need to pass the GOP-controlled Senate, which is unlikely due to opposition from Republican leaders like John Thune and the lack of perceived need for new legislation given existing disclosures.
  - President Donald Trump has publicly opposed the effort, making bipartisan support difficult and raising political risks for any party supporting the bill.
  - Even if the House approves the bill, procedural votes and debate would be required, and the Senate would need 60 votes to advance it — a major hurdle given Republican opposition.
  - The effort is politically charged, forcing Republicans to choose between supporting President Trump's position or backing transparency on Epstein-related crimes.

### Named Entities
- **Adelita Grijalva**
    - U.S. Representative, Democrat, newly sworn in member of the U.S. House of Representatives

    - The date marks the update of the article, indicating the timeline of the discharge petition's progress and the final signature required to trigger a House floor vote.

### Important Timeframes

### Summary

Speaker Mike Johnson announced that the U.S. House will vote next week on a bill to compel the Department of Justice to release all Jeffrey Epstein case files, following a successful discharge petition by Republican Thomas Massie and Democrat Ro Khanna. The vote comes amid rising internal pressure within the GOP, as members like Tim Burchett and others express frustration over months of delay, fearing accusations of protecting pedophiles. While the House Oversight Committee released 20,000 new pages of documents — including emails where Epstein mentioned Donald Trump — Speaker Johnson dismissed the findings as a 'massive distraction' and emphasized that President Trump supports maximum transparency. Despite GOP leadership resistance, two Republican representatives, Warren Davidson and Eli Crane, have committed to voting in favor, while others like Clay Higgins oppose the bill. The event underscores the intersection of legislative procedure, political pressure, and public scrutiny over connections between high-profile figures and Epstein.

## Congress Sends Funding Package to Reopen Federal Government for Trump's Signature - <small>`cnn`</small>

### Summary

After a 43-day federal shutdown—the longest in U.S. history—Congress passed a short-term funding bill to reopen the government, ending a six-week stalemate over an Obamacare program. The bill, passed by a 222–209 margin in the House with bipartisan support, includes critical protections for SNAP and WIC programs, ensuring food and nutrition services continue even during future shutdowns. However, Democrats criticized the bill for lacking any guarantee of future health care subsidies. A controversial provision allowing senators to sue the DOJ over phone records obtained during a Biden-era probe—potentially awarding them $500,000 per violation—raised accusations of 'self-dealing' and prompted Speaker Mike Johnson to vow to remove it in future sessions. The decision also coincided with heightened scrutiny over the Jeffrey Epstein files, after a newly elected Democrat, Adelita Grijalva, triggered a petition to release all DOJ records, prompting Johnson to push the release bill to the House floor earlier than expected. Meanwhile, emails and documents related to Epstein’s correspondence with Trump have emerged, intensifying political and public scrutiny. With multiple expiring deadlines approaching—including Obamacare subsidies and farm bills—Congress faces a frenetic legislative period ahead.

  - Speaker Mike Johnson admitted he was unaware of the controversial provision when it was introduced and vowed to remove it in future House action, though Republicans like Chip Roy declined to amend it to avoid delaying the shutdown.
  - A new Democratic representative, Adelita Grijalva, triggered a petition for the Justice Department to release all Epstein case files, prompting Johnson to bring a bill to the House floor earlier than expected.
  - House Democrats released emails showing Epstein mentioning Trump by name, while GOP-led oversight released 200,000 pages from Epstein’s estate, increasing public scrutiny over the files and their political implications.

### Summary

The Trump administration held a Situation Room meeting with key Republican lawmakers, including Rep. Lauren Boebert, to address a growing House effort to force the release of Justice Department files related to Jeffrey Epstein. The House discharge petition, which requires 218 signatures, was completed with the support of Democratic Rep. Adelita Grijalva, enabling a floor vote. The petition has drawn support from several Republican members, including Boebert, Nancy Mace, and Marjorie Taylor Greene, highlighting internal Republican division over transparency. While the White House, including press secretary Karoline Leavitt, framed the meeting as a sign of transparency, the administration has not detailed specific discussions. The controversy is further fueled by newly released documents from the House Oversight Committee, which include references to Trump, though the White House dismissed those as proving nothing. The push to release the files must still pass through the Senate and be signed into law by President Trump, who has criticized the effort. No criminal charges have been filed against Trump, and Ghislaine Maxwell previously stated there was no wrongdoing by Trump in Epstein’s case, adding complexity to the public narrative.

### Summary

A federal judge, Jeffrey Cummings, ordered the release of 615 individuals arrested during Operation Midway Blitz, a sweeping immigration crackdown by ICE agents in the Chicago area from June to October 2025. The lawsuit, led by the National Immigrant Justice Center and the ACLU, alleged that over 3,000 people were unlawfully detained, violating a 2022 settlement agreement on warrantless arrests. The judge ruled that detainees who do not pose a significant threat and lack mandatory detention orders should be granted bond by November 21. The decision was criticized by the Department of Homeland Security, which claimed it puts American lives at risk, while advocates highlighted constitutional violations, racial profiling, and the detention of individuals like teacher Diana Galeano, whose unlawful arrest sparked public outrage. The case also involved legal challenges to senior enforcement official Gregory Bovino, who faced criticism for lying about the use of tear gas and for leading federal operations in politically sensitive areas without local consent. This ruling marks a significant legal setback to the Trump administration’s mass deportation strategy and underscores ongoing tensions over constitutional rights and law enforcement tactics.

### Summary

New emails from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate, released by the House Oversight Committee, include references to Donald Trump, raising questions about his awareness of Epstein's activities. In a 2011 email, Epstein calls Trump the 'dog that hasn't barked,' referencing a woman (identified as Virginia Giuffre) who spent hours with Trump at his house. A 2019 email indicates Trump knew about Ghislaine Maxwell’s recruitment efforts at Mar-a-Lago, prompting speculation about Trump’s knowledge. A 2015 email suggests Epstein and author Michael Wolff strategized on how Trump should deny past ties to Epstein, with Wolff advising to 'let him hang himself.' Epstein also reportedly claimed to have given his girlfriend to Trump in the 1990s and had photos of Trump with girls. These revelations deepen public scrutiny of Trump’s knowledge and response, especially given his past evasiveness. The White House dismissed the emails as proving nothing, while congressional efforts to release full Epstein documents continue, with bipartisan support despite White House resistance.

### Summary

In a chaotic day of immigration enforcement in Chicago, Department of Homeland Security agents were shot at in the Little Village neighborhood, with a suspect from Mexico arrested in connection to the incident. The shooting occurred after a male driver in a black Jeep Wrangler opened fire on agents near 26th Street and Kedzie Avenue. Meanwhile, federal agents were accused of deploying flash-bang grenades and pepper spray without warning against peaceful protesters, sparking outrage from community members and local officials. Border Patrol Chief Greg Bovino was accused of lying about being struck by a rock and using tear gas, prompting a federal judge to rule that the government’s claims were false and that the use of force was unlawful. The Trump administration appealed the ruling, but the case remains under review. Community leaders, including Mayor Brandon Johnson, Alderman Mike Rodriguez, and Rep. Jesús García, condemned the operations as provocative, illegal, and designed to incite violence, calling the actions 'state-sponsored terrorism' and emphasizing peaceful resistance. The incident intensified tensions between federal immigration enforcement and the local population, raising serious questions about the legitimacy, transparency, and proportionality of federal operations in a major U.S. city.

### Summary

British police have issued a public appeal for information regarding a racially aggravated incident that occurred on October 11, 2025, at Bond Street Tube Station in central London. A woman was allegedly assaulted and racially abused as she entered the station with her family, with a man and woman reportedly shouting abuse, pulling out a prohibited pepper spray, and spraying the victim.

## Speaker Johnson’s narrow majority shrinks further after Democrat Adelita Grijalva sworn in - <small>`cnn`</small>

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/politics/narrow-house-majority-congress-dg)

- **Politics & Governance**
- <small>tags: `House of Representatives, political instability, Jeffrey Epstein case files, narrow majority, bipartisan legislation, government shutdown, special election, Congressional history`</small>

### Summary

Following a delay, Democrat Adelita Grijalva was sworn in as a new member of the U.S. House of Representatives, reducing Speaker Mike Johnson’s Republican majority from 219 to 214. This narrow partisan split—mirroring the closest House majority since the 1930s—creates significant legislative challenges, particularly in passing major bills. Grijalva’s entry enables a pivotal vote to compel the release of Jeffrey Epstein case files, with bipartisan support from Reps. Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna. The current dynamic is further complicated by two vacant seats: one in Republican-leaning Tennessee (to be filled by a special election next month) and one in Texas (pending a runoff). Johnson had previously refused to convene the House, delaying action on the government shutdown and the Epstein files. The tight margin has already resulted in Republican legislative setbacks, such as the failed tax and spending cuts bill due to defections. Historically, similar narrow majorities have led to instability, as seen in the 72nd Congress during the Great Depression, where shifting vacancies and deaths altered party control.

### Key Takeaways
  - Speaker Mike Johnson's narrow Republican majority in the House has shrunk from 219 to 214 after Democrat Adelita Grijalva was sworn in following a delayed process.
  - The House is now at 219 Republicans and 214 Democrats, with two vacant seats—Tennessee (Republican-leaning) and Texas (pending runoff)—which impacts the chamber’s overall balance and legislative capacity.
  - A critical vote on releasing Jeffrey Epstein case files is expected, with Grijalva expected to deliver the decisive vote on a bipartisan petition from Rep. Thomas Massie and Rep. Ro Khanna.
  - Johnson refused to call the House into session for weeks after Grijalva’s special election win, delaying legislative action and raising questions about political accountability and urgency.
  - The narrowest House majority since the 1930s has created significant challenges for Republicans in passing legislation, including a failed tax and spending cuts bill due to two Republican defectors.
  - Historically, such narrow majorities have led to instability, with past Congresses experiencing shifts due to deaths and special elections, as seen in the 72nd Congress during the Great Depression.
  - A tie vote in the House fails, and passage requires a majority of members present and voting—making the current dynamic highly sensitive to absences or vacancies.

## The last-ever penny was minted today in Philadelphia - <small>`cnn`</small>

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/business/last-penny-minted)
- _Published: 2025-11-12 13:59:00-05:00_
- **Politics & Governance**
- <small>tags: `currency, penny, U.S. Mint, monetary policy, retail, economic policy, legal compliance, coin production, Trump administration, consumer behavior`</small>

### Summary

The U.S. Mint officially ceased production of the penny on November 12, 2025, after 238 years, following a directive from President Donald Trump in February 2025. Despite being legally tender, the penny's discontinuation has created significant logistical and financial challenges for retailers, who face legal risks and financial losses from rounding prices to the nearest nickel. Some states and cities require exact change, and the SNAP program mandates precise pricing, making such rounding legally problematic. Retailers like Kwik Trip have adopted rounding policies that cost millions annually. The U.S. Mint may face increased costs due to producing more nickels. The penny, first minted in 1787 and featuring Lincoln in 1909, has declined in use and is now largely obsolete, though it holds sentimental value for many. There is no national transition plan, unlike in countries such as Canada and Australia, and consumer and business backlash remains unresolved.

### Key Takeaways
  - The last U.S. penny was minted in Philadelphia on November 12, 2025, ending 238 years of production.
  - The penny costs nearly four cents to produce, more than its face value, making it economically unsustainable.
  - Despite being legally tender, the penny's removal from circulation has caused widespread retail and consumer problems, including rounding to the nearest nickel.
  - Retailers like Kwik Trip face financial losses from rounding policies, with potential annual costs of millions of dollars.
  - Several states and cities, including New York, Philadelphia, and Miami, require exact change, creating legal risks for businesses that round prices.
  - The federal SNAP program requires precise pricing, making rounding dangerous for merchants who serve low-income customers.
  - The U.S. Mint may actually incur higher costs by producing more nickels to replace pennies, offsetting savings from discontinuing the penny.
  - The end of penny production lacks a national policy or transition plan, unlike in countries like Canada and Australia.
  - The penny was first minted in 1787 and featured Abraham Lincoln in 1909; it is now considered obsolete but nostalgic.
  - Public sentiment is muted, as most people no longer use pennies regularly, though they hold sentimental value.

- <small>tags: `Thanksgiving flights, government shutdown, air traffic control shortage, flight cancellations, travel disruption, airline recovery, contingency planning, travel insurance, regional flight cancellations, flight delays, post-shutdown recovery`</small>

### Summary

This article addresses the potential for flight disruptions during the Thanksgiving 2025 travel season, caused by the ongoing U.S. government shutdown and related air traffic controller shortages. While Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and Delta CEO Ed Bastian suggest that normal operations may resume by Thanksgiving, the FAA has already reduced flights at 40 airports due to staffing shortages, with controller retirements rising to 15–20 per day. Industry leaders like Chris Sununu and Katy Nastro warn that full recovery will take time, and disruptions may persist. Travelers are advised to use flight-tracking apps, book with disruption assistance services, prepare backup plans (e.g., car rentals or train travel), and avoid basic economy fares. Travel insurance coverage is typically excluded for known events like shutdowns, and travelers are encouraged to review their policies. The article highlights both the severity of the staffing crisis and the practical steps individuals can take to remain flexible and prepared.

### Key Takeaways
  - Airlines may recover from the government shutdown's impact on flight operations within a week or two, but not immediately after the shutdown ends due to lingering staffing shortages.
  - Air traffic controller shortages have worsened, with daily retirements rising from an average of four to 15–20 per day during the shutdown, which will persist beyond government reopening.
  - The FAA has ordered flight reductions at 40 US airports, initially by 8% on Thursday and 10% on Friday, and will not lift restrictions until controllers return and operations are deemed safe.
  - Travelers are advised to prepare with flight tracking apps, alternative booking options, and contingency plans (e.g., car rentals, train travel) to manage disruptions.
  - Many travel insurance policies exclude coverage for known events like government shutdowns; travelers should check for 'Cancel For Any Reason' or 'Interruption For Any Reason' coverage.
  - Basic economy fares may not be eligible for flight change waivers, so travelers should avoid them when possible.
  - Regional flights are more vulnerable to cancellation, especially under 500 miles, and cancellations affect fewer passengers per flight.
  - Airlines like Delta and American may face delays or disruptions, but experts suggest that if the government reopens quickly, disruptions will be limited, though not absent.

## Two blasts a day apart in India and Pakistan’s capitals fray regional nerves in an already tense year - <small>`cnn`</small>

- **Politics & Governance**
- <small>tags: `South Asia, terrorism, India-Pakistan tensions, security crisis, regional instability, suicide bombing, blame game, military escalation, cross-border conflict, public safety, political rhetoric, Afghanistan, militant groups`</small>

### Summary

Two coordinated terrorist attacks—one in Delhi, India, and one in Islamabad, Pakistan—occurred within 24 hours in November 2025, marking a rare and severe escalation in regional security. The Delhi blast, which killed at least 10 and injured over 15 in a historic neighborhood near the Red Fort, and the Islamabad bombing, which killed at least 12 and injured 20 in the judicial complex, are the deadliest such attacks in their capitals in nearly two decades. Pakistan accused India of sponsoring the Islamabad attack through militant groups operating from Afghan soil, while India rejected the claim, labeling it a 'baseless diversion' and asserting the Delhi blast was carried out by 'anti-national forces'. The militant group Jamaat-ul-Ahrar claimed responsibility for the Islamabad attack, though the TTP distanced itself. In response, Pakistan declared a 'state of war' and intensified security measures. The attacks have reignited a long-standing cycle of political blame and mutual suspicion between the two nuclear-armed rivals, with experts warning of a potential regional crisis involving India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. Both nations have historically considered their capitals secure, so these attacks signal a dangerous shift in the vulnerability of major urban centers. As investigations continue and political rhetoric escalates, the region faces a critical moment of volatility, demanding restraint, reflection, and a renewed commitment to regional stability.

### Key Takeaways
  - Two separate suicide bombings—one in Islamabad and one in Delhi—occur within 24 hours of each other, signaling a serious deterioration in regional security.
  - The attacks are rare in their capitals, which have historically been considered secure, suggesting a growing threat to major urban centers in South Asia.
  - Pakistan accused India of sponsoring the Islamabad attack through 'terrorist proxies' from Afghan soil, while India rejected the claim, labeling it a 'baseless diversionary ploy'.
  - India labeled the Delhi blast a 'terrorist incident' carried out by 'anti-national forces', without naming Pakistan, but past patterns suggest such accusations are politically charged.
  - The militant group Jamaat-ul-Ahrar (JuA), a splinter of the TTP, claimed responsibility for the Islamabad bombing, though the TTP distanced itself.
  - Pakistan declared a 'state of war' in response to the Islamabad attack, citing Afghanistan as a source of militant threats, a reference to ongoing cross-border tensions.
  - The Afghan Taliban denied supporting the Pakistani Taliban and condemned the attack, adding complexity to regional security dynamics.
  - Experts warn that the current situation could escalate into a broader crisis involving India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan due to deep-rooted narratives of mutual suspicion and blame.
  - The attacks have intensified political pressure on both governments, with leaders using them to justify stronger security measures or military actions.
  - The cycle of accusation and hyperbole, long established in South Asian politics, risks pushing the region toward dangerous confrontation and instability.

### Named Entities

- **Jamaat-ul-Ahrar (JuA)**
    - A splinter group of the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing in Islamabad on November 11, 2025.

- **Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP)**
    - A militant group operating in Pakistan that has been responsible for multiple attacks. It distanced itself from the Islamabad bombing, though it is linked to the broader militant landscape.

### Summary

President Donald Trump defended the U.S. H-1B skilled worker visa program, arguing that the country lacks workers with 'certain talents' to fill essential domestic jobs, citing the September 2025 ICE raid on a Georgia Hyundai battery plant where South Korean contractors were deported.

### Summary

At the COP30 climate summit in Belém, Brazil, California Governor Gavin Newsom delivered a sharp critique of President Donald Trump, calling him an 'invasive species' and a 'wrecking ball' for abandoning U.S. climate commitments and rolling back clean energy progress. Newsom argued that Trump's policies—such as withdrawing from the Paris Agreement and promoting fossil fuel expansion—have empowered China in clean energy markets and undermined American leadership. He rejected reports of planned oil drilling off California’s coast, asserting the plan is politically motivated and impossible. Newsom emphasized the need to make climate change relatable through real-world events like the 2025 Los Angeles wildfires and advocated for affordable, community-centered climate policies. The White House responded with a counterattack, accusing Newsom of hypocrisy due to the environmental cost of the summit’s infrastructure, which required clearing rainforest land for a special-purpose highway.

## Trump Threatens to Sue BBC for $1 Billion Over Speech Editing Allegations - <small>`cnn`</small>

- <small>tags: `defamation, media bias, BBC crisis, Donald Trump, political media conflict, public broadcasting, editorial integrity, UK media, US-Britain relations`</small>

### Summary

Donald Trump threatened to sue the BBC for $1 billion over allegations that a documentary titled 'Trump: A Second Chance?' misrepresented his January 6, 2021 speech by splicing together two separate statements — one calling for cheering supporters and another calling for fighting like hell — to falsely imply a direct call for violent action. The BBC, which is publicly funded and committed to editorial impartiality, admitted in a letter to a parliamentary committee that it made an 'error of judgment' in the editing. The controversy was amplified by a leaked memo from former BBC adviser Michael Prescott, which criticized the editorial approach and revealed internal awareness of the issue for months. This led to the resignation of BBC Director General Tim Davie and Chief Executive Deborah Turness. Trump's legal action, being filed in Florida, aims to assert his claim of defamation and reputational harm, though it faces significant legal and financial hurdles, as the BBC’s financial reserves are insufficient for a $1 billion payout. The incident reflects a broader crisis of trust in public broadcasting and underscores a pattern of Trump’s legal challenges against media organizations over editing claims.

  - The BBC, funded by a license fee and operating under a royal charter, maintains a public service mission of impartiality, though it has faced accusations of bias from both political sides.
  - Trump’s legal action is being filed in Florida, which allows for a longer statute of limitations, though it weakens his argument by requiring proof of audience impact in a specific jurisdiction.
  - The BBC has a revenue of approximately $7.8 billion annually, with $627 million in cash reserves, suggesting it could not realistically cover a $1 billion payout.

### Summary

In November 2025, US President Donald Trump wrote a letter to Israeli President Isaac Herzog requesting a full pardon for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is facing criminal charges of fraud, bribery, and breach of trust in multiple cases.

## FAA Workers Grapple with Possible Shutdown Deal as Officials Try to Navigate Upcoming Holiday Travel Rush - <small>`cnn`</small>

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/us/faa-workers-shutdown-deal)

- <small>tags: `government shutdown, FAA, air traffic control, federal employees, holiday travel crisis, back pay, political deadlock, aviation safety, family impact, economic hardship`</small>

### Summary

A prolonged U.S. government shutdown in late 2025 has severely impacted the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), with over 5,000 workers and 14,000 air traffic controllers working without pay. The shutdown has led to flight cancellations at 40 U.S. airports, mass absences among controllers due to exhaustion, illness, or financial stress, and significant disruptions in air travel during a peak holiday season. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy calls the situation a 'crisis within aviation,' and confirms that controllers will receive partial back pay (70% within 24–48 hours, 30% within a week). A bipartisan funding measure, passed by the Senate, now moves to the House for final approval. Personal stories, such as that of Atlanta mother Amanda James and her husband—a controller—highlight the emotional and financial toll on families, including delayed medical care and the need for side income. President Donald Trump urged controllers to return to work and proposed a $10,000 bonus for those who remained, but such incentives are not guaranteed. The article underscores the broader societal impact of government shutdowns, especially on essential services and vulnerable families.

  - The shutdown has caused significant disruptions in air travel, with 40 U.S. airports seeing reduced flight operations and many air traffic controllers taking unscheduled leave due to exhaustion, illness, or financial stress.
  - Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy described the situation as a 'crisis within aviation' and confirmed that air traffic controllers will receive partial back pay (70% within 24–48 hours, 30% one week later) once funding resumes.
  - Affected families, such as the James family, face real-life consequences, including delayed medical procedures, financial strain, and the need to pursue side income to survive.

## How the Trump Administration Seeks to 'Weaponize' the White House Website to Troll Democrats and Amplify Its Message - <small>`cnn`</small>

- <small>tags: `political manipulation, White House website, digital strategy, misinformation, meme culture, government transparency, Hatch Act, Trump administration, democratic integrity`</small>

### Summary

The Trump administration has significantly altered the official White House website (whitehouse.gov) from its original role as a neutral, informative government resource into a politically aggressive platform. The site now includes a timer tracking 'Democrats Have Shut Down the Government,' a satirical 'mysafespace' page mocking Democrats—particularly Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer—with memes like 'Sombrero Guy' and references to 'illegal immigrants' and 'transnational gangs.' The administration has also added misleading or false entries to the 'Major Events Timeline,' such as falsely linking Hunter Biden to cocaine and misrepresenting Obama’s pre-presidential visit to Kenya. Former White House officials from previous administrations, including George W. Bush and Barack Obama, argue that these changes represent a dangerous erosion of public trust, shifting the website from a factual record to a tool for partisan attacks. While the administration claims to operate within legal boundaries (e.g., the Hatch Act), critics contend that the content is politically motivated, unverified, and designed to provoke outrage and social media sharing. This strategy reflects a broader digital shift under Trump, where the site is used not just for information but as a vehicle to troll opponents and amplify a partisan narrative.

  - The use of AI-generated content, memes, and user-generated email drafts (e.g., pre-written messages to Jeffries and Schumer) reflects a shift toward entertainment and digital trolling over transparency and civic service.
  - Critics like Ashleigh Axios and Macon Phillips argue the strategy is a red herring that distracts from pressing issues like rising healthcare costs and economic stability.

## How Japan’s new prime minister has brought China’s ‘wolf warriors’ back out - <small>`cnn`</small>

- <small>tags: `Japan-China relations, Taiwan issue, Wolf warrior diplomacy, Sanae Takaichi, Xi Jinping, Nanjing Massacre, Strategic ambiguity, Geopolitical tension, Historical grievances, Diplomatic crisis`</small>

### Summary

Japan’s new female prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, sparked a major diplomatic crisis with China by stating in parliament that a Chinese attack on Taiwan would threaten Japan’s survival and could trigger a military response. China responded with intense rhetoric, including a deleted social media post by its consul general in Osaka threatening to 'cut off' Takaichi’s neck, and state media criticism from outlets like People’s Daily and commentator Hu Xijin, who warned of 'beheading' Japanese militarists. The incident reflects a resurgence of China’s 'wolf warrior' diplomacy, fueled by historical grievances such as the Nanjing Massacre and Japan’s colonial rule over Taiwan. Despite being Japan’s largest trading partner, the two nations are now at odds, with Takaichi’s hardline stance echoing past leaders like Shinzo Abe. The conflict is further complicated by the 80th anniversary of WWII, during which China commemorated its victory and intensified anti-Japanese sentiment, and by prior diplomatic incidents like former U.S. President Joe Biden’s comments on military intervention in Taiwan, which similarly provoked backlash. Takaichi’s remarks, while framed as hypothetical, have reignited long-standing tensions over Taiwan and regional security, marking a significant shift in Japan-China relations.

  - The controversy is rooted in historical tensions, such as Japan’s colonial rule over Taiwan during WWII and the Nanjing Massacre, which China continues to memorialize and use as justification for current political stances.
  - Takaichi, influenced by hardline conservative policies similar to former PM Shinzo Abe, has emphasized Japan’s defense capabilities and raised concerns about China’s military presence in the region, particularly around Taiwan and in the East China Sea.
  - The spat occurs amid broader regional instability, with China ramping up military drills near Taiwan and Taiwan’s status remaining a flashpoint in cross-strait and international politics.

## Trump’s 2026 redistricting scheme could wind up hurting democracy more than Democrats - <small>`cnn`</small>

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/politics/redistricting-trump-democrats)

### Summary

President Donald Trump's push for aggressive redistricting in 2025 to create more GOP-leaning districts has not yielded the desired electoral gains for Republicans in 2026. While Republicans have gained a few seats in states like Texas, Ohio, and Missouri, Democrats have responded effectively with new maps in California and Utah, bolstered by strong voter outcomes and legal interventions. The article argues that the real damage from Trump’s actions may not be in changing seat counts, but in normalizing partisan redistricting tactics that erode competitive elections and democratic norms. Factors such as shifting voter demographics—especially among Hispanic communities—and the potential future weakening of the Voting Rights Act could further complicate GOP efforts. Despite possible GOP gains of three to five seats, Democrats are likely to maintain control of the House due to historical patterns of mid-term performance. Ultimately, the article concludes that Trump’s redistricting strategy may be more harmful to American democracy than to the Democratic Party's electoral prospects.

### Key Takeaways
  - Trump's redistricting strategy, aimed at creating more GOP-leaning districts, may not lead to significant gains for Republicans in the 2026 elections.
  - Democrats have gained ground through state-specific redistricting efforts, such as in California and Utah, where new Democratic-leaning districts were established.
  - Legal challenges and shifting voter demographics — especially among Hispanic communities — are weakening GOP redistricting efforts, particularly in Texas.
  - The overall political norm of fair and competitive districts is being undermined, potentially leading to a long-term decline in competitive elections.
  - The possibility of the Supreme Court striking down part of the Voting Rights Act could enable more aggressive gerrymandering in the South, fundamentally altering future election dynamics.
  - Even if Republicans gain 3–5 seats, this would not prevent Democrats from controlling the House due to historical patterns of opposition-party gains in midterms.
  - The real damage from Trump’s redistricting scheme may be not in electoral outcomes but in normalizing aggressive, partisan redistricting tactics that erode democratic norms.

### Summary

Ahmed Al-Sharaa, a former jihadist fighter who joined Al-Qaeda-backed rebels in Syria’s civil war, has risen to become the country’s president after a surprise military offensive that toppled the 53-year rule of Bashar al-Assad. In a historic visit to the White House in November 2025, Al-Sharaa became the first Syrian head of state to meet with U.S. leadership, signaling a dramatic shift from isolation to diplomatic engagement. The visit, praised by President Donald Trump as a sign of strength and resilience, includes efforts to remove U.S. sanctions, join the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, and promote counterterrorism and regional peace. Al-Sharaa’s foreign policy is carefully balanced, including a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, to avoid alienating major powers. This transformation reflects a broader effort to reverse Syria’s decades-long diplomatic and economic isolation, driven by regional allies such as Saudi Arabia and Turkey, and viewed as a strategic move for U.S. security amid regional instability in Iraq and Lebanon.

The bill now moves to the House, where Republican leaders, including Speaker Mike Johnson, are pushing for approval, while Democratic leaders, especially Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, are opposing it. The package also includes a reversal of federal worker firings and payment of back wages. The House plans to vote on the bill on Wednesday, with a procedural rule vote expected to follow. President Donald Trump has endorsed the plan and expressed support for its passage. The outcome hinges on narrow GOP majorities, moderates, and potential cross-party support from Democrats like Jared Golden.

### Summary

Congress is moving swiftly to pass a bipartisan funding bill to end the longest federal government shutdown in U.S. history. The House and Senate have approved a compromise package that provides temporary funding for most federal agencies through January 30, 2026, while ensuring full-year funding for key programs like the USDA, Veterans Affairs, and the legislative branch.

A new provision requires the Justice Department and FBI to notify the Senate when a lawmaker is under investigation. Eight Democratic senators defied party leadership by supporting the bill without extending Affordable Care Act subsidies, which will be addressed in a separate vote next month. This resolution averts a potential repeat shutdown and strengthens public trust in federal services, especially in food assistance and worker protections.

## Supreme Court Keeps Full SNAP Payments on Hold with Short-Term Order - <small>`cnn`</small>

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/politics/supreme-court-extends-hold-on-full-snap-payments)

### Summary

The Supreme Court extended a short-term administrative stay, blocking the Trump administration from providing full SNAP benefits in November, as part of a legal standoff over a government shutdown. This decision stems from lower court rulings, including one by U.S. District Judge John McConnell, which found the administration’s partial benefits to be arbitrary. The administration argued that court-ordered full payments would interfere with shutdown negotiations, while beneficiaries—including nearly 42 million Americans—faced real hunger risks, with 27 million expected to receive their payments by Monday. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson issued an emergency stay and later dissented from its extension, signaling judicial concern over executive overreach. While 16 states provided full benefits and five gave partial ones, the legal limbo highlights tensions between political actions and public welfare during a government shutdown.

### Key Takeaways
  - The Supreme Court extended a short-term administrative stay that prevents the Trump administration from providing full SNAP benefits in November.
  - This legal action is linked to a broader government shutdown, with the administration arguing that court-ordered full payments would interfere with efforts to end the shutdown.
  - Nearly 42 million Americans rely on SNAP benefits, with 27 million expected to receive their monthly allotments by Monday, and many families spending their $350 average monthly benefit quickly.
  - Lower courts, including U.S. District Judge John McConnell in Rhode Island, ruled that the administration acted arbitrarily by providing only partial benefits, ordering full payments as a matter of due process.

### Summary

Marion County, Kansas, has agreed to pay $3 million and issue a public apology for a 2023 raid on the Marion County Record, a small-town newspaper, which involved the seizure of reporters’ phones and computers and the search of the publisher’s and a councilwoman’s homes. The raid was reportedly based on a false claim that a reporter unlawfully obtained a restaurant owner’s driving records. Police Chief Gideon Cody, who led the raid, resigned and was charged with interfering with the judicial process. The incident sparked five federal lawsuits by the newspaper’s publisher, editor, employees, and the estate of co-owner Joan Meyer, who died a day after the raid—her death is believed to have been stress-related. The county and sheriff’s office acknowledged wrongdoing in the settlement, emphasizing the apology as more valuable than the financial payout. A separate lawsuit against the city of Marion remains pending. The case is seen as a pivotal moment in the national debate over press freedom and law enforcement overreach, with advocates arguing that such actions will be deterred through legal consequences.

While the NFL’s medical leadership, including Allen Sills, praises the rule as a success, Trump continues to argue that it undermines football’s traditional spirit and has called for its reversal, especially in college football.

### Summary

Serbian protesters, led by youth, have formed a human shield around a bombed-out military complex in Belgrade to prevent its redevelopment into a luxury compound by Affinity Global Development, a company linked to Jared Kushner, son-in-law of U.S. President Donald Trump. The site, partially destroyed in a 1999 NATO bombing, is viewed as a national symbol of resistance to foreign aggression and is protected by heritage status. Despite opposition from experts and the public, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic’s government has approved the $500-million project, citing economic benefits and stronger U.S. ties. However, critics allege that documents used to strip the complex of protected status were forged. The controversy is part of a broader wave of protests against Vucic’s government, which has faced accusations of corruption and poor project management, especially following a deadly train station collapse in Novi Sad in 2024. A similar Kushner-linked project in Albania has also raised concerns about regional political influence.

## Trump’s flailing on the economy is worse than Biden’s - <small>`cnn`</small>

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/politics/trump-economy-biden-analysis)
- _Published: 2025-11-11 20:17:00-05:00_
- **Politics & Governance**
- <small>tags: `Trump, Biden, inflation, economy, economic policy, politics, public trust, media commentary, polling data, economic misinformation`</small>

### Summary

The article analyzes how President Donald Trump’s recent downplaying of economic inflation and affordability concerns — including calling polls 'fake' and claiming there is no inflation — has created a greater political liability than President Joe Biden’s earlier misjudgment of inflation as 'transitory.' While Biden’s economic missteps were politically costly when inflation persisted, Trump’s approach is more extreme, involving outright denial of economic reality. Public opinion polls show a strong tendency to blame Trump for economic hardship, even as he attempts to deflect responsibility onto Democrats and falsely claims data is fabricated. The article underscores that Trump’s failure to address affordability head-on — despite a majority of Americans saying the administration has neglected this issue — has intensified public distrust and solidified his role as a politically vulnerable figure in the current economic climate.

### Key Takeaways
  - President Donald Trump has made repeated, misleading claims about inflation and economic conditions, including asserting that polls showing economic anxiety are 'fake' and that inflation does not exist.
  - Trump’s dismissive remarks — such as calling affordability concerns a 'con job by Democrats' — are more extreme than those made by President Joe Biden, who previously downplayed inflation as 'transitory' and faced political consequences when that prediction proved wrong.
  - While inflation was a political liability under Biden due to inaccurate forecasts, it has become a major political liability under Trump due to his refusal to acknowledge economic hardships and his active downplaying of inflation and rising prices.

## Trump floats $2,000 tariff rebate checks. What you need to know - <small>`cnn`</small>

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/economy/tariff-rebate-check-proposal-what-to-know)

- **Politics & Governance**
- <small>tags: `tariff rebate checks, Donald Trump, economic policy, affordability crisis, inflation, stimulus checks, Supreme Court, Congress, tax revenue, economic stimulus, political feasibility`</small>

### Summary

President Donald Trump has proposed a $2,000 tariff rebate check for American citizens as a response to growing affordability concerns, suggesting that revenue from tariffs imposed on imported goods could fund the checks. The idea, first floated in August 2025 and reiterated on November 11, 2025, would exclude high-income individuals but would require significant financial resources—estimated at over $300 billion—exceeding the total tariff revenue collected since Trump’s second term began. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has expressed skepticism, stating no formal proposal exists and raising concerns about feasibility and legal standing. The Supreme Court’s scrutiny of Trump’s emergency tariff powers adds legal risk, as such tariffs could be invalidated and tariff revenue returned to businesses. Congress, which controls the power of the purse, would need to approve such a program, making it politically and legally untenable without legislative backing. Moreover, the proposal risks exacerbating inflation and affordability issues at a time when inflation is already a public priority, potentially alienating conservative voters and undermining monetary policy. Even if approved, the distribution process could take months, similar to the paper checks issued during the pandemic.

### Key Takeaways
  - President Donald Trump proposed a $2,000 tariff rebate check for American citizens as a response to rising affordability issues.
  - The rebate checks would be funded by tariff revenue collected from U.S. importers, not from general taxpayer funds.
  - The proposed checks would exclude high-income individuals, though no clear income threshold was specified.
  - The total cost of distributing $2,000 checks to 163 million Americans would exceed $326 billion, surpassing the $220 billion in tariff revenue collected since Trump’s second term began.
  - Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that no formal proposal exists and questioned the feasibility and forms of such a distribution.
  - The Supreme Court has shown skepticism about Trump’s emergency tariff powers, which could lead to the return of tariff revenue to businesses, reducing funds available for rebates.
  - Congress holds the power of the purse, and such a program would likely require legislative approval, not unilateral action by the President.
  - The proposal may worsen inflation and affordability concerns at a time when inflation is already a major public concern.
  - Fiscal conservatives may oppose the plan due to its potential to stimulate inflation and undermine monetary policy.
  - If implemented, the checks would be distributed similarly to pandemic stimulus checks, with paper checks taking up to 20 weeks to arrive.

## Tracking states’ unprecedented redistricting efforts - <small>`cnn`</small>

- <small>tags: `redistricting, gerrymandering, 2026 midterm elections, political polarization, Utah, Voting Rights Act, Republican strategy, Democratic response, Supreme Court, census redistricting`</small>

### Summary

In 2025, President Donald Trump and Republican leaders have launched an unprecedented wave of redistricting efforts across the U.S. to protect their narrow majority in the House ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. Democrats are responding with their own redistricting actions, resulting in legal battles and political polarization. A key case is in Utah, where a judge rejected a 2021 Republican-drawn map that violated an anti-gerrymandering ballot initiative, ordering a new map likely to produce a Democratic seat. While redistricting traditionally occurs every decade after a census, this year’s process is politically urgent due to the close House margins. Republicans have a strategic advantage in states where they control the legislature, while Democrats in some states have ceded map-drawing power to independent commissions—now facing efforts to reverse that. Ongoing legal challenges and the potential Supreme Court decision to overturn parts of the Voting Rights Act could further enable more aggressive, partisan redistricting nationwide, fundamentally reshaping the political landscape of the 2026 midterms.

### Key Takeaways
  - President Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers are actively redrawing congressional maps to protect their narrow majority in the House ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.
  - Democrats are responding with their own redistricting efforts, resulting in widespread legal and political conflicts across the country.
  - In Utah, a judge rejected a Republican-drawn map from 2021, which violated an anti-gerrymandering ballot measure, and ordered the use of a new map likely to create a Democratic seat.
  - Redistricting is typically conducted once every decade following the census, but this year’s process is politically driven and happening mid-decade due to the tight House majority.
  - The redistricting process varies by state: some states allow state legislators to redraw maps with political will, while others require constitutional changes or public votes.
  - Republicans have more opportunities to gain seats due to full control of state governments and in many Democratic states, map-drawing power has been transferred to independent commissions, which some are now trying to reverse.
  - Legal challenges are ongoing in multiple states to overturn existing redistricting maps.
  - The U.S. Supreme Court may soon rule on the Voting Rights Act, and a decision to strike down key provisions could allow for even more aggressive and politically motivated redistricting.

## Trump being urged to intervene in Tina Peters case, sources say - <small>`cnn`</small>

### Summary

Following the 2020 election, Tina Peters, a former Republican clerk from Mesa, Colorado, was convicted on state charges for participating in a scheme to prove false claims of mass voter fraud. Despite the conviction, President Donald Trump has repeatedly urged her release, calling her an 'innocent political prisoner' and threatening Colorado. The Justice Department, led by pardon attorney Ed Martin and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, is pushing for Peters to be transferred to a federal prison, citing potential threats to her safety as a witness in a federal probe into election fraud. However, Colorado officials, including Governor Jared Polis and Attorney General Phil Weiser, have firmly resisted such moves, asserting they will uphold the law and resist political pressure. A federal judge has dismissed claims of new evidence involving anonymous informants, and the Colorado Department of Corrections has stated there is no current process to transfer Peters. The case illustrates a broader conflict between political figures promoting election denial and legal institutions enforcing accountability under the rule of law.

### Key Takeaways
  - Tina Peters, a former Republican clerk from Mesa, Colorado, was convicted on state charges related to a scheme promoting false claims of mass voter fraud during the 2020 election.
  - Trump has publicly urged the release of Peters, calling her an 'innocent political prisoner' and threatening 'harsh measures' against Colorado if she is not freed.

  - Federal Magistrate Judge Scott Varholak ruled that the depositions of these informants are inadmissible in Peters’ habeas petition.
  - Colorado Governor Jared Polis and Attorney General Phil Weiser have firmly resisted Trump’s pressure, stating they will uphold the law and not engage in quid-pro-quo deals.
  - The Colorado Department of Corrections has stated there is no formal process to transfer Peters, and such a move would require internal state approval based on security and threat assessment.
  - The Justice Department’s involvement in a state case is unusual and has drawn criticism as politically motivated, especially given the lack of transparency and state-level cooperation.
  - Peters continues to advocate from prison, expressing frustration with the Justice Department’s inaction despite Trump’s repeated demands.

Turkish prosecutors have demanded a prison sentence of over 2,000 years for Ekrem Imamoglu, the opposition mayor of Istanbul, in a sweeping indictment that alleges he led a criminal network responsible for 160 billion lira ($3.8 billion) in state losses over a decade.

Imamoglu has been in prison since March 2025 and faces further legal challenges, including an appeal against a July 2025 sentence for threatening the chief prosecutor.

### Summary

The article explores the commercial and critical underperformance of recent boxing biopics, including Sydney Sweeney’s 'Christy' and other films like 'The Fire Inside' and 'Against the Ropes'.

## House votes to fund government, ending longest ever government shutdown - <small>`npr`</small>

- [source](https://text.npr.org/g-s1-97607)
- _Published: 2025-11-12 20:22:00-05:00_
- **Politics & Governance**
- <small>tags: `government shutdown, Affordable Care Act, SNAP, funding bill, political compromise, health care subsidies, Congressional negotiations, federal workers, bipartisan agreement, midterm elections`</small>

### Summary

The House of Representatives ended the longest government shutdown in history by approving a funding bill that extends government operations through January 30, 2026, with some agencies receiving funding through September 2026. The bill includes provisions to reverse shutdown-era layoffs, provide backpay to federal employees, and restore SNAP benefits. However, it fails to address the core Democratic demand—extending Affordable Care Act subsidies—which expired at the end of the year. Senate Majority Leader John Thune agreed to a December vote on a Democrat-drafted subsidy extension bill, but this arrangement is viewed by many Senate Democrats as a weak compromise. Critics, including Sen. Tammy Baldwin and Tim Kaine, argue that the outcome does not deliver meaningful policy gains and only postpones a solution. The shutdown, which lasted 43 days and affected millions, demonstrated the failure of political brinkmanship to achieve policy objectives, and both parties now face the challenge of crafting long-term legislation amid limited funding and political uncertainty.

### Key Takeaways
  - The government shutdown was the longest in history, lasting 43 days and affecting millions of Americans, including cutting pay for federal workers and disrupting critical services like air traffic control.
  - The bill passed by the House, despite a narrow Republican majority, with 222 votes in favor and 209 opposed, including six Democrats joining Republicans.
  - The bill does not address the core issue of expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies, which Democrats had demanded during the shutdown.
  - Senate Majority Leader John Thune agreed to a bipartisan vote in mid-December on a Democrat-drafted subsidy extension bill, but this lacks guarantees and faces skepticism from Senate Democrats.
  - Senators like Tammy Baldwin and Tim Kaine expressed dissatisfaction with the outcome, calling it a 'handshake deal' that fails to deliver on cost reductions or meaningful policy gains.
  - President Trump did not actively intervene in the shutdown negotiations, allowing Senate Majority Leader Thune to lead GOP strategy.
  - Democrats believe they have a strong policy issue—health care affordability—to leverage in the upcoming midterm elections, even if they fail to secure a subsidy extension.
  - Both parties must pass nine additional appropriations bills before the current funding expires, indicating the shutdown’s end is only a temporary resolution.

### Named Entities

- **Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies**

    - These subsidies expire at the end of the year and were the central demand of Democrats during the shutdown, but are not addressed in the final bill.

    - He has not committed to bringing a bill to the floor to extend ACA subsidies, creating uncertainty about future legislative action.

## The U.S. Just Produced Its Last Penny After a More Than 200-Year Run - <small>`npr`</small>

- [source](https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5407493)

- <small>tags: `penny phase out, U.S. Mint, money saving, currency reform, economic policy, Abraham Lincoln, Ben Franklin, global trends, cash vs. digital payments, coin production costs`</small>

### Summary

The U.S. Mint has officially produced its last penny, marking the end of over 200 years of continuous production. Each penny costs nearly 4 cents to produce, leading the Treasury Department to estimate annual savings of $56 million. Despite being legal tender, most pennies are stored rather than used, contributing to the financial loss. Businesses may face shortages and be forced to round prices to the nearest nickel, though declining cash usage—only 14% of all payments—reduces the impact. Countries like Canada, Australia, and New Zealand have already eliminated their one-cent coins, showing global precedent. While the penny is phased out, the government continues to explore cost-saving measures for nickels by changing their composition, and Lincoln remains on the $5 bill as a cultural touchstone. This move reflects a broader trend toward reducing inefficient small change in a cash-poor economy.

## After a 50-day wait, Arizona Rep. Adelita Grijalva is sworn into Congress - <small>`npr`</small>

### Summary

After a 50-day delay, Adelita Grijalva, a Democrat representing Arizona’s 7th Congressional District, is officially sworn into Congress on November 12, 2025, following a political standoff over the release of Jeffrey Epstein’s files. The delay stemmed from House Speaker Mike Johnson’s insistence on reopening the government before allowing her to take office, which critics accused him of doing to stonewall a vote on the files. Grijalva, who won the seat in a special election on September 23, had campaigned on supporting the release of the files and became the 218th signatory of a bipartisan petition to trigger a vote. Her swearing-in marks a key shift in the balance of power in the House, narrowing the Republican majority to 219–214, meaning they can only afford to lose two votes on any given vote. Grijalva’s first legislative action will be on whether to reopen the government, and she declined to support the bipartisan Senate plan due to insufficient benefits for healthcare advocates.

## 3 Questions About Trump's 50-Year Mortgage Plan - <small>`npr`</small>

- [source](https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5604384)
- _Published: 2025-11-12 18:22:00Z_
- **Politics & Governance**
- <small>tags: `housing affordability, mortgage reform, President Trump, financial policy, Dodd-Frank Act, home ownership, interest rates, economic policy, MAGA, real estate`</small>

### Summary

President Trump has proposed a 50-year mortgage plan to make home ownership more accessible, especially for first-time buyers, claiming it would reduce monthly payments. However, financial experts and critics argue the plan would result in significantly higher total interest payments—up to 86% more over the life of the loan—and minimal equity growth, with borrowers paying nearly all interest in the first decade. The proposal is blocked by the Dodd-Frank Act, which excludes loans longer than 30 years from being backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Critics, including bank officials and nonprofit leaders, say the plan is unsustainable and unlikely to gain public support, calling it a 'giveaway to banks' and a failure to address the real issues of high mortgage rates and housing supply shortages. Experts suggest better solutions include lowering interest rates, expanding housing construction, and supporting 30-year mortgage terms, which have historically provided a stable and equitable path to homeownership.

### Key Takeaways
  - A 50-year mortgage plan proposed by President Trump would allow homebuyers to pay lower monthly payments over a longer period, potentially increasing affordability for first-time buyers.
  - However, the plan would result in significantly higher total interest payments—up to 86% more over the life of the loan—compared to a standard 30-year mortgage.

  - The plan is not eligible under the Dodd-Frank Act for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, limiting its availability and lender support.
  - Critics, including financial experts and nonprofit leaders, argue the plan is unsustainable and unlikely to gain public support, calling it a 'giveaway to banks' and a failure to address root causes like high interest rates and housing supply shortages.
  - Experts suggest better solutions include lowering interest rates, reducing inflation-driven mortgage costs, and expanding housing supply through increased homebuilding.

### Summary

The House Oversight Committee released new emails and documents from Jeffrey Epstein's estate, revealing discussions between Epstein and figures like Michael Wolff and Ghislaine Maxwell that suggest a close relationship with Donald Trump. The emails include claims that Trump spent time at Epstein's house, knew about trafficking operations, and were described as 'the dog that hasn't barked,' prompting renewed scrutiny of the president's connection to Epstein. While the White House downplayed the emails, calling them a 'bad-faith leak' and asserting no wrongdoing, Democrats argue the documents expose a cover-up. The release comes amid a government shutdown, with bipartisan pressure to vote on releasing Epstein files, delayed by House Speaker Mike Johnson. The political significance is heightened by the fact that Trump campaigned on releasing such documents as a way to expose corruption, yet has not fulfilled that promise, leading to accusations of broken campaign commitments and a lack of transparency.

  - Epstein's 2017 message to Lawrence Summers calls Trump 'the worst person' he has met, indicating a strong negative assessment.
  - The White House downplayed the emails, claiming they were a 'bad-faith leak' designed to smear Trump and that the administration has been more transparent than any prior administration.
  - Democrats have consistently pushed for release of Epstein files, citing a need for transparency, while Trump has denied any connection and dismissed related documents as fake.
  - The release of documents occurs amid a government shutdown, with House Democrats and four Republicans pushing for a vote to release files, which could force a government reopening.
  - House Speaker Mike Johnson delayed the vote by refusing to swear in Democrat Adelita Grijalva, who was elected in a special election and whose signature brought the bipartisan petition to 218 votes, enabling a vote.

## Transgender TSA Officer Sues DHS Over Policy Banning Pat-Down Duties - <small>`apnews`</small>

### Summary

A federal lawsuit filed by transgender TSA officer Danielle Mittereder alleges that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, through the Transportation Security Administration, violated civil rights by implementing a policy that bars transgender officers from conducting pat-downs and using gender-aligned restrooms, citing compliance with President Donald Trump’s 2021 executive order on gender categories. This policy, which reversed a 2021 directive allowing officers to perform duties based on gender identity, has led to claims of discrimination, emotional distress, and career barriers for transgender employees. Multiple officers, including Kai Regan, report similar experiences, citing feelings of inadequacy, anxiety, and early retirement. Critics, including legal advocates and labor leaders, argue the policy is arbitrary, unsupported by data, and potentially harmful to both employee well-being and security operations. TSA maintains the policy is necessary for passenger comfort and operational safety, though experts and unions warn it could lead to inefficiencies and increased delays.

### Key Takeaways
  - The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), through the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), implemented a policy in February 2025 that bans transgender officers from conducting pat-down screening duties or serving as witnesses in private screening areas, citing compliance with President Donald Trump’s 2021 executive order on gender categories.
  - This policy contradicts TSA’s prior 2021 directive that allowed officers to perform duties aligned with their gender identity, and has led to legal challenges, including a federal lawsuit filed by transgender officer Danielle Mittereder at Dulles International Airport.
  - The lawsuit alleges that the policy violates civil rights by restricting core job functions, limiting career advancement, and subjecting transgender officers to daily scrutiny and humiliation, despite no performance issues being previously reported.
  - Other transgender officers, such as Kai Regan and Skye Perryman, report similar experiences, citing emotional distress, feelings of inadequacy, and early retirement due to the policy’s impact.
  - TSA claims the policy is operationally sound, citing passenger comfort and security, and notes that travelers may request different officers or correct assumptions about gender. However, critics argue it creates uncertainty, potential delays, and fails to be supported by data.
  - Experts like Sheldon H. Jacobson suggest the policy may cause minor inconvenience but not systemic delays, while labor leaders like Everett Kelley warn it undermines workforce efficiency and public safety.
  - The policy is seen as part of a broader pattern of workplace discrimination against transgender federal employees during the second Trump administration, raising concerns about civil rights and equal treatment under federal employment standards.

### Summary

The U.S. government shutdown has created significant uncertainty about the delivery of SNAP food assistance, with 42 million Americans relying on the program for nutrition. While Congress passed a plan to reopen the government and the USDA stated that full benefits could be available within 24 hours for most states, actual loading of funds onto EBT cards varies by state. Some states, like Missouri, have issued partial benefits, while others, such as South Carolina and West Virginia, have not issued any. Conflicting court rulings and USDA guidance have led to chaos, with states scrambling to provide aid using their own funds or emergency measures. Experts and advocacy groups warn that delays harm low-income families who depend on SNAP for food and household expenses. The legislation to reopen the government includes provisions for state reimbursement, but clarity remains lacking on eligibility and timelines. Ultimately, the situation underscores the fragility of federal programs in the face of political and legal disruptions.

### Key Takeaways

  - States like South Carolina and West Virginia that had not issued benefits are expected to be among the first to do so due to administrative urgency.

  - States responded to the shutdown by using state funds, activating food banks, or deploying the National Guard to aid food distribution.
  - The legislation to reopen the government includes a provision for states to be reimbursed for spending SNAP funds, with partial reimbursements for states that issued partial benefits.

### Summary

A batch of 23,000 documents from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate, including emails between Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, revealed that Epstein allegedly wrote in 2019 that Donald Trump 'knew about the girls' and referred to Trump as a 'dog that hasn't barked.' These disclosures, released by Democrats on the House Oversight Committee, reignited debate over Trump’s possible knowledge of Epstein’s sex trafficking network, particularly given Giuffre’s claims that Trump was 'not involved in wrongdoing' and was 'friendly' to her. Trump and his allies have dismissed the emails as a political hoax or smear, with the White House accusing Democrats of selective leaks to defame the president. Giuffre, who died by suicide, maintained in her memoir and deposition that she only met Trump once and did not believe he was involved. Maxwell, Epstein’s associate, denied ever seeing Trump in inappropriate settings. The controversy has been further fueled by Trump's claim that he banned Epstein from Mar-a-Lago and that Epstein 'stole' her and others.

## U.S. Ends Penny Production After 230 Years in Major Monetary Shift - <small>`apnews`</small>

- <small>tags: `currency, economic policy, monetary reform, U.S. history, penny discontinuation, Trump administration, retail innovation, coin production, public policy, historical artifacts`</small>

### Summary

The United States officially ended production of the penny in November 2025, marking more than 230 years of currency history. The decision was driven by the penny's production cost—nearly 4 cents—exceeding its face value of 1 cent. The final pennies were pressed at the U.S. Mint in Philadelphia, where officials, including Treasurer Brandon Beach and staff, participated in a ceremonial event. Although billions of existing pennies remain legal tender, retailers faced challenges due to supply shortages and lack of guidance, leading to creative workarounds such as offering prizes for collecting coins. The move was influenced by public and political pressure, including a 2025 advocacy by former President Donald Trump, and mirrors actions taken by countries like Canada. Historians and collectors, however, lament the loss, viewing pennies as cultural artifacts that reflect American values, history, and identity.

### Key Takeaways
  - The U.S. ended production of the penny in 2025 after more than 230 years, due to its production cost (nearly 4 cents) exceeding its face value (1 cent).
  - The final penny was pressed at the U.S. Mint in Philadelphia on November 12, 2025, with the last coins being auctioned off.
  - President Donald Trump had previously advocated for the penny's elimination, stating that it cost more to produce than its value.
  - Many retailers faced logistical challenges, including supply shortages and lack of government guidance, leading to creative solutions like giving prizes for collecting pennies.
  - Despite the phase-out, billions of existing pennies remain legal tender, and collectors and historians value them as historical artifacts reflecting American culture and ideals.

### Summary

A major corruption scandal known as the 'Midas' network has emerged within Ukraine’s state-owned Energoatom, implicating high-level officials and close associates of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) revealed a 15-month investigation involving over 70 raids, 1,000 hours of wiretaps, and the detention of five individuals, with seven others linked to approximately $100 million in kickbacks. Wiretaps show that contractors were pressured to pay 10%-15% kickbacks under the guise of business necessity, exploiting martial law rules that blocked legal debt claims. The investigation also uncovered delays in securing defensive fortifications for critical energy sites, including nuclear switchyards. As a result, Energy Minister Svitlana Grynchuk and Justice Minister Herman Halushchenko resigned, and sanctions are being proposed against Timur Mindich, a close Zelenskyy associate. The scandal is seen as a serious blow to Ukraine’s credibility with Western allies, especially as Russia intensifies attacks on energy infrastructure. Meanwhile, European partners, including Germany, have expressed concern, emphasizing the need for transparent governance and accountability. Despite the timing being especially damaging during wartime, the case highlights the effectiveness of independent anti-corruption bodies and underscores that no official is immune from legal scrutiny.

### Summary

Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has offered renewed peace talks with Afghanistan’s Taliban government, following the collapse of previous negotiations in Istanbul. This comes amid a surge in militant attacks, including a deadly suicide bombing in Islamabad that killed 12 and wounded 27, and a violent assault on a military-run college in Wana.

Despite diplomatic efforts by Qatar and Turkey, the ceasefire remains fragile. Meanwhile, Pakistan has promoted its army chief to Chief of Defense Forces to strengthen military coordination. India, in contrast, has deepened ties with Afghanistan, marking a shift in regional dynamics. The situation underscores the fragility of peace in South Asia and the persistent threat of terrorism across borders.

### Summary

At the COP30 climate conference in Brazil, California Governor Gavin Newsom sharply criticized the Trump administration for its absence, calling it a failure of leadership and a sign of disengagement from global climate action. He contrasted his state's bipartisan environmental efforts—citing past Republican leaders like Reagan and Nixon—with Trump’s denial of climate change and support for fossil fuel expansion, including a proposed offshore drilling initiative in California. Newsom condemned both Trump’s policy of targeted air strikes in the Caribbean and Pacific and his climate skepticism, arguing that such actions undermine the rule of law and U.S. global influence. He also stressed the need to make climate messaging more relatable to the public, suggesting that terms like '1.5 degrees Celsius' should be translated into everyday language. While not explicitly declaring a presidential run, Newsom positioned himself as a responsible, forward-thinking alternative to Trump, especially at a time when he is nearing the end of his term as governor and preparing for a potential 2028 presidential bid.

### Summary

Following a suicide blast at Islamabad’s district court on November 11, 2025, Pakistan’s Defence Minister Khawaja Asif described the attack as a 'wake-up call' and accused Afghanistan of directly targeting Pakistan, calling for a conventional military response. This attack comes amid deteriorating relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan, which had previously signed a ceasefire in Doha in October 2025 after weeks of border fighting. The peace talks, previously revived in Istanbul, have now been threatened by the violence, with Pakistan accusing Kabul of sheltering militant groups like the TTP and ISKP, while Afghanistan denies these allegations. In parallel, India faced a car blast in New Delhi, prompting accusations from Pakistan that India is behind attacks in both Pakistan and Afghanistan. India denies the claims, asserting its own narrative of being a victim of regional terrorism. Analysts, including Iftikhar Firdous and Fahad Nabeel, argue that a full-scale war is unlikely due to reputational and strategic costs, but warn of a realignment where Afghanistan becomes central to global power dynamics. Turkey and Qatar continue to act as mediators, urging restraint and supporting diplomatic efforts to de-escalate tensions.

## House to vote on bill to end US shutdown: Why are Democrats opposing it? - <small>`aljazeera`</small>

- <small>tags: `U.S. government shutdown, Affordable Care Act, healthcare subsidies, Democrats vs. Republicans, political compromise, healthcare affordability, funding legislation, House of Representatives, budget crisis, healthcare reform, political leadership, bipartisan politics, social welfare, economic impact, political accountability`</small>

### Summary

The U.S. House of Representatives is set to vote on a stopgap funding bill to end a 42-day government shutdown, which was previously passed by the Senate with bipartisan support including eight Democratic senators. However, Democrats, led by Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, oppose the bill because it does not include a three-year extension of Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies—criticizing it as a partisan Republican measure that would double health costs for 24 million Americans. The bill, which will pass in the Republican-controlled House with a simple majority, will then go to President Donald Trump for signature. Democrats argue that failing to extend subsidies will result in premiums rising from $888 to $1,904 annually, with real-world impacts like those experienced by Pennsylvania hair stylist Christine Meehan. Progressive Democrats are blaming Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer for enabling the compromise and are calling for his resignation. The bill also includes provisions to pay furloughed federal workers and extend SNAP funding through next September. Despite Republican efforts to push the bill forward, Democratic leaders urge caution, emphasizing that the shutdown should not have occurred and that alternative solutions were repeatedly offered throughout the year.

### Key Takeaways
  - The U.S. government is set to end a 42-day shutdown with a bipartisan funding bill that fails to include healthcare subsidies under the Affordable Care Act (ACA).

## IAEA demands ‘long overdue’ inspections of Iran nuclear sites - <small>`aljazeera`</small>

- <small>tags: `Iran, nuclear inspections, IAEA, Israel, United States, nuclear proliferation, Middle East, security, international diplomacy, sanctions, nuclear weapons, Cairo agreement`</small>

### Summary

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has expressed urgent concern over its inability to verify Iran’s stockpile of highly enriched uranium since June 2025, following Israeli and US airstrikes that targeted key nuclear sites such as Fordo, Natanz, and the Isfahan Nuclear Technology Centre. Despite Iran’s agreement in September 2025 to resume inspections under a Cairo deal, the reimposition of UN sanctions by European powers and the US led to a halt in implementation, deepening the verification gap. The IAEA has called for immediate inspections to confirm the status of declared nuclear material, particularly given that enriched uranium at up to 60% purity could theoretically produce about 10 nuclear bombs. While damage at Isfahan appears limited, the buried facility’s tunnels were hit, raising concerns about the location and status of stored material. IAEA inspectors are now scheduled to visit Isfahan, marking a potential step toward restoring oversight, though full verification remains arduous due to infrastructure damage and Iran’s lack of cooperation.

### Key Takeaways
  - The IAEA has been unable to verify Iran’s stockpile of highly enriched uranium since June 2025 due to attacks by Israel and the United States.
  - Seven nuclear sites, including Fordo and Natanz, were targeted during the 12-day war, disrupting IAEA inspections and raising concerns about potential diversion of nuclear material for weapons.
  - The IAEA has called for urgent verification of inventories of declared nuclear material to address fears of weapons development, despite no credible evidence of a coordinated weapons program.
  - Iran suspended cooperation with the IAEA after the attacks but resumed inspections under a Cairo agreement in September 2025, which was later undermined by the reimposition of UN sanctions.
  - The uranium stockpile, enriched to up to 60% purity, is considered a serious concern as it could theoretically produce about 10 nuclear bombs, with much of it possibly stored at a buried facility in Isfahan.
  - Damage to the Isfahan facility was limited, but the entrance tunnels were hit, suggesting the material may still be present and unaccounted for.
  - IAEA inspectors are scheduled to visit the Isfahan Nuclear Technology Centre for the first time since the war, signaling a potential step toward restoring oversight.

### Summary

A 2011 email from Jeffrey Epstein alleges that Donald Trump spent hours with one of his victims at Epstein’s house, a claim echoed in a 2019 email stating Trump 'knew about the girls'. The emails were released by Democrats, sparking renewed political controversy. The White House, through spokesperson Karoline Leavitt, dismissed the claims, asserting that the victim is Virginia Giuffre and that Trump was friendly to her and never involved in wrongdoing. Trump himself dismissed the emails as a 'hoax' and accused Democrats of deflecting from other issues. Critics, including Representative Ro Khanna, argue that powerful figures like Trump tolerated Epstein’s abuse, highlighting a culture of inaction. Epstein, a convicted sex trafficker with ties to prominent figures including Prince Andrew, Bill Clinton, and Ehud Barak, died in prison in 2019, fueling conspiracy theories. The Justice Department and FBI have rejected claims of blackmail and stated there is no basis to release the so-called Epstein files, citing victim privacy and the fight against child exploitation. Trump has also sued the Wall Street Journal over a claim of a sexually suggestive birthday card sent to Epstein. Elon Musk has suggested Trump refuses to release the files because he is mentioned in them.

## Iraqi PM al-Sudani’s coalition comes first in parliamentary election - <small>`aljazeera`</small>

### Summary

In Iraq’s latest parliamentary election, the coalition led by Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani has emerged as the top winner with 1.3 million votes, surpassing the next closest group by 370,000 votes. Voter turnout reached 56%, but was lower in key cities like Baghdad and Najaf due to a boycott call by Muqtada al-Sadr, reflecting voter disillusionment with the election process. The results show traditional sectarian patterns: Shia candidates winning in Shia provinces, Sunni in Sunni areas, and Kurdish in Kurdish regions—though with notable surprises, such as the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) securing the most seats in predominantly Sunni Nineveh province and no Kurdish candidates winning in Diyala province for the first time since 2005. Given that no party holds a majority in the 329-member legislature, coalition-building is inevitable and will require prolonged negotiations among political factions. This election marks the sixth since 2003, a period defined by instability, sectarian conflict, and the rise of ISIS, underscoring Iraq’s ongoing struggle to establish stable, inclusive governance. The next prime minister must address urgent societal needs like jobs, education, and health while navigating complex regional dynamics between Iraq’s key allies, Iran and the United States.

### Summary

Australia has announced a ban on children under 16 accessing major social media platforms, including Reddit, Kick, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, and YouTube, set to take effect on December 10. The move stems from concerns over harmful design features such as addictive algorithms and opaque content targeting. While the government and eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant emphasize protecting children’s well-being and giving parents peace of mind, critics—including over 140 academics—argue the ban may deprive children of valuable developmental experiences. Enforcement remains challenging without mandatory age verification. The policy is being closely watched globally, with France opening a criminal investigation into TikTok’s role in pushing minors toward suicide, highlighting shared international concerns about social media’s impact on youth mental health.

### Key Takeaways
  - Australia is implementing a ban on children under 16 accessing several major social media platforms, including Reddit, Kick, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, and YouTube.
  - The ban is driven by concerns over harmful design features such as opaque algorithms, endless scrolling, and targeted content that may exploit vulnerable youth.
  - The eSafety Commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, emphasized the need to evaluate unintended consequences, such as changes in sleep patterns, physical activity, and social interaction among children.
  - Critics argue that the ban may deprive children of developmental benefits from social media exposure, citing evidence that early exposure helps children learn and grow in a safe digital environment.
  - Enforcement is challenging due to the inability to compel users to submit government-issued IDs for age verification; platforms must self-comply or face civil fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars.
  - The ban is being closely watched by global governments, especially in Europe and the United States, where similar concerns about youth mental health and platform design are emerging.
  - In France, a criminal investigation has been opened into TikTok’s algorithms and their potential role in pushing minors toward suicide, citing concerns over inadequate moderation and addictive content loops.
  - TikTok, owned by China-based ByteDance, has faced global scrutiny over content promoting self-harm, unhealthy body image, and foreign interference, with France specifically probing its role in youth suicide risks.
  - TikTok has denied allegations, calling them a 'scapegoat' for broader societal issues, and maintains it does not encourage suicidal behavior.

### Summary

Starbucks is facing a significant labor strike by unionized baristas in the US, marking the third major strike since 2021. The strike, which could affect at least 25 cities and coincide with the Red Cup holiday sales event, stems from ongoing disputes over pay, staffing, and working conditions. While the company's CEO Brian Niccol has implemented a 'Back to Starbucks' turnaround strategy with policy changes and a $500 million investment in staffing, union representatives argue that these changes have increased workloads and failed to address inflation and healthcare costs. The union has rejected a proposed contract offer, citing inadequate pay increases, while Starbucks claims the strike would harm operations and customer experience. Analysts and business experts warn that employee dissatisfaction directly undermines customer satisfaction and brand reputation, with Starbucks falling to 45th in brand strength—its lowest since 2016. Over 80 US Democrats have criticized the company for 'union-busting', adding political pressure. The conflict highlights the tension between corporate restructuring and worker welfare, and raises questions about the sustainability of Starbucks' recovery efforts.

### Summary

A major release of over 20,000 pages from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate includes emails that reference President Donald Trump, Prince Andrew, and Michael Wolff. The emails suggest Trump visited Epstein's home, allegedly discussed with Ghislaine Maxwell, and was reportedly asked to resign from Mar-a-Lago. Michael Wolff, a known Trump biographer, allegedly advised Epstein on how to respond to Trump’s potential involvement, including suggesting he be portrayed as a victim of political correctness. Prince Andrew is linked through a 2011 email forwarded by Maxwell, where he denies involvement. Lord Mandelson, a former UK ambassador, had contact with Epstein as late as 2016. The White House claims the emails were selectively leaked to smear Trump, while Democrats argue they are part of a legitimate investigation.

## Why is Donald Trump threatening to sue the BBC? - <small>`bbc`</small>

- <small>tags: `BBC, Donald Trump, media ethics, libel, political controversy, editorial integrity, US-Britain relations, freedom of speech, public broadcasting, capitol riot, Panorama documentary`</small>

### Summary

The BBC is facing a major crisis following criticism of a Panorama documentary that edited a section of Donald Trump’s speech to create the impression he called for violence at the Capitol on January 6, 2021. The documentary, 'Trump: A Second Chance?', was broadcast in October 2024 and sparked outrage after a leaked internal memo revealed that the BBC had combined two non-adjacent parts of the speech, more than 50 minutes apart. The BBC acknowledged the error, with chairman Samir Shah apologizing and confirming over 500 complaints. This led to the resignations of director general Tim Davie and head of news Deborah Turness, both citing the controversy as a contributing factor. In response, Donald Trump threatened a $1 billion lawsuit, demanding a retraction, apology, and compensation, with legal action potentially being filed in Florida. Experts suggest the BBC would likely win in court due to lack of evidence of malice or direct impact in the US. The incident has also raised concerns about broader BBC editorial standards, including coverage of transgender issues and the Israel-Gaza war in BBC Arabic. The UK government is set to review the BBC’s Royal Charter, potentially affecting its funding and governance. The crisis underscores tensions between political figures and public broadcasters over editorial independence and media credibility.

## Italy probes claim that tourists paid to go to Bosnia to kill besieged civilians - <small>`bbc`</small>

### Summary

The Italian public prosecutor’s office in Milan has launched an investigation into allegations that Italian citizens and others paid large sums — up to €100,000 — to participate in 'sniper safaris' during the 1990s siege of Sarajevo in Bosnia-Herzegovina. These claims, first raised in the 1990s and rekindled by a 2022 Slovenian documentary, suggest that wealthy individuals, including Italians, were charged by the hour or by group to shoot civilians from hills above the city. The investigation is based on testimony from a Bosnian military intelligence officer who reported that the practice was discovered in late 1993 and reported to Italy’s Sismi intelligence in early 1994, leading to a prompt response that reportedly ended the tours within months. Despite the claims, British military personnel who served in Sarajevo have dismissed the idea as an 'urban myth,' citing logistical barriers and lack of evidence. The case is being treated as a potential murder investigation, with prosecutors examining a 17-page file compiled by journalist Ezio Gavazzeni, including a report by former Sarajevo mayor Benjamina Karic. While the evidence remains controversial, the allegations highlight the ethical and legal implications of foreign involvement in wartime violence.

### Key Takeaways
  - Italian prosecutors in Milan have opened an investigation into claims that Italian citizens and others paid to engage in sniper tourism during the Bosnian siege of Sarajevo in the early 1990s.
  - The allegations suggest that wealthy individuals, including Italians, were charged different rates to shoot at civilians — men, women, or children — with some paying up to €100,000 (equivalent to £88,000 today).
  - The claims are based on testimony from a Bosnian military intelligence officer who revealed that Bosnian colleagues discovered the 'safaris' in late 1993 and passed the information to Italy’s Sismi intelligence in early 1994.
  - Sismi responded by identifying the tourist routes — such as from Trieste — and reportedly stopped the practice within two to three months.
  - The allegations were first brought to light through a 2022 documentary, 'Sarajevo Safari,' which claimed foreign participants from the US, Russia, and Italy were involved in the killings.
  - Ezio Gavazzeni, a journalist and novelist, initiated a 17-page investigation file in February 2025, including a report by former Sarajevo mayor Benjamina Karic.

## Fifty-year mortgages and $2,000 cheques: What's behind Trump's affordability drive? - <small>`bbc`</small>

- <small>tags: `Donald Trump, affordability, economic policy, 50-year mortgages, tariff revenue, inflation, public sentiment, elections, health insurance, housing affordability, political strategy, economic data, tariff policy, government spending`</small>

### Summary

US President Donald Trump is pushing a series of proposals to address public concerns about economic affordability, including a $2,000 cash rebate funded by tariff revenue, promoting 50-year mortgages to reduce housing costs, and converting expiring health insurance subsidies into direct payments. However, economists and political opponents argue that the rebate plan is financially unfeasible, could fuel inflation, and disproportionately benefits lenders. Trump's efforts follow poor electoral results and a national shift in public sentiment, with affordability emerging as the top economic concern. Critics, including Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene and economists like Erica York, warn that these policies may worsen inflation and fail to address core affordability issues. Trump's claims about falling prices are challenged by data showing rising costs in key sectors like beef, coffee, and electricity. The proposals face significant hurdles in congressional implementation due to narrow party majorities and opposition from within his own party.

### Key Takeaways
  - Trump is proposing a $2,000 cash rebate to Americans, which would be funded by tariff revenue—though economists argue it is financially unfeasible and could drive inflation.

## Cyril Ramaphosa hits back at Donald Trump's boycott of G20 summit in South Africa - <small>`bbc`</small>

### Summary

South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa has strongly rejected US President Donald Trump's decision to boycott the G20 summit in Johannesburg, calling the boycott 'boycott politics' that fails to achieve meaningful outcomes. Trump, citing discredited claims of a 'white genocide' and land confiscation, stated that no US official would attend, which he called a 'total disgrace'. South Africa refutes these claims, asserting that no white farmers have lost land without compensation and that the US absence undermines global economic cooperation. The summit, marking the first time on African soil, is hosted by South Africa as the current G20 chair, with other leaders like Argentina’s Javier Milei also skipping attendance. This highlights tensions between international diplomatic norms, misinformation, and the role of global economic forums.

## Four potential obstacles in House vote to end US government shutdown - <small>`bbc`</small>

- <small>tags: `government shutdown, funding bill, health insurance subsidies, House of Representatives, Republican Party, Democratic Party, fiscal policy, political division, budget debate, travel disruptions, debt growth, midterm elections`</small>

### Summary

A spending bill aimed at ending the longest-ever government shutdown is set for a vote in the U.S. House of Representatives by Wednesday evening. While House Republicans do not require Democratic support to pass the bill, a razor-thin margin—only two votes—makes success precarious. A major point of conflict is whether to renew tax credits that keep health insurance affordable for 24 million Americans; Senate Republicans agreed to a vote on extension, but House Speaker Mike Johnson has not committed to allowing one. Key Republican figures like Marjorie Taylor Greene have voiced concern over potential premium hikes, signaling internal dissent. Democrats are deeply divided, with progressives like Bernie Sanders and Gavin Newsom calling the compromise a 'surrender,' while moderates like Henry Cuellar and Jared Golden may cross the aisle. With the next Arizona congresswoman-elect taking office, the Republican majority will shrink to five votes, making passage even more difficult. Potential defectors such as Thomas Massie and Victoria Spartz add uncertainty, and fiscal hawks may object to the plan’s projected $1.8 trillion annual increase in federal debt. Travel challenges, including flight cancellations and extreme Midwest weather, underscore the widespread impact of the funding deadlock beyond politics.

### Summary

The New York City Council has approved a rezoning plan that could deliver nearly 15,000 new apartments in a former industrial area of Long Island City, Queens. The plan, approved just days after the mayoral election where housing affordability was a central issue, includes significant public investments in parks, schools, and infrastructure, with at least 30% of units required to be affordable for low- and moderate-income residents. This marks a shift from previous plans that prioritized corporate development, such as Amazon’s headquarters proposal, to community-focused, equitable growth. While supported by left-leaning officials like Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani and Councilwoman Julie Won, the plan faced criticism from community groups like the Western Queens Community Land Trust, who argued that essential community needs were neglected and that gentrification risks remain unaddressed. The approval reflects a broader city effort to combat a housing shortage that has intensified over the past six decades, particularly in rapidly developing areas like Long Island City.

## Adams Makes It Harder for Mamdani to Build Over Elizabeth Street Garden - <small>`nytimes`</small>

- <small>tags: `affordable housing, urban development, green space preservation, New York City politics, political transition, community activism, city planning`</small>

### Summary

In a move to prevent future development, the former mayor Eric Adams, in a letter dated November 3, 2025, formally designated the Elizabeth Street Garden in Lower Manhattan as permanent parkland. This action, which requires approval from the State Legislature to override, effectively blocks housing development on the site. Despite Zohran Mamdani’s public commitment to revive the housing plan, the Adams administration’s legal and administrative actions have made it difficult to proceed. The conflict reflects broader tensions in New York City over affordable housing, green space preservation, and political priorities, with community members, celebrities, and advocacy groups actively involved in the debate.

### Key Takeaways
  - Mayor Eric Adams initially supported replacing the Elizabeth Street Garden in Lower Manhattan with affordable housing, but reversed course in June 2024, opting instead to pursue housing elsewhere.
  - The city has now formally designated the Elizabeth Street Garden as permanent parkland through a letter from Louis Molina to Iris Rodriguez-Rosa, making it legally difficult to build housing on the site.
  - Zohran Mamdani, the incoming mayor, has publicly pledged to revive housing plans for the site, which has angered development advocates and raised concerns about political continuity and commitment.
  - The fight over the garden reflects broader tensions in New York City over affordable housing, gentrification, and the preservation of green space in densely populated, wealthy neighborhoods.
  - The nonprofit tenant, community members, and notable figures such as Robert De Niro, Martin Scorsese, and Patti Smith have been instrumental in advocating for the garden’s preservation over several years.

### Summary

The American penny, first minted in 1793 and long a symbol of frugality, luck, and cultural identity, was officially retired in 2025 after 232 years of circulation. The Treasury Department cited irrelevance and a production cost exceeding 3 cents per coin as key reasons for its demise. Final pennies were minted in Philadelphia, where officials observed the final minting. The coin’s legacy includes cultural references in music, film, and popular belief, such as the idea that a dropped penny brings good luck. Despite its retirement, 250 billion pennies remain in circulation, and businesses will now round transactions to the nearest nickel. The penny's retirement is part of a broader trend in U.S. currency, as the nickel now faces similar challenges, with its value and cost of production also declining.

### Summary

President Gustavo Petro of Colombia has engaged in a high-stakes political confrontation with U.S. President Donald Trump, refusing to resume intelligence sharing and accusing the U.S. of extrajudicial killings in maritime operations targeting Colombian fishing boats. This defiance stems from Petro’s long-standing revolutionary background with the M-19 rebel group and his lifelong opposition to corruption and inequality. The U.S. has responded with severe measures, including revoking Petro’s visa and imposing sanctions, labeling him a drug kingpin. While Petro’s actions have earned admiration from global left-wing circles and are seen as a moral stand against imperial overreach, critics in Colombia argue that his policies are ideologically driven and poorly implemented, threatening national stability and U.S. relations. Internal political dissent, especially from former ministers like Alejandro Gaviria and Susana Muhamad, underscores tensions between Petro’s bold, confrontational style and pragmatic governance. The article portrays Petro not just as a leader in conflict with Trump, but as a symbolic figure of resistance to elite power, whose actions reflect a deeper struggle between revolutionary idealism and the realities of governance in a divided and complex world.

  - Critics argue that his foreign policy is ideologically driven and impractical, especially given Colombia’s reliance on U.S. support for trade and counternarcotics efforts.
  - Internal divisions within Colombia’s political establishment—between supporters who see Petro as a moral leader and critics who view him as erratic or ineffective—reflect deeper societal tensions about governance, ideology, and national stability.

### Summary

The article analyzes the political dynamics following a brief government shutdown, contrasting the resignation of Senate Democrats to a compromise with President Trump’s unpopularity revealed at an N.F.L. game. While Democrats restored key benefits like SNAP and health care subsidies, they failed to achieve significant policy concessions. The piece argues that Trump’s administration is not just politically unpopular but increasingly authoritarian, using agencies like ICE and CBP as tools of repression. The article calls on Democrats to adopt a more confrontational stance, emphasizing accountability, institutional reform, and democratic renewal—especially in the context of upcoming midterms and a potential shift in power. It concludes that the current moment demands bold political action, not retreat, as the nation faces a fundamental threat to democratic governance.

### Key Takeaways
  - President Trump's appearance at an N.F.L. game in Washington, D.C., was met with jeers, highlighting his unpopularity and the public's rejection of his political agenda.

  - The Republican Party's refusal to compromise on health care and austerity measures reveals a deep ideological commitment to conservative policy, even at the cost of public welfare.
  - Democrats are engaged in a broader struggle for democratic principles and institutional integrity, not just electoral gain, as they confront Trump’s efforts to centralize power and undermine civil society.
  - Trump’s leadership style—marked by authoritarian impulses, disregard for public opinion, and lack of responsiveness to dissent—poses a significant threat to constitutional governance.
  - If Democrats win in the next midterm elections, they will face the challenge of dismantling agencies like U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), reforming gerrymandering, protecting reproductive rights, and restoring democratic institutions.
  - The public’s growing discontent with Trump suggests that future electoral outcomes may favor Democrats, especially in times of national crisis.

## Michelle Obama’s New Book Is a Historical Document Dressed Up as a Coffee-Table Tome - <small>`nytimes`</small>

- <small>tags: `Michelle Obama, First Lady, Fashion, Diplomacy, Social Media, Historical Significance, Style and Politics, Cultural Representation, Women in Leadership, White House`</small>

### Summary

Michelle Obama’s new book, 'The Look,' is a historical and deeply insightful document that reveals how fashion evolved into a central component of diplomatic strategy during her tenure as First Lady. As the first first lady to have a dedicated stylist on the White House payroll, she established a new precedent where clothing choices were no longer mere personal preference but deliberate tools of cultural outreach, diplomacy, and representation. The book details over 100 outfits, each selected with strategic intent—such as showcasing underrepresented designers, honoring international ties, and addressing practical needs. It also highlights the public scrutiny and criticism she faced, especially regarding sleeveless dresses, and reveals the financial realities of such a wardrobe. By contrast, past first ladies like Jacqueline Kennedy, Nancy Reagan, and Hillary Clinton relied on a single designer and focused on pageantry rather than diplomacy. Today, with Melania Trump and Jill Biden also employing stylists, the model has become the norm. The book ultimately underscores that first lady fashion is not accidental—it is strategic, political, and deeply tied to national identity and global perception.

### Key Takeaways
  - The book 'The Look' is not just a fashion collection, but a historical document showing how clothing became a formal, strategic tool in the role of the first lady.
  - Michelle Obama was the first first lady to have a dedicated stylist (Meredith Koop) on the White House payroll, marking a shift from informal fashion relationships to structured visual diplomacy.
  - The styling team included multiple professionals — hairdressers, makeup artists, and a stylist — indicating a comprehensive, team-based approach to image management.
  - Fashion choices were deliberately made to represent diverse and underrepresented designers and cultures, such as choosing Jason Wu to showcase overlooked talent.
  - Style decisions were also shaped by diplomatic considerations, such as selecting a designer with a connection to a specific country for state dinners.
  - Practical considerations like mobility and durability were essential in designing the clothing, especially for events involving physical interaction.
  - The book addresses public scrutiny and criticism — particularly regarding sleeveless dresses — but avoids discussing the financial burden of acquiring so many outfits.
  - Designers often 'gift' outfits to the nation for public events, ensuring items go into national archives rather than personal closets.
  - The book demonstrates that first lady fashion is a deliberate, strategic form of communication, not a casual or personal choice.
  - After leaving office, Michelle Obama continued to experiment with fashion, reinforcing the idea that style is a form of political and cultural expression.

### Summary

A powerful 'cannibal storm' from the sun, driven by a coronal mass ejection (CME) that merged with a previous one, triggered intense geomagnetic activity and dazzling auroras visible as far south as Florida and Alabama. The event, linked to solar region AR 14274, has been classified as G3 by the US Space Weather Prediction Center with a potential escalation to G4 or G5, the latter predicted by the British Geological Survey. A large geoelectric field of 3.5 volts per kilometer was recorded in the Shetland Islands, posing risks to power infrastructure. The storm disrupted satellite operations and forced Blue Origin to delay the launch of NASA’s Escapade Mars-bound mission. Scientists note that this storm is part of the solar cycle’s peak and decay phase, with historical comparisons drawn to the 2024 and 2003 storms, though it remains below the extreme 1859 Carrington Event level.

### Key Takeaways
  - A 'cannibal storm' from the sun, where a second coronal mass ejection (CME) caught up and merged with a first, causing intensified geomagnetic activity, was responsible for spectacular auroras visible in southern US states like Florida and Alabama.
  - The event has been classified as G3 by the Space Weather Prediction Center, with a potential rise to G4 on Thursday and possible G5 (extreme) levels, as predicted by the British Geological Survey.
  - This solar storm is linked to active region AR 14274 on the sun, which produced three X-class solar flares and multiple CMEs, with the most intense one occurring on Tuesday.
  - The geomagnetic storm generated a large geoelectric field of 3.5 volts per kilometer in the Shetland Islands — the highest ever recorded since 2012 — posing a threat to power transformers and satellite systems.
  - Blue Origin has postponed NASA’s Escapade mission launch due to elevated solar activity and its potential risks to the spacecraft.
  - The storm is part of the solar cycle’s decay phase, which typically sees the strongest solar flares, even as sunspot activity decreases.
  - Auroras are visible due to solar particles interacting with Earth’s atmosphere, and sensors in phones and cameras can detect them even when not visible to the naked eye.
  - Historical context shows that while the 2024 storm was extreme, it did not reach the intensity of the 1859 Carrington Event, which caused telegraph systems to fail and sparked fires.

## Scientists Now Know That Bees Can Process Time, a First in Insects - <small>`cnn`</small>

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/science/bees-visual-stimulus-study-scli-intl)
- _Published: 2025-11-12 07:10:00-05:00_
- **Science & Technology**
- <small>tags: `bee cognition, insect intelligence, time perception, animal behavior, neuroscience, cognitive flexibility, insect research, science breakthrough`</small>

### Summary

A new study led by doctoral student Alex Davidson and senior lecturer Elisabetta Versace at Queen Mary University of London reveals that bumblebees can process the duration of light flashes—distinguishing between short (0.5 seconds) and long (up to 5 seconds)—to decide where to forage for food. This is the first documented evidence of such temporal processing in insects. The researchers used a maze setup where bees learned to associate short flashes with sweet food and long flashes with bitter food, proving that bees use time duration as a decision-making cue, not just smell or sight. The findings challenge the long-held belief that insects are mere reflex machines, suggesting instead that they possess complex cognition, flexibility, and inner experiences. Experts such as Cintia Akemi Oi and Jolyon Troscianko support the significance of the discovery, noting its implications for understanding animal cognition and time perception across species. The study, published in Biology Letters, opens doors to exploring the neural mechanisms behind insect time processing and may redefine how we perceive insect intelligence and behavior.

### Key Takeaways
  - Bees can process the duration of light flashes and use this temporal information to decide where to forage, a first in insect cognition.
  - This ability demonstrates that bees are not simple reflex machines but complex animals with flexible learning and memory.
  - The study shows bees can differentiate between novel stimuli (flash durations) they have never seen before, suggesting advanced cognitive flexibility.
  - Only a few animals—including humans, macaques, and pigeons—have been shown to distinguish short and long flashes, highlighting bees' unique cognitive capacity.

- <small>tags: `northern lights, geomagnetic storm, solar maximum, CME, aurora visibility, space weather, NOAA, solar wind, U.S. aurora sightings, technology disruption`</small>

### Summary

On November 12, 2025, the United States witnessed an unusually southern expansion of the northern lights, visible as far south as Florida and Alabama, due to a powerful geomagnetic storm driven by two coronal mass ejections (CMEs) from the sun. The storm reached G4 level on NOAA’s scale, indicating a high-risk event that could disrupt satellite operations, GPS, and power grids. A third, even stronger CME is expected to arrive midday on Wednesday, increasing the risk of further disruptions. The aurora is visible across multiple states, including Idaho, Iowa, Missouri, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, and Washington, due to the peak of the sun’s 11-year solar cycle. While usually confined to high latitudes, solar wind and charged particles from the sun colliding with atmospheric gases generate the colorful auroras. The event is significant not only for public fascination but also because it highlights the growing vulnerability of technology to space weather during solar maximum. The public is advised to use dark, light-pollution-free settings and apps like My Aurora Forecast & Alerts or Aurorasaurus to track and observe the phenomenon.

### Key Takeaways
  - The U.S. observed vivid northern lights as far south as Florida and Alabama due to a powerful geomagnetic storm caused by solar activity.
  - The storm resulted from two coronal mass ejections (CMEs) from the sun, with a third expected on Wednesday that could be even stronger.
  - The geomagnetic storm reached G4 level, the second-highest on NOAA's scale, indicating a significant disturbance to Earth's magnetic field and potential disruption to technology such as GPS, satellites, and power grids.
  - The aurora is visible over a broad swath of the U.S., including states like Idaho, Iowa, Missouri, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, and Washington.

- <small>tags: `supermassive black hole, astronomy, cosmic flare, spaghettification, Milky Way, early universe, Caltech, Palomar Observatory, Nature Astronomy, star destruction, black hole formation`</small>

### Summary

Scientists have recorded the most energetic flare ever observed from a supermassive black hole, which briefly emitted light equivalent to 10 trillion suns. This event occurred in a distant galaxy about 11 billion light years away and was triggered when a massive star—between 30 and 200 times the mass of the Sun—was torn apart by the black hole’s gravity, a process known as spaghettification. The star’s remains spiraled into the black hole, heating up and emitting intense radiation, with the flare peaking after about three months and continuing over an estimated 11-year period. First detected in 2018 by the Palomar Observatory at Caltech, the event is significant because it provides a rare observational window into the early universe and helps scientists understand the formation and evolution of supermassive black holes, which are believed to exist at the centers of most galaxies, including the Milky Way. The findings were published in the scientific journal Nature Astronomy and led by astronomer Matthew Graham, with KE Saavik Ford as a co-author.

### Key Takeaways
  - Scientists have observed the most energetic flare ever recorded from a supermassive black hole, which briefly emitted light equivalent to 10 trillion suns.

- <small>tags: `nuclear testing, noncritical tests, U.S. nuclear policy, China nuclear arsenal, Trump administration, stockpile stewardship, subcritical experiments, global nuclear arms control, nuclear weapons safety, international relations`</small>

### Summary

In early 2025, President Donald Trump announced a directive to restart U.S. nuclear weapons testing, prompting concern over a possible return to explosive nuclear detonations. However, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright clarified that the planned tests are 'noncritical' and do not involve nuclear explosions. These tests will focus on components of nuclear weapons to ensure safety and reliability, using advanced simulations and subcritical experiments with plutonium. Experts, including Georgia Cole of Chatham House and the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), emphasize that the U.S. does not require explosive testing to maintain a safe and effective stockpile, which has been assessed as secure since 1992. While Trump claims China is rapidly building its arsenal and will match the U.S. within five years, there is no credible evidence that any country—Russia, China, Pakistan, or India—is currently conducting explosive nuclear tests. The only known 21st-century test was by North Korea, which has since declared a moratorium. Experts warn that resuming full explosive nuclear testing by the U.S. would dangerously escalate tensions and prompt retaliatory actions from Russia and China, potentially collapsing the 30-year global nuclear testing moratorium. The article underscores the distinction between noncritical, non-explosive testing and full nuclear detonations, highlighting the importance of transparency and scientific integrity in nuclear policy.

### Key Takeaways
  - The U.S. is planning noncritical, non-explosive nuclear tests that involve testing components of nuclear weapons, not full detonations.
  - These tests are conducted to ensure new nuclear weapons systems are safe, reliable, and improve upon older designs, using advanced computer simulations and subcritical experiments.
  - U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright clarified that the tests are 'noncritical' and not explosive, emphasizing the distinction between full nuclear detonations and component-level system testing.
  - Despite President Donald Trump's public statements calling for a restart of nuclear testing, experts and agencies like the NNSA maintain that current stockpiles remain safe without explosive tests.
  - The U.S. has not conducted any nuclear explosive tests since 1992; previous tests were conducted under the 1992 moratorium, which remains in place except for non-explosive component testing.
  - There is no credible evidence that China, Russia, or Pakistan are conducting nuclear explosive tests; only North Korea has tested in the 21st century, and it has since declared a moratorium.
  - Resuming full explosive nuclear testing by the U.S. would likely prompt retaliatory actions from Russia, China, and North Korea, potentially collapsing the 30-year global nuclear testing moratorium.
  - Noncritical and subcritical tests, which use plutonium without triggering a nuclear chain reaction, are legally and technically allowed under international norms and are widely used in nuclear weapons maintenance.
  - The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) maintains that the U.S. stockpile remains safe, secure, and effective without explosive testing, citing annual reviews by national security labs.

## Suneung: Blind students sit 13-hour college entry exam in South Korea - <small>`bbc`</small>

- [source](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9wv22qjq8eo)
- _Published: 2025-11-12 23:01:22.448+00:00_
- **Society & Culture**
- <small>tags: `education, disability rights, accessibility, South Korea, blind students, Suneung exam, student perseverance, educational equity, braille, Korean society`</small>

### Summary

The article reports on the extreme challenges faced by blind students in South Korea during the Suneung college entrance exam, which they take for up to 13 hours due to the conversion of test materials into braille. Unlike sighted students who complete the exam in eight hours, blind students endure a significantly longer duration, facing physical strain from reading thick braille test papers and cognitive fatigue from holding information in memory. The exam is not only a test of knowledge but a demonstration of perseverance, as students like Han Donghyun and Oh Jeong-won struggle with delayed access to essential braille study materials, such as EBS textbooks, which are not available until months before the exam. Despite the challenges, the students rely on tools like screen-reading software and the Hansone braille notetaker. Institutions like the National Institute of Special Education and the Korean Blind Union have acknowledged the issue, with the latter advocating for constitutional action to enforce equal access to educational resources, underscoring systemic inequities in South Korea’s education system.

### Key Takeaways
  - The Suneung exam is a pivotal national gatekeeper for university admission in South Korea, significantly influencing life outcomes such as job prospects, income, and housing.
  - Blind students face a much longer exam duration—up to 13 hours—due to the conversion of test materials into braille and the lack of breaks, emphasizing systemic accessibility challenges.
  - Braille test papers are six to nine times thicker than standard versions, increasing physical strain and cognitive load, especially during reading and interpretation of complex material.
  - Students like Han Donghyun and Oh Jeong-won rely on screen-reading software and braille notetakers (Hansone), but face limitations in studying due to delayed access to braille versions of essential textbooks like EBS materials.
  - The delay in receiving braille versions of EBS materials (received only in August or September, months after sighted students receive them) creates significant educational inequality and undermines preparation equity.
  - The Korean Blind Union and National Institute of Special Education are involved in efforts to improve accessibility, with plans for constitutional action to enforce equal access to study materials.
  - The exam is not just a test of knowledge but a symbol of perseverance, reflecting the long-term effort, resilience, and determination of blind students in navigating a system that often lacks inclusive design.

## 42 Million People Are Enrolled in SNAP. Who Are They? - <small>`nytimes`</small>

### Summary

The article reports that 42 million Americans are enrolled in SNAP, the nation’s largest anti-hunger program, which provides monthly food benefits via EBT cards. The program, a modern successor to the 1939 food stamp program, is administered by states and has long served as an economic stabilizer during downturns. Despite a recovering economy, enrollment remains stable at 41 million due to persistent poverty, inflation, and job market weakness. On November 1, 2025, new work requirements under President Trump’s domestic policy law require able-bodied adults aged 18–64 to work 80 hours per month or participate in education/training, with narrowed exemptions for caregivers and former foster youth. These changes could disqualify up to 2.4 million people. The Trump administration attempted to cut SNAP benefits during a government shutdown, sparking legal challenges and a Supreme Court emergency hearing, where advocates argue that a 10-day delay in benefits has already caused severe hardship. The case underscores the tension between executive authority and civil rights in food security policy.

### Key Takeaways
  - SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) is the U.S. government's largest anti-hunger program, serving 42 million low-income Americans — one in eight — and helping them purchase groceries via EBT cards.
  - SNAP eligibility is based on income limits, typically 130% of the federal poverty level, with a household of two earning up to $529 per week ($27,495 annually) and a family of four up to $41,795 annually.
  - Nearly 90% of SNAP recipients are native-born U.S. citizens, and 96% are citizens, indicating strong ties to the American legal and social structure.
  - About 62% of recipients are in families with children, with 40% being under 18 and 20% over 60, showing the program's broad demographic impact.
  - The states with the highest SNAP participation rates are New Mexico, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Oregon, indicating regional economic and poverty patterns.
  - SNAP acts as an economic 'automatic stabilizer,' expanding during downturns and contracting during growth, helping to stabilize household spending and consumer demand.
  - Under the new Trump administration policy effective November 1, 2025, able-bodied adults aged 18–64 must work 80 hours per month or participate in education/training to remain eligible for more than three months in a three-year period.
  - The exemption for caregivers of children under 18 was narrowed to children under 14, and exemptions for homeless people, veterans, and foster care youth aged out of care are now eliminated.
  - The Congressional Budget Office estimates that up to 2.4 million people may fall out of SNAP due to the new work requirements alone.
  - The Trump administration attempted to cut off SNAP benefits during a government shutdown, leading to legal challenges and a Supreme Court emergency hearing on whether such cuts were lawful.
  - Legal advocates argue that a 10-day delay in receiving benefits has already caused severe hardship, and further delays would deepen food insecurity and social instability.
