### Summary

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has been appointed after an unexpected parliamentary defeat, hours after failing to secure a two-thirds majority. Despite this setback, Merz's appointment was confirmed by the German President and he is set to be sworn in. However, his appointment was made during a tumultuous period of political uncertainty, as his coalition displayed reluctance. The appointment was also met with the insurgent far-right AfD party gaining new leverage. Merz faces challenges in his new role, including pushing through changes to Germany's defense spending and managing the impact of the Trump administration's withdrawal of security guarantees for Europe. This appointment is a complex situation for Germany, with political instability and the need to modernize defense spending as pressing issues.

### Key Takeaways
  - Friedrich Merz has been appointed as the new Chancellor of Germany after an unexpected parliamentary defeat. This was his second attempt at becoming Chancellor, as he fell short by six votes in an earlier vote. The appointment was confirmed by the President shortly after the parliamentary approval. However, the appointment was met with significant political instability, as the coalition revealed reluctance and the far-right AfD party gained new leverage. Merz faces challenges in his new role, including the need to modernize Germany's defense spending and manage the impact of the Trump administration's withdrawal of security guarantees for Europe. The appointment of Merz is a complicated situation for Germany, particularly in light of the AfD's new position and the broader political landscape.

### Summary

The Trump administration has taken new steps to target federal funding to Harvard University, cutting off all new federal research grants unless the prestigious school agrees to political policy changes. Harvard is not eligible for these grants due to ongoing issues with the administration, including concerns about the university's handling of affirmative action, protesting on campus, and testing requirements. The administration demands have included removing diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, banning masks at campus protests, and eliminating merit-based hiring and admissions changes. Harvard has denounced these demands as 'unprecedented and improper control' and 'chilling implications for higher education.' Meanwhile, other universities like Columbia, Princeton, Cornell, and Northwestern have also faced funding cuts and pressure from the administration.

## Trump admin plans to shut down money-saving Energy Star program soon, sources say

- _Published: 2025-05-06 10:15:00-20:15_

### Summary

The Trump administration is planning to eliminate two key divisions of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) focused on climate change and energy efficiency, including the Energy Star program, according to two sources familiar with the plan. The agency plans to shutter its climate change division and climate protection partnership division, as well as its Energy Star program, a public-private partnership that certifies energy-efficient appliances and helps consumers save money on energy costs. The Energy Star program, which was implemented in 1992, is nearly universally supported by manufacturers, retailers, and consumers. However, the Trump administration's plan to eliminate the Energy Star program has been met with opposition from bipartisan groups and environmental advocates, who argue that it would contradict the administration's promise to reduce household energy costs. The agency is offering staffers a second round of deferred resignation offers and will reassess how many people it needs to fire after that offer period has closed.

- _Published: 2025-05-06 10:14:00-20:14_

### Summary

The Trump administration has asked a judge to dismiss a lawsuit from Idaho, Kansas, and Missouri that seeks to restrict telehealth access to mifepristone, an abortion medication. The states argue that access to mifepristone undermines their abortion laws, but the federal government argues that the states lack legal standing to sue. The case is currently being considered by U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, a Trump nominee, who previously ruled in favor of halting approval for the drug. The lawsuit aims to roll back access to mifepristone and was originally filed by anti-abortion groups, whose case was dismissed by the Supreme Court. The states are challenging actions taken by the Food and Drug Administration in 2016 to relax restrictions on mifepristone, arguing that this action was taken too long ago to be legally challenged.

## A Soviet-era spacecraft that failed to reach Venus is due to crash back to Earth this week

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/05/science/cosmos-482-reentry-earth)
- _Published: 2025-05-06 11:30:00-20:30_

### Summary

A Soviet-era spacecraft, Cosmos 482 (also spelled Kosmos 482), is set to reenter Earth's atmosphere around May 10, 2025. Much about the spacecraft remains unknown, with projections indicating it might reenter around that time, but uncertainty surrounds its exact shape, size, and the part of the vehicle set to land. Despite these uncertainties, the risk of the spacecraft causing deadly damage is estimated to be 1 in 25,000, but there is still a small chance of it landing in populated areas. Researchers believe that Cosmos 482 is likely to be the cylindrical entry capsule of the V-71 No. 671 spacecraft, which did not reach Venus due to a malfunction during its launch in 1972. The risks associated with the reentry of space debris are generally low, but the incident serves as a reminder of the need for ongoing efforts in space debris mitigation to prevent future incidents and mitigate potential risks.

### Key Takeaways
  - A piece of a Soviet spacecraft, Cosmos 482, is expected to reenter Earth's atmosphere around May 10, 2025.
  - There is uncertainty about the exact shape, size, and the portion of the spacecraft set to reenter, leading to unpredictability and potential risks.
  - The object poses a minimal risk of causing deadly damage, with a probability of around 1 in 25,000, but there is a possibility of landing in populated areas.

- _Published: 2025-05-06 08:36:00.000Z_

### Summary

When the cardinals enter the Sistine Chapel for the conclave, they will be sealed off from the world. However, attempts to influence their thinking through written materials, such as the 'College of Cardinals Report,' have been made. The report, created by Edward Pentin and Diane Montagna and distributed by conservative Catholic groups like Sophia Institute Press and the Papal Foundation, aims to steer the conclave in a more conservative direction. The report contains profiles of papal candidates, some of whom are portrayed in a favorable light while others are criticized. The cardinals are not easily influenced by such efforts, and the secrecy of the conclave is designed to prevent outside influence. However, various conservative Catholic groups, including the Society of St. Pius X, are trying to influence the election process.

### Key Takeaways
  - The cardinals who will elect the next pope have been offered a dossier on papal candidates, containing profiles and opinions on their positions, potentially influencing their decisions.

## Trump’s trade war with Canada has backfired on America. Now he has a crucial meeting with Mark Carney

- _Published: 2025-05-06 08:14:00.000Z_

### Summary

A crucial meeting is scheduled between Mark Carney, the Canadian Prime Minister, and Donald Trump, the US President, on May 6, 2025. This meeting is expected to be contentious, given the strained relationship between the two countries due to the U.S. trade war with Canada. The U.S. trade war has had negative effects on both American and Canadian businesses, and has disrupted trade relationships between the two nations. Canada's recent election and the newly elected government's stance on Trump's policies may influence the outcome of this meeting.

The Federal Reserve's Beige Book report indicates that American businesses are noticing fewer Canadian tourists due to the trade war, and that some retailers and hospitality providers have seen a material drop in cross-border tourism. Furthermore, Canadians are opting to not purchase American-made products in favor of alternatives from other countries, such as Italian tomatoes, Ohio-made pepperoni, and Coca Cola with Canadian maple syrup. The key elements of the trade relationship between the US and Canada, including the USMCA, NAFTA, and recent tariff actions, are discussed, highlighting the historical context and current state of affairs.

## Drone strikes pound Port Sudan, putting aid deliveries at risk

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/06/africa/drone-strikes-port-sudan-intl)
- _Published: 2025-05-06 07:17:00-04:17_

### Summary

Explosions and fires rocked Sudan’s main port city and wartime capital Port Sudan on Tuesday, with a drone assault that has torched the country’s biggest fuel depot, damaging the most important gateway for foreign aid. The attacks came after the army-aligned government accused the United Arab Emirates of backing the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), responsible for the drone strikes. The attacks have escalated the conflict, with the RSF shifting tactics from ground incursions to drone attacks targeting power stations and other facilities deep in army-controlled territory. The attacks have drawn condemnation from neighboring countries and the UN, and with the army’s success in pushing the RSF out of most of central Sudan, the paramilitary has shifted tactics, continuing to fight ground battles for control of al-Fashir.

### Summary

Cirrus Aircraft, a leader in 'personal aviation,' has launched the first FAA-certified autonomous safety system in a single-engine piston airplane called 'Safe Return.' This system allows an airplane to land safely and autonomously by pressing a red button. The Safe Return system, first certified in the Vision Jet by Cirrus in August 2020, is now available in the SR Series G7+ aircraft. The system works by making a decision to route the plane to the closest available runway if the pilot is incapacitated. It takes control of the aircraft and ensures a safe landing in the center of the runway without any human intervention. Cirrus aims to introduce more people to aviation and make it more accessible by creating user-friendly flight decks and interfaces.

## Businesses find strange but legal ways to avoid Trump’s tariffs

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/06/economy/us-businesses-avoiding-tariffs)
- _Published: 2025-05-06 07:00:00-11:59_

### Summary

A few months after President Trump imposed tariffs on various imports, US businesses are finding creative ways to avoid paying these additional costs. Two popular methods include 'tariff engineering' and the use of bonded warehouses. 'Tariff engineering' involves manipulating product classification codes and materials to qualify for lower tariff rates. For instance, Columbia Sportswear has employed a team to modify products for lower rates. The bonded warehouse approach, on the other hand, allows businesses to store goods tariff-free in regulated warehouses, with tariffs only due when goods are removed. According to Erik Smithweiss of GDLSK, a partner specializing in trade compliance, there are still opportunities to avoid additional tariffs through these methods. Jennifer Hartry, president of Howard Hartry, a customs broker in Los Angeles, noted that her company's bonded warehouse business has experienced a surge in inquiries since tariffs were implemented, with goods primarily from China being stored. This legal workaround is seen as a response to the economic impact of the tariffs.

### Key Takeaways
  - American businesses are exploring legal ways to avoid Trump’s tariffs through 'tariff engineering' and the use of bonded warehouses.
  - Businesses are utilizing 'tariff engineering' by altering product materials to qualify for lower tariff rates.
  - The use of bonded warehouses involves storing goods without tariffs until they are moved out, betting on future tariff rate reductions.

### Summary

At least 12 ICE arrests on or near courthouse grounds have occurred across seven states since January 2025. Experts warn that these arrests, which have disrupted judicial processes and made communities less safe, may intimidate people from going to court hearings. Some legal experts and immigration advocates are concerned that undocumented immigrants are changing their behaviors and avoiding places where they normally find work. The Trump administration has been criticized for its rapid deportation procedures and the use of ICE arrests near courthouses, which they defend as tactical approaches to catch criminals and keep the community safe. Wilson Martell-Lebron, who the government alleges is an undocumented immigrant from the Dominican Republic, was arrested by an ICE agent outside a Boston courthouse during his jury trial. Other cases include a 41-year-old man arrested in Charlottesville, Virginia, and a couple in Ohio who were afraid to attend a routine immigration appointment after Rodriguez's arrest. The article highlights how these arrests, particularly their timing and location, can cause significant disruptions and potential fears for individuals and their families involved in legal proceedings.

## Israel vows to escalate war with new plan to 'conquer' Gaza

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/05/middleeast/israel-gaza-expansion-hnk-intl)
- _Published: 2025-05-06 05:30:00-05:30_

### Summary

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced an expanded military operation in Gaza, known as 'Gideon's Chariots,' to 'conquer' the territory. This operation was unanimously approved by the security cabinet and aims to subdue Hamas and secure the release of Israeli hostages. The plan includes the displacement of Gaza's entire population to the south of the enclave and lifting the blockade, pending a hostage deal. The military's top spokesman, Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin, stated that the primary goal is the return of hostages, not the defeat of Hamas. The announcement was made following the approval of the security cabinet, which coincided with the mobilization of tens of thousands of reservists by the military. The military spokesman faced swift condemnation from the national security minister, Itamar Ben Gvir, who criticized him for being 'confused into thinking that the army is above the political echelon.' The conflict is ongoing amidst international condemnation, with the UN, France, and China expressing concern over the potential humanitarian and political consequences of the expanded operations. The United States and Israeli officials are also discussing a mechanism to deliver aid to Gaza that bypasses Hamas, as Hamas rejected the new aid framework. Aid agencies have also criticized the new framework, arguing it would not ensure aid reaches Gaza's most vulnerable residents.

### Summary

When President Donald Trump welcomes his new Canadian counterpart, Mark Carney, to the White House on Tuesday, the U.S. and Canada's upcoming summit in Kananaskis, Alberta is set to be a major test of their relationship. Trump and his aides have not yet made a final decision on whether to attend the Group of 7 (G7) meeting, which is scheduled for mid-June. The meeting is crucial for Canada as it seeks to improve relations with the U.S., especially after Trump took office and caused tensions in their alliance. Despite this, Trump's trade war with Canada and threats to the country's sovereignty have led to a more confrontational relationship. Canadian officials believe Tuesday's meeting will be the strongest indicator of Trump's intentions to attend, while Trump has expressed a more positive attitude towards Canada under his new prime minister. Despite the disagreement on tariffs, there are still hopes that the summit can improve trade and security ties between the countries. The article emphasizes that Trump's attendance at the summit is important for the stability of the alliance system, and the potential absence of the U.S. could have significant implications on the summit and the global response to the conflict in Ukraine.

### Summary

This article by Stephen Collinson analyzes President Donald Trump's proposal to reopen Alcatraz as a federal prison, framing it as a metaphorical extension of his leadership style.

## Trump administration argues to keep window short for alleged Tren de Aragua detainees to challenge removal

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/05/politics/hearing-tren-de-aragua-detainees)
- _Published: 2025-05-05 18:31:00+00:00_

### Summary

The Trump administration is arguing for the swift removal of Venezuelan detainees from the U.S. under the Alien Enemies Act, claiming they are not eligible for a designated alien enemy status that would require sending them to the brutal El Salvador prison CECOT. The U.S. Justice Department argues that the detainee's status should keep a federal judge out of the matter, but federal Judge Stephanie Haines of Pennsylvania is considering the arguments and has raised concerns about the amount of time detainees have to challenge their removal. The ACLU represents detained Venezuelan men who argue the Alien Enemies Act should not be used to remove them without due process and due to the potential brutality of the El Salvador prison. The Trump administration is also pushing for shorter windows to challenge removal under the Alien Enemies Act, arguing this is reasonable. The case is ongoing, with Haines not committing to a ruling at the hearing. If she rules in favor of the Trump administration, it could set a precedent for quicker detainee removals under the law.

Rite Aid's CEO, Matt Schroeder, stated that the company is encouraged by the interest from potential national and regional strategic acquirors.

### Summary

President Donald Trump's auto tariffs are estimated to cost Ford $1.5 billion this year. Ford CFO Sherry House stated that overall US car prices may rise 1% to 1.5% in the second half of 2025. The tariffs include a 25% levy on all imported vehicles and a similar tariff on most auto parts, though automakers can offset some of these costs. Ford expects a sharp overall drop in auto sales later this year as Americans rushed to buy vehicles ahead of the tariffs. The company will likely see fewer effects from tariffs than General Motors due to its reliance on American assembly plants. Ford withdrew its full-year earnings guidance due to the tariff uncertainty and is selling off its imported vehicle inventory.

## Five people rescued almost two days after plane crashes into alligator-infested swamp

- _Published: 2025-05-05 17:53:00.000Z_

### Summary

Five people, including a child, were rescued almost two days after their plane crashed in an alligator-infested swamp in the Amazonian jungle of Bolivia. The pilot of the small aircraft, which had crashed on Wednesday, was able to report technical issues before all contact with the aircraft was lost. The plane had taken off from the Baures municipality in northern Bolivia and was bound for the city of Trinidad. The group, which included the pilot, three women, and a child, was not seriously injured and survived on rations such as chocolate and cassava flour. The pilot managed the emergency landing near an alligator nest, but the strong smell from the fuel leak kept the alligators away. However, the group was without drinking water, and the alligators made noises at night, scaring the survivors. Search and rescue operations were hindered by adverse weather conditions, but eventually, the group was found by fishermen early Friday morning and airlifted to the city of Trinidad by a rescue helicopter from the Bolivian Air Force. The survival of the group and the efforts of the pilot, government agencies, and local communities in organizing the rescue operation highlight the importance of swift and effective emergency responses in remote and dangerous locations.

## 60 Minutes probe is 'penalty,' not 'threat,' per FCC chair

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/05/media/fcc-cbs-investigation)
- _Published: 2025-05-05 15:22:00-20:22_

### Summary

Brendan Carr, the FCC chair, clarified that the federal inquiry into CBS' '60 Minutes' over their October interview with Vice President Kamala Harris is a penalty under the Communications Act, not a threat to the broadcaster. Carr stressed the need for trust in the media and attributed the perceived issue of 'news distortion' to national broadcasters, such as ABC, NBC, and CBS, rather than local TV stations. Carr has been involved in a larger campaign of attacks on legacy media, including a push by President Donald Trump for CBS' license revocation and a settlement against the broadcaster. The investigation into '60 Minutes' is part of multiple complaints against CBS, NBC, and Fox News for 'news distortion,' with the FCC chair reinstating these complaints after their initial dismissal. However, Carr has stated that the license investigations and the president's lawsuit into '60 Minutes' are separate from the FCC's merger probe involving CBS parent Paramount and Skydance Media.

  - Brendan Carr, the FCC chair, does not view the federal inquiry into CBS' '60 Minutes' as a threat, but rather a penalty under the Communications Act. The investigation seeks to address the perceived issue of 'news distortion,' which the FCC chair perceives as national broadcasters exercising excessive control over local TV stations.
  - Carr has stressed the need to trust in the media and believes the fault lies with larger broadcasters, particularly those like ABC, NBC, and CBS, rather than local TV stations.

### Summary

Grief and fear permeate the Kashmir region, separated by the disputed Line of Control (LoC) between India and Pakistan. Malik Khadim, a 55-year-old farmer in Sarjiwar, a village on the Pakistani side of the LoC, expresses his deep fear and grief over the recent terrorist attack in the Indian-controlled part of Kashmir, which killed 26 tourists. Indian authorities shot at the villagers from Indian-controlled positions, making life increasingly dangerous for residents. Despite the escalating tensions, both sides are quick to blame each other, expelling diplomats and closing airspace, leading to military readiness and a potential for conflict. The region, home to millions of people split across the LoC, faces challenges such as an intense insurgency in the western border areas and loss of livelihood due to border skirmishes. Both India and Pakistan are accused of harboring militant groups, leading to heightened public pressure for retaliation from India's Prime Minister, Narendra Modi.

### Summary

The U.S. Army has suspended helicopter flight operations into the Pentagon pending an investigation after two commercial planes had to abort landings at Reagan National Airport due to a helicopter approaching the Pentagon. The incident occurred on a day following the January 29 midair collision between an American Airlines Flight 5342 and an Army helicopter, which killed 67 people. The National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Administration are investigating the events. The Army unit involved, the 12th Aviation Battalion, which was based out of Fort Belvoir, Virginia, was suspended from flights following the incidents. The proximity of the aircraft involved in the aborted landings was very close, raising concerns about the potential for future midair collisions. The FAA has also banned helicopter traffic in a specific area over the Potomac River, following the January 29 collision. Senator Maria Cantwell has called for stronger FAA and DOD oversight of the airspace to ensure the safety of the flying public. The incident underscores the ongoing safety concerns in the national airspace, particularly around airports and densely populated areas.

- _Published: 2025-05-05 14:17:00.000Z_

### Summary

A new analysis by TransUnion indicates that about 4 million, or roughly one in five, federal student loan borrowers with a payment due are seriously delinquent, a significant jump from February 2020 when 11.5% were seriously delinquent. This percentage has risen to 20.5% as of February, according to the analysis. The Department of Education has announced that federal student loans are due again, following a pause during the pandemic. TransUnion cautioned that the findings may understate the problem due to some borrowers not yet being reported as seriously delinquent.

## Scientists explore the anatomy of a 'zombie volcano' that’s showing signs of activity

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/05/science/uturuncu-zombie-volcano-erupt)
- _Published: 2025-05-05 14:10:00-16:10_

### Summary

Scientists have discovered a 'zombie volcano' located in the Central Andes mountain range, Uturuncu, which has been inactive for over 250,000 years but is showing signs of activity similar to active volcanoes. The study, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, used satellite data and seismic activity analysis to reveal the volcano's inner dynamics. The findings suggest that magma, gases, and briny fluids are interacting in a hydrothermal network beneath the volcano, rather than surging magma as previously thought. This interaction causes the volcano to rise by about 0.4 inches per year, release steam, and trigger quakes. While the volcano's activity is not considered an impending eruption, it does not appear to be cooling off. The research could help identify other zombie volcanoes at risk of future activity and aid in the potential development of geothermal energy and mining opportunities. The findings are significant for understanding volcanoes and could improve risk and hazard assessments.

### Summary

A Temple University student, believed to be involved in an antisemitic incident, has been placed on interim suspension by the school's president, John Fry. The incident, which occurred at Barstool Sports Bar in Philadelphia, was sparked by an antisemitic sign reading 'F**k the Jews' that was posted at the bar, owned by Dave Portnoy, the founder of Barstool Sports. The sign was part of a request for bottle service and a letter board that accompanies high-end beverage offerings. Temple University is investigating the case, which has been deemed a 'deeply disturbing' antisemitic event. The university president released a letter stating that acts of hatred and discrimination are not tolerated at the institution, and that antisemitism is abhorrent. Dave Portnoy, the bar's owner and a Jew, has offered to pay for the men involved in the incident to visit Auschwitz, a former Nazi concentration camp in Poland, as a way to learn about the horrors of the Holocaust. The Department of Education is also investigating Temple University and other US institutions for alleged antisemitic discrimination and harassment.

## Marijuana is extremely dangerous to the fetus in the womb, study finds

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/05/health/marijuana-prenatal-harm-wellness)
- _Published: 2025-05-05 12:49:00-20:49_

### Summary

A meta-analysis of research has found that using marijuana during pregnancy is linked to poor fetal development, low infant birth weight, dangerously early deliveries, and even death. This study, led by obstetrician and lead study author Dr. Jamie Lo, found that there is a 52% higher risk of preterm delivery and a 75% higher risk of low birth weight. The new study, published in JAMA Pediatrics, analyzed 51 studies with over 21 million participants. Despite the potential harms to the baby both before and after birth, use of marijuana during pregnancy is rising, with use predominantly recreational rather than medical. The findings suggest that there is a lack of clear public health messaging about the health risks of marijuana use during pregnancy, and that further research is needed to better understand and address these risks.

### Key Takeaways
  - Marijuana use during pregnancy is linked to poor fetal development, low infant birth weight, dangerously early deliveries, and even death.
  - There is a mistaken perception that because marijuana is natural and plant-based, it’s not harmful.
  - The study found that use of marijuana during pregnancy was linked to a 52% higher risk of preterm delivery before 37 weeks and a 75% higher risk of low birth weight.
  - Modern research into the potential harms of cannabis is still in its infancy.
  - There is a lack of clear public health messaging about the health harms of cannabis.
  - Marijuana use during pregnancy raises the risk of stroke by 42% and heart attack by 25%. 
  - The incidence of emergency care and hospitalization is 25% higher for marijuana users.
  - Research over the last decade has linked marijuana use to cognitive decline, dementia, complications during elective surgery, and an increased risk of some cancers.
  - Daily use by adolescents and adults can result in uncontrollable vomiting.
  - Children born to marijuana users have more psychotic-like behaviors and weaker cognitive abilities.

## Trump administration asks court to toss suit restricting access to abortion drug

- [source](https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5388198)
- _Published: 2025-05-06 13:20:00-20:20_

### Summary

On May 6, 2025, the Trump administration requested that a judge dismiss a lawsuit filed by Idaho, Kansas, and Missouri. These states argue that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) should roll back access to mifepristone, a common abortion medication. The government contends that the states do not have the legal right to sue and that their claims should be dismissed or transferred to a different venue. The lawsuit, originally filed after the Supreme Court preserved mifepristone access, seeks to prohibit telehealth prescriptions for the drug, require in-office visits, and limit its use to specific stages of pregnancy. U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, who has previously ruled against the drug's telehealth access, is overseeing the case. This move is part of the ongoing conflict over abortion rights, as the Trump administration tries to challenge the legal standing of the lawsuit initiated by the Biden administration.

## 20 years later, the Real ID deadline is here. Here's why it took so long.

- [source](https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5387735)
- _Published: 2025-05-06 05:00:00.000Z_

### Summary

A 20-year-old law requiring state-issued IDs to meet federal standards has taken effect, with some states still working towards compliance. The Real ID Act, introduced in 2005 after the 9/11 attacks, aimed to improve the security and authenticity of IDs. However, the implementation faced resistance and complications, with varying degrees of compliance across states. The Real ID Act has two primary goals: to make IDs harder to counterfeit and to enhance state verification. While the law has been delayed numerous times, its deadline in airports is set for May 7, 2025. Non-Real ID compliant driver's licenses will no longer be accepted, impacting the travel rights of undocumented residents. The law has also been criticized for potentially aiding illegal immigration by providing a means for some to travel without being detected. Despite delays and ongoing pushback, the federal government is now auditing compliance, indicating the continued relevance of the Real ID Act in contemporary U.S. policy. The article highlights the complexities of the law's implementation, its impacts, and its ongoing relevance in the context of U.S. immigration policies.

### Summary

German lawmakers confirmed Friedrich Merz as the new chancellor in a second vote in parliament, following an unexpected defeat in the first round.

- _Published: 2025-05-05 12:01:00-20:01_

### Summary

A small Maryland town that voted for Trump overwhelmingly was shocked by the administration's decision to cancel in-person classes at the National Fire Academy, a facility that trains firefighters and is vital to the local economy. Mayor Frank Davis, who voted for Trump, sees the cancellation as a breach of his campaign promises to cut waste. The former superintendent of the National Fire Academy, Denis Onieal, argues that the academy plays a crucial role in training firefighters and preparing them for real-world emergencies. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which oversees the academy, claimed the cancellation was due to travel costs, but many residents and firefighters believe this is an unnecessary move.

## Bipartisan push to ban lawmakers from trading stocks gets a boost from Trump

- [source](https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5381400)
- _Published: 2025-05-06 20:19:00-20:21_

### Summary

President Trump and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries have expressed support for legislation to ban lawmakers from trading individual stocks. This bipartisan effort has gained momentum in recent weeks, with Trump indicating he would sign a bill that ends the ability of members of Congress to buy or sell individual stocks. The push for this ban has been bolstered by a flurry of lawmaker's stock trades around the time of President Trump's tariff announcement, which raised questions about whether they had received advance notice. The legislation would ban both lawmakers and their spouses from trading individual stocks. It covers a transition period for current lawmakers to shift to either blind trusts or mutual funds, and for newly elected members to divest. Despite some resistance from members of both parties, proponents argue that the ban is necessary to prevent potential conflicts of interest and insider trading. The legislation has gained attention from constituents and appears to have garnered support from a majority of the public, as shown by recent polling results.

## Critics warn DOJ is being politicized despite vows to end its purported weaponization

- [source](https://text.npr.org/g-s1-64305)
- _Published: 2025-05-06 05:00:00-04:59_

### Summary

Critics of Attorney General Pam Bondi argue that she is politicizing the Justice Department despite her promise to end what they claim was a previous administration's alleged weaponization. The article highlights several incidents and actions taken under Bondi's leadership that are viewed as politically motivated, including the dismissal of the corruption case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams and the firing of prosecutors who worked on Trump-related cases. It also mentions the resignation of Ryan Crosswell, a federal prosecutor in the Public Integrity Section, who was forced to sign the dismissal of the Adams case within an hour due to political pressure. Critics suggest that the Justice Department is now essentially whatever the president wants it to be, driven by political considerations rather than expertise and integrity. Pam Bondi, who previously served as President Trump's defense attorney, has been described by some as transforming the department into a personal law firm for the president, with decisions driven by the White House's political preferences rather than the Justice Department's professional judgment.

## Most Americans use federal science information on a weekly basis, a new poll finds

- [source](https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5387367)
- _Published: 2025-05-06 06:00:00-20:00_

### Summary

A new nationwide poll by the Association of Science and Technology Centers found that most Americans rely on federal science information in their daily lives, including weather forecasts, job market reports, and food safety warnings, with 90% of respondents using weather forecasts on a weekly basis. The poll also indicated that only 10% of respondents were concerned about cuts to federal support for science impacting their access to such information. The Trump administration has made deep budget and personnel cuts to federal agencies that collect weather data and do safety inspections at factories, which could potentially impact the public's reliance on this information. The poll was conducted to understand current attitudes about science in the U.S. and to inform how science museums and other educational centers can better serve the public. The poll showed that there is some agreement across party affiliation that federal investment in STEM education is important for future economic prosperity, and that respondents from both parties are concerned about policy changes that might make it harder for the U.S. to attract and retain top scientists.

## Trump says he will reopen Alcatraz for the 'most ruthless and violent' prisoners

- [source](https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5387239)
- _Published: 2025-05-05 17:03:00-20:03_

### Summary

President Donald Trump has ordered federal agencies to reopen Alcatraz, the notorious maximum security prison that closed more than 60 years ago. Alcatraz was opened in 1934 and has become a historic site with a notorious reputation, housing dangerous criminals like Al Capone. However, the prison's history shows it was expensive to maintain and had significant infrastructure challenges. Historian Jolene Babyak highlighted the challenges, including the need to bring in water and sewage, while Dan Berger, a historian, expressed skepticism about the feasibility and cost of reopening it. The National Park Service noted that Alcatraz attracts millions of visitors annually, making its closure a significant loss for the local economy. Despite the challenges, Trump's plan suggests he sees Alcatraz as a symbol of law and order, drawing parallels with his administration's focus on public safety and the fight against illegal immigration.

## Trump expands military use at the southern border. Are there legal limits?

- [source](https://text.npr.org/g-s1-63778)
- _Published: 2025-05-06 05:00:00-20:00_

### Summary

President Trump is using the military for immigration enforcement in a way that has been limited by the Posse Comitatus Act, a 150-year-old law intended to prevent federal troops from participating in civilian law enforcement activities. The Posse Comitatus Act was created in response to concerns about military overreach during the Civil War. Trump has recently designated a 170-mile stretch of federal land along the southern border as a military installation, allowing for more extensive use of military personnel in border patrol operations. While this shift is a significant change, it also poses challenges to the legal restrictions on military involvement in civilian law enforcement, such as the Insurrection Act, which has not been used for immigration enforcement before. The use of military forces for immigration enforcement is also raising questions about the clarity of the legal restrictions and the potential implications for military readiness and recruitment.

### Key Takeaways
  - President Trump has expanded the use of military forces for immigration enforcement, potentially challenging the Posse Comitatus Act, a law designed to limit federal troops' involvement in law enforcement on American soil.

## South Korea halted its adoption fraud investigation. Adoptees still demand the truth

### Summary

South Korea's government investigation into human rights violations in past international adoptions, which led to a landmark admission of government responsibility in March, has been halted. Adoptees and advocates are blaming the politicization and lack of understanding within the country's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, the government body leading the investigation. The investigation began in 2022 at the petition of 367 South Korean adoptees from 11 countries, including the U.S., who said they were falsely registered as orphans to be put up for adoption. In an interim report in March, the bipartisan Truth and Reconciliation Commission found that in 56 cases, adoption agencies falsified or obscured documents in a process facilitated by the government. However, the commission has put the remaining 311 cases on hold due to differences of opinion among commissioners and shortage of time, with the current term for investigation ending in late May.
