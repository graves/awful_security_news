	- [On a chilly March morning, Jason Storms stood on a patch of lawn across from a women's health clinic in Greenville, S.C. It's one of three clinics in that state that perform abortions. Dozens of other anti-abortion rights activists joined him, from Wisconsin, Florida and Mississippi. Storms had convened the group there for a conference to highlight what he felt to be the failures of the anti-abortion movement since Roe v. Wade was overturned. He said there should be no excuse for abortions still happening in a deep red, Bible Belt state like South Carolina. The abortion abolitionists are working on multiple fronts, including statehouses, grassroots pressure on state legislators, and local officials. They are pushing for hardline anti-abortion bills, criminalizing abortion and aiming to close the loophole that allows mothers to face legal immunity while doctors face felony charges. Despite the challenges, activists like Jason Storms believe that their approach could still succeed, as Republican legislators are more open to their policy prescriptions now that Roe v. Wade is no longer the law of the land. The article also highlights the broader cultural and religious imperative within this movement, which sees abortion as a threat to manhood, and aims to combat what they perceive as a crisis of masculinity.
