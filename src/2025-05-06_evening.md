### Summary

An additional F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jet from the USS Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier was lost at sea on May 6, 2025, marking the second such incident within a week. Two people familiar with the incident reported that the jet experienced some kind of arrestment failure during landing, leading to the pilot and weapons systems officer ejecting. They were rescued by a rescue helicopter and are both alive but suffered minor injuries. The jet crashed into the sea and has not been recovered. Separately, the Iran-backed Houthi rebel group reportedly attacked the Truman on Tuesday, despite an apparent ceasefire announced by President Donald Trump. The incidents raise concerns about the safety of US naval assets in the Red Sea, where ongoing conflicts and missile attacks have been occurring since the Houthi began their attacks in November 2023. The USS Harry S. Truman has faced several incidents in the Red Sea, including a collision with a merchant ship in February and another F/A-18 jet crashing into the Red Sea in December, both resulting from Houthi attacks. The incidents underscore the challenges faced by US naval forces in maintaining security and operational readiness in the region.

## Two more judges block the Trump administration’s use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport migrants

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/06/politics/judge-blocks-trump-administration-deport-migrants)
- _Published: 2025-05-06 17:00:00-04:00_

### Summary

Two more federal judges blocked the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport migrants from the Southern District of New York on May 6, 2025, citing constitutional violations and the lack of evidence supporting the administration's claims. The Alien Enemies Act is used to deport individuals from the US during times of war, but the judges found that it was not being used appropriately in this instance. The judges argued that the administration's use of the law violated due process, as it gave the migrants little notice and no proper legal procedure. The judges also noted that the Trump administration had used the law to deport migrants to El Salvador's notorious mega-prison, despite the law requiring active military invasion to justify its use. In a similar ruling, a federal judge in Colorado blocked the president from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport any migrants in that state, finding that the administration's use of the law was likely beyond its legal authority. These rulings add to a growing trend of legal challenges against the Trump administration's rapid deportation policies.

### Key Takeaways
  - Two more federal judges blocked the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport migrants from the Southern District of New York.
  - The Alien Enemies Act was used to justify the deportation of Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador's notorious mega-prison, which was found to violate constitutional protections.

## Eating an Inflammatory Diet May Make Your Kid’s First Period Start Earlier, New Study Suggests

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/06/health/nutrition-early-menstruation-wellness)
- _Published: 2025-05-06 16:50:00-20:50_

### Summary

A new study published in the journal Human Reproduction suggests that a more inflammatory diet in late childhood and early adolescence may lead to girls experiencing their first period earlier. The research, led by Dr. Holly Harris, found that a healthier diet can delay the start of menstruation. The study analyzed data from over 7,500 children and used two dietary indexes: the Alternative Healthy Eating Index and the Empirical Dietary Inflammatory Pattern. It showed that eating a more inflammatory diet was associated with a 15% greater chance of having the first period in the next month. Conversely, a healthier diet reduced the risk by 8%. The findings highlight the importance of promoting healthy eating patterns to reduce the risk of chronic diseases later in life, such as breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. The study suggests that other factors, aside from body mass index, may influence the connection between diet and early menstruation, and that it's crucial for parents to provide their children with access to healthy meal options.

### Key Takeaways
  - A 15% greater chance of having your first period in the next month is associated with eating an inflammatory diet
  - A 8% reduced risk of having your first period in the next month is associated with eating a healthier diet
  - An early first period is associated with a higher risk of breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes in adulthood

## Divided Supreme Court allows Trump administration to begin enforcing ban on transgender service members

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/06/politics/supreme-court-ban-transgender-service-members)
- _Published: 2025-05-06 16:37:00-04:00_

### Summary

The Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to begin enforcing a ban on transgender service members in the military, a decision that is a victory for the administration and a setback for the LGBTQ rights groups Lambda Legal and the Human Rights Campaign Foundation. The ban denies transgender individuals service in the military and restricts them from joining any branch of the military. It is not immediately effective and federal appeals court had refused to put a hold on the district court's ruling. The ban was challenged by legal challenges and was previously ruled unconstitutional by federal judges. The lead plaintiff in the DC case, a transgender lieutenant in the Army, expressed disappointment with the decision but said he would continue to perform his duties until he is no longer allowed to do so. There are 4,240 service members across active-duty, reserve, and the National Guard with a diagnosis of gender dysphoria. The ban's enforcement was also challenged by the Supreme Court, which held that the district court's injunction cannot be squared with the substantial deference that the Department's professional military judgments are owed.

### Key Takeaways
  - The Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to begin enforcing a ban on transgender service members in the military.

## T. rex ancestors crossed from Asia to North America via land bridge 70 million years ago, study finds

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/06/science/t-rex-ancestors-asia-study-scli-intl)
- _Published: 2025-05-06 19:36:00+00:00_

### Summary

A team led by Cassius Morrison, a doctoral student of paleontology at University College London, concluded through mathematical modeling that the direct ancestors of Tyrannosaurus rex arrived in North America from Asia via a land bridge around 70 million years ago. The study suggests that the Bering Strait served as the crossing route. Morrison's team also found that T. rex ancestors experienced rapid growth in size during a period of falling global temperatures, possibly due to environmental factors. The research indicates that T. rex was more closely related to the large carnivore Tarbosaurus found in Asia than to top predators in North America such as Daspletosaurus. The study, published in the journal Royal Society Open Science, tracks the evolution and growth of T. rex ancestors, including their role in replacing another group of giant meat-eating dinosaurs, the carcharodontosaurids, which went extinct, creating an opportunity for T. rex to grow to gigantic sizes. The findings highlight that T. rex's evolutionary success was influenced by climatic conditions.

## WeightWatchers Files for Bankruptcy Under Chapter 11

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/06/business/weight-watchers-bankruptcy)
- _Published: 2025-05-06 19:16:00-20:16_

### Summary

WeightWatchers, a 62-year-old dieting program, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, aiming to bolster its financial position and increase investment flexibility. The company, now known as WW International, struggled with over $1.5 billion in debt and failed to keep up with alternative weight loss methods. CEO Tara Comonte, a former Shake Shack CFO, will lead the restructuring, and the company plans to emerge as a publicly traded entity after eliminating its debt. During the bankruptcy process, the company will continue to serve its millions of members. The company's decline can be attributed to the failed turnaround plan under former CEO Sima Sistani, who was replaced due to a stock decline and pivoting towards a telehealth platform. Former star investor Oprah Winfrey also left the board and donated her shares to a museum. WW International's history includes a points system for dieting and exercise, which became a defining feature of the program.

### Key Takeaways
  - WeightWatchers, formerly known as WW, filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11, which will help bolster the company's financial position and allow it to reinvest in its members.
  - The CEO of the reorganized company, Tara Comonte, plans to accelerate innovation and reinvest in the members, while the operations for the members will continue as normal.
  - WW had faced financial difficulties, including a $1.5 billion in debt, and failed to keep pace with more convenient weight loss options.
  - The company's turnaround from the perspective of CEO Sima Sistani didn't work out, and she was forced out due to its stock's decline.
  - WeightWatchers' decline was also influenced by its decision to pivot towards telehealth, where patients can receive weight-loss and diabetes drug prescriptions from doctors, which wasn't aligned with the company's in-person approach.

### Named Entities
- **WW International**

## Lawmakers want answers after reporting reveals crippling vacancies at hurricane-prone National Weather Service office

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/06/weather/national-weather-service-staffing-hurricane-houston)
- _Published: 2025-05-06 16:18:00-20:18_

### Summary

Three Houston-area Democratic Representatives have sent a letter to the acting head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) demanding answers about staffing shortages, including vacancies in all management positions, at the National Weather Service's Houston-Galveston forecast office. The office, which serves more than 7 million people in Houston alone, is unique in lacking experts in all senior managerial roles, including meteorologist-in-charge. Representatives urge NOAA to fill management positions by May 30, warning that this could jeopardize life-saving weather warnings and extreme weather warnings during the upcoming hurricane season. Under the Trump administration, the NWS has faced cutbacks that have led to reduced services and reduced staffing. Representatives are particularly concerned given the lack of experienced meteorologists and the risk of errors or missed warnings if these positions remain unfilled.

## US is shutting down Office of Palestinian Affairs and merging it into its embassy in Jerusalem

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/06/politics/us-shutting-down-office-of-palestinian-affairs)
- _Published: 2025-05-06 16:14:00-20:14_

### Summary

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the closing of the Office of Palestinian Affairs and its merger into the US embassy in Jerusalem. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce stated that the closure will 'restore the first Trump term framework' of a unified US diplomatic mission. The decision is being made to ensure that the interests of the embassy, US foreign aid, and other actions can work together more effectively. However, this move has been criticized as a further step in downgrading relations with the Palestinian people, particularly in light of Israel's expansion of its war in Gaza and the ongoing blockade of Gaza. David Friedman, a staunch advocate of Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank during Trump's first term, was the primary intermediary for the Palestinians to talk to the US government. The Biden administration did not reopen the consulate general despite claiming it would do so. The move to close the Office of Palestinian Affairs is seen as a significant shift in the US-Palestinian relationship and may affect how the US engages with the Palestinian people and their government in the future.

## A man spent 45 days in jail, accused of trying to abduct a child at Walmart. A judge granted a bond after lawyer shows video

- _Published: 2025-05-06 16:12:00-19:12_

### Summary

Mahendra Patel, who is facing attempted kidnapping and other charges, was granted a $10,000 bond after spending 45 days in Cobb County jail. The bond was granted by Cobb County Superior Court Judge A. Gregory Poole after being shown video footage by Patel's lawyer. The video allegedly shows Patel attempting to grab a 2-year-old boy's mother's child while the mother was riding a scooter with the child in her lap. The video is somewhat grainy and Patel's back obscures part of the scene. Prosecutor argued that Patel grabbed the child and fled, while the defense contended that he did not flee and had strong ties to the community. Caroline Miller, the 26-year-old mother who was allegedly in the Walmart when the incident happened, said Patel asked for help finding Tylenol at the store. She claimed Patel tried to grab her son, but she pulled him back. The defense further argued that Patel had ties to the community, such as owning property, being married, and volunteering. The case, which was indicted on April 3rd, was presented to a grand jury. Patel spent his birthday in jail and has been in legal proceedings for 45 days.

### Key Takeaways
  - Mahendra Patel, 57, was granted a $10,000 bond after being held in jail for 45 days.

## Ukrainian drones attack Moscow, temporarily halting flights ahead of major military parade

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/06/europe/ukraine-drones-moscow-may-9-xi-intl-hnk)
- _Published: 2025-05-06 17:37:00-18:37_

### Summary

Ukrainian drones attacked Moscow for the second consecutive night, temporarily halting flights at four airports in the Russian capital. This occurred as Moscow was preparing to host a major military parade expected to be attended by world leaders, including China's President Xi Jinping. The attack comes after a three-day ceasefire called by Putin, which Kyiv has criticized as being unfulfilled. The latest Ukrainian attack on the Russian capital comes ahead of Xi's expected arrival in Moscow, with a military parade set to be held in Moscow on May 9th to commemorate the Soviet Union's defeat in World War II. The attack on Moscow was part of a series of 105 Ukrainian drones intercepted across Russia overnight. Despite the attacks, Russia has canceled planned commemorations in Sevastopol, Crimea, and Krasnador due to security reasons. In response to the attacks, Ukraine called on international allies not to send troops to Russia's Victory Day celebrations, stating such participation would be a desecration of the memory of the victory over Nazism. Ukraine has increasingly turned to drones to counter Russia's advantage in manpower and resources. Meanwhile, Kyiv has claimed it shot down a Russian Su-30 fighter jet for the first time using a seaborne drone, while a Ukrainian official confirmed the country's military retains a presence inside Russia's Kursk.

### Summary

Friedrich Merz, the German Chancellor, has been appointed for a second time after an unprecedented parliamentary defeat. Despite having won a February election and forming a coalition with the Social Democrats, Merz failed to secure a parliamentary majority.

Merz's new tenure faces challenges, including the potential for new elections and the need to navigate the demands of his coalition and the US-UK alliance. He aims to change Germany's debt brake and pursue a security policy change, but his success will depend on maintaining stability and support within his coalition.

## Trump admin plans to shut down money-saving Energy Star program soon, sources say

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/06/climate/energy-star-trump)
- _Published: 2025-05-06 17:21:00-20:21_

### Summary

The Trump administration is planning to shut down the Energy Star program, a key energy efficiency certification and labeling program, which helps American families save over $40 billion in annual energy costs. The program, which was previously threatened during Trump's first term but remained unclear in his second term, is part of a broader initiative within the EPA's Office of Air and Radiation to streamline organizational structures. This move has gained bipartisan support but is likely to face opposition from manufacturers, retailers, and environmental advocates. The Energy Star program's closure could significantly impact the EPA's ability to measure US fossil fuel emissions and enforce regulations to curb pollution. Senator Susan Collins, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, expressed bafflement at the administration's decision to eliminate the Energy Star program. The program, implemented in 1992 by the Bush administration, has been a cornerstone of energy conservation efforts and is recognized by over 90% of US households.

### Summary

Trainer Bill Mott informed the Preakness Stakes' executive vice president, Mike Rogers, that Sovereign will instead focus on the Belmont Stakes, the final leg of the Triple Crown. Sovereign, who won the Derby on a muddy track in Louisville, Kentucky, on the Saturday before the announcement, will not race in the Preakness, scheduled for May 17 at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore. The trainer expressed that the decision was made to do what was best for the horse. The last Triple Crown winner was Justify in 2018, and this decision means there will be no Triple Crown winner this year. Sovereign was injured with a scrape on his right front pastern, which was likely from clipping heels with another horse during the Derby.

## Netanyahu chooses war – and his political survival – as Israelis demand hostage deal - Analysis by Jeremy Diamond, CNN

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/06/middleeast/analysis-netanyahu-war-over-hostage-deal-latam-intl)
- _Published: 2025-05-06 15:01:00-20:00_

### Summary

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has chosen to prioritize military action over the release of 59 Israeli hostages held in Gaza, a decision that has been criticized by many Israelis and Hamas alike. Netanyahu's decision to expand the military assault in Gaza comes amidst ongoing military operations by Israel against Hamas. While some right-wing ministers and Netanyahu's wife have expressed support for the expanded war effort, Netanyahu is now turning a rhetoric of defeating Hamas into action. Israeli officials are calling up tens of thousands of reservists to seize and occupy large swaths of Gaza, claiming that this will be the 'final moves' against Hamas. This decision has been met with significant concern from hostages' families and humanitarian organizations, as it risks endangering the hostages' safety and potentially causing another mass displacement of Palestinians in Gaza. However, the military's ability to achieve its objectives remains uncertain, and the dynamics of the conflict remain largely unchanged due to Hamas's resilience and Israel's inability to effectively counter their armed resistance. This decision is seen by many as a shift from the cautious approach taken by Israel under former President Joe Biden and a move towards a more aggressive posture under current President Donald Trump.

## Jury begins deliberating fate of 3 former Memphis officers charged in Tyre Nichols’ death

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/06/us/tyre-nichols-trial-jury-deliberations)
- _Published: 2025-05-06 14:28:00-20:28_

### Summary

The fate of three former Memphis police officers charged in the beating of Tyre Nichols was decided by a jury in Hamilton County. Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man, died from blunt-force trauma after being pepper-sprayed and hit with a Taser during a January 2023 traffic stop. The officers—Demetrius Haley, Justin Smith, and Tadarrius Bean—were already facing federal charges for the beating. Defense lawyers argued that Nichols was actively resisting arrest, while prosecutors argued the officers used excessive and deadly force. The trial, conducted outside Memphis to avoid jury bias, came after the US Justice Department found the Memphis Police Department uses excessive force and discriminates against Black people. The five officers were part of a Scorpion Unit focused on drug, gun, and violent offenders, but often used force against unarmed individuals. The case highlights the ongoing scrutiny of police departments and the complex legal and medical evidence presented in such high-profile cases.

### Key Takeaways
  - A jury deliberated the fate of three former Memphis police officers charged in the beating of Tyre Nichols. The trial concluded with the jury deciding the fate of the officers, who were charged with second-degree murder, aggravated assault, and other charges. The trial took place in Hamilton County, outside Shelby County where Memphis is located, due to concerns of jury bias from the intense public scrutiny of the case. The officers, including Demetrius Haley, Justin Smith, and Tadarrius Bean, were already convicted of federal charges.

## Trump judges pump brakes so far on Alien Enemies Act deportations to El Salvador

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/06/politics/trump-judges-enemies-act-deportations)
- _Published: 2025-05-06 13:53:00.000Z_

### Summary

The Trump administration has attempted to use the Alien Enemies Act to deport undocumented immigrants from El Salvador, but federal courts, including judges Trump himself appointed, have been resisting these actions. The Alien Enemies Act allows the US government to deport immigrants without proper legal process. On Monday, federal judge Stephanie Haines in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, ruled that the administration couldn’t deport suspected Tren de Aragua gang members from Venezuela to El Salvador without providing due process. This ruling came after another Trump-appointed judge, Fernando Rodriguez Jr., in South Texas, ruled in the opposite direction, finding the Alien Enemies Act’s use unconstitutional. A third Democratic appointee, Alvin Hellerstein in Manhattan, also ruled the Alien Enemies Act was not lawful. These rulings are part of a broader fight against the Trump administration's use of the controversial law. The Supreme Court, with a conservative majority, put a hold on the administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act at the Bluebonnet Detention Center in an April 19 emergency vote. The Supreme Court directed each detainee to bring their own challenge where they are held, leading to the piecemeal handling of these cases across the country. This issue is expected to reach the Supreme Court, with the potential for major legal implications.

### Summary

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced the expansion of military operations in Gaza, stating that the goal is to subdue Hamas and secure the release of hostages. This comes after the US President's visit to the region was planned, as part of a strategy to potentially bring a hostage deal. The plan includes displacing Gaza's entire population, lifting the blockade, and occupying the security buffer zone around Gaza. However, this plan has faced condemnation from international and Palestinian organizations, who criticize the plan as being focused on the defeat of Hamas rather than securing the hostages' release. The UN and French officials raised concerns over civilian casualties and the humanitarian impact of the plan. Meanwhile, an Israeli aid mechanism bypassing Hamas is being discussed to deliver aid to Gaza under international law, though Hamas rejected the plan, stating it violates humanitarian principles. There are also concerns about the potential annexation of Gaza.

### Summary

A federal judge, Stephanie Gallagher, has refused to overturn her order requiring the Trump administration to facilitate the return of a 20-year-old Venezuelan asylum seeker, Cristian, who was deported to El Salvador. The judge, who was appointed by President Donald Trump in 2019, has noted that the Trump administration's decision to indicate the denial of Cristian's asylum application is premature.

## Just the way it is.” Trump says Canada's prime minister can do nothing to reduce tariffs today

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/06/business/trump-carney-tariffs)
- _Published: 2025-05-06 13:35:00-20:35_

### Summary

In an Oval Office meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, President Donald Trump stated that there is nothing Carney could say to convince him to reduce tariffs on Canadian goods. Trump claimed that Canada is subsidizing the U.S. by $200 billion a year, despite the official U.S. statistics showing a $35.7 billion goods and services trade deficit in 2024. Carney acknowledged that Canada being the top buyer of American goods could benefit the U.S. to restore free trade but emphasized that a trade deal would take time and discussion, not something that could happen during this meeting. Despite the mutual benefits of trading, Trump is imposing tariffs on Canadian goods, while Canada is retaliating with tariffs on US goods, both of which are hurting the trade relationship.

### Key Takeaways
  - President Trump stated that he would not reduce tariffs on Canadian goods, despite complaints about unfair treatment from Canada.

### Summary

The REAL ID deadline for U.S. states to enforce new security standards for identification documents is May 7, 2025. The REAL ID Act, passed by Congress in 2005, established minimum security standards for state-issued driver’s licenses and identification cards. Despite delays, TSA is fully prepared to enforce the law, and travelers without a REAL ID will still be allowed to fly with alternative acceptable forms of ID. However, states have varying requirements and costs for obtaining REAL IDs, and non-REAL ID compliant licenses are still valid for other purposes. REAL ID-compliant credentials are marked with a star at the top of the card. TSA encourages everyone to ensure they have a plan for providing an acceptable ID for future travel.

## US intelligence finds Venezuela not directing gang, undercutting Trump’s use of Alien Enemies Act

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/06/politics/tren-de-aragua-intelligence-alien-enemies-act)
- _Published: 2025-05-06 12:06:00-20:06_

### Summary

The US intelligence community has found evidence that suggests the Venezuelan government is not directing the movements and operations of the gang Tren de Aragua inside the United States. This conclusion, which has been declassified and released, contradicts President Donald Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act in March. Trump declared that the gang was acting hostilely and in coordination with the Maduro regime, but a judge in Texas ruled that Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act was unlawful. The intelligence assessment highlights the decentralized structure of Tren de Aragua and the difficulties in establishing a direct relationship between the Venezuelan government and the gang. The revelation has been met with criticism from the administration and support from intelligence officials, with the Director of National Intelligence calling the reporting 'propaganda' and calling for the continuation of the administration's efforts to deport gang members.

### Key Takeaways
  - The US intelligence community believes that the Venezuelan government is probably not directing the gang Tren de Aragua's movements and operations inside the United States.
  - The intelligence community's judgment is based on lethal law enforcement actions by the Venezuelan government and the decentralization of the gang.
  - This contradicts President Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act, which he invoked in March to speed up deportations of alleged Venezuelan gang members.

### Summary

Tesla's sales have plummeted across Europe, showing a sharp decline in sales in countries like the UK, the Netherlands, Denmark, Portugal, Sweden, and France in April.

## Title: Title of the burned, still-rolled scroll decoded after nearly 2,000 years; Author: Catherine Nicholls, CNN

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/06/science/herculaneum-scroll-title-author-decoded-intl-scli)
- _Published: 2025-05-06 10:49:00+00:00_

### Summary

Researchers have successfully deciphered the contents of a burned, still-rolled scroll from the ancient Roman town of Herculaneum, buried under volcanic debris in 79 AD. The scroll, named PHerc. 172, is one of hundreds of texts from the town that have been preserved under mud and ash in a villa believed to belong to the father-in-law of Julius Caesar. The scrolls were discovered in the 18th century and have been fragile and challenging to unroll for scholars over the years. Recently, Marcel Roth and Micha Nowak, graduate students from Germany’s University of Würzburg, along with Sean Johnson, have independently uncovered the title and author of the text, which is identified as 'On Vices' by the Greek philosopher Philodemus. This find is significant as it identifies the first book in Philodemus' 'On Vices and Their Opposite Virtues and In Whom They Are and About What' series, providing insights into the philosopher's ethical views and potentially revealing new content within the scroll. The discovery comes from the Vesuvius Challenge, an initiative that aims to decode texts of the Herculaneum scrolls without unrolling them, marking a major breakthrough in the field of ancient scrolls and papyrology.

## America’s trading partners have a massive bazooka in the trade war. They may never use it

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/06/economy/trade-war-tariffs-japan-china-us-debt)
- _Published: 2025-05-06 10:29:00-20:29_

### Summary

The article discusses the potential impact of a large-scale sale of US Treasury bonds by major foreign creditors like Japan, China, and the UK, which are key buyers of U.S. debt. Japanese Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato threatened to sell US Treasuries as a means of negotiating trade deals with the US, though he later backtracked. This move, if carried out, could destabilize global financial markets by increasing Treasury rates and making it harder for the US to borrow. The article highlights the interconnectedness of global financial markets, where the sale of U.S. debt by major foreign creditors can have negative repercussions, and suggests that trade tariffs could reduce net capital inflows. The author notes that while the threat to sell U.S. debt is rare, it serves as a reminder of the potential consequences of the ongoing trade war.

### Key Takeaways

  - The threat of dumping US debt by Japan or other nations like China and the UK could have significant impacts on the global financial markets.
  - The U.S. relies heavily on foreign investment in its debt, which can be destabilizing if other countries choose to sell large amounts of U.S. Treasuries.
  - Trade tariffs can reduce net capital inflows, according to both theoretical models and data.
  - The U.S. might need to sell its future debt at higher yields and lower prices if tariffs are fully implemented, which could result in higher borrowing costs and tax cuts.

- _Published: 2025-05-06 10:16:00-20:16_

### Summary

The Trump administration has taken drastic actions against Harvard University, halting all new federal research grants unless Harvard implements political policy changes. Education Secretary Linda McMahon wrote a letter to Harvard President Alan Garber, criticizing the university for its 'consistent violations of its own legal duties.' The administration's actions are part of a broader national clash over academic freedom, federal funding, and campus oversight.

The administration's latest move targets research grant funding, estimated to impact over $1 billion a year, and includes revoking the university's tax-exempt status and threatening its ability to host international students. Harvard has sued for the release of the federal research funding, stating that it would not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights.

## Trump administration asks judge to toss suit restricting access to abortion medication

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/06/health/mifepristone-abortion-pill-trump-lawsuit)
- _Published: 2025-05-06 10:14:00-04:00_

### Summary

The Trump administration has asked a judge to dismiss a lawsuit from Idaho, Kansas, and Missouri that seeks to limit access to the abortion medication mifepristone. The lawsuit argues that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) should roll back access to mifepristone, which is part of the most common method of abortion in the U.S. The states argue that the drug undermines their abortion laws, but the Department of Justice attorneys argue that the states lack legal standing to sue. The case is being considered in Texas by U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, a Trump nominee who previously ruled in favor of halting approval for the drug. The Trump administration previously stated they would not restrict access to abortion medication, but Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s views on abortion have shifted. The lawsuit challenges actions the FDA took in 2016 to loosen restrictions on mifepristone, which is usually used in combination with a second drug for medication abortion. Abortion is generally legal up to 22 weeks in Kansas and Missouri, while it is banned at all stages in Idaho.

## A Soviet-era spacecraft that failed to reach Venus is due to crash back to Earth this week

- _Published: 2025-05-06 09:30:00-20:30_

### Summary

A piece of Soviet spacecraft, Cosmos 482, is set to reenter Earth's atmosphere this week, bringing up concerns about space junk. Though most projections indicate Cosmos 482 will reenter around May 10, experts emphasize the uncertainty and unpredictability involved in space reentry. Despite the low risk of causing damage to Earth's surface, it is recommended that anyone encountering Cosmos 482 contact authorities immediately to prevent mishandling. The risk is roughly 1 in 25,000, and the area likely for landing encompasses prominent landmasses, although most of the Earth's surface is ocean. The 1967 Outer Space Treaty, which remains the primary document outlining international space law, ensures that any surviving debris would remain Russian property. The reentry of Cosmos 482 highlights the importance of debris mitigation efforts to minimize the risks associated with space objects that fail to reach their intended destinations.

## Cardinals choosing the next pope have been offered a dossier on candidates – with a subtext

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/06/world/cardinals-pope-conclave-dossier-candidates-intl)
- _Published: 2025-05-06 08:36:00-04:00_

### Summary

When the cardinals enter the Sistine Chapel for the conclave on the election of a new pope, they will be sealed off from the outside world. However, the process is not entirely free of external influences. A book titled 'The College of Cardinals Report,' compiled by Catholic journalists Edward Pentin and Diane Montagna, has been offered to cardinals. This resource contains profiles on around 40 papal candidates, highlighting their views on various topics such as same-sex blessings and contraception. It is suggested that the book is meant to influence the voting process in a direction that is different from that of the late Pope Francis, whose progressive reforms are unpopular with some conservatives. The creators of the report claim that their intention was to help the cardinals 'know one another better' and be 'accessible to as many cardinals as possible.' However, critics argue that the book is far from impartial and is an attempt to influence the conclave. Church laws and canon lawyers have emphasized the importance of preventing outside influence during the conclave, in line with the rules set by Pope John Paul II. The conclave process is currently subject to attempts from various conservative Catholic groups, including Napa Institute, Papal Foundation, and the Eternal Word Network. Cardinals are not easily influenced, as some warn against 'fake news' and maintain a critical stance towards the book's content.

### Summary

The Vatican announced that all mobile phone signals will be deactivated in the Vatican on Wednesday ahead of the secret conclave to elect the next pope. The Vatican plans to use signal jammers around the Sistine Chapel to prevent electronic surveillance or communication during the conclave. The cardinals will have to give up their phones and all electronic devices starting Tuesday and will only get their devices back once the conclave has ended. The cardinals will be locked in the Sistine Chapel and will take a vow to observe absolute and perpetual secrecy during the conclave. Even the electricians, plumbers, and elevator operators will commit to secrecy. The signal deactivation will not affect St. Peter's Square, where the public often gathers. Security has been ramped up throughout St. Peter's Square, with checkpoints at the entrances, metal detectors, and anti-drone systems deployed. The pilgrim’s route will remain unchanged, allowing the public to pass through the Holy Door of St. Peter's Basilica. The Sistine Chapel is placed under total lockdown during the conclave to guarantee complete secrecy. In 2013, during the conclave that elected Pope Francis, signal blockers were also installed to prevent any calls, texts, or internet access.

## Trump policies at odds with ‘Make America Healthy Again’ push

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/06/health/trump-policies-maha-kff-health-news)
- _Published: 2025-05-06 07:00:00-04:00_

### Summary

In his March address to Congress, President Donald Trump emphasized a 'Make America Healthy Again' initiative that included pledges to reduce childhood cancer rates and address chronic diseases. However, as the article discusses, Trump's administration has taken actions that are contradictory to this goal. By slashing 20,000 HHS positions, cutting research grants, and withdrawing from the World Health Organization, the administration has reduced the ability of federal agencies to combat chronic diseases and respond to health threats. Experts and advocates argue that these policies will make Americans less healthy, with potential long-term consequences for the nation's health.

### Key Takeaways
  - The Trump administration’s policies, such as slashing HHS positions and cutting research grants, run counter to their stated goal of reducing chronic disease through their 'Make America Healthy Again' initiative.
  - Public health advocates and experts argue that these policies will ultimately result in less healthy Americans, given the cuts in staff at key health agencies like CDC and NIH.
  - The administration has also withdrawn the U.S. from the World Health Organization and cut funding to USAID, leaving the nation more vulnerable to infectious diseases and disease outbreaks.
  - Research projects at NIH, including those on Alzheimer's and HIV, have been cut, impacting the progress on diseases that were previously mentioned as priorities by the administration.
  - The Trump administration's actions, such as weakening tailpipe emission standards and canceling research grants, are seen as undermining efforts to reduce chronic diseases.

## Falsified records, fake donations: Credit Suisse fined for helping rich Americans hide over $4 billion from the taxman

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/06/business/credit-suisse-fine-americans-tax-evasion-intl)
- _Published: 2025-05-06 04:24:00.000Z_

### Summary

A Credit Suisse unit has pleaded guilty to helping ultra-wealthy Americans evade taxes by hiding over $4 billion in offshore accounts and falsifying records. The unit will pay a fine of $510 million, marking the largest fine the bank has ever paid. This guilty plea stems from the Swiss bank’s practice of maintaining accounts in Singapore on behalf of US taxpayers who were using offshore accounts to evade US taxes and reporting requirements. The guilty plea also covers fraudulent acts such as falsifying records and processing fictitious donation paperwork. The case is linked to a 2014 plea agreement that the bank had previously made with US authorities but failed to uphold. UBS, which acquired Credit Suisse in 2023, entered a non-prosecution agreement as part of the settlement, agreeing to cooperate with investigations and disclose any information regarding US-related accounts.

### Key Takeaways

### Summary

Air traffic controllers at Newark Liberty International Airport lost communication with aircraft, leading to widespread delays and cancellations for more than a week. The incident, caused by the failure of the FAA's radar and communication systems, led to the temporary loss of radar and communication for at least five FAA employees. At least 45 days of leave were taken by controllers affected by the incident, indicating a traumatic situation that could lead to mental health issues. The FAA acknowledged the issue, stating that their 'antiquated air traffic control system' is affecting their workforce.

Peter Goelz, the former managing director of the National Transportation Safety Board, stated that the situation at Newark could be a sign of larger issues if not resolved soon. The situation is being looked into by the Department of Transportation's Office of Inspector General, with the FAA planning to implement a new system that could take up to four years to fully function. Schumer called for a deep investigation into the issues, given the FAA's history of responding slowly to such concerns.

### Summary

A federal judge issued a legal injunction against President Trump's attempt to eliminate the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), a federal agency providing funding for libraries and museums. On March 14, Trump issued an executive order calling for the elimination of seven government agencies, including IMLS. In response, 21 states sued the president to stop the dismantling of the IMLS, the Minority Business Development Agency, and the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. On March 20, the lawsuit was filed in court. On May 6, District Court Judge John J. McConnell Jr. issued a preliminary injunction against the executive order, citing it as a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. This halt on the executive order was seen as a win for the public interest, as it protects everyday people's access to resources and services provided by IMLS. The IMLS is the main source of federal funding for public libraries through its Grants to States program. The agency's employees were placed on administrative leave shortly after the executive order was issued. The IMLS was established by Congress in 1996 and has a budget of $294 million for 2024. The agency's acting director, Keith E. Sonderling, was installed after the executive order. Another lawsuit against the IMLS's dismantling was filed by the American Library Association and AFSCME, the largest union representing museum and library workers.

## Why oil prices are falling, and what it means for the economy

- [source](https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5387426)
- _Published: 2025-05-06 17:36:00-04:00_

### Summary

President Trump's promise of a booming U.S. oil industry and lower gasoline prices has not materialized due to factors such as tariffs, increased production from OPEC+, and economic uncertainties. The article discusses how oil prices have dropped by nearly 25% since January, driven by lower demand and supply issues. OPEC+, led by Saudi Arabia, has made announcements to increase oil production, which has led to lower prices. However, this has not resulted in higher U.S. oil production, as it has become uneconomical for U.S. producers to drill new wells. The article also addresses the tension between the President's vision of expanding the U.S. oil industry and the current reality of low oil prices and reduced production, which could negatively impact both producers and the broader economy. The article concludes with analysis of how these changes have affected the consumer level, including lower gasoline prices and lower shipping costs, but warns of the potential economic ripple effects on oil producers and the overall economy.

### Key Takeaways
  - Oil prices are falling due to factors such as tariffs, increased production from OPEC+, and economic uncertainties.
  - There is a conflict between the promises made by the Trump administration of a booming U.S. oil industry and the reality of low oil prices and reduced production.
  - The fall in oil prices benefits consumers through lower gasoline prices but could negatively impact oil producers and the broader economy.

## Supreme Court upholds Trump's ban on transgender military members while appeals continue

- [source](https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5388507)
- _Published: 2025-05-06 14:56:00-20:56_

### Summary

The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday allowed the Trump administration to temporarily enforce its ban on transgender military service members, despite challenges from groups of current and aspiring transgender service members. The justices blocked a lower court order that temporarily halted the ban's enforcement. The policy mimics a previous one established during the first Trump administration. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Trump administration, at least for now, indicating a strong indication that the administration will likely prevail in the long run. The ruling is seen as a 'devastating blow' to transgender servicemembers by Lambda Legal and Human Rights Campaign. The ban was challenged on constitutional grounds, claiming it violated equal protection of the law. The Pentagon argues that the ban targets those with gender dysphoria as a 'medical condition,' not transgender individuals outright, but a judge disagreed, calling the policy a 'blanket prohibition on transgender service.'

## U.S. intelligence memo says Venezuelan government does not control Tren De Aragua gang

- [source](https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5388392)
- _Published: 2025-05-06 13:22:00-05:00_

### Summary

The U.S. intelligence community has released a declassified memo stating that Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro does not control the Tren de Aragua (TDA) gang, in direct contradiction to claims by President Trump. According to the memo, while some members of the Maduro regime may tolerate or work with TDA, there is no evidence of widespread, organized cooperation. The memo also highlights that TDA is decentralized and unlikely to coordinate large volumes of human trafficking or migrant smuggling. This information was obtained by the Freedom of the Press Foundation and shared with NPR on May 5, 2025. The U.S. government has relied on these claims to justify the deportation of 137 alleged gang members to El Salvador, invoking the Alien Enemies Act, which has only been invoked three times in U.S. history. The Trump administration's actions have been criticized for their potential violation of due process rights of the deportees.

## Trump offers $1,000 incentive to migrants who leave the country voluntarily

- [source](https://text.npr.org/g-s1-64513)
- _Published: 2025-05-06 11:16:00.000-04:00_

### Summary

The Trump administration has announced a $1,000 incentive for migrants who self-deport using the CBP Home App, rebranded to encourage removals. This move is seen as a more cost-effective and 'dignified' approach compared to traditional arrests and detentions, costing around $17,121 on average per person. The department launched this initiative to streamline removals, despite a maxed-out detention capacity. However, immigrant advocates are skeptical, arguing that not all migrants will receive the incentive and that many will remain fearful of removal despite the offer. The incentive has been used to transport someone from Chicago to Honduras, with plans for more to be booked for this week and next. Despite the benefits cited by the administration, immigrant advocates emphasize the challenges faced by families and individuals without legal status, and the long-standing threat of deportation they face.

## Rwanda says it's in 'early stages' of talks with U.S. to take in deported migrants

- [source](https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5387506)
- _Published: 2025-05-06 04:26:00.000Z_

### Summary

Rwanda's foreign minister announced that his government is in 'early talks' with the U.S. to take in third-country nationals deported from the U.S. These talks are part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to find countries willing to take deportees, despite criticisms about Rwanda's poor human rights record and its involvement in the conflict in neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo. Critics argue that Rwanda is not a suitable country to resettle deportees due to its authoritarian government and lack of free speech. The timing of the talks is seen as suspicious, especially given the ongoing conflict in Congo. The U.S. has already entered into similar agreements with countries like El Salvador, Mexico, and Panama. However, the U.S. State Department has stated that ongoing engagement with foreign governments is vital for deterring illegal and mass migration and securing borders, though they did not confirm Rwanda and the U.S. are in a formal agreement.

## Trump expands military use at the southern border. Are there legal limits?

- [source](https://text.npr.org/g-s1-63778)
- _Published: 2025-05-06 05:00:00-04:59_

### Summary

A U.S. federal law, the Posse Comitatus Act, was designed to limit the use of federal troops in law enforcement activities on American soil. However, President Trump's actions in expanding the use of the military for immigration enforcement have brought this law under significant scrutiny. Thousands of active-duty troops are now deployed to the U.S.-Mexico border, with the designation of new military installations. These deployments have significantly shifted the role of the military, going beyond typical support roles to the Border Patrol. Key exceptions to the Posse Comitatus Act, such as the Insurrection Act, have been utilized by the Trump administration, which can be more concerning than the Alien Enemies Act. The article highlights the potential implications of expanding military involvement in immigration enforcement, including potential legal and practical issues, as well as concerns about military readiness and national security.

### Summary

Critics argue that Attorney General Pam Bondi is weaponizing the Justice Department herself, despite her promise to restore integrity to the department. The Trump Justice Department has been accused of targeting Trump and conservative individuals during the Biden administration.

### Summary

A U.S. District Judge has criticized the improper deportation of a 2-year-old girl from the U.S. to Honduras, raising concerns about the lack of proper legal process.

Instead, the coaches had bad news to share: About half the team's runners might lose their roster spots if a proposed multi-billion-dollar legal settlement was approved by a federal judge.
