### Summary

Wall Street experienced its worst day in a month on November 13, 2025, as investors reacted to the end of the longest U.S. government shutdown in history. The closure had delayed key economic data releases, causing market uncertainty and triggering a sharp sell-off in major indices — the Dow dropped 1.65%, the S&P 500 fell 1.66%, and the Nasdaq Composite slid 2.29%. The market's fear gauge, the VIX, surged 18%, and investor sentiment deteriorated to 'extreme fear'. Tech stocks were especially hit, with companies like Tesla, Palantir, and Nvidia seeing steep declines as investors reevaluate high valuations amid concerns over AI profitability. Despite this, market participants still expect a 52% chance of a Federal Reserve rate cut in December, though with growing uncertainty from missing inflation and employment data. The sell-off coincided with the end of the third-quarter earnings season, reducing fundamental support for equities. Meanwhile, Bitcoin declined to around $98,250 after a recent peak, signaling broader market volatility.

### Summary

The article from CNN, published on November 13, 2025, reveals that 24% of U.S. households are living paycheck to paycheck, spending over 95% of their income on essentials. This trend is fueled by stagnant wages—especially among lower-income and millennial households—while inflation outpaces income gains. The 'K-shaped economy' underscores a growing divide between affluent and struggling Americans, with data from Bank of America, Fitch Ratings, and Goldman Sachs showing rising financial distress, including increased car loan delinquency and reduced consumer spending. Personal stories from Austin H. and Vanessa Jones illustrate the human toll: job instability, medical debt, and the inability to save or buy homes. Experts warn that this financial strain could weaken consumer demand and trigger labor market deterioration. President Donald Trump dismisses the crisis as a political fabrication, contrasting with the tangible evidence of widespread financial hardship.

### Key Takeaways

## This oil-producing country is moving away from oil. Here's how it's going - <small>`npr`</small>

### Summary

Colombia, under President Gustavo Petro, has taken a bold step toward phasing out fossil fuel exploration by halting new oil, gas, and coal exploration contracts since 2023. Despite being a major fossil fuel producer in South America, Colombia is now a global leader in climate action, with its national oil company, Ecopetrol, actively diversifying into renewable energy like solar, wind, and geothermal projects. While progress has been made—especially in community-scale solar projects and energy communities—the transition faces significant challenges, including inadequate grid infrastructure, lack of consultation with Indigenous communities, and political vulnerability. Experts warn that future governments could reverse these policies, and the messaging around energy transition has not fully resonated with the public, who often perceive it as economically harmful. Colombia will host the first international conference on fossil fuel phase-out in early 2025, marking a potential turning point in global climate policy and signaling a push toward a binding global treaty to end fossil fuel expansion.

### Key Takeaways
  - Colombia, under President Gustavo Petro, has pledged to stop approving new exploration contracts for oil, gas, and coal, making it a global leader in fossil fuel phase-out efforts.
  - Colombia's national oil company, Ecopetrol, is actively diversifying its business by investing in solar, wind, geothermal, and renewable transmission infrastructure.

  - The country is hosting the first international conference on fossil fuel phase-out, signaling a potential milestone in global climate policy and the development of a binding treaty.
  - While Colombia's climate leadership is widely recognized, experts note that the transition is complex—balancing economic realities, social equity, and political sustainability—making it a 'real story' rather than a simple success or failure.

- <small>tags: `home insurance, climate change, hailstorms, Great Plains, Nebraska, insurance affordability, extreme weather, property damage, rising costs, economic inequality, disaster risk, climate risk`</small>

### Summary

Even in areas without hurricanes or wildfires, home insurance is becoming unaffordable due to increasing hailstorms in the central U.S., particularly the Great Plains. A major hailstorm in Cozad, Nebraska, in June 2024 caused extensive damage to homes, vehicles, and infrastructure, with an estimated $100 million in local damage and $160 billion nationwide in insured losses. Climate change is making such storms more frequent and intense, leading to a surge in insurance claims and premium increases. In Nebraska, average homeowners now pay nearly $6,400 annually—more than 40% above the national average—due to higher repair costs and inflation. Insurance companies are passing on rising costs through higher deductibles and reduced coverage, especially hurting seniors and small businesses like the Cozad Community Hospital, which now pays more for less protection. Despite mitigation efforts such as hail-resistant roofing, financial strain persists, and property ownership is becoming unsustainable for many residents.

- <small>tags: `drought, water crisis, Tehran, climate change, dams, drought, Iran, energy, agriculture, climate resilience, water management, sanctions, infrastructure, public policy, environmental degradation`</small>

### Summary

Iran is facing a worsening water crisis due to six consecutive years of drought, with the current year being one of the driest on record. Key dams feeding Tehran, including Lar, Latyan, Karaj, Taleqan, and Mamloo, are at critically low levels—some below 10% capacity—threatening the city’s drinking water supply. With only 2.3mm of precipitation by early November (down 81% from historical averages), authorities warn of mandatory rationing and possible nighttime water shutdowns. Experts, including professors Farshid Vahedifard and Kaveh Madani, attribute the crisis to decades of poor management, overreliance on infrastructure, and agricultural overuse, which consumes over 90% of water supply despite contributing only 12% to GDP. Wastage and illegal consumption account for over a third of water use. The government has responded with short-term measures like desalination and rationing, but experts stress the need for long-term, resilient policies that prioritize groundwater restoration, integrated water-energy-agriculture planning, and equitable access. The crisis reflects broader systemic failures, including political neglect and environmental degradation, and raises concerns about social instability and economic collapse due to rising living costs and water scarcity.

### Key Takeaways
  - Iran is facing its sixth consecutive year of drought, with precipitation levels down by 81% compared to historical averages.
  - 19 dams are on the verge of drying out, with most major dams feeding Tehran at less than 10% capacity.
  - A swimmer's viral video from the Karaj reservoir revealed the extreme water level drop, illustrating public awareness of the crisis.
  - Water rationing and nighttime shutdowns are being considered, with Energy Minister Abbas Aliabadi stating that high-consuming urban users will be penalized.
  - Over 90% of Iran’s water supply is used in agriculture, despite agriculture contributing only 12% to GDP and 14% to employment.
  - More than a third of Iran’s water is wasted due to physical losses and illegal consumption, reflecting systemic inefficiencies.

### Summary

Hundreds of Indigenous activists, including members of the Tupinamba community and leaders like Gilmar and Leo Cerda, protested at the COP30 climate summit in Belem, Brazil, demanding the protection of Amazon rainforest territories from agribusiness, oil exploration, and logging. The protest, led by a 3,000km-long flotilla known as the Yaku Mama flotilla, emphasized that Indigenous peoples are essential to climate solutions, as the Amazon acts as a major carbon sink. Despite Brazilian President Lula da Silva’s public support for Indigenous voices, activists argue that actions on the ground are insufficient, especially with Petrobras granted offshore oil drilling rights near the Amazon River. The protest coincides with the ICJ’s ruling that countries must meet climate obligations, and occurs amid the global absence of the United States, which has historically resisted climate action. Indigenous leaders stress that inclusive climate policy requires their presence at negotiations, and that extractive industries must be excluded from protected territories, including the Amazon, Congo, and Borneo-Mekong-Southeast Asia basins.

## New Jersey man is first known death from meat allergy triggered by tick bites - <small>`cnn`</small>

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/health/tick-bite-alpha-gal-death)
- _Published: 2025-11-13 20:44:00-05:00_
- **Health & Public Safety**
- <small>tags: `alpha-gal syndrome, tick bites, red meat allergy, anaphylaxis, public health, allergies, New Jersey, lone star tick, CDC, medical research`</small>

### Summary

A 47-year-old man from New Jersey died in September 2024 after experiencing severe symptoms following consumption of red meat, following prior exposure to lone star tick bites during a camping trip. His case, detailed in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology in Practice, is now recognized as the first known fatality linked to an alpha-gal allergy—caused by the sugar alpha-gal, which is transferred from tick bites to human blood. The man showed elevated immunoglobulin E antibodies and extremely high tryptase levels, indicating a severe anaphylactic reaction. The case underscores a growing public health issue: widespread, undiagnosed sensitization to alpha-gal due to increasing tick populations, particularly in areas with high deer numbers. Despite its known existence in some states, alpha-gal allergy remains poorly recognized by healthcare providers, with a 2023 CDC survey showing that nearly half of doctors do not recognize it. This case emphasizes the urgent need for greater public awareness, medical education, and diagnostic access to prevent future deaths.

### Key Takeaways
  - The first known fatality linked to a red meat allergy caused by tick bites has been identified in a 47-year-old man from New Jersey.
  - The man was bitten by dozens of baby lone star ticks during a camping trip, leading to sensitization to alpha-gal, a sugar found in red meat.
  - The man developed symptoms hours after consuming red meat, including severe stomach pain, vomiting, and dizziness, ultimately leading to death after a second exposure.
  - Autopsy results showed high levels of immunoglobulin E antibodies to alpha-gal and red meat, and extremely elevated tryptase levels, confirming a fatal anaphylactic reaction.

- <small>tags: `vaccination, covid-19, public health, vaccine hesitancy, health disparities, racial and ethnic disparities, young adults, immigration policy, healthcare trust, conflicting guidance`</small>

### Summary

Vaccination rates for the covid vaccine in the U.S. have declined significantly, with only 23% of American adults receiving at least one dose during the 2024-25 season, despite ongoing public health risks. Experts warn that conflicting guidance from the FDA and CDC — including narrowing vaccine approval to high-risk groups and promoting individual decision-making — has fueled vaccine hesitancy. Rates are especially low among Latinos (15%), African Americans, young adults (11%), and residents in Republican-leaning states. Misinformation about vaccine safety and effectiveness, coupled with distrust in health systems and fears of immigration enforcement, contributes to this hesitancy. Experts emphasize that the primary benefit of the vaccine is preventing severe illness and long covid, not complete infection prevention, and stress that most adults, including children, should get vaccinated, similar to flu vaccine recommendations.

### Key Takeaways
  - More than 75% of American adults did not receive a covid vaccine during the 2024-25 season, significantly lower than flu vaccine uptake.
  - Covid remains a serious health risk, causing 31,400 deaths in the U.S. in 2024, compared to 6,500 from flu and 41,600 from pneumonia.
  - Vaccination rates are lowest among Latinos (15%), African Americans, men, the uninsured, and residents of Republican-leaning states.
  - Conflicting public health guidance from the FDA and CDC — narrowing approval to high-risk groups and promoting individual decision-making — has increased vaccine hesitancy.
  - Misinformation about vaccine safety, effectiveness, and long-term consequences is widespread, especially among young adults and minority populations.
  - Young adults (18–29) have the lowest vaccination rate (11%), down from 70% in early 2023, and many misunderstand the vaccine’s purpose, thinking it fails if they get infected.
  - Long covid is a major concern, especially among younger adults, and the vaccine helps prevent severe illness and long-term complications.
  - Public trust in health systems is critical; fears about immigration enforcement, health discrimination, and data privacy contribute to hesitancy among Latinos.
  - Healthcare providers are key influencers in vaccine decisions, especially among African Americans, who are more likely to trust clinicians than faith leaders or peers.
  - Over 90% of African Americans in a Georgia study received at least one dose, but unvaccinated individuals were more likely to believe false myths about vaccines.

## US Health Leaders Hail Hormone Therapy for Menopause After FDA Removes Black Box Warning - <small>`cnn`</small>

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/health/fda-hormone-therapy-menopause-balance)

- <small>tags: `hormone therapy, menopause, black box warning, FDA decision, women's health, heart disease, dementia, systemic vs. local estrogen, scientific evidence, regulatory process, public trust, medical controversies, menopause treatments`</small>

### Summary

The US Food and Drug Administration, under Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary, announced the removal of the long-standing black box warning on hormone therapy for menopause symptoms, reversing a 2003 decision made after the Women’s Health Initiative study raised safety concerns. Makary claims that hormone therapy offers significant long-term benefits, such as reducing risks of heart disease, dementia, and hip fractures, and likened its impact to that of vaccines and antibiotics. However, experts including Dr. Leslie Cho, Dr. Rebecca Thurston, and others criticize the decision as scientifically unsound, citing outdated data, cherry-picked studies, and a lack of formal advisory committee review. They emphasize that hormone therapy, particularly systemic forms like oral pills, carries real risks such as blood clots and cancer and should be used only after individual risk-benefit discussions. The decision also sparked controversy over the FDA’s process, transparency, and the potential for overpromising benefits. In contrast, vaginal estrogen therapies are considered safer and have long been advocated for removal of the warning. Experts stress the importance of offering women multiple treatment options, including nonhormonal alternatives like Veozah and Lynkuet, and caution against treating hormone therapy as a miracle cure.

### Key Takeaways
  - The FDA, under Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary, has removed the broad black box warning on hormone therapy for menopause symptoms, citing new evidence of long-term benefits such as reduced risks of heart disease, dementia, and hip fractures.
  - The decision to remove the warning is based on a review of scientific literature, including a 2023 study cited by Makary, though experts criticize the use of outdated or cherry-picked studies and the omission of key findings from randomized trials that show no benefit for heart disease.
  - Hormone therapy, especially systemic forms like oral pills, is associated with increased risks such as blood clots and endometrial cancer, particularly in women with preexisting conditions like high blood pressure or high cholesterol.
  - Vaginal estrogen therapies are considered safer because they don’t significantly raise blood estrogen levels, and experts have long advocated removing the black box warning for these specific products.
  - Major medical societies and experts warn that removing the warning from all hormone therapies — including systemic ones — may overstate benefits and downplay risks, leading to misinformed patient decisions and eroding public trust.
  - The FDA's decision was made without convening a formal advisory committee, raising concerns about transparency and adherence to standard regulatory protocols.
  - Experts emphasize that hormone therapy should be used individually, with risk-benefit discussions based on a woman’s age, health history, and specific symptoms, and that nonhormonal alternatives like Veozah and Lynkuet are now available for managing menopausal symptoms.

### Summary

A nationwide infantile botulism outbreak linked to the ByHeart organic baby formula has affected at least 15 infants across 12 U.S. states, with at least 84 babies treated since August 2025. Parents of two affected infants, Stephen and Yurany Dexter of Flagstaff, Arizona, and Michael and Hanna Everett of Richmond, Kentucky, filed lawsuits claiming the formula was defective and that the company was negligent. Both children developed severe symptoms including unresponsiveness, floppiness, and loss of gag reflex, requiring emergency hospitalization and treatment with the rare IV medication BabyBIG. A sample of the formula tested positive for the bacteria causing infantile botulism, confirming the product’s role in the outbreak. ByHeart, a New York-based company, initiated a recall of all its formula on November 12, 2025, after health officials identified the pathogen. The parents purchased the formula for its natural, organic attributes, believing it was safer than traditional formulas. While both infants recovered, the incident has sparked widespread concern about food safety, regulatory oversight, and the risks of consumer-driven choices in infant nutrition. Legal actions are expected to grow, and the company now faces potential existential crisis due to public backlash and liability.

### Summary

Scientists are pioneering a revolutionary new approach to treat autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and multiple sclerosis by reprogramming malfunctioning immune systems rather than merely suppressing symptoms. Led by researchers such as Dr. Maximilian Konig at Johns Hopkins University and Dr. Georg Schett in Germany, these therapies—including CAR-T treatment, T cell engagers like teclistamab, and mRNA-based immune reprogramming—are showing promising results. Patients such as Mileydy Gonzalez and Allie Rubin have experienced long-term remission and relief from debilitating symptoms, offering hope for a potential cure. While still experimental and costly, these treatments represent a major shift in how autoimmune diseases are approached, aiming to restore immune balance by targeting only rogue cells. Early studies suggest that these therapies could prevent disease onset in at-risk individuals, like in type 1 diabetes, and that the next decade may see transformative breakthroughs in treatment and prevention.

### Key Takeaways
  - CAR-T therapy, originally developed for blood cancers, is now being adapted to treat autoimmune diseases such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis by reprogramming rogue immune cells.
  - Patients with severe autoimmune diseases have shown remarkable improvements — including remission and elimination of daily symptoms — after receiving CAR-T or related therapies, such as T cell engagers like teclistamab.
  - New experimental approaches include off-the-shelf CAR-T, mRNA-based immune reprogramming, and engineered 'peacekeeper' regulatory T cells to calm autoimmune attacks without wiping out the entire immune system.
  - While these therapies are still largely experimental and costly, early results suggest they could offer long-term remission or even cures, unlike traditional drugs that only suppress symptoms.
  - Research is exploring how to predict autoimmune diseases before symptoms appear, such as in type 1 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis, by identifying pre-illness immune changes.
  - Studies like StopRA aim to identify at-risk individuals early and intervene before joint damage occurs, potentially preventing or delaying disease onset.

### Summary

Canada has lost its measles elimination status after a large, multi-jurisdictional outbreak began in October 2024, with over 5,000 cases and two deaths reported across 11 provinces and territories. This outbreak, linked to declining vaccination rates and growing vaccine hesitancy—fueled by misinformation and distrust in healthcare—has led the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) to declare that the Americas region has lost its elimination status. The outbreak is most severe in Canada, Mexico, and the United States, with over 95% of cases reported in these countries. The US faces a January 2025 deadline to prove outbreak control. The MMR vaccine, which is 97% effective, is critical to achieving herd immunity, requiring at least 95% vaccination coverage. Communities like the Mennonites have low vaccination rates due to religious beliefs, contributing to outbreaks. Global data shows measles vaccination prevented 31.7 million deaths between 2000 and 2020. Experts stress that with political commitment, regional cooperation, and sustained vaccination efforts, the region can reverse the trend and re-establish elimination status.

## The Trump Administration Is 'Actively Evaluating' Portable Mortgages. What You Need to Know - <small>`cnn`</small>

- <small>tags: `housing affordability, portable mortgages, Trump administration, mortgage reform, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, real estate policy, mortgage-backed securities, 50-year mortgage, assumable loans`</small>

### Summary

The Trump administration is actively evaluating a proposal for portable mortgages, which would allow homeowners to transfer their existing mortgage rates to a new home when relocating. This is intended to increase housing supply by encouraging homeowners to move without facing higher interest rates, thus improving affordability. However, experts like Susan Wachter and Justin Demola raise concerns about logistical issues, legal challenges tied to property-specific contracts, and potential disruptions to mortgage-backed securities markets. The administration is also considering a 50-year mortgage and broader use of assumable loans, though these ideas face skepticism due to limited benefits and practical constraints. While the concept aims to solve housing affordability, its implementation could face significant economic and legal hurdles.

### Key Takeaways
  - The Trump administration is actively evaluating portable mortgages to improve housing affordability by allowing homeowners to transfer their mortgage rate with them when moving.
  - Portable mortgages would let borrowers keep their existing low-interest rates when relocating, potentially increasing housing supply by encouraging home moves.
  - A major challenge is that current mortgage agreements are legally tied to a specific property address, making transfer difficult or legally complex.
  - The proposal could disrupt mortgage-backed securities markets, as fewer loans would be paid off early, potentially raising interest rates due to increased risk.
  - Experts like Susan Wachter and Justin Demola caution that portable mortgages may create logistical and financial complications, and could backfire due to market instability.
  - The administration is also considering a 50-year mortgage option and more assumable loans, though experts argue the 50-year plan offers minimal savings and limited practicality.
  - Most government-backed loans are already assumable, but few first-time buyers currently take over existing mortgages due to cash or secondary loan requirements.

## Self-styled miracle worker whose followers claimed could multiply gnocchi charged with fraud - <small>`cnn`</small>

### Summary

Gisella Cardia and her husband Gianni Cardia, self-styled clairvoyants who claimed supernatural events such as blood weeping from a Madonna statue and food multiplication during prayer events, have been formally charged with fraud. Over a six-year period from 2018 to 2024, they collected nearly €400,000 from pilgrims, which prosecutors allege was misused for personal purposes—such as a $40,000 car and shrine renovations—rather than being donated to children’s hospitals. A genetic test confirmed that blood from the statue matched Gisella’s DNA, suggesting the blood was staged. The Vatican declared the apparitions not supernatural, and an investigation began after a former follower reported finding a coffin in his car. Witnesses, including a woman and Gisella herself, claimed to have seen food like gnocchi and pizza multiply, reinforcing the couple’s narrative. The couple is set to stand trial in April 2025, with their lawyers calling the trial a necessary step to clarify the facts and end controversy.

  - The Vatican issued a warning in 2023, stating the alleged apparitions and messages were not supernatural, aligning with the prosecution's claim that the events were fraudulent.
  - A former follower reported finding a coffin in his car after an alleged confrontation, initiating the investigation.

### Summary

In a high-profile case involving the murder of Minnesota lawmakers Melissa and Mark Hortman, and John and Yvette Hoffman, Vance Boelter is charged with federal and state murder and attempted murder charges. Prosecutors have disclosed over 130,000 pages of evidence, including 800 hours of audio and video and 2,000 photographs, collected during what authorities call the largest hunt for a suspect in Minnesota history. Boelter, a politically conservative evangelical Christian, claims he acted in response to an undercover investigation into alleged vaccine-related deaths and opened fire when the victims tried to remove him from their homes. However, Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty has dismissed these claims. The defense is struggling with the volume of material, noting that it took nearly 110 hours to download, and the case is still under review. The federal government has not yet decided whether to seek the death penalty, with that decision resting with U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi. The case draws national attention not only due to its political context but also because it occurs in a state that abolished capital punishment in 1911, raising questions about the federal use of the death penalty under the current administration.

  - The defense has stated that reviewing the massive volume of evidence has been slow due to the federal government shutdown, and their team has spent nearly 110 hours just downloading the material.
  - The case has drawn national attention due to its political context and the possibility of a federal death penalty, despite Minnesota having abolished capital punishment since 1911.
  - The Trump administration's push for expanded use of capital punishment is highlighted as a broader policy context, with implications for how such cases are handled at the federal level.

# Military Actions & War

## How Venezuela’s aging Soviet-era military stacks up against US forces in the Caribbean - <small>`cnn`</small>

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/americas/venezuela-military-us-tensions-explainer-intl-latam)
- _Published: 2025-11-13 16:00:00Z_
- **Military Actions & War**
- <small>tags: `Caribbean, Military Conflict, US Military, Venezuela, Soviet-Era Equipment, Bolivarian Militia, Hugo Chávez, Nicolás Maduro, Geopolitical Tension, Defense Analysis, Arms Procurement, Economic Impact on Military`</small>

### Summary

The article examines the potential for conflict between the United States and Venezuela in the Caribbean, prompted by a significant US naval buildup including the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier and over 15,000 personnel. It contrasts this modern US military strength with Venezuela’s aging Soviet-era arsenal—such as Su-30 fighter jets, T-72 tanks, and S-300 missile systems—acquired under Hugo Chávez. Despite Venezuela’s large military structure and the claimed mobilization of millions of militiamen, experts highlight severe deficiencies in equipment maintenance, training, and operational readiness due to economic collapse and sanctions. The article concludes that while Venezuela may appear strong on paper, its military is far less capable than the US forces, especially in air defense and naval operations, making it vulnerable in a potential conflict.

### Key Takeaways
  - The US military presence in the Caribbean, especially the arrival of the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier and 15,000 personnel, raises concerns about a potential conflict with Venezuela.
  - Venezuela's armed forces, primarily the Bolivarian National Armed Forces (FANB), rely heavily on Soviet-era Russian equipment such as Su-30 fighter jets, T-72 tanks, S-300 and Buk missile systems, which are aging and poorly maintained.
  - Despite having a large military structure—about 123,000 active personnel and a reported militia of 4.5 to 8.2 million—Venezuela's operational capability is severely undermined by economic collapse, inflation, lack of spare parts, and poor training.
  - The Bolivarian Militia, while touted by Maduro as a massive defensive force, is largely untrained and functionally serves as a surveillance and repressive tool rather than a combat-effective force.
  - The US has a far more modern and operationally capable military presence in the region, with advanced technology, better logistics, and trained personnel, especially in air and naval power, making Venezuela's forces appear outdated and vulnerable.
  - Experts question the reliability of Venezuela’s military readiness, citing over a decade of economic crisis and underinvestment, with the navy being the most under-resourced branch.

### Named Entities
- **US Naval Forces**
    - A large-scale US military deployment in the Caribbean, including the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier, 15,000 personnel, multiple warships, and 10 F-35 fighter jets stationed in Puerto Rico.
    - The US military buildup is central to the article's premise, as it sets the stage for a comparison with Venezuela’s military strength and raises concerns about a possible escalation in the region.
- **Venezuela**
    - The country whose military is being analyzed in contrast to US forces, especially in the context of potential conflict.
    - Venezuela is the focal point of the article, as its aging Soviet-era military is being evaluated for its combat readiness and strategic value against a modern US naval presence.
- **Bolivarian National Armed Forces (FANB)**
    - Venezuela’s official military, including the army, navy, air force, and national guard, with about 123,000 active personnel.
    - The FANB is the core of the comparison between Venezuela and the US military, with its equipment, structure, and capabilities being analyzed for their viability in a conflict.
- **Hugo Chávez**
    - Former Venezuelan president (1999–2013), who significantly shaped Venezuela’s military through state-funded purchases of Russian arms and integration of military leaders into government.
    - Chávez’s policies laid the foundation for Venezuela’s current military posture, with most of its Soviet-era equipment acquired during his leadership.
- **Nicolás Maduro**
    - Current president of Venezuela, who has recently emphasized the use of the Bolivarian Militia in response to US military actions.
    - Maduro's public statements about mobilizing millions of militiamen reflect a strategic attempt to project strength and legitimacy in the face of US military escalation.
- **USS Gerald R. Ford**
    - The US Navy’s most lethal combat platform, recently deployed to the Caribbean.
    - This aircraft carrier symbolizes the peak of US naval power and is used as a benchmark to contrast with Venezuela’s aging and under-resourced forces.
- **Su-30MK2 Fighter Jets**
    - Advanced Russian-made fighter jets used by Venezuela’s air force, which are considered top-tier in Latin America despite being Soviet-era designs.
    - These jets represent Venezuela’s most advanced air capabilities, though their maintenance issues and accident history raise doubts about operational readiness.
- **T-72B1 Tanks**
    - Soviet-era main battle tanks acquired by Venezuela, currently used in armored brigades.
    - These tanks are highlighted as part of Venezuela’s conventional military strength, but their age and lack of maintenance make them vulnerable in modern warfare.
- **S-300, Buk, Pechora, Igla-S**
    - Anti-aircraft and anti-ship missile systems acquired from Russia, used by Venezuela’s air defenses.
    - These systems are critical to Venezuela’s air defense strategy but are seen as outdated and likely to be early targets in a conflict.
- **Bolivarian Militia**
    - A paramilitary force created by Chávez, composed of civilians from factories and workplaces, officially claimed to number up to 8.2 million.
    - The militia is central to Maduro’s response to US military activity, though experts consider it largely untrained and more of a political tool than a combat force.
- **International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS)**
    - A think tank that reported on Venezuela’s military readiness and personnel numbers.
    - The IISS provides authoritative data on Venezuela’s military structure and operational capability, supporting the article’s analysis.

    - The date of the article's publication, when US naval forces were recently deployed to the Caribbean, sparking speculation about potential military conflict with Venezuela.

### Important Timeframes
  - **From _2000_ to _2019_**
    - The period from 1999 to 2019 marks the rise of Hugo Chávez's military influence and the significant acquisition of Soviet-era Russian military equipment by Venezuela, shaping its current military posture.

### Summary

The United States military has conducted 20 strikes between September 2 and November 10, 2025, killing 80 people on 21 vessels in the Caribbean and Pacific Oceans. The Trump administration claims these actions constitute an 'armed conflict' against drug cartels, labeling them 'unlawful combatants' and asserting that intelligence confirms the boats are operated by designated terrorist organizations such as Tren de Aragua and Colombian cartels. No US personnel were injured, and the strikes were announced via social media platforms like Truth Social and X. However, there is no public evidence of narcotics on the vessels or their direct ties to drug trafficking. Survivors from two strikes were briefly detained and returned to their home countries, with claims that one was innocent and had no prior criminal record. This campaign has sparked strong international criticism from Venezuela and Colombia, which accuse the US of unlawful killings, 'serial executions,' and launching an undeclared war. The expansion of strikes into the Pacific Ocean and the repeated targeting of vessels with no verifiable evidence of narcotics raises significant legal and humanitarian concerns.

### Summary

The United States has announced Operation Southern Spear, a military campaign led by U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, to target so-called narco-terrorists and disrupt drug trafficking in Latin America and the Caribbean. This follows a significant military build-up, including Marines training aboard the USS Iwo Jima and the expected arrival of the USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier off Venezuela’s coast. The operation has been linked to U.S. President Donald Trump’s stated priorities, though critics—including Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and international analyst Elizabeth Dickinson—argue it is more of a political pressure campaign than a legitimate counter-narcotics effort. The U.S. has conducted multiple lethal strikes in the region, killing at least 80 people, with no public evidence or legal justification offered. Venezuela has responded by mobilizing nearly 200,000 troops and denouncing the presence as a violation of sovereignty and regional peace, while G-7 allies have expressed concern over the lack of transparency and proportionality in the military actions.

### Key Takeaways

  - The Venezuelan Ministry of Defence mobilized nearly 200,000 troops for a readiness exercise in response to the U.S. military presence.
  - International analysts, such as Elizabeth Dickinson of the International Crisis Group, argue that an aircraft carrier is not effective for combating drug trafficking and view the deployment as a strategic pressure tactic against Venezuela.

## Germany agrees new military service plan to boost troop numbers - <small>`bbc`</small>

- <small>tags: `military service, Germany, Bundeswehr, Rheinmetall, conscription, Russia, NATO, defence spending, public opposition, security threat, military modernization`</small>

### Summary

Germany’s coalition government has agreed to a new military service plan aimed at expanding the Bundeswehr from 182,000 to 255,000–260,000 troops over ten years. Starting in 2025, all 18-year-old men will be required to complete a suitability questionnaire, with mandatory medical screening beginning in July 2027. The plan is driven by security concerns following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and growing NATO pressure to increase defence spending. While the government sees it as a realistic and necessary step to build Europe’s strongest conventional army, public opposition—especially among young people—is strong, with a Forsa survey showing 63% opposition to mandatory service. The policy is supported by defence leaders such as Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Defence Chief Carsten Breuer, and Defence Minister Boris Pistorius, who emphasize deterrence and peace through strength. Rheinmetall, Germany’s largest defence firm, reports significant revenue growth due to rising demand, and its CEO Armin Papperger underscores the global nature of current security threats, calling Europe’s situation a non-peaceful, hybrid or cold war environment.

A U.S. District Judge has denied Representative LaMonica McIver’s request to dismiss criminal charges related to an incident in May 2025 at Delaney Hall, a federal immigration detention center in Newark, New Jersey. McIver, a Democrat, was charged with assaulting federal agents during a chaotic attempt to visit the facility, where she was among several officials, including Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, trying to access the site. Prosecutors claimed she physically interacted with an agent, while McIver's legal team argued her actions were protected under congressional oversight authority and that the prosecution was selective and vindictive. Judge Jamel Semper ruled that McIver failed to prove the prosecution was retaliatory and that her actions were not disconnected from her legislative duties. The case is emblematic of a larger political conflict between the Trump administration and a critical Democratic lawmaker. The incident has also drawn attention to broader issues of congressional oversight, the legal boundaries of such visits, and the current scrutiny of federal prosecutors in New Jersey, including the tenure of acting U.S. Attorney Alina Habba.

### Summary

The Nevada Supreme Court ruled that a case against six pro-Trump 'fake electors' who falsely claimed Donald Trump won Nevada in December 2020 should proceed, overturning a prior dismissal due to venue issues. The case is now being prosecuted in Clark County, home to Las Vegas and the majority of Nevada’s Democratic electorate, where prosecutors believe a more favorable jury pool may exist. Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford emphasized that these individuals violated state law, even though President Trump granted them federal pardons for related actions—only covering federal offenses. The fake electors' fraudulent certificates were presented during the January 6, 2021 congressional vote to count electoral votes, attempting to overturn the official results of the 2020 election. This case is part of a broader, mixed outcome across states, where Michigan's case was dismissed due to lack of evidence, Georgia's is stalled, and cases in Arizona and Wisconsin remain ongoing.

### Summary

South Korean prosecutors allege that former President Yoon Suk Yeol and senior defense officials planned to send drones into North Korea’s airspace to provoke a military response from Kim Jong Un, particularly targeting his personal residences and symbolic sites such as Samjiyon and Wonsan.

## CBP Officials Headed to Charlotte, North Carolina, Amid Political Crackdown and Community Fears - <small>`cnn`</small>

- <small>tags: `immigration enforcement, border patrol, political targeting, Charlotte, NC, Trump administration, law and order, civil liberties, federal-local coordination, public fear, immigrant rights, political theater`</small>

### Summary

Gregory Bovino, the top US Border Patrol official under the Trump administration, is reportedly heading to Charlotte, North Carolina, as part of a politically motivated immigration enforcement push targeting Democratic-led cities. Officials in Charlotte, including Mayor Vi Lyles, Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden, and City Councilmembers Malcolm Graham and Dimple Ajmera, were initially unaware of the operation and have expressed concern over the lack of prior coordination and communication from federal agencies. The move follows President Trump’s public criticism of Charlotte after a violent incident involving a Ukrainian refugee, Iryna Zarutska, and aligns with a broader pattern of aggressive federal enforcement in cities like Chicago and New Orleans. Though Charlotte is not near a U.S. border, Bovino, originally from North Carolina, has personal ties to the region, and his public endorsement of a Charlotte visit suggests political intent. Local officials emphasize that they do not participate in federal operations and only respond to criminal warrants. The situation has caused significant public anxiety, with immigrant advocacy groups like the Carolina Migrant Network preparing for increased enforcement and reporting fear from residents. The lack of transparency and coordination mirrors past incidents, such as the Chicago 'Operation Midway Blitz,' raising concerns about federal overreach and civil liberties.

### Summary

Paul Ingrassia, who was nominated by President Donald Trump to lead the Office of Special Counsel, withdrew his nomination after a wave of controversy over alleged racist text messages—including references to a 'Nazi streak,' anti-Asian and anti-Black rhetoric, and a suggestion that Martin Luther King Jr. Day should be 'tossed into the seventh circle of hell.' Despite claims from his lawyer that the messages were satirical, the Senate, including leaders John Thune and Rick Scott, showed no support, leading to the withdrawal. Ingrassia is now serving as deputy general counsel at the General Services Administration, a move that reflects both political resilience and the administration’s continued engagement with controversial figures. The incident raises significant concerns about political appointments, accountability, and the spread of extremist ideologies within federal leadership.

  - The Senate, particularly Republican Senator Rick Scott and Senate Leader John Thune, did not support Ingrassia, signaling strong opposition to his nomination.

## British journalist says ICE detention was ‘attack on freedoms’ after 18-day ordeal in US - <small>`cnn`</small>

### Summary

Sami Hamdi, a British journalist and political commentator, was detained for 18 days by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) after speaking at a CAIR California gala in October 2025. He claims the detention was politically motivated retaliation for criticizing Israel’s war in Gaza, asserting that his visa was revoked without explanation or evidence. Authorities cited national security as a justification, but civil rights groups and organizations like CAIR argue that such actions violate free speech protections and represent a broader campaign to silence pro-Palestinian voices. The incident parallels similar cases involving other foreign nationals, such as Momodou Taal, and has sparked global attention, with Hamdi stating that the detention was an attack on freedom of speech. Despite being uncharged, Hamdi faced dehumanizing conditions in detention facilities and alleges systematic targeting of individuals expressing dissent. He concludes that while he is grateful for the attention, he sees himself as a symbol of a larger crisis—the ongoing humanitarian suffering in Gaza—rather than a personal story.

## Texas A&M Professors Need Approval for Race and Gender Topics - <small>`cnn`</small>

### Summary

Texas A&M University System regents adopted a policy requiring faculty to obtain prior approval from the university president before discussing race and gender-related topics in classrooms. The policy, which defines 'race ideology' and 'gender ideology' with specific, politically charged criteria, follows months of public and political controversy sparked by a viral video of a student and instructor debating gender identity in a children’s literature class. The incident led to the firing of senior lecturer Melissa McCoul, under pressure from Governor Greg Abbott and Republican lawmakers, prompting internal turmoil and the resignation of former president Mark A. Welsh III. Critics, including prominent academics like Rana Jaleel and Leonard Bright, argue the policy undermines academic freedom and violates First Amendment principles, while supporters such as Regent Sam Torn claim it ensures educational neutrality. The policy marks the first time a public university system in Texas has imposed such restrictions and reflects a broader national trend of political pressure on universities to limit diversity, equity, and inclusion content, especially under the influence of President Donald Trump’s calls for conservative reforms in higher education.

### Key Takeaways
  - Texas A&M University System regents passed a policy requiring faculty approval from the president before discussing race and gender topics in classrooms.
  - The policy defines 'race ideology' as attempts to shame a race or assign guilt based on ancestral actions, and 'gender ideology' as self-assessed gender identity replacing biological sex.
  - The policy is the first of its kind in a public university system in Texas, responding to public and political pressure following a viral video involving a student and instructor over gender identity teaching.
  - Critics argue the policy undermines academic freedom and First Amendment rights, claiming it enables censorship and politicizes education.
  - The policy emerged after the controversial firing of Melissa McCoul, a senior lecturer, which sparked public outcry and political pressure from Republican lawmakers, including Gov. Greg Abbott.
  - Former Texas A&M President Mark A. Welsh III resigned shortly after McCoul’s firing, indicating internal pressure and political influence on leadership.
  - The policy was supported by some faculty but rejected by others, including Rana Jaleel and Leonard Bright, who emphasize the importance of free academic discourse and truth in education.
  - Other universities, including Harvard, Columbia, and the University of Virginia, are under scrutiny nationally, especially due to President Donald Trump’s calls for conservative shifts in DEI practices.
  - Trump has requested commitments from major universities to eliminate race and sex in admissions and to adopt a strict binary definition of 'man' and 'woman'.

### Summary

In a CNN exclusive interview during a rally in Caracas, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro urged the United States to unite with Venezuela for the peace of the Americas, criticizing U.S. military actions in the Caribbean as a cover for regime change and calling for an end to prolonged wars like those in Libya and Afghanistan. The U.S. has recently deployed over 15,000 troops and more than a dozen warships, including a major aircraft carrier, to the region, claiming to disrupt drug trafficking, while Venezuela interprets this as a threat to its sovereignty. The U.S. has conducted at least 20 strikes, killing 80 people, and is reportedly considering internal strikes within Venezuela, though no legal basis has been formally established. In response, Venezuela has mobilized its military and civilian militias, conducted military exercises, and installed anti-vehicle barriers on key highways such as the Caracas-La Guaira route. Maduro emphasized peace and called for cooperation, but did not directly address U.S. aggression, instead focusing on domestic governance and national unity.

## BBC Signals It Will Fight, Not Fold Under Trump’s Political Pressure - <small>`cnn`</small>

### Summary

The BBC has refused to settle a defamation lawsuit from President Donald Trump’s legal team, instead affirming it will fight to defend its journalistic independence. The dispute arose from an editing error in a 'Panorama' documentary that incorrectly stitched together clips from Trump’s January 6, 2021, speech, which was aired in October 2024. While the BBC acknowledged an 'error in judgment,' it denied any defamation claim and rejected Trump’s demand for a $1 billion payout. The incident prompted resignations from BBC leadership figures Tim Davie and Deborah Turness, and triggered public debate over media integrity. In contrast, media companies like Disney and Paramount settled with Trump to avoid legal battles, sparking criticism that such compromises could lead to self-censorship. The BBC’s decision to stand firm, alongside resistance from the New York Times and Wall Street Journal, reflects a broader struggle between political pressure and independent journalism. Experts argue that Trump’s pattern of legal intimidation threatens free press standards, and the BBC’s stance represents a critical stand for press freedom and public accountability.

## Johnson shifts strategy on Epstein files vote – as GOP leaders brace for mass defections - <small>`cnn`</small>

- <small>tags: `Jeffrey Epstein, House of Representatives, bipartisan legislation, transparency, political strategy, government accountability, U.S. presidential opposition, Justice Department, House Oversight Committee`</small>

### Summary

House Speaker Mike Johnson has shifted strategy to expedite a House vote on a bipartisan bill co-sponsored by Republican Thomas Massie and Democrat Ro Khanna, aiming to force the Justice Department to release all Jeffrey Epstein case files. This marks a reversal of prior efforts by Johnson and the White House to delay the vote. Momentum in the House has grown, especially after the release of thousands of new Epstein-related emails by the House Oversight Committee, and with bipartisan support from a broad cross-section of Republicans, including Lauren Boebert, the bill is now expected to receive a full vote. A veto-proof majority of 290 votes would pressure the Senate, particularly President Donald Trump, who has opposed the release. Despite White House and GOP leadership attempts to block the vote, the decision to proceed quickly reflects a shift in political reality, with leaders concluding that delaying further would be futile. The outcome remains uncertain in the Senate, where Majority Leader John Thune has questioned the need for new legislation.

### Key Takeaways
  - House Speaker Mike Johnson shifted strategy to expedite a House vote on a bipartisan bill to force the Justice Department to release all Jeffrey Epstein case files, reversing prior efforts to delay the vote.
  - The bipartisan effort led by GOP Rep. Thomas Massie and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna now has a strong chance of gaining a veto-proof majority of 290 votes in the House, which would put significant pressure on the Senate and President Donald Trump.
  - Despite White House and GOP leadership efforts to delay the vote, momentum in the House has grown, leading to the conclusion that the only viable path is to proceed with a full vote and send the bill to the Senate.
  - The decision to move quickly came after the release of thousands of new Epstein-related emails by the House Oversight Committee and increased support from Republican lawmakers, including Lauren Boebert.
  - President Donald Trump was informed in advance of the vote’s expediting, and his opposition remains a key obstacle, especially in the Senate where Majority Leader John Thune has expressed skepticism about the need for new legislation.
  - The initial procedural delay stemmed from lack of approval from House Republican leadership; now, with a majority of GOP members supporting the effort, the vote is expected to occur within weeks.

### Summary

In 2025, President Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers have intensified efforts to redraw state congressional maps in order to preserve their narrow majority in the U.S. House ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. Democrats have responded with their own redistricting initiatives, leading to significant political conflict, including a lawsuit by the Justice Department against California’s newly approved Democratic map, which aims to flip five Republican-held seats. This mid-decade redistricting—unprecedented in scale and political motivation—has been driven by the tight political landscape and potential future Supreme Court rulings that could undermine the Voting Rights Act. As states vary in their redistricting processes, Republicans hold more advantages due to greater state-level control and access to map-drawing power, while legal challenges and constitutional changes may further reshape the political map in the coming years.

### Key Takeaways
  - President Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers are actively redrawing congressional maps to protect the party's narrow majority in the U.S. House ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.
  - Democrats have launched their own redistricting efforts, leading to political disputes across multiple states that will shape the midterm political landscape.
  - The Justice Department has sued California over its newly approved Democratic-drawn redistricting map, which aims to flip five Republican-held seats by favoring Democratic candidates.
  - Redistricting typically occurs once every decade following the census, but in 2025, politically motivated redistricting is happening mid-decade due to the tight House majority situation.
  - Redistricting processes vary by state: some allow state legislators to draw maps with political will, while others require constitutional changes or direct public votes.
  - Republicans have more opportunities to gain seats due to greater control of state governments and in some states, Democrats have ceded map-drawing power to independent commissions.
  - Multiple legal challenges are underway to overturn existing maps, and the U.S. Supreme Court may soon rule on whether to strike down key provisions of the Voting Rights Act, which could significantly expand the ability for states to draw more aggressive, partisan maps.

### Summary

A federal judge, Jeffrey Cummings, ordered the release of hundreds of individuals arrested during Operation Midway Blitz, a Trump administration-led immigration crackdown in Illinois that targeted over 3,000 undocumented people between June and October 2025. The ruling, which found violations of a 2022 consent decree restricting warrantless arrests, mandates that 615 individuals without final removal orders and low public safety risks be released on a $1,500 bond with participation in ICE’s Alternatives to Detention program. Additionally, 13 people were released immediately due to violations of the consent decree. The government is required to provide names and threat levels for all 3,000 arrested individuals by November 19. Critics, including the Department of Homeland Security, argue the decision endangers public safety, while advocates, including the National Immigrant Justice Center and ACLU, claim it upholds constitutional rights and due process. The case gained national attention through the arrest of teacher Diana Galeano, whose detention was ruled unlawful in a separate habeas petition. The broader conflict involves federal enforcement tactics, racial profiling, and legal accountability, with senior official Gregory Bovino facing scrutiny for alleged misconduct and false statements.

### Summary

The Trump administration has sued to block California’s redistricting effort, which was approved by 64% of voters via Proposition 50. The plan allows California Democrats to override the state’s independent redistricting commission and shift five Republican-held House seats to favor Democrats. The Justice Department claims the plan constitutes racial gerrymandering, arguing it violates constitutional principles, while Democrats assert it is a necessary response to Republican-led redistricting in Texas, which was driven by President Trump’s push to gain House seats ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. The case involves major political figures, including Governor Gavin Newsom and former President Barack Obama, and marks a rare and significant federal intervention in state-level election redistricting. The outcome could influence the balance of power in Congress and set a precedent for future redistricting disputes.

## What’s in the bill to reopen the federal government? - <small>`cnn`</small>

- <small>tags: `federal government shutdown, political compromise, funding legislation, SNAP food assistance, WIC program, security funding, veterans healthcare, hemp regulation, Affordable Care Act subsidies, Capitol security, federal workers' back pay`</small>

### Summary

After a 43-day federal government shutdown—the longest in history—President Donald Trump signed a compromise bill that ended the impasse. The legislation provides funding for most federal agencies through January 30, 2026, with full-year funding for key agencies including the Department of Agriculture, legislative branch, military construction, and veterans affairs. Critical programs like SNAP, WIC, and the Commodity Supplemental Food Program are fully funded, with all beneficiaries expected to receive full benefits. Security funding is increased, including $852 million for Capitol Police and $28 million for Supreme Court justices. The bill guarantees retroactive pay for over 1.4 million federal workers furloughed during the shutdown and reverses workforce cuts. However, the bill does not extend enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies, which will be considered separately. A controversial provision requires the Justice Department and FBI to notify Congress when a lawmaker is under investigation, sparking criticism from Democrats and prompting Republican efforts to repeal it. Additionally, a hemp-based products ban is included, restricting unregulated sales of hemp-derived products in retail settings, despite hemp being legalized in 2018.

### Key Takeaways
  - The bill ends the longest federal government shutdown in history after 43 days.
  - President Donald Trump signed the compromise legislation after it passed the House and was approved by the Senate, with eight Democratic senators defying party leadership by supporting it.
  - The bill does not guarantee extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies, which will be considered in a separate Senate vote next month.
  - The legislation provides full-year funding for the USDA, legislative branch, military construction, and veterans affairs, ensuring continuity of critical services.
  - The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is fully funded through September 30, with all beneficiaries expected to receive full benefits by Monday, and the contingency fund replenished.

  - The Commodity Supplemental Food Program receives $460 million to support 700,000 low-income seniors.
  - Security funding is increased: $203.5 million for Capitol security, $852 million for US Capitol Police, and $28 million for Supreme Court justice protection.
  - Veterans Affairs receives $115 billion in medical care funding, a $2.3 billion increase, including support for mental health, rural health, homelessness prevention, and caregivers.
  - Federal workers receive retroactive pay for furloughed or unpaid time during the shutdown, with over 1.4 million affected and back pay expected to be distributed in coming days.
  - The bill reverses staffing reductions, restoring workforce levels to pre-shutdown levels and preventing further layoffs through January 30.
  - A provision requires the Justice Department and FBI to notify the Senate when a lawmaker is under investigation or their personal information is being subpoenaed—prompted by the controversial 'Arctic Frost' FBI probe into 2020 fake elector scheme. This provision has drawn criticism from Democrats like Rep. Rosa DeLauro and is expected to be repealed by Republicans via a standalone bill.
  - The bill includes a controversial hemp products ban that prohibits unregulated sales of hemp-based or hemp-derived products in online stores, gas stations, and corner stores, excluding non-intoxicating CBD and industrial hemp products. This measure is notable because hemp was legalized under the 2018 Farm Bill.

### Summary

In a courtroom hearing on November 13, 2025, attorneys for former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James challenged the Justice Department’s appointment of Lindsey Halligan, a White House adviser, as interim US Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. They argue that Halligan’s appointment violated constitutional checks and balances by bypassing the 120-day limit and Senate confirmation requirements, thereby undermining the Appointments Clause and separation of powers. The Justice Department counters that the 120-day rule is a guideline, not a strict limit, and that the attorney general has authority to reappoint interim officials. The hearing also highlighted concerns over oversight, with Judge Cameron McGowan Currie questioning whether Attorney General Pam Bondi reviewed the grand jury transcript in the Comey case, noting a gap in the record after 4:28 PM ET. The DOJ denies the missing time refers to a gap, stating it was jury deliberation behind closed doors. A decision on Halligan’s appointment is expected before Thanksgiving, with both trials set for January 2026.

### Summary

The article analyzes the political dangers surrounding President Donald Trump’s connection to Jeffrey Epstein, focusing on newly released emails that suggest Trump may have been aware of Epstein’s activities, including meetings with Virginia Giuffre and Ghislaine Maxwell’s recruitment of young women from Mar-a-Lago. While no criminal charges have been filed against Trump, public perception and polling data show widespread disapproval of his handling of the situation, with a significant portion of Americans—including many Republicans—willing to believe he was involved in Epstein-related crimes. The article highlights Trump’s political effort to block a House discharge petition that would compel the release of the full Epstein files, which is seen as an act of obstruction and a deepening of public suspicion. Despite the lack of evidence, the optics and political conduct of the Trump administration are interpreted as reinforcing beliefs in a broader cover-up, raising serious political risks to his credibility and public support.

### Key Takeaways
  - The newly released Epstein emails from 2011 and 2019 suggest that Trump may have been aware of Epstein's activities, including meetings with Virginia Giuffre and Maxwell’s recruitment of young women from Mar-a-Lago.
  - Trump has not been formally accused of wrongdoing, but the emails and his political response have fueled public suspicion.

  - Trump’s resistance to releasing the full Epstein files, particularly the Situation Room meeting with GOP lawmakers, is seen as politically dangerous, as it reinforces perceptions of a cover-up.

### Summary

In a surprising and controversial move, House Democrat Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington launched a floor resolution to sanction fellow Democrat Chuy García of Illinois, accusing him of 'anointing an heir' by designating his chief of staff, Patty Garcia, as the sole successor to his House seat. The decision followed García’s announcement on November 4, 2025, citing personal grief and family obligations, including the death of his daughter and the health of his wife. Patty Garcia filed to run just before the deadline, raising concerns about democratic integrity. Gluesenkamp Perez invoked procedural powers to push for a vote, framing the action as a failure to uphold fair elections. The move sparked backlash from within the Democratic Party, with some, like Sen. Andy Kim, condemning it as undemocratic, while others, such as Rep. Delia Ramirez, defended García, arguing the criticism was politically motivated. The incident occurred amid a broader Democratic party division over the government shutdown, highlighting tensions between party unity and accountability in times of personal and political crisis.

## Trump administration designates four European Antifa groups as terrorists - <small>`cnn`</small>

- <small>tags: `terrorism, Antifa, foreign terrorist organizations, Trump administration, Marco Rubio, Germany, Greece, Hungary, anarchism, ideological extremism, U.S. counterterrorism policy, domestic terrorism, European security`</small>

### Summary

The Trump administration has designated four European Antifa groups—Antifa Ost in Germany, the Informal Anarchist Federation/International Revolutionary Front (FAI/FRI), Revolutionary Class Self-Defense, and Armed Proletarian Justice in Greece—as Specially Designated Global Terrorists and intends to classify them as foreign terrorist organizations. The move follows President Donald Trump’s earlier designation of Antifa as a domestic terrorist organization. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio accused these groups of promoting revolutionary anarchist and Marxist ideologies, including anti-Americanism, anti-capitalism, and anti-Christianity, which he claims are used to justify violent attacks both domestically and abroad. The groups are cited for specific violent actions: Antifa Ost for attacks in Germany and Hungary; FAI/FRI for threats of bombings against capitalist institutions; Revolutionary Class Self-Defense for two IED attacks in Greece; and Armed Proletarian Justice for a bomb near Greek riot police in 2023. As a result, U.S. assets linked to these groups will be blocked, and Americans are prohibited from knowingly providing material support. The designation places these groups on par with major terrorist organizations like ISIS-K and al-Shabaab, signaling a significant escalation in the U.S. government's counter-terrorism approach toward left-wing extremist movements.

### Summary

Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt commuted the death sentence of Tremane Wood to life in prison without parole, just before a scheduled lethal injection in November 2025. Wood, 46, was convicted for his role in the 2002 stabbing of 19-year-old Ronnie Wipf during a botched robbery. The decision follows a 3-2 vote by the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board, citing ineffective trial counsel, prosecutorial misconduct, and a key witness plea agreement that was improperly concealed. Wood's attorney claimed his brother Zjaiton Wood, who admitted to killing Wipf, was the actual perpetrator, while Wood himself denied committing the murder. The U.S. Supreme Court denied a request to halt the execution. The decision was praised by Wipf’s family and the surviving victim, and seen as a rare act of clemency by Governor Stitt, who has only granted such relief twice in his seven years in office. Attorney General Gentner Drummond expressed disappointment over the outcome, citing public safety concerns.

### Summary

Newly released emails from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate reveal that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, the former Duke of York, expressed distress in 2011 when informed that a British newspaper would publish allegations linking him to Ghislaine Maxwell and Virginia Giuffre. The allegations claim that Giuffre, a former accuser of Epstein and Maxwell, was sexually trafficked and forced into sexual encounters with Mountbatten-Windsor in London, New York, and on Epstein’s Caribbean island, Little St. James. Despite denials, including claims of no memory of such events, Mountbatten-Windsor reached an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre in 2022. The revelations have led to his removal from royal titles by King Charles III. Additionally, the documents reveal that Peter Mandelson, the former British ambassador to the US, had ongoing contact with Epstein as late as 2016 and advised him to avoid Mountbatten-Windsor, suggesting deeper elite connections. The US House Oversight Committee’s release of these documents has reignited global scrutiny of Epstein’s network and ties to high-profile figures.

## The government shutdown is over. Here’s what travelers need to know about Thanksgiving flights - <small>`cnn`</small>

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/travel/thanksgiving-travel-government-shutdown-flights)
- _Published: 2025-11-13 09:22:00-05:00_
- **Politics & Governance**
- <small>tags: `government shutdown, Thanksgiving travel, air travel disruption, air traffic control shortage, flight cancellations, FAA flight reductions, traveler preparedness, airline recovery, staffing shortages, travel insurance, alternative transportation`</small>

### Summary

The US government shutdown, which ended on November 13, 2025, after President Trump signed a reopening bill, had significant consequences for air travel. The shutdown caused widespread staffing shortages, especially among air traffic controllers, prompting the FAA to reduce flights at 40 major airports by 6%—a reduction now paused due to improved staffing. Despite the reopening, airlines like Delta expect full recovery over several days, with recovery taking a week or more due to residual effects. Travelers are advised to prepare proactively by downloading airline apps, enabling notifications, researching alternatives, and securing backup plans such as rental cars or Amtrak. Although the FAA’s cuts only affected flights, not passengers, the long-term shortage of air traffic controllers may continue to impact operations. Insurance policies often do not cover known events like shutdowns, and travelers are urged to avoid basic economy fares for flexibility. The article offers practical guidance on managing disruptions, changing plans, and making contingency arrangements to ensure safe and stress-free travel during the Thanksgiving period.

### Key Takeaways
  - The US government shutdown ended on November 13, 2025, after President Trump signed a bill to reopen federal operations.
  - Airlines cannot immediately resume full operations; recovery could take a week or more due to residual staffing and operational disruptions.
  - The FAA imposed a 6% reduction in flights at 40 major airports, which has been paused due to improved air traffic controller staffing.
  - A long-standing air traffic controller shortage worsened during the shutdown, with 15–20 controllers retiring per day compared to the usual four, creating lasting impacts on flight operations.
  - Travelers should prepare by downloading airline apps, enabling notifications, researching alternatives, and securing a Plan B (e.g., backup tickets or rental cars).
  - Basic economy fares may not be eligible for flight change waivers during disruptions, so travelers should avoid them for flexibility.
  - Travelers should consider alternative transportation such as Amtrak or driving, especially for regional routes, due to high cancellation rates of regional jets.
  - Many travel insurance policies do not cover known events like government shutdowns; coverage depends on specific policy terms such as 'Cancel for Any Reason' or 'Interruption for Any Reason'.
  - Travelers are advised to act proactively by booking disruptions assistance services, arriving early, and contacting airlines quickly if flights are delayed or canceled.
  - Even after reopening, flight disruptions may persist due to ongoing staffing shortages and reduced flight capacity.

## Flying Will Stay Rough After the Shutdown. Why? Spirit Airlines - <small>`cnn`</small>

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/business/holiday-travel-spirit-airlines)
- _Published: 2025-11-13 07:00:00-05:00_
- **Politics & Governance**
- <small>tags: `spirit airlines, airline pricing, holiday travel, flight cancellations, bankruptcy, discount carriers, U.S. domestic flights, fiscal 2025, economic impact, travel costs`</small>

### Summary

Spirit Airlines, despite its relatively small passenger base, has historically played a critical role in shaping U.S. airline pricing by forcing major carriers like American, Delta, and United to offer lower fares. However, due to severe financial difficulties and its current second bankruptcy reorganization, Spirit is now operating nearly 11,000 fewer flights this holiday season—a one-third reduction—compared to last year. This decline in operations, even after government shutdown-related cancellations are lifted, is reducing the downward pressure on airline prices, contributing to a 6% increase in Thanksgiving week fares and a 7% rise during the year-end holidays. While Spirit CEO Dave Davis maintains that the airline has saved consumers hundreds of millions of dollars, its shrinking footprint is now altering the competitive landscape, with major carriers facing higher prices due to reduced competitive pressure from Spirit.

### Key Takeaways
  - Spirit Airlines, despite having relatively few passengers, has historically exerted significant downward pressure on airline fares across the industry due to its no-frills pricing model.
  - Even after government-mandated flight cancellations end, Spirit will operate nearly 11,000 fewer flights this holiday season than last year, representing a one-third reduction in its schedule and a loss of nearly 2 million available seats.
  - This reduction in Spirit's presence is leading to a measurable increase in U.S. domestic flight prices—up 6% during Thanksgiving week and 7% during the year-end holiday period—according to Going.com.
  - Spirit has been in financial distress since 2020 and is currently in its second bankruptcy reorganization, with the company expressing 'substantial doubt' about its ability to remain in business over the next 12 months.
  - The airline has drastically reduced its route network, resulting in less overlap with major carriers like American, Delta, and United, thereby reducing its influence on overall pricing.
  - Spirit CEO Dave Davis emphasized that the airline has saved consumers hundreds of millions of dollars, even if passengers do not fly with Spirit directly.

## The government shutdown is over, but things are not back to normal - <small>`cnn`</small>

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/politics/government-shutdown-ends-federal-workers-return)
- _Published: 2025-11-13 10:16:00-05:00_
- **Politics & Governance**
- <small>tags: `government shutdown, federal workforce, back pay delays, air traffic control, SNAP benefits, Head Start programs, economic data, funding delays, workforce layoffs, public safety, policy instability`</small>

### Summary

The government shutdown, which lasted 43 days and ended on November 13, 2025, has not restored normal operations. Federal workers face significant backlogs, delayed back pay, and mental stress, with operations in education, transportation, food safety, and national parks severely impacted. Key programs such as SNAP and Head Start face prolonged funding delays, while essential economic data for September and October was permanently lost. The short-term funding deal only extends operations to January 30, 2025, leaving federal employees and the public facing continued instability. Staffing cuts, abrupt closures at NASA’s Goddard Center, and a surge in federal employee resignations signal deep systemic issues. Experts warn that the federal workforce is not returning to normal—instead, it’s preparing for another shutdown in the coming months, with recovery likely taking months or even years.

### Key Takeaways
  - The government shutdown, which lasted 43 days, has not restored normal operations, with federal workers facing ongoing backlogs, delayed payments, and operational instability.
  - Air traffic control is severely understaffed due to furloughed controllers, with at least 15–20 retirement-aged controllers quitting daily during the shutdown, threatening long-term safety and infrastructure development.
  - Critical safety net programs like SNAP and Head Start are experiencing delayed funding, with SNAP benefits distributed in a fragmented manner and Head Start programs in 17 states and Puerto Rico forced to close.
  - Economic data for September and October has been permanently lost, and the first Q3 GDP estimate is missing, depriving policymakers of essential data during a critical economic period.
  - Federal workers are experiencing significant mental and financial stress, with a 74% spike in resignations and job transitions to state or local government roles through platforms like CivicMatch.
  - NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center faced abrupt and unannounced closures of multiple buildings, raising concerns about administrative restructuring and potential dismantling of key research facilities.
  - Back pay for roughly 1.4 million furloughed workers is expected to take days to weeks, with delays due to staffing cuts and fragmented pay systems across agencies.
  - The shutdown exacerbated pre-existing federal workforce reductions, making recovery more difficult across agencies including education, food safety, national parks, and tax administration.

### Summary

Dozens of Israeli settlers launched a coordinated arson attack in the West Bank, specifically targeting the Deir Sharaf Bedouin village and Al-Juneidi dairy factory in Beit Lid, east of Tulkarm. The attack, which involved torching trucks, tents, and property, resulted in four Palestinian injuries and damage to critical agricultural infrastructure. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) responded by dispatching troops, arresting several suspects, and condemning the violence as 'unacceptable' and carried out by 'anarchist fringe youth'. Israeli lawmaker Gilad Kariv warned the attacks may trigger a 'third intifada', while Palestinian authorities called for international intervention. This incident is part of a broader surge in settler violence across the West Bank, with over 264 attacks reported in October 2025—up from previous years—particularly during the olive harvest season. Similar attacks occurred in villages like Beita and Burin, where Israeli civilians, including off-duty reservists and activists, were injured. These events reflect deepening tensions, with both Palestinian civilians and Israeli citizens directly exposed to violence, raising urgent concerns over security, stability, and human rights.

## Judge Hears Arguments Thursday in Bid by James Comey and Letitia James to Disqualify Lindsey Halligan - <small>`cnn`</small>

### Summary

The criminal cases against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James face a critical legal challenge as their defense attorneys argue that Lindsey Halligan, the only federal prosecutor who signed their indictments, is unlawfully serving as interim U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. Halligan was appointed by President Donald Trump shortly after her predecessor was ousted for resisting charges against Comey. The defense claims the 120-day interim period for US attorneys expired in September 2025, and that the clock should not be reset with a new appointment. If the judge rules against Halligan’s authority, the indictments could be dismissed, especially since the five-year statute of limitations has expired in Comey’s case. The Justice Department counters that the indictments do not depend on Halligan’s office being valid and that a new appointment could occur if a vacancy arises. The case is being heard by senior federal judge Cameron McGowan Currie, a Clinton appointee, who has been assigned due to the importance of judicial oversight in the district. Both defendants have pleaded not guilty and are set for trial in January.

### Key Takeaways

## US Lawmakers Demand Answers from Trump Administration Over Chinese Chemical Shipments to Iran - <small>`cnn`</small>

### Summary

US lawmakers, including Representatives Raja Krishnamoorthi and Joe Courtney, have demanded answers from the Trump administration over reports that Chinese firms are supplying Iran with sodium perchlorate—a key precursor in ballistic missile propellants—since late September 2025. These shipments, estimated at 2,000 tons, could enable Iran to produce around 500 missiles, raising alarm about violations of UN sanctions reinstated in September 2025 after Iran breached the JCPOA. The Chinese government denies knowledge of specific shipments, citing compliance with export controls and opposition to sanctions, while experts note that sodium perchlorate is a direct precursor to the banned oxidizer ammonium perchlorate. The shipments, traced through cargo ship movements and crew social media, involve vessels and entities under US sanctions, suggesting a coordinated supply chain. China and Russia have opposed the UN sanctions, arguing they interfere with diplomatic efforts. The incident deepens concerns about strategic coordination among China, Iran, Russia, and North Korea, and underscores a failure of US deterrence efforts despite prior sanctions and diplomatic actions.

### Key Takeaways
  - Chinese firms are reportedly shipping sodium perchlorate to Iran, a key precursor in ballistic missile propellant, in violation of UN sanctions.

  - Sodium perchlorate, though not explicitly banned in UN documents, is a direct precursor to ammonium perchlorate, a prohibited oxidizer used in ballistic missiles, creating a legal gray area for China to claim compliance.
  - Several cargo ships and Chinese entities involved in the shipments are under US sanctions, indicating potential coordination between sanctioned actors and Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps.
  - The shipment routes and crew activities are traceable through social media posts, suggesting a patterned, organized supply chain that may be exploiting diplomatic and logistical networks.

### Summary

A peace agreement between Thailand and Cambodia, brokered by U.S. President Donald Trump and signed in late October 2025, is collapsing after a violent border clash on November 12, 2025. The incident, in which Thai forces allegedly opened fire on civilians in Banteay Meanchey province, killing one and injuring three, is blamed by Cambodia on Thailand, while Thailand claims Cambodian troops fired first in Sa Kaeo province and responded with warning shots. The conflict follows a landmine explosion in Sisaket province that injured four Thai soldiers, prompting Thailand to suspend all agreements with Cambodia. The peace agreement, which included commitments to withdraw weapons and de-mining, is now under severe strain, with Cambodia calling for an independent investigation and denouncing the incident as a violation of international law. The dispute is rooted in a colonial-era border map that Thailand rejects, and the two nations share a 500-mile border.

### Summary

Pakistan’s parliament passed a controversial constitutional amendment that elevates army chief Asim Munir to Chief of Defence Forces, integrating the navy and air force under his command and granting him lifelong legal immunity. The amendment also creates a new Federal Constitutional Court, whose judges are appointed by the government, effectively shifting constitutional cases away from the Supreme Court. Critics, including opposition parties and legal experts, warn that this undermines judicial independence and marks a dangerous erosion of democracy. While Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif frames the reform as a step toward national unity and military honor, the rapid legislative process and opposition protests indicate deep political and constitutional tensions.

### Summary

Adelita Grijalva’s swearing-in as a U.S. House Representative provided the 218th signature needed to activate a discharge petition demanding the release of Jeffrey Epstein’s case files. This petition, led by Republicans Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna, is a procedural tool that allows a floor vote even if leadership opposes it. Though the effort faces strong opposition—particularly from Senate Republicans and President Donald Trump—and the House process involves multiple procedural steps, Speaker Mike Johnson has committed to bringing the measure to the floor next week. The bill would still require passage through the Republican-controlled Senate and presidential approval, but the House vote would mark a significant moment of accountability, forcing Republicans to choose between supporting the President or advancing transparency in a high-profile criminal case.

### Key Takeaways

  - The bill faces significant hurdles in the GOP-controlled Senate, where Majority Leader John Thune and others argue that thousands of documents already released by the Justice Department make the legislation unnecessary.
  - Senate Republicans previously killed a similar bill in September, with only two voting to support it, indicating strong resistance to further action.
  - President Donald Trump has publicly opposed the effort, which may influence both party leadership and public perception.

### Summary

The release of three newly obtained emails from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate has reignited public and political debate over Donald Trump’s relationship with Epstein.

These documents deepen questions about what Trump knew and when, particularly given Trump’s history of evasive or contradictory statements. Despite the White House denying any wrongdoing and accusing Democrats of selective leaking, the emails suggest a level of awareness and connection that raises concerns about transparency and accountability.

### Summary

Department of Homeland Security agents were shot at in Chicago’s Little Village neighborhood on Saturday morning during an immigration enforcement operation dubbed 'Operation Midway Blitz.' A man driving a black Jeep Wrangler opened fire, then fled, with a Mexican national suspect later arrested. The incident occurred amid accusations that federal agents used flash-bang grenades and pepper spray against peaceful protesters without warning. Witnesses, including Alderman Mike Rodriguez and Pastor Matt DeMateo, reported no prior warnings and were injured by the explosions.

The Trump administration appealed this ruling, deepening legal and political conflict. Local leaders, including Mayor Brandon Johnson and Rep. Jesús ‘Chuy’ García, condemned the violence as unconstitutional and state-sponsored, emphasizing community fear and a call for peace. The events highlight a growing crisis of trust between federal immigration enforcement and local communities in Chicago.

## Speaker Johnson’s narrow majority shrinks further after Democrat Adelita Grijalva sworn in - <small>`cnn`</small>

- <small>tags: `narrow majority, House of Representatives, Jeffrey Epstein files, political instability, special election, government shutdown, bipartisan vote, historical parallels, Congressional dynamics`</small>

### Summary

After a delayed swearing-in, Democrat Adelita Grijalva joins the House, reducing Speaker Mike Johnson’s Republican majority to 219-214 and intensifying political tension. This narrow majority—among the closest in nearly a century—creates significant challenges for passing legislation, especially as a critical vote on releasing Jeffrey Epstein case files is now imminent due to bipartisan support. The shift is driven by vacancies, including the resignation of Matt Gaetz, and the ongoing uncertainty over two open seats in Tennessee and Texas. The situation echoes historical Congresses like the 72nd, where narrow margins and vacancies led to political instability. Johnson’s ability to maintain control hinges on avoiding two Republican defections, making every vote a high-stakes event.

### Key Takeaways
  - Speaker Mike Johnson’s majority has shrunk to 219 Republicans and 214 Democrats after Democrat Adelita Grijalva's swearing-in, making the House majority one of the narrowest in nearly a century.

  - Adelita Grijalva’s swearing-in enables a petition from GOP Rep. Thomas Massie and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna to force a vote on releasing Jeffrey Epstein case files, highlighting the political significance of the vote.
  - The current majority is historically narrow, with the last such division occurring after the 1930 elections, and the 119th Congress has seen shifts due to vacancies and special elections.
  - A tie vote in the House results in failure, which makes passing legislation highly risky under this narrow majority.
  - The 119th Congress began with 219 Republicans and 215 Democrats, but the vacancy of former GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz reduced the Republican count to 219, contributing to the current tight balance.

### Summary

At the COP30 climate summit in Belém, Brazil, California Governor Gavin Newsom sharply criticized President Donald Trump, calling him an 'invasive species' and a 'wrecking ball' for abandoning U.S. climate action and rolling back clean energy policies. Newsom argues that Trump’s policies allow China to dominate clean energy markets and that any plan to open California’s coast to oil drilling is unacceptable. He emphasizes the need to make climate change tangible through real-world events like the 2025 Los Angeles wildfires and stresses affordability in policy messaging. The White House responded with a counterattack, accusing Newsom of hypocrisy over attending a climate summit that involves deforestation in the Amazon. This exchange underscores the deepening political and environmental divide over climate leadership in the U.S. and globally.

## 'We Need to Get Out of Here': Trump's Immigration Crackdown Is Quietly Reshaping Where Immigrants Live in America - <small>`npr`</small>

### Summary

Under the Trump administration's aggressive immigration enforcement, undocumented immigrants across the U.S. are experiencing both self-deportation and internal migration. Families and individuals, such as E in Tampa, Florida and R in Nebraska, are leaving high-enforcement zones like Florida and Nebraska for safer areas such as Michigan and North Carolina, driven by fear of raids and deportation. These movements reflect a long-standing pattern of migration, studied by demographer Matt Brooks, where immigrants move from urban centers to the South and Midwest for jobs and then to less targeted regions for safety. The Trump administration reports over 1.6 million voluntary departures, and anecdotal evidence shows that internal relocations are becoming a widespread response to enforcement actions, reshaping where immigrants live across America.

## Two blasts a day apart in India and Pakistan’s capitals fray regional nerves in an already tense year - <small>`cnn`</small>

- <small>tags: `terrorism, India-Pakistan conflict, security crisis, South Asia, suicide bombing, cross-border attacks, political blame game, regional instability, military tensions, capital attacks`</small>

### Summary

Two deadly terrorist attacks—one in Delhi, India, and one in Islamabad, Pakistan—occurred within 24 hours in November 2025, marking a rare and alarming escalation in security in both nations' capitals. The Delhi blast, near the historic Red Fort, killed at least 10 and injured dozens, while the Islamabad suicide bombing in a judicial complex killed at least 12 and injured 20. No direct link has been established between the attacks. Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif accused India of sponsoring the Islamabad attack, claiming Indian-backed militants from Afghan soil were responsible, while India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi rejected the claims and labeled the Delhi incident a 'terrorist act' by anti-national forces. Jamaat-ul-Ahrar (JuA), a splinter group of the TTP, claimed responsibility for the Islamabad bombing, though the TTP distanced itself. Both governments responded with political posturing: India launched an investigation by the National Investigation Agency, and Pakistan declared a 'state of war.' Experts warn that the attacks reflect a fragile security environment, with cross-border tensions reignited by the long-standing India-Pakistan blame game, particularly following a major military conflict in May 2025. The attacks signal a shift in terrorism's geography, moving from rural areas to secure urban centers, and raise fears of a wider regional crisis involving India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan.

  - Jamaat-ul-Ahrar (JuA), a splinter group of the TTP, claimed responsibility for the Islamabad attack, while the TTP itself distanced itself.
  - The attacks have intensified political pressure on both governments to act decisively, with domestic hardliners using the incidents to demand stronger security measures.
  - The region is at risk of a wider crisis involving India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan due to shared militant threats and mutual accusations.

## California plans to revoke 17,000 commercial driver's licenses given to immigrants - <small>`npr`</small>

### Summary

California plans to revoke 17,000 commercial driver's licenses issued to immigrants after discovering that the expiration dates of these licenses exceeded the legal status of the drivers in the U.S. The action follows criticism from Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, who accused the state of issuing licenses to individuals unlawfully present in the country. California previously argued that drivers had valid federal work authorizations, but now acknowledges that state law requires licenses to expire on or before the end of a person's legal status. The revocation is part of California’s compliance with new federal rules introduced in September, which limit eligibility to only H-2a, H-2b, and E-2 visa holders and require states to verify immigration status through federal databases. Although the new rules are not retroactive, drivers will be notified that their licenses expire in 60 days. The issue gained public attention after a fatal crash in Florida in August 2025, and similar crashes in Texas and Alabama underscore broader concerns about safety and legality. The Transportation Department has threatened to withhold up to $160 million in federal funding if California fails to remove all illegal licenses.

### Key Takeaways
  - California plans to revoke 17,000 commercial driver's licenses given to immigrants due to expiration dates exceeding the legal status of the drivers in the U.S.
  - The revocation follows criticism from the Trump administration, particularly Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, who accused California of issuing licenses to individuals illegally present in the U.S.
  - California previously defended its licensing standards, citing federal government work authorizations, but now acknowledges state law requires licenses to expire no later than the end of the driver’s legal status in the U.S.
  - Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy previously found that one quarter of 145 reviewed licenses in California were improperly issued, including four that remained valid after work permits expired—sometimes years later.
  - The new federal rules, announced in September, limit eligibility to only three visa types: H-2a, H-2b, and E-2, and require states to verify immigration status through federal databases.
  - Under the new rules, only 10,000 of the 200,000 noncitizen commercial drivers would qualify, with licenses valid for up to one year unless a visa expires earlier.
  - The new rules are not retroactive; the 190,000 affected drivers will retain their licenses until renewal, but will be issued notices that their licenses expire in 60 days.
  - The action is part of California's compliance with federal regulations and scrutiny from the Department of Transportation, which has threatened to withhold up to $160 million in federal funding.
  - The issue gained public attention after a fatal truck crash in Florida in August 2025, involving a driver not authorized to be in the U.S., which killed three people.
  - Similar concerns arose from fatal crashes in Texas and Alabama earlier in 2025, highlighting broader issues with immigrant commercial driver licensing.

## Air traffic controllers promised fast shutdown pay, but they've been told that before - <small>`npr`</small>

- <small>tags: `government shutdown, air traffic controllers, back pay, overtime pay, Fair Labor Standards Act, Federal Aviation Administration, Sean Duffy, President Trump, union representation, public trust, staffing shortage, flight delays`</small>

### Summary

During a 43-day government shutdown in November 2025, air traffic controllers in the United States worked without pay, missing two full paychecks and part of a third. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy promised prompt compensation, with 70% of back pay to be issued within 48 hours of the government reopening and the rest within a week. However, many controllers remain wary due to past failures during the 2018–2019 shutdown, when a lawsuit over unpaid overtime and shift differentials resulted in years-long delays and only partial compensation. Some controllers had to manually calculate their owed wages, with one receiving a $400 check just weeks before the current shutdown. President Trump proposed a $10,000 bonus for controllers who maintained full shifts, and Secretary Duffy expressed support, suggesting a White House presentation. Despite these promises, neither the FAA nor the Department of Transportation has provided detailed information on the distribution of back pay or bonuses. Meanwhile, staffing shortages during the shutdown caused temporary flight reductions, which will remain in place until safety data improves, and airlines expect to return to normal operations within a week.

### Key Takeaways

## The longest government shutdown in U.S. history comes to a close - <small>`npr`</small>

- <small>tags: `government shutdown, Affordable Care Act, SNAP, bipartisan compromise, political negotiation, funding legislation, healthcare policy, U.S. politics, 2025 legislative session`</small>

### Summary

The longest government shutdown in U.S. history, lasting 43 days and affecting millions of Americans, ended when President Trump signed a funding bill passed by the House. The bill extended spending through January and provided limited funding for agencies like SNAP, reversed Trump-era layoffs, and offered backpay to federal workers. However, it did not address the core demand from Democrats—extending ACA subsidies—which expire at year-end. A bipartisan deal involving Senate Majority Leader John Thune to vote on such legislation in mid-December was agreed upon, but remains controversial, especially among Democratic leaders who see it as insufficient. The shutdown failed to produce meaningful policy gains, instead reinforcing criticism of political brinkmanship. With Congress still facing multiple funding bills to pass, the political path forward hinges on whether Democrats can secure bipartisan support to extend ACA subsidies before the next legislative cycle.

### Key Takeaways
  - The shutdown, lasting 43 days, was the longest in U.S. history and deeply affected millions of Americans, including through unpaid work and halted SNAP benefits.
  - The final funding bill did not extend ACA subsidies, leaving the core political demand of Democrats unmet.
  - Six Democrats joined Republicans to pass the bill, with two Republicans voting against it, highlighting bipartisan compromise despite political tensions.
  - The shutdown failed to achieve policy goals, reinforcing the view that government shutdowns are ineffective tools for advancing legislative agendas.
  - Senate Democrats are now under pressure to act quickly to pass bipartisan legislation to extend ACA subsidies before the December vote, with potential implications for the 2026 midterms.

## SNAP Funding Pause to Soon End, but Anxiety and Anger May Linger - <small>`npr`</small>

### Summary

The end of a 12-day government shutdown in November 2025 led to the restoration of SNAP benefits for 42 million Americans, but the temporary suspension raised serious concerns. The U.S. Department of Agriculture withheld full SNAP payments during the shutdown, claiming a lack of funds and blaming Democrats, while arguing that reserve funds could not be used. This decision was challenged in court, and two judges ruled that the USDA must use other reserves to cover benefits. Critics, including experts and advocacy groups, say this action broke SNAP’s longstanding entitlement status, eroded public trust, and may be used as a political negotiation tool in future shutdowns. President Donald Trump criticized SNAP as a 'Democrat program' and made false claims about President Biden giving benefits randomly. Advocates stress that while the pause caused anxiety and may have discouraged some from applying, it also raised public awareness of the program’s vital role in food security. The congressional deal to reopen the government funds SNAP through September 2026, but experts urge lawmakers to pass legislation to prevent future disruptions.

## Federal Special Education Staff May Get Their Jobs Back — But For How Long? - <small>`npr`</small>

- <small>tags: `federal government shutdown, special education, staffing cuts, OSERS, OCR, Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), civil rights enforcement, Trump administration, federal staffing, education policy, student rights`</small>

### Summary

The U.S. Department of Education has reinstated 121 former OSERS staff and 137 former OCR staff following a federal government funding deal, with employment status restored as of September 30, 2025. However, the reinstatement is temporary, expiring on January 30, 2025, and there is no legal protection beyond that date. The cuts to OSERS and OCR—both federally mandated offices that oversee special education and civil rights enforcement—raise serious concerns among advocates and experts. These staff reductions may signal an intentional dismantling of the special education system, with potential consequences including weakened enforcement of disability rights, increased political influence in education policy, and erosion of accountability for school districts. Advocacy groups and academics warn that without long-term staffing and structural stability, both offices could transform into politically driven entities rather than independent guardians of civil rights.

### Key Takeaways
  - The Trump administration reinstated federal special education staff after a government shutdown, but this reinstatement is only temporary and expires on January 30, 2025.
  - The Office for Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS) and the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) are both mandated by federal law to support students with disabilities and investigate discrimination complaints.
  - OSERS lost 121 of its 135 employees in October, and OCR lost 299 employees in March and 137 in October, with many placed on administrative leave or facing potential re-firing after the funding deal expires.
  - The reinstatement is limited to 'employment status' as of September 30, but there is no assurance of continued employment beyond January 30.
  - Experts and advocacy groups express concern that dismantling these offices undermines the federal special education system and risks transforming OCR into a politically driven enforcement arm.
  - The federal government’s aggressive use of OCR to target schools for policies on transgender students and diversity, equity, and inclusion raises concerns about political overreach and erosion of civil rights protections for students with disabilities.

### Summary

Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, once second-in-line to the British throne, has been stripped of all royal titles by King Charles III following a renewed scandal tied to Jeffrey Epstein and Virginia Roberts Giuffre. The recent release of thousands of emails, including correspondence between Epstein and Andrew, reveals that their connection extended far beyond what Mountbatten-Windsor claimed, and that he was aware of Giuffre’s allegations. Giuffre, who died by suicide, alleges she was trafficked and had multiple sexual encounters with him when she was 17, a claim contradicted by his public denials and supported by her posthumous memoir. Epstein’s emails show he disparaged Giuffre, called her a 'telephone answerer,' and suggested having a reporter investigate her, indicating active efforts to undermine her credibility. The fallout includes the loss of Mountbatten-Windsor’s royal status, his removal from public office, and a potential eviction from royal property. Despite settling a lawsuit with Giuffre out of court, the evidence continues to undermine his claims, marking a significant collapse of his public reputation.

### Summary

The U.S. Justice Department has filed a lawsuit to block new congressional district boundaries approved by California voters through Proposition 50, which aims to give Democrats a chance to gain five seats currently held by Republicans ahead of the 2026 House elections. The lawsuit, led by Attorney General Pam Bondi, alleges that the map constitutes racial gerrymandering and undermines civil rights by using race as a proxy to favor Hispanic voters. The move is a direct response to similar Republican-led redistricting efforts in Texas, Missouri, and North Carolina, which were supported by President Donald Trump. California Governor Gavin Newsom, seen as a potential 2028 presidential candidate, defended the initiative as a democratic response to political pressure. The case is part of a national trend where states are redrawing district lines to gain partisan advantage, drawing significant financial and political attention, including high-profile support from figures like Barack Obama and opposition from former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. The outcome could determine control of the U.S. House in 2026 and influence the future direction of federal policy.

## California to Revoke 17,000 Commercial Driver’s Licenses for Immigrants Amid Federal Push - <small>`apnews`</small>

### Summary

California has announced the revocation of 17,000 commercial driver’s licenses issued to immigrants, after discovering that the licenses expired after the drivers lost legal status in the U.S. The action follows federal criticism from Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, who accused California of improperly issuing licenses—especially in cases where work permits expired years ago—and threatened significant funding cuts. California previously maintained that all drivers had valid federal work authorizations, but the revocation is based on state law requiring licenses to expire no later than the end of a person’s legal status. The federal government has introduced new rules limiting commercial licenses to only H-2a, H-2b, and E-2 visa holders, with no retroactive enforcement. While the new rules were not in place when the licenses were issued, drivers are being given 60-day notices to renew before their licenses expire. The issue was amplified by a fatal crash in Florida in August, and earlier crashes in Texas and Alabama, raising national concerns about the safety and legality of allowing undocumented individuals to operate commercial vehicles.

### Key Takeaways
  - California plans to revoke 17,000 commercial driver’s licenses issued to immigrants due to expiration dates surpassing the legal status of the drivers’ presence in the U.S.
  - The revocation follows federal criticism from Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, who accused California of improperly issuing licenses to unauthorized individuals, including in cases where work permits expired years ago.
  - The state previously maintained that all drivers had valid federal work authorizations, but the revocation was based on state law requiring licenses to expire no later than the end of a person’s legal status in the U.S.
  - Duffy imposed a $40 million funding cut for California over lack of English language requirements and threatened an additional $160 million if all illegal licenses are not invalidated.
  - Under new federal rules, only H-2a, H-2b, and E-2 visa holders can qualify for commercial licenses, making it extremely difficult for most immigrants to obtain them.
  - The new rules are not retroactive, meaning the 190,000 existing noncitizen commercial drivers will retain their licenses until renewal.
  - California’s review was prompted by Duffy’s audit, which found that one quarter of 145 reviewed licenses were issued in violation of state law, with some licenses remaining valid after work permits expired.

### Summary

On November 13, 2025, Cambodia evacuated around 250 families from Prey Chan village in Banteay Meanchey province after a shooting incident involving a Cambodian man, Dy Nai, who was reportedly killed.

### Summary

Bill Pulte, the Trump administration’s top housing regulator and chairman of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, ordered Fannie Mae’s marketing head Lauren Smith to share confidential mortgage pricing data with its competitor Freddie Mac. This action sparked alarm at Fannie Mae, with executives warning that it exposed the company to allegations of collusion. Senior officials, including Malloy Evans, Danielle McCoy, and CEO Priscilla Almodovar, were dismissed in late October 2025, while a loyalist, John Roscoe, was promoted. The incident raises serious concerns about Pulte’s use of nonpublic data and regulatory power for political gain, including targeting political opponents like Sen. Adam Schiff and Attorney General Letitia James with fraud referrals. Pulte has also promoted controversial proposals such as 50-year mortgages and cryptocurrency in lending, which are seen as politically driven. Critics, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, argue that Pulte is weaponizing his position to advance Donald Trump’s agenda rather than serving public housing interests.

### Key Takeaways
  - Bill Pulte, the top housing regulator under the Trump administration, used confidential mortgage data from Fannie Mae to share with a competitor, Freddie Mac, raising serious concerns about data misuse and conflict of interest.
  - Lauren Smith, Fannie Mae’s head of marketing, shared sensitive pricing data with Freddie Mac on Pulte’s directive, which triggered internal alerts at Fannie Mae and prompted legal evaluations of potential collusion and violations.

## Trump administration targets European antifa groups as ‘global terrorists’ - <small>`aljazeera`</small>

### Summary

The Trump administration has designated four European antifa groups—Antifa Ost (Germany), the Informal Anarchist Federation/International Revolutionary Front (FAI/FRI) in Italy, Armed Proletarian Justice and Revolutionary Class Self-Defense in Greece—as 'specially designated global terrorists' and plans to list them as 'foreign terrorist organisations' effective November 20, 2025. The move follows a September 22 executive order in which Trump declared antifa a 'domestic terrorist organisation'. The US Department of State warned that any US-based individual or entity engaging in transactions with these groups could face sanctions, including secondary penalties. Experts, including historian Mark Bray, argue that antifa is not a coordinated or funded movement but a decentralized ideology rooted in protest and political expression, and that labeling it as terrorism is a political strategy to suppress left-wing activism and promote conspiracy theories about hidden financiers like George Soros. This raises significant concerns about free speech, association, and the expansion of the legal definition of terrorism beyond traditional threats.

### Key Takeaways
  - The Trump administration designated four European antifa groups—Antifa Ost (Germany), Informal Anarchist Federation/International Revolutionary Front (FAI/FRI) (Italy), Armed Proletarian Justice (Greece), and Revolutionary Class Self-Defense (Greece)—as 'specially designated global terrorists' and plans to list them as 'foreign terrorist organisations' effective November 20, 2025.
  - The US State Department warned that US-based individuals or entities conducting business with these groups face sanctions, including secondary sanctions under counterterrorism authorities.

  - Experts, including historian Mark Bray, contend that labeling antifa as a 'terrorist' organisation is misleading and politically motivated, serving as a tool to suppress left-wing activism and promote conspiracy theories about shadowy financiers like George Soros.
  - The designation raises constitutional concerns regarding free speech and association under the First Amendment, as it may enable broad political repression against individuals or groups on the left.

## James Comey, Letitia James argue US attorney in their cases hired illegally - <small>`aljazeera`</small>

### Summary

James Comey and Letitia James, both prominent critics of President Donald Trump, have petitioned a federal judge to dismiss criminal cases against them, claiming the indictments were the result of illegal and politically motivated actions. The prosecution hinges on the appointment of Lindsey Halligan, an interim US Attorney appointed without Senate confirmation and beyond the 120-day limit, who was previously part of Trump’s legal team. The lawyers argue that Halligan's appointment violated federal law, and that the lack of proper documentation during the grand jury proceedings—including the absence of a court reporter—raises serious procedural concerns. The Justice Department counters that the appointments are lawful and the charges valid, calling the claims a 'paperwork error'. President Trump openly supported the indictments, criticizing the prior US Attorney and praising Halligan. The judge, Cameron McGowan Currie, has expressed skepticism, noting gaps in the grand jury transcript and questioning whether Attorney General Pam Bondi could have reviewed the proceedings. A watchdog group, Campaign for Accountability, has also accused Halligan of violating professional ethics by conducting indictments without career prosecutors and with minimal jury support, suggesting a politically driven outcome.

## Trump administration joins lawsuit against California’s redistricting maps - <small>`aljazeera`</small>

- <small>tags: `gerrymandering, redistricting, California, Trump administration, racial discrimination, democratic process, election law, political gerrymandering, U.S. Department of Justice, Proposition 50, election integrity`</small>

### Summary

The Trump administration has joined a legal challenge against California’s new congressional redistricting map, which was approved via Proposition 50—a ballot initiative with 64% support. The map, designed to benefit Democrats and counter Republican gerrymandering in states like Texas, Missouri, and North Carolina, is accused by the Justice Department and California Republicans of violating constitutional provisions by racially favoring Hispanic communities. The map, which merges conservative rural areas with liberal coastal enclaves like Marin County, is set to affect elections from 2026 through 2030. Governor Gavin Newsom has defended the measure as a democratic defense, while critics argue it constitutes racial gerrymandering. The lawsuit, filed on November 5, 2025, seeks a court injunction to block the map’s use in future elections, highlighting ongoing tensions over fair representation and democratic accountability in U.S. politics.

### Key Takeaways
  - The Trump administration, including the Department of Justice, has joined a lawsuit against California’s redistricting map, claiming it violates constitutional principles by favoring Hispanic communities.
  - California’s Proposition 50, passed by a 64% majority, suspends the independent redistricting commission and instead uses state legislature-drawn boundaries to benefit Democrats.
  - The new map is designed to dilute Republican voting power by merging rural conservative areas with liberal coastal regions, such as uniting far northern California with Marin County.
  - The Justice Department accuses the map of racial gerrymandering, arguing it manipulates district lines to bolster the voting power of Hispanic populations based on race.
  - The lawsuit includes both California Republicans and 19 registered voters who claim the map violates the U.S. Constitution by illegally disadvantaging certain communities.
  - Texas, Missouri, and North Carolina have seen Republican-backed redistricting that could increase Republican representation, prompting California’s effort to counterbalance this shift.
  - Governor Gavin Newsom has defended the redistricting as a democratic defense and has called the Trump administration’s opposition ‘ramblings of an old man that knows he’s about to lose’.
  - California’s new districts will remain in effect through 2026, 2028, and 2030, making the legal challenge a long-term issue in American electoral politics.

### Summary

Ivory Coast has heightened its border security in response to an unusual flow of refugees from Mali, driven by sustained militant attacks and a fuel blockade imposed by the al-Qaeda-linked group Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM). The group, formed in 2017 from several militant factions including Ansar Dine and al-Mourabitoun, has been waging a decade-long insurgency in Mali and expanding into neighboring countries such as Burkina Faso, Ghana, Benin, Togo, and Nigeria. JNIM’s attacks, including a fuel blockade on Mali’s capital Bamako and an assault on the town of Loulouni, have caused widespread civilian suffering and mass displacement. As a result, Ivory Coast, which already hosts around 90,000 refugees from Burkina Faso, has activated its National Security Council to register asylum seekers and reinforce northern border defenses. This reflects the growing regional instability and the urgent need for coordinated responses to cross-border security and humanitarian challenges in the Sahel.

### Summary

An Israeli settler arson attack on the Hajja Hamida Mosque in Deir Istiya, West Bank, on November 13, 2025, sparked international condemnation, with racist slogans and Quran copies burned. This attack is part of a broader wave of violence linked to the 2025 olive harvest, with at least 167 settler attacks reported since October 1, resulting in over 150 injuries and extensive damage to olive trees. The UN Human Rights Office has warned that these attacks are coordinated with Israeli security forces and serve a broader strategy of annexing the West Bank and enforcing systemic discrimination. International actors including the UN, Jordan, Germany, and Switzerland have condemned the violence, calling for investigations and accountability. A separate incident in Khirbet Abu Falah involved settlers setting fire to a Palestinian home with a family inside, causing injury. The violence reflects ongoing Israeli policies of occupation, settlement expansion, and discrimination, which are intensified by the war in Gaza and domestic political push for annexation under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s far-right government.

## Will Pakistan’s defence overhaul strengthen or upset its military balance? - <small>`aljazeera`</small>

- [source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/14/will-pakistans-defence-overhaul-strengthen-or-upset-its-military-balance)
- _Published: 2025-11-14 03:40:25+00:00_
- **Politics & Governance**
- <small>tags: `constitutional reform, military restructuring, civilian-military balance, Pakistan, nuclear command, Rule of Law, defense integration, political instability, India-Pakistan conflict, military power`</small>

### Summary

Pakistan has passed the 27th Constitutional Amendment, which radically overhauls the military command structure by granting lifetime immunity to top military leaders, creating a new Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) role held by the Chief of Army Staff (Field Marshal Asim Munir), and abolishing the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC). These changes significantly expand the army’s control over the air force and navy, formalize the army’s dominance in national strategic command—including nuclear affairs—and extend the tenure of the army chief to at least 2030. While proponents argue the reforms modernize defense coordination and improve strategic readiness, critics—including constitutional experts, former military officials, and analysts—warn that the changes institutionalize military supremacy, undermine civilian authority, and risk destabilizing the fragile civilian-military balance. The reforms follow Pakistan’s brief conflict with India in May 2025 and come amid political tensions, including accusations that the military orchestrated the removal of former Prime Minister Imran Khan and suppressed the PTI party.

### Key Takeaways
  - The 27th Constitutional Amendment grants lifetime immunity from criminal prosecution to top military leaders, significantly increasing their legal protection.
  - The creation of the Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) position, held concurrently by the Chief of Army Staff (COAS), consolidates army command over the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) and Pakistan Navy (PN).
  - The amendment abolishes the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) role, removing a historical balance point between the military branches.
  - The Commander of the National Strategic Command (CNSC) is now restricted to army officers, with oversight limited to the CDF and a maximum of six years, with possible extension.
  - Five-star ranks, previously honorary, are now constitutionally recognized with lifetime privileges and rank retention.
  - The military restructuring is seen by critics as a consolidation of power, not a modernization effort, undermining civilian-military balance and rule of law.
  - The reforms are viewed as politically motivated, especially in the context of the May 2025 conflict with India and the political challenges posed by the PTI and Imran Khan.
  - Supporters claim the changes improve coordination and modernize national defense for 21st-century hybrid warfare, but critics argue they deepen institutional imbalance.

- <small>tags: `nuclear weapons, U.S. nuclear policy, nuclear testing, noncritical tests, China nuclear build-up, arms control, Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, Trump administration, stockpile stewardship, global security, nuclear proliferation`</small>

### Summary

The article examines the controversy surrounding proposed U.S. nuclear tests, which Energy Secretary Chris Wright clarifies are noncritical and do not involve nuclear explosions. These 'system tests' focus on verifying the functionality of weapon components without detonating the warhead, aligning with existing scientific methods such as computer simulations and subcritical experiments. Despite President Donald Trump’s public call to restart nuclear weapon testing due to China’s expanding arsenal, experts stress that there is no credible evidence of current nuclear detonations by China, Russia, or Pakistan. The U.S. has maintained a 30-year moratorium on full nuclear testing since 1992, and officials including the National Nuclear Security Administration assert that the stockpile remains safe without explosive tests. Experts warn that resuming full nuclear explosive tests would trigger a global escalation, with Russia and China likely to follow, potentially undermining decades of arms control and increasing global nuclear risks. The article highlights the technical and geopolitical nuances of nuclear testing, emphasizing that noncritical tests are within established policy and science, while full testing would represent a major policy shift with profound global consequences.

### Key Takeaways
  - The U.S. is planning noncritical, nonexplosive nuclear tests involving only weapon components, not full detonations, as clarified by Energy Secretary Chris Wright.
  - These tests are described as 'system tests' and are intended to verify that new nuclear weapon designs are safer and more reliable than older models, without triggering nuclear chain reactions.
  - Experts like Georgia Cole from Chatham House emphasize that such noncritical or subcritical tests are within the bounds of existing scientific and policy frameworks, and do not constitute a return to full nuclear explosions.
  - President Donald Trump has publicly advocated for restarting nuclear testing, citing China’s rapid nuclear buildup and the actions of other nations, but there is no credible evidence that China, Russia, or Pakistan are currently conducting nuclear detonations.
  - The U.S. has maintained a 30-year moratorium on full nuclear testing since 1992, and officials including the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) assert that the stockpile remains safe and effective without explosive testing.
  - Resuming full nuclear explosive tests would significantly increase global nuclear risks and likely trigger retaliatory actions from other nuclear states, particularly Russia and China, potentially collapsing decades of arms control efforts.
  - The U.S. has conducted 1,032 nuclear tests historically, while other nuclear-armed states have ceased testing since the 1990s, with China being the only country to show consistent growth in its arsenal since 2023.
  - China’s nuclear arsenal is growing at about 100 warheads per year and is expected to reach 1,000 by 2030, according to Pentagon estimates.

The eSafety Commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, is evaluating the ban’s real-world effects on children’s sleep, activity, and social behavior. Critics argue that the ban may delay valuable learning and development. Internationally, France has launched a criminal investigation into TikTok, citing algorithmic risks of pushing minors into suicide-related content loops. TikTok has denied these allegations, calling them a political scapegoating. The ban marks a significant policy shift in digital regulation, with global implications for how children’s online exposure is managed.

### Key Takeaways
  - Australia is implementing a ban on children under 16 from accessing social media platforms including Reddit, Kick, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, and YouTube.
  - The ban is being driven by concerns over harmful design features such as opaque algorithms and endless scrolling that may negatively impact children’s mental health and development.
  - The eSafety Commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, is overseeing an evaluation of the ban’s real-world effects, including children’s sleep, physical activity, and social interaction patterns.
  - Failure to comply with the ban could result in civil fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars (US$32.1 million).
  - Critics argue that delaying children’s access to social media limits their ability to learn and grow, and that the ban may have unintended consequences.

### Summary

Nigeria has reversed its three-year policy of teaching primary school students in indigenous languages, reinstating English as the official medium of instruction from pre-primary through university. The decision, announced by Education Minister Tunji Alausa, is based on poor academic performance in national exams (WAEC, Neco, Jamb) in regions that adopted the mother-tongue approach. While supporters, including parents and global economic advocates, believe early English exposure improves global competitiveness, critics such as education expert Dr Aliyu Tilde and social analyst Habu Dauda argue that the policy was abandoned prematurely and that substantial investment in teacher training, curriculum development, and long-term implementation is needed before such a shift can succeed.

A large-scale police operation in Rio de Janeiro on 28 October 2025, targeting the powerful Comando Vermelho (CV) gang, resulted in 121 deaths, including four police officers.

Residents in targeted neighborhoods report no improvement in safety or daily life, with armed presence and gang control persisting. Rights groups and academics have labeled the operation a 'massacre' and failure, citing its brutality and ineffectiveness. The Brazilian public prosecutor's office initiated the operation due to rising gang violence, but federal President Lula has ordered a national investigation, while the governor maintains his stance, claiming continued resistance from law-abiding citizens.

### Summary

Since President Donald Trump's re-election in early 2025, Canadians have significantly reduced their travel to the United States in protest of his trade policies, including 35% tariffs on Canadian goods and public statements suggesting Canada should become the '51st state'. This boycott, exemplified by individuals like Kristy Gammon from Nova Scotia, has led to a 24% drop in air travel and over 30% decline in car travel from Canada to the US, contributing to a 3.2% drop in US international spending. Despite efforts by US destinations like Kalispell, Montana, to lure back Canadian tourists through a 'Canadian Welcome Pass', the trend shows no signs of slowing. Meanwhile, Canada's domestic tourism industry has benefited, with record revenue of C$59 billion from May to August 2025, driven by increased domestic travel. Canadian snowbirds and retirees are also staying home, with a 66% drop in plans to visit the US, and some even selling their Florida homes. Future global events like the 2026 FIFA World Cup and the 2028 Summer Olympics may eventually offset the shortfall, but for now, the boycott remains a significant political and economic phenomenon between Canada and the United States.

## US tariffs on coffee and bananas to ease under new trade deals - <small>`bbc`</small>

- [source](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg7jm046e4o)

- <small>tags: `US trade policy, tariff reductions, coffee prices, banana exports, Latin American trade deals, beef market access, economic affordability, political pressure, global trade negotiations, severe weather impact, Donald Trump administration`</small>

### Summary

The Trump administration has announced a temporary easing of import taxes on coffee and bananas from four Latin American countries — Argentina, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Ecuador — as part of reciprocal trade agreements designed to address rising consumer prices and political pressure following poor election performance. While a 10% tariff remains on goods from Guatemala, Argentina, and El Salvador, and a 15% tariff on Ecuador, coffee and other goods that cannot be produced in the US are exempted. The deals also include expanded market access for beef between the US and Argentina. The administration attributes price increases to both supply disruptions from severe weather and trade policies, and believes that reduced tariffs could eventually lower consumer prices through retail passes. These agreements follow earlier sweeping tariffs introduced in April, which were paused amid global financial instability and later replaced with negotiated deals, reflecting a recalibration of US trade policy under mounting economic and political pressure.

## Israel receives body Hamas says belongs to hostage - <small>`bbc`</small>

### Summary

Israel has confirmed receiving a body from Hamas, which claims it belongs to a missing Israeli hostage, marking progress in the first phase of a ceasefire deal brokered by the United States. The body was collected by Red Cross vehicles in the Khan Younis area of southern Gaza. This would bring the total number of returned deceased hostages to 25 out of 28, fulfilling a key condition of the agreement. However, due to the lack of DNA testing in Gaza, identifying the remains of Palestinians is extremely difficult. Israel has accused Hamas of delaying recovery, while Hamas claims it is struggling to locate bodies under rubble.

## Bihar election: Vote counting under way in state where Modi's party faces key test - <small>`bbc`</small>

### Summary

In Bihar, India, vote counting has begun following a historic election with a record 66.91% voter turnout, including a historic 71.6% female participation. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is hoping to return to power after a controversial revision of electoral rolls that removed 4.7 million names, a move opposed by the opposition which claims it excludes genuine voters—especially Muslims. The BJP and JD(U) alliance is facing a key test, as the state has not yet seen a BJP-led government on its own. Political figures like Nitish Kumar and Lalu Prasad Yadav, both in their 70s and central to Bihar's 40-year political legacy, are at risk of losing power. A new political party led by Prashant Kishor enters the fray, signaling a shift in dynamics. The results are expected by evening, and this election is seen as a precursor to upcoming state elections in West Bengal, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu, where the BJP faces significant challenges.

### Key Takeaways
  - Bihar's election in 2025 marks a pivotal moment for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's BJP, as it is a key test of the party's ability to form a government without relying on alliances.
  - A record voter turnout of 66.91% was achieved, the highest since 1951, reflecting increased political engagement and participation.
  - Women's voter turnout reached a historical high of 71.6%, indicating a significant shift in political participation and the growing influence of female voters.
  - A controversial revision of electoral rolls by the Election Commission removed 4.7 million names, sparking opposition allegations of voter exclusion—particularly among Muslims—though the BJP and EC deny these claims.
  - The Bihar election is a critical precursor to upcoming state elections in West Bengal, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu, where the BJP faces significant challenges in gaining ground.

A U.S. lawyer, Dan Kovalik, has been hired to file a legal claim arguing the killings are unlawful. The incident has led to a diplomatic rift, with Colombia suspending intelligence sharing with the U.S., and has caused widespread fear among local fishermen, disrupting the fishing industry. Mangled bodies have also washed ashore in Trinidad and Tobago, underscoring the human toll of the strikes.

- **Politics & Governance**
- <small>tags: `Pardon Power, Executive Branch Abuse, Trump Pardons, Political Loyalty, Democratic Accountability, Historical Precedents, Constitutional Reform, Capitol Attack, Criminal Justice, Political Culture`</small>

### Summary

The article highlights a troubling pattern in which individuals with criminal convictions — including sexual assault, threats against elected officials, financial fraud, and deadly force — received pardons from President Trump, despite lacking evidence of innocence or just cause. These pardons are seen not as acts of justice, but as rewards for political loyalty or personal connections. The piece draws on historical precedents, such as Andrew Johnson's pardons of Confederates, to warn that unchecked executive power undermines democratic accountability. It argues that the pardon power, as currently granted, enables presidents to shield allies from justice and protect acts of sedition, especially after the 2020 Capitol attack. The article calls for constitutional reform, suggesting a supermajority requirement (two-thirds of the Senate) for pardons to prevent abuse and restore public trust. It also critiques the broader culture of political extremism and the rise of right-wing influencers who prioritize personal loyalty over democratic norms, warning that without reform, future generations may face an imperial presidency that operates beyond the reach of the law.

### Key Takeaways
  - President Trump has granted pardons to individuals who have since committed serious crimes or engaged in acts of sedition, raising concerns about abuse of executive power.
  - The pardons are not based on innocence, justice, or public interest, but rather on personal connections, political loyalty, or financial benefit to Trump or his allies.
  - The article draws historical parallels to Andrew Johnson’s blanket pardons of Confederates, which enabled the return of former slaveholders to power and contributed to systemic repression of Black Americans.
  - Historical figures like George Mason and the Anti-Federalists warned that unchecked pardon power could lead to monarchy and the destruction of the republic.
  - The pardon power is seen as a threat to democratic norms, especially when used to protect allies who committed crimes against democracy, such as sedition or electoral subversion.
  - The article calls for constitutional reform — specifically, an amendment requiring a two-thirds Senate supermajority to grant pardons — to prevent abuse and restore accountability.
  - Public disgust at presidential pardon abuse is bipartisan, with both Democrats and Republicans criticizing recent pardons by Biden and Trump.

- <small>tags: `Hitler, DNA analysis, Kallmann syndrome, genetic research, history, science ethics, polygenic risk score, ancient DNA, historical figures, medical conditions, military history, scientific controversy`</small>

### Summary

A new documentary titled 'Hitler’s DNA: Blueprint of a Dictator' reveals that researchers led by geneticist Turi King have sequenced DNA from a bloodstained fabric taken from Hitler’s bunker in 1945. The DNA analysis suggests Hitler had a mutation in the PROK2 gene linked to Kallmann syndrome, a condition that can delay puberty and cause undescended testicles. The study also refutes rumors of Jewish ancestry through Y-chromosome DNA matching with a known male-line relative. A polygenic risk score indicates a higher-than-average predisposition to schizophrenia, ADHD, and autism—but experts emphasize these are not diagnostic and do not imply violent behavior. Despite the scientific claims, the research has not undergone peer review or formal publication, raising concerns about validity and ethics. Experts caution against stigmatizing individuals with these genetic conditions and stress that Hitler’s genetics is a 'small, small puzzle piece' in understanding his complex historical and behavioral profile.

### Summary

The U.S. minted its final penny on November 12, 2025, in Philadelphia, marking the end of a 238-year tradition. The decision, initiated by President Donald Trump in February 2025, was based on the penny's high production cost—nearly four cents per coin—compared to its one-cent value. Although the penny remains legal tender, its discontinuation has caused significant logistical, legal, and financial challenges for retailers and consumers. Many businesses, including Kwik Trip, now round prices to the nearest nickel, leading to increased costs and potential violations of state and federal laws requiring exact change. The absence of a comprehensive national policy mirrors the lack of planning seen in other countries that phased out low-value coins. Pro-penny advocates argue that the transition has been chaotic, with no clear solutions in place, especially for vulnerable groups like SNAP recipients who require precise pricing. The penny, originally designed by Benjamin Franklin and redesigned in 1909 to feature Abraham Lincoln, holds deep historical and sentimental value, though its practical use has declined substantially.

## Black Soldiers in WWII Removed from U.S. Military Cemetery Spark Controversy - <small>`cnn`</small>

- <small>tags: `World War II, African American soldiers, Military history, Racial discrimination, Historical erasure, Museum exhibits, Cemetery memorialization, Dutch-American relations, Civil rights, World War II history`</small>

### Summary

In the winter of 1944, Black U.S. soldiers, including 1st Lt. Jefferson Wiggins, were assigned to bury American dead in Margraten, Netherlands, during World War II, despite facing racial discrimination and being restricted to non-combat roles. A commemorative panel highlighting their contributions was installed in 2024 at the cemetery’s visitor center, which is operated by the American Battle Monuments Commission (ABMC). In March 2025, the panel was removed following an internal review led by former ABMC Secretary Charles Djou, with the agency stating it was outside the scope of their commemorative mission. The removal sparked outrage from local Dutch officials, including the mayor of Eijsden-Margraten and the Limburg Province government, who argue the panels were intended to be permanent and represent a vital part of history. Janice Wiggins, Wiggins’ widow, emphasized that the panel was a personal mission to ensure Black soldiers' sacrifices were not forgotten, particularly given the 1973 fire that destroyed many military records. The controversy highlights broader issues of racial erasure in U.S. military history and the importance of inclusive memorialization in post-war remembrance.

Despite being recognized as a competitive sport since 1992, escaramuza remains marginalized compared to the national male sport charrería. Women in the sport face internalized misogyny, such as the belief that women are more valuable when quiet or passive, and many are undocumented immigrants who support each other through financial and social interdependence. The work includes poetic narratives by Mexican-American writers Ire’ne Lara Silva and Angelina Sáenz, highlighting emotional and feminist struggles. The cultural influence of escaramuza is evident in fashion — including Dior’s Maria Grazia Chiuri and Vogue’s feature of Kendall Jenner and Gigi Hadid — signaling its growing visibility. Ultimately, the article celebrates the resilience, sisterhood, and future-oriented vision of the women, who see the sport as a way to inspire the next generation of girls to believe that women can ride horses.

### Summary

In South Korea, the annual Suneung (College Scholastic Ability Test) is a high-stakes exam that determines university admission and future life outcomes. While most students take an eight-hour exam, blind students with severe visual impairments are granted a 1.7 times longer duration — up to 13 hours — due to the need to read braille test materials, which are six to nine times thicker than standard versions. Students like Han Donghyun and Oh Jeong-won face immense physical and cognitive challenges, including fatigue, memory overload, and lack of access to timely braille study materials such as EBS textbooks, which are often delayed by months. Despite these barriers, students emphasize perseverance and resilience as key traits developed through their preparation. The Korean Blind Union has called for systemic change, including a constitutional petition to improve accessibility, highlighting a critical gap in educational equity.

### Key Takeaways
  - The Suneung exam in South Korea is a critical determinant of university admission, job prospects, income, and social outcomes, affecting millions of students annually.

  - Students rely on screen-reading computers and braille notetakers (like Hansone) to manage complex subjects such as Korean language and mathematics, requiring strong memory and focus.
  - A major barrier is the delayed availability of braille versions of core exam preparation materials, such as EBS textbooks, which are released months after sighted students receive their materials.
  - Blind students often have to manually convert textbooks into braille or audio, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming, creating significant educational disparities.
  - Despite these challenges, students like Han Donghyun and Oh Jeong-won emphasize that the exam represents a test of perseverance and personal resilience, not just academic ability.
  - The Korean Blind Union has formally raised concerns with authorities and plans to file a constitutional petition demanding better accessibility to educational materials for blind students.
