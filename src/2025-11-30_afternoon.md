### Summary

Black Friday retail sales in the US rose 4.1% over last year, with online spending increasing 9.1% to $11.8 billion, driven by value-driven consumer choices and major online discounts. However, inflation and rising prices—especially in groceries, rent, and heating—mean real spending may be stagnant. The economy is bifurcated: high-income consumers benefit from stock and home appreciation and continue spending, while lower-income consumers are cutting back due to financial stress and cost-of-living pressures. This reflects a 'K-shaped economy,' where wealthier individuals spend freely while others live paycheck to paycheck. Consumer sentiment is cautious, with 85% expecting higher prices due to tariffs, and retailers like Walmart, TJ Maxx, and Gap benefiting from value-driven demand, while Target and Bath & Body Works struggle. Despite economic headwinds, overall holiday spending is projected to reach a record $1 trillion, with strong growth expected through Cyber Monday and the holiday season.

### Summary

A potential 107% tariff on Italian pasta from 13 major producers—stemming from an antidumping complaint by American companies—could drastically raise prices for U.S. consumers. The U.S. Commerce Department found that two key Italian companies, La Molisana and Pastificio Lucio Garofalo, sold pasta below normal value and were uncooperative during investigation, leading to an 'adverse facts available' tariff. This would compound with existing 15% EU tariffs, pushing total rates to 107%. Italian farming body Coldiretti warns that exports could be 'virtually wiped out,' impacting 16% of Italian pasta exports to the U.S. While the tariffs were not directly driven by President Trump, who generally avoids involvement in such cases, they face political pressure due to affordability concerns. Consumers, including Greg Bettinelli and Costanza Zerbi, are reacting by seeking homemade alternatives, highlighting the cultural and economic significance of Italian pasta in American households.

## Could This Finally Be Sears’ Last Black Friday? - <small>`cnn`</small>

### Summary

The article explores the potential end of Sears, once America’s largest retailer, as it may close its final stores by the next holiday season. After a 20-year decline, Sears now operates only five stores—four in malls owned by Simon Property Group and one in Coral Gables, Florida, which may be torn down for housing development. Experts say the remaining stores are unprofitable and essentially symbolic, with no viable retail operations. The company’s decline is attributed to poor management under hedge fund operator Eddie Lampert, who prioritized financial maneuvers over retail innovation. Sears’ legacy includes pioneering the mail-order catalog, creating iconic brands like Kenmore, Craftsman, and Die-Hard, and helping shape American suburban life. The rise of Walmart, Home Depot, and online shopping, coupled with Sears’ failure to modernize, led to its downfall. Its potential closure marks the end of a 130-year retail empire that once defined American consumer culture.

## Israel Gaza war: Why I spend hours painstakingly repairing banknotes - <small>`bbc`</small>

### Summary

Following the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel, a devastating war erupted, destroying banks in Gaza, halting cash transfers, and looting vaults. This has led to a severe economic collapse, with over 80% of Gazans unemployed and widespread poverty. With no functional ATMs or digital banking access, people rely on informal money merchants who charge exorbitant fees—up to 50%—to convert digital transfers into cash. Trust in physical banknotes is eroded due to damage and theft, prompting a surge in demand for repair services like those offered by Baraa Abu al-Aoun. The Palestine Monetary Authority has responded by launching e-wallets and digital payment systems, which are now used by over 500,000 Gazans. Humanitarian agencies such as Unicef and the World Food Programme distribute cash directly to vulnerable populations, ensuring food and essential items are purchased. Despite a ceasefire, financial systems remain unstable, and civilians continue to face dire shortages. The article underscores how war has disrupted not just physical infrastructure but also the fundamental economic and social fabric of Gaza, leaving people in a state of survival rather than stability.

### Summary

A massive bio-bead spill in southern England, resulting from a mechanical failure at a Southern Water wastewater treatment plant, has devastated coastal environments, particularly the Rye Harbour Nature Reserve. Millions of inert plastic pellets—used to aid bacterial breakdown in water treatment—have washed ashore, where they are mistaken for natural seeds and ingested by wildlife, including rare birds. The spill, which occurred after a failure on October 29, 2025, has sparked massive public volunteer clean-up efforts and raised serious concerns about long-term ecological and human health risks due to potential chemical leaching, especially from legacy heavy metals and persistent pollutants like PFAS. Experts describe the incident as an 'oil spill in solid form' due to its environmental toxicity and persistence. Similar incidents have occurred in the past, including in 2010 and 2017, and bio-beads have now been found in France and Belgium, indicating a broader European crisis. The Environmental Investigation Agency and regulators like the Environment Agency are pushing for systemic change, advocating for the replacement of plastic bio-beads with natural, non-toxic alternatives such as sand or pumice. Southern Water has acknowledged responsibility and is reviewing its use of bio-beads, but environmentalists stress that urgent regulatory and policy reforms are needed to prevent future disasters.

### Key Takeaways
  - An estimated 10 tons (650 million bio-beads) of plastic pellets escaped from a wastewater treatment plant in southern England, creating one of the UK's worst environmental disasters in years.
  - The bio-beads, used in wastewater treatment to grow bacteria that break down pollutants, have been found to leach toxins or absorb pollutants like PFAS (‘forever chemicals’) during their journey through the ocean, raising concerns about bioaccumulation in marine life and human food chains.
  - The spill has caused widespread ecological damage, particularly in the Rye Harbour Nature Reserve, a critical habitat for rare birds and endangered species, where the beads resemble seeds and pose a serious ingestion risk.
  - Volunteers and clean-up crews have been mobilized in large numbers, with up to 100 people per day participating in beach cleanups, highlighting public concern and civic engagement.

Despite the elevated raw water levels, treatment processes bring PFAS concentrations below federal safety limits, ensuring public safety. The EPA finalized new PFAS regulations in 2024, with enforcement starting in 2029, but Trump-appointed EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has proposed limiting enforcement to only two PFAS types. Chemours has been found to exceed pollution permits repeatedly, prompting a lawsuit by the West Virginia Rivers Coalition and a federal court order to immediately cease over-pollution. Environmental advocates stress that source protection is more effective and affordable than treating PFAS after contamination. Louisville Water is investing $23 million to upgrade its water treatment system to remove PFAS, highlighting the growing financial and technical challenges for utilities nationwide.

### Key Takeaways

### Summary

Tehran and other Iranian cities are facing a severe smog crisis as the government continues to burn mazut, a highly polluting form of petroleum, to generate electricity due to chronic shortages of natural gas and aging infrastructure. This practice, ongoing under President Masoud Pezeshkian and Energy Minister Abbas Aliabadi, has led to dangerously high PM2.5 levels—exceeding 200 on pollution indexes—resulting in thousands of premature deaths and $17.2 billion in economic and health costs. The Iranian Meteorological Organization has issued health warnings, with schools and offices closed in multiple cities. Despite previous efforts to reduce mazut use, the policy persists due to energy insecurity. Additionally, wildfires in northern forests threaten the UNESCO-listed Hyrcanian forests, underscoring the broader environmental and public health crisis in Iran.

### Key Takeaways
  - Tehran and other Iranian cities are experiencing severe smog due to the continued burning of mazut, a highly polluting fuel high in sulfur and impurities.
  - Iran has the world's second-largest natural gas reserves and third-largest crude oil reserves, yet it continues to rely on dirty fuel due to chronic mismanagement and aging infrastructure.
  - The air pollution index in Tehran reached over 200, classifying the air as 'very unhealthy', with high levels of PM2.5 particles causing respiratory and cardiovascular harm, especially among children, elderly, and those with preexisting conditions.
  - A massive 21 million liters of mazut are burned daily, with energy minister Abbas Aliabadi confirming that mazut is used as a last resort due to its value and scarcity of natural gas.
  - The government has acknowledged 58,975 deaths from PM2.5 exposure between January and March 2025, equating to 161 deaths per day, and estimated total pollution-related costs at $17.2 billion.
  - Health warnings were issued by the Iran Meteorological Organization for Tehran, Karaj, Arak, Isfahan, Tabriz, Mashhad, Ahvaz, and Urmia, with schools and offices shut down in multiple cities.

### Summary

A devastating fire broke out at the Wang Fuk Court public housing complex in Hong Kong’s Tai Po neighborhood on November 26, 2025, starting at Wang Cheong House.

## When it makes sense to help your adult kids financially — and when it doesn’t - <small>`cnn`</small>

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/30/business/making-financial-gifts-to-adult-children-grandchildren)
- _Published: 2025-11-30 05:00:00Z_
- **Health & Public Safety**
- <small>tags: `family finance, parenting, financial planning, estate planning, gift tax, adult children, financial independence, tax law, trusts, parental support, life-stage decisions`</small>

### Summary

This CNN article by Jeanne Sahadi offers parents practical, emotionally intelligent guidance on whether and how to financially assist their adult children. It emphasizes that while supporting family is important, financial decisions must be balanced with personal economic stability. The article outlines four key considerations: affordability, fairness across siblings, timing of gifts (during life vs. after death), and the risks of reinforcing bad financial habits. It highlights that direct payments for education or medical expenses are tax-free and do not count as gifts, while larger gifts or trust structures can offer long-term protection and alignment with parental values. Experts from the Schwab Center and Plante Moran provide insights into tax rules, emotional value, and ethical support, helping parents navigate complex decisions without creating dependency.

### Key Takeaways
  - Parents should consider their own financial capacity before offering help to adult children.
  - Gifting during lifetime may provide greater impact than post-death transfers due to inflation and timing of need.
  - Support should be aligned with parental values — such as education — and can be personalized through notes or trust structures.
  - Helping a child in financial hardship due to medical debt or disability may be appropriate, but bailing out of bad habits could reinforce dependency.
  - Direct payment of medical or educational expenses is not considered a gift, offering a tax-efficient and ethical way to assist.
  - Annual gift tax exclusion is $19,000 per person (up to $38,000 with a spouse), which can be used to give money without triggering gift tax or lifetime exemption limits.
  - Establishing a trust can protect assets, especially if the child has creditors, is in a bad marriage, or has special needs, allowing parents to retain control over funds.

## FDA Official Plans to Change Vaccine Approval Process, Claiming That Covid-19 Shots Caused Child Deaths - <small>`cnn`</small>

- <small>tags: `vaccine safety, FDA policy, Covid-19 vaccines, public health, anti-vaccine movement, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., children’s health, hepatitis B, pneumonia vaccine, flu vaccine, regulatory reform`</small>

### Summary

Dr. Vinay Prasad, the FDA’s chief medical officer, has announced plans to overhaul the agency’s vaccine approval process, claiming that 10 children died as a result of Covid-19 vaccinations and that the vaccines were administered under mandatory school and work policies despite minimal risk to children. Citing a preliminary analysis of 96 deaths, Prasad argues that the risks of vaccination are comparable to those of other respiratory viruses, and he proposes stricter safety standards, including requiring proof of disease reduction for pneumonia vaccines and more rigorous evaluation for vaccines used in pregnant women and the flu vaccine. These changes are aligned with the long-standing anti-vaccine agenda of HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has disbanded CDC advisory bodies and promoted false claims linking vaccines to autism. The CDC’s advisory panel is now considering delaying the first hepatitis B vaccine for infants, despite no new evidence of risk. The proposed reforms could significantly slow vaccine development and approval timelines, raising concerns about public health preparedness and scientific integrity.

### Summary

Measles cases are surging globally, threatening to reverse decades of progress toward elimination, as the World Health Organization reports that only 59 countries reported large or disruptive outbreaks in 2024—nearly triple the number in 2021. Despite an 88% drop in measles-related deaths from 2000 to 2024 and the achievement of elimination in countries like Cabo Verde, Seychelles, and Mauritius, global vaccination coverage remains below the 95% threshold required to stop transmission. A quarter of outbreaks are occurring in previously measles-free countries, including Canada and the United States, which have recently lost their elimination status. The U.S. recorded 1,798 confirmed measles cases in 2025—the highest since 2000—highlighting a major public health setback. The root causes include declining immunization rates, pandemic-related disruptions, misinformation, and a lack of routine health systems, including trained workforce and surveillance. The WHO warns that deep funding cuts to the Global Measles and Rubella Laboratory Network and reduced domestic support for immunization are jeopardizing progress and making measles elimination a 'distant goal'.

### Summary

During a federal government shutdown in November 2025, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) faced significant disruption, leaving millions of Americans, especially Indigenous communities, at risk of food insecurity. While SNAP was eventually restored, many Native Americans—over 60% of whom rely on food assistance as their primary source—struggled to access food. Tribal nations like the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes, the Blackfeet Nation, and the Fort Belknap Reservation responded by launching emergency food aid, including slaughtering livestock and redirecting grant funds. However, tribal programs are not reimbursed for these extra costs, creating long-term financial strain. Individuals like Mary Lefthand, who switched to tribal commodity programs for stability, face bureaucratic hurdles to re-enroll in SNAP. Experts warn that the disruption led to severe financial consequences, such as skipping rent, medications, or facing eviction, underscoring the vulnerability of Indigenous food systems and the need for sustainable, adequately funded support programs.

- <small>tags: `hormonal contraception, breast cancer risk, public health misinformation, social media, reproductive health, scientific nuance, shared decision-making, women's health, JAMA Oncology, Sweden, desogestrel, copper IUD, medical research, patient counseling`</small>

### Summary

A large-scale Swedish study tracking over 2 million women under age 50 found that hormonal birth control remains safe overall, with only small, short-term increases in breast cancer risk — particularly during active use and fading within five to ten years after stopping. The study found a modest 24% higher rate of breast cancer in users, translating to about one extra case per 7,800 users annually, and noted higher risk with certain progestins like desogestrel, while lower risk was seen with medroxyprogesterone acetate, drospirenone, and levonorgestrel. However, the study included both invasive and non-invasive (in situ) tumors, potentially inflating the perceived risk. Experts caution that context is vital, especially given how social media often distorts such nuanced findings into fear-based narratives. Despite this, doctors stress that current advice remains unchanged: hormonal birth control is safe, effective, and offers significant health benefits, including reduced risk of ovarian and uterine cancers and relief from period pain. Alternative methods like the copper IUD are available for women preferring hormone-free options. The article underscores the need for accurate, patient-centered communication in reproductive health, especially in an era where misinformation spreads rapidly online.

### Key Takeaways
  - Hormonal contraception remains safe overall, with only small, transient increases in breast cancer risk, particularly in current or recent users.
  - The increased risk is modest: about 13 extra cases per 100,000 women per year, translating to one extra case per 7,800 users annually.
  - Risk is highest during active use and declines within five to ten years after discontinuation.
  - Certain progestins, such as desogestrel (in brands like Cyred EQ, Reclipsen, Azurette, Pimtrea), are associated with slightly higher risk, while others like medroxyprogesterone acetate (Depo-Provera), drospirenone, and levonorgestrel are linked to lower risk.
  - The study includes both invasive and non-invasive (in situ) breast cancers, which may inflate the apparent risk; experts caution that only invasive cases should be used to assess clinical significance.
  - Social media often distorts nuanced scientific findings by highlighting a single alarming statistic (e.g., 24% higher risk) without context, leading to fear and misinformation.
  - Doctors and reproductive health experts emphasize that hormonal birth control is safe, effective, and beneficial — offering relief from heavy periods, endometriosis pain, and reduced risk of ovarian and uterine cancers.
  - Alternative methods like copper IUDs offer safe, long-term, hormone-free options for women seeking non-hormonal contraception.
  - Patients should engage in shared decision-making with healthcare providers, weighing personal values, medical history, and reproductive goals.

- <small>tags: `measles outbreak, vaccination rates, vaccine hesitancy, public health crisis, Canada, United States, Americas region, MMR vaccine, anti-vaccine misinformation, herd immunity, global health`</small>

### Summary

Canada has lost its measles elimination status after a large, multi-jurisdictional outbreak began in October 2024, with over 5,000 cases and two deaths reported across provinces. This outbreak, part of a broader regional crisis, caused the entire Americas region to lose its elimination status, with PAHO reporting a 30-fold increase in cases and 28 deaths across the region. The primary driver is declining vaccination rates, including a drop in Canada from 89.5% to 82.5% between 2019 and 2023. Misinformation, such as the discredited link between the MMR vaccine and autism, and growing vaccine hesitancy—especially post-COVID-19—have fueled low uptake. Communities like the Mennonites, with low vaccination rates, have acted as hotspots for outbreaks. The U.S. faces a similar crisis, with over 1,600 cases and a deadline to prove outbreak control, while the UK and Western Australia also report rising cases. Experts emphasize that the situation is reversible through political commitment, regional cooperation, and sustained vaccination programs. This crisis underscores the global fragility of public health gains in the face of misinformation and declining immunization.

### Summary

The article highlights the growing trend of healthy individuals—such as Gabriela, a Brazilian lawyer, and Andrew, a UK-based food company executive—using weight-loss injections like Ozempic, Wegovy, and Mounjaro for cosmetic purposes without medical necessity, prescriptions, or clinical supervision.

Medical professionals emphasize that these drugs are approved only for treating conditions like diabetes and obesity, not for aesthetic goals. The UK and Brazil have responded by tightening regulations on online pharmacies, reflecting growing concerns about safety, misuse, and long-term health impacts. Experts stress that the drugs are designed for consistent, supervised use and that irregular or off-label use undermines both health outcomes and scientific understanding of their effects.

## A blue schoolbag in a mass grave. Sri Lanka’s bloody past is re-emerging from the soil - <small>`cnn`</small>

### Summary

The article details the discovery of over 240 human skeletal remains, including children, at the Chemmani mass gravesite in Sri Lanka’s Jaffna district, reigniting long-standing allegations of wartime atrocities during the 1983–2009 civil war. The bodies, found buried in shallow graves without clothing, suggest unlawful and extrajudicial killings, with evidence such as a blue schoolbag and baby’s milk bottle indicating civilian victims. These discoveries follow a 1998 confession by a Sri Lankan soldier and have reignited demands from Tamil families for justice, accountability, and truth. Despite promises from the current government to establish a truth and reconciliation commission, domestic investigations—such as the Office on Missing Persons (OMP)—have failed to deliver results, with only 23 of over 23,000 cases resolved. The article highlights the trauma of victims’ families, including Sivapatham Elangkothai and Mary Ranjini Nirmalanathan, who have led sustained protests. International bodies like the UN and Amnesty International have underscored the scale of disappearances, and the Sri Lankan government has resisted international oversight, citing domestic processes. Journalist Kumanan Kanapathipillai, who reported on the discovery, has faced accusations of terrorism, raising concerns about media suppression. The article concludes that while the discovery of the graves offers a path to truth, the lack of accountability and persistent political resistance to international scrutiny undermines the possibility of justice for victims and their families.

### Key Takeaways
  - The discovery of over 240 human skeletal remains, including children and infants, at the Chemmani mass grave in Sri Lanka’s Jaffna district has reignited long-standing allegations of wartime atrocities and cover-ups during the 1983–2009 civil war.
  - The bodies were buried naked in shallow graves, suggesting unlawful and extrajudicial killings, which contradicts traditional Hindu burial practices and points to state or paramilitary involvement.
  - A blue schoolbag, a baby’s milk bottle, and bangles found with the remains indicate the victims were civilians, likely children or young people, and not combatants.
  - The victims were mostly from the ethnic Tamil minority, who were targeted during the conflict, and families have been demanding answers for over 30 years.
  - Despite multiple investigations and commissions, such as the Office on Missing Persons (OMP), only 23 of over 23,000 missing persons cases have been resolved, undermining public trust in domestic accountability mechanisms.
  - International organizations, including the UN and Amnesty International, have attributed many disappearances to Sri Lankan security forces and affiliated paramilitary groups.
  - Mothers and community leaders continue to protest, demanding independent international oversight and justice, citing harassment and intimidation by authorities.
  - Sri Lankan officials, including Foreign Minister Vijitha Herath, have refused calls for international investigation, asserting that accountability should be handled through domestic processes, which critics say are ineffective and politicized.

### Summary

A deadly fire in the Wang Fuk Court apartment complex in Hong Kong’s Tai Po neighborhood killed 128 people and left up to 200 still missing. The blaze, which began in Wang Cheong House, Block 6, rapidly spread due to flammable bamboo scaffolding, green mesh netting, and polystyrene boards that ignited and caused windows to shatter, spreading the fire indoors. Fire alarms in all eight buildings were found non-functional, raising serious concerns about safety compliance. Authorities arrested eight people, including project managers and subcontractors, over alleged negligence in fire safety and maintenance. Three construction workers were earlier arrested and granted bail. The government has provided financial aid to affected families, and consular support is being coordinated for foreign domestic helpers. The investigation into the fire’s cause is ongoing and expected to last three to four weeks.

## Nigeria's kidnapping crisis: 'Too scared to speak' - villagers on living in the midst of bandits - <small>`bbc`</small>

### Summary

A wave of school kidnappings across Nigeria, including 300+ students in Papiri, Niger state, and separate incidents in Borno and Kebbi states, has sparked a national crisis. The abductions are primarily carried out by criminal bandit gangs composed of ethnic Fulani herders, and in some cases by jihadist groups like Iswap. Parents remain silent due to fear of reprisal, and many communities suffer from long-term insecurity. In response, rural areas like Jibia and Kurfi in Katsina state have initiated peace deals with bandits, leading to the release of hostages and the re-opening of schools. These negotiations, driven by mutual exhaustion and economic hardship, show a shift from armed conflict to coexistence. However, experts caution that such deals may only shift insecurity southward, where better-off communities can afford ransoms. While there is no confirmed link between the attacks and Donald Trump’s threats, experts emphasize that kidnappings are primarily profit-driven. A dual strategy combining military force and peace negotiations is seen as essential for long-term solutions.

### Key Takeaways
  - Mass abductions of schoolchildren in Nigeria, especially in rural and remote areas, are a growing humanitarian crisis, with over 300 students reportedly taken in the Papiri school incident.
  - The kidnappings are often carried out by criminal gangs known as 'bandits', composed largely of ethnic Fulani herders, and sometimes linked to jihadist groups such as Islamic State of West Africa (Iswap).
  - Parents are deeply traumatized and fearful of speaking to authorities due to threats of reprisal, with many refusing to engage in discussions or media interviews.
  - Peace deals have emerged in areas like Jibia and Kurfi, Katsina state, where bandit leaders and local communities have negotiated for safety, access to resources, and the release of captives.
  - The traditional profit motive of ransom payments has led to kidnappings, though paying ransoms is illegal in Nigeria; in practice, communities often fund or negotiate releases.
  - The lack of effective policing and rural insecurity has led to the development of informal peace agreements, which may reduce violence in some areas but shift it to more profitable regions in the south.
  - There is no confirmed link between the recent attacks and Donald Trump's threats of military intervention, as experts emphasize profit-driven motives over ideological ones.
  - Experts stress a dual approach to solving the crisis: military action combined with negotiated peace deals to address root causes such as poverty, lack of access to markets, and insecure livelihoods.

### Summary

Brian Walshe, a real estate manager and father of three, is on trial in Dedham, Massachusetts for the first-degree murder of his wife, Ana Walshe, who disappeared in December 2022. After pleading guilty to lesser charges—illegally disposing of her body and misleading police—Walshe still faces a life sentence if convicted of murder. The prosecution argues he planned the killing, citing Google searches on how to dispose of a body and items with both spouses’ DNA found in a dumpster. A key motive includes financial gain from life insurance and an alleged affair with a man in Washington, DC. Walshe’s defense may rely on him testifying, though credibility is questionable due to lack of corroboration. The trial, delayed due to a mental health evaluation after a jail stabbing, is expected to last two to three weeks and is being held in a courthouse with a history of high-profile cases like Karen Read’s. Jurors are restricted from media exposure to ensure impartiality.

### Key Takeaways
  - Brian Walshe is on trial for the first-degree murder of his wife, Ana Walshe, nearly three years after her disappearance.
  - Walshe pleaded guilty to lesser charges—illegally disposing of a human body and misleading police—without admitting to murder, which means he still faces a life sentence if convicted of first-degree murder.
  - A key piece of evidence is that Walshe conducted Google searches on the morning of January 1, 2023, including how to dispose of a body and remove blood from floors, suggesting premeditation or intent.
  - Items with Brian and Ana Walshe’s blood and DNA were found in a dumpster and at their home, supporting claims of a body disposal.
  - Prosecutors allege a financial motive: Walshe may have wanted to benefit from life insurance policies after his wife’s death, tied to his prior federal fraud conviction.
  - An ongoing extramarital affair between Ana and a man in Washington, DC, is cited as a motive, with evidence showing Walshe Googled the man days before her disappearance.
  - Walshe’s defense may rely on him testifying to explain his actions, but this is challenged by lack of corroboration and potential credibility issues.
  - The trial is scheduled to begin in late November 2025 and may last two to three weeks; it was delayed due to a mental health evaluation after a stabbing in jail.
  - The defense argues for a fair trial in light of media coverage, but the judge denied a request to move the trial to another jurisdiction.
  - Jury members were instructed to avoid media and social media to prevent exposure, similar to the high-profile Karen Read case.
  - If convicted of first-degree murder, Walshe would face life without parole; a conviction on a lesser charge could result in up to 50 years.
  - Walshe is already serving a 37-month federal sentence for art fraud, which runs concurrently with his state sentence.

The case has had a profound national impact, shifting how American families supervise their children and leading to the creation of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.

## U.S. Military Carries Out Second Strike Killing Survivors on Suspected Drug Boat - <small>`cnn`</small>

### Summary

The U.S. military conducted a follow-up strike on a suspected drug boat in the Caribbean on September 2, 2025, after an initial attack failed to eliminate all on board. The second strike killed the remaining crew, bringing the total death toll to 11, and sank the vessel. While the administration claims the operation is lawful under the Law of Armed Conflict and that drug traffickers are combatants, legal experts, including former Pentagon lawyers and international law analysts, argue that the killings of incapacitated survivors violate international humanitarian law. The operation has drawn bipartisan scrutiny from the Senate and House Armed Services Committees, which have launched investigations into its legality and transparency. The United Kingdom has ceased intelligence sharing with the U.S. over concerns of complicity. This incident marks a shift from traditional law enforcement to military lethal action in drug interdiction, raising serious ethical, legal, and diplomatic questions.

### Key Takeaways
  - The U.S. military conducted a second strike on a suspected drug boat in the Caribbean on September 2, 2025, after the first strike failed to eliminate all crew members.
  - The second strike killed the remaining survivors, bringing the total death toll to 11, and sank the vessel.
  - This action is considered controversial because it allegedly violated the Law of Armed Conflict, which prohibits the killing of individuals who are hors de combat (incapacitated or surrendered).
  - Survivors were not rescued following the second strike, unlike in a prior October operation where two survivors were repatriated.
  - The White House and Department of Defense claimed the strikes were legal under the Law of Armed Conflict, arguing that drug traffickers were combatants linked to terrorist organizations.
  - Legal experts and international law specialists argue that drug traffickers are civilians and the strikes amount to extrajudicial killings.
  - The U.S. military reportedly knew there were survivors in the water after the first strike and still conducted a second lethal operation.
  - The Republican-led Senate and House Armed Services Committees have launched 'vigorous oversight' investigations into the follow-up strike to assess its legality and transparency.
  - Former Pentagon officials and legal experts, including Sarah Harrison, have raised concerns that the strikes violate international law, particularly the principle of humane treatment of non-combatants.
  - The United Kingdom has stopped sharing intelligence with the U.S. on drug trafficking vessels due to concerns about complicity in illegal military actions.
  - The operation was announced by President Donald Trump on Truth Social, who referred to the targets as 'Tren de Aragua narcoterrorists'.
  - A classified Justice Department legal opinion in summer 2025 claimed the president could authorize lethal strikes against 24 cartels due to an imminent threat, but this reasoning has been challenged by the behavior of the traffickers (e.g., turning around before being struck, and survivors being incapacitated).
  - Admiral Alvin Holsey, commander of U.S. Southern Command, expressed concerns about the legality of the strikes and indicated he might resign, though he will leave his post in December 2025.

### Summary

The Louvre museum in Paris is planning to increase entrance fees by 45% for non-European Economic Area (EEA) visitors, with individual tickets set to rise to 32 euros ($37) starting January 14, 2026. The move, announced earlier by Culture Minister Rachida Dati, is expected to generate 15–20 million euros annually, which will be reinvested into modernizing and securing the museum to address long-standing structural and safety issues. This decision follows a major security breach on October 19, 2025, and criticism from the French Court of Accounts, led by Pierre Moscovici, which accused the Louvre leadership of prioritizing acquisitions over safety. The policy also extends to other major French cultural sites like the Palace of Versailles, Sainte Chapelle, and Château de Chambord, reflecting a broader national strategy to manage visitor demand and fund heritage infrastructure. With the Louvre being the world’s most visited museum and welcoming 8.7 million visitors last year, including 13% from the United States, the fee hike underscores growing financial and operational challenges in managing global tourism and preserving cultural heritage.

### Summary

In a deadly attack on the Damascus countryside town of Beit Jinn, Israel conducted air raids that killed at least 13 people, including two children, following a failed ground incursion by Israeli soldiers. The Israeli military claimed the operation targeted members of Jamaa al-Islamiya, Lebanon’s branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, allegedly involved in recruiting terrorists along Israel’s northern border. However, Jamaa al-Islamiya denied any activity in Syria, asserting it operates only in Lebanon and has upheld the 2024 Lebanon-Israel ceasefire. The Syrian government condemned the attack as a war crime, citing Israel’s violation of the 1974 disengagement agreement and the deliberate shelling of a civilian town. This marks one of Israel’s deadliest strikes in Syria since the fall of Bashar al-Assad’s regime, reflecting broader military strategies to establish buffer zones in response to the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack. Israel has since expanded its presence in Syria through ground incursions, outposts, and detentions of Syrian citizens, raising serious international legal and humanitarian concerns.

### Summary

Ukrainian naval drones, operated by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and designated Sea Baby drones, attacked two Russian 'shadow fleet' oil tankers — the Kairos and Virat — off the Turkish coast in the Black Sea.

Meanwhile, Ukraine continues diplomatic efforts, sending a delegation led by Rustem Umerov to the US to discuss a peace agreement, following the resignation of chief staff Andriy Yermak. A major energy consortium, the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, also suspended operations in Novorossiysk after an unmanned boat attack caused significant damage, highlighting the broader regional impact of the military escalation.

## Swiss voters reject mandatory national service for women - <small>`cnn`</small>

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/30/europe/switzerland-women-national-service-intl)
- _Published: 2025-11-30 08:48:00-05:00_
- **Politics & Governance**
- <small>tags: `Switzerland, gender equality, national service, referendum, climate change, democracy, military service, economic policy, public opinion, civic responsibility`</small>

### Summary

Swiss voters decisively rejected a proposal to mandate national service for women, which would have required all citizens to serve in military, civil protection, or other national roles—currently only men are required to do so. The initiative failed due to lack of a majority of both voters and cantons. Supporters argued that such service would enhance social cohesion in areas like environmental protection and elderly care, while opponents, including lawmakers, raised concerns about economic impact, workforce loss, and the disproportionate burden on women who already bear significant unpaid domestic responsibilities. A separate proposal to impose a 50% tax on inheritances or donations over 50 million francs ($62 million) to fund climate change mitigation was also rejected, with the government warning it could drive wealthy individuals to leave the country. This outcome reflects Switzerland’s unique democratic system, where citizens directly shape national policy through frequent referendums.

### Key Takeaways
  - Swiss voters rejected a proposal to mandate national service for women, which would have required all citizens to serve in military, civil protection, or other national service roles—currently only men are required to do so.
  - The initiative failed because it did not achieve a majority of both voters and cantons, as required by Swiss constitutional rules for referendums.

## Israeli PM Netanyahu requests pardon in ongoing corruption trial - <small>`cnn`</small>

### Summary

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has formally requested a pardon from President Isaac Herzog, citing public interest as the reason, despite being the first incumbent PM to face criminal prosecution while in office. The case centers on allegations of bribery, fraud, and breach of trust involving $250 million in regulatory benefits provided to his friend Shaul Elovitch in exchange for favorable media coverage via Walla! News. Netanyahu’s request marks a reversal from his earlier claims that the charges would collapse in court, and it has sparked strong reactions: opposition leaders like Yair Lapid and Yair Golan criticize the move as evidence of guilt and a breach of judicial integrity, while allies such as Itamar Ben Gvir support it on national security grounds. US President Donald Trump also urged a pardon, adding international dimension. Public opinion remains divided, with a Channel 12 poll showing 48% opposing and 44% supporting an unconditional pardon. Experts warn that granting a pardon during an active trial undermines judicial independence and the rule of law, as pardons are typically reserved for convicted individuals.

### Key Takeaways
  - Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's Prime Minister, formally requested a pardon from President Isaac Herzog in a letter dated November 30, 2025, citing public interest as a justification.
  - Netanyahu is the first incumbent Israeli prime minister to face criminal prosecution while in office, beginning in May 2020 with charges of bribery, fraud, and breach of trust.

  - Netanyahu has consistently maintained his innocence and has repeatedly claimed the charges would collapse in court; however, the trial has been delayed multiple times, mostly at his request.
  - The pardon request has been met with strong opposition from opposition leaders like Yair Lapid and Yair Golan, who argue that only someone guilty would request a pardon and that it undermines judicial integrity.
  - Support has been voiced by Netanyahu’s political allies, including Far-right Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, who cited national security concerns as a justification.
  - US President Donald Trump publicly urged President Herzog to pardon Netanyahu, calling him a decisive wartime leader now transitioning into peace.
  - A Channel 12 poll conducted in mid-November 2025 showed that 48% of Israelis opposed an unconditional pardon, while 44% supported it, indicating significant public division.
  - According to the Israel Democracy Institute, pardons in Israel are typically granted only after conviction, and granting one during active trial risks undermining the rule of law and judicial independence.
  - The request marks a reversal from Netanyahu’s earlier assertions that the indictments would collapse and that he would prove his innocence through legal proceedings.

## SNAP Benefits Are Flowing Again, But Many Enrollees Will Soon Hit Another Hurdle - <small>`cnn`</small>

- <small>tags: `SNAP, food assistance, work requirements, Republican policy, government shutdown, federal legislation, state implementation, poverty, benefit eligibility, economic policy`</small>

### Summary

SNAP benefits are being restored after a government shutdown, but many enrollees are facing new work requirements under the Republican-led 'One Big Beautiful Bill' signed by President Donald Trump. The law now applies to recipients aged 54 to 64 and parents of children aged 14 to 17, requiring them to work, volunteer, or participate in job training for at least 80 hours per month or face losing benefits for only three months every three years. A Congressional Budget Office analysis estimates that 2.4 million Americans, including 300,000 families with children, will lose SNAP benefits over the next decade. States like Connecticut and Pennsylvania are struggling with implementation due to rushed timelines, outdated systems, and lack of clarity in USDA guidance. Beneficiaries are not always properly informed, increasing the risk of unintentional benefit loss due to missed administrative steps. The legislation also limits state flexibility by tightening eligibility waivers to areas with unemployment rates over 10%, and has led to confusion and delays in rollout, with some states only ready to enforce the rules in spring 2026.

  - Implementation has been chaotic due to rushed timelines, lack of clear USDA guidance, and technological limitations in state systems.
  - States like Connecticut and Pennsylvania are facing significant operational challenges, including system updates, manual workarounds, and risk of administrative errors leading to benefit loss.
  - Beneficiaries are not always properly informed, raising concerns that people may be subject to the work requirement without knowing, potentially leading to unintended benefit loss.

### Summary

Lindsey Halligan, a former White House adviser and non-prosecutor with no prior experience in federal criminal law, was handpicked by President Donald Trump to lead the Alexandria, Virginia US Attorney’s office. Within 63 days, her appointment was invalidated by a federal judge due to the expiration of the 120-day interim period for evaluation. Despite this, Halligan proceeded to prosecute high-profile cases against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James. These actions triggered legal and internal backlash, including judge-ordered scrutiny of her grand jury statements and the dismissal of the James case. Experienced prosecutors were fired or sidelined without explanation, fueling allegations of political interference and undermining the office’s credibility. Halligan denied claims of installing security cameras and faced accusations of misleading grand jurors. The Justice Department remains divided on how to proceed, and Halligan’s official status and role are still under review, signaling a significant crisis in the independence and integrity of federal prosecution under political influence.

  - Lindsey Halligan, a former White House adviser and lawyer with no prosecutorial experience, was handpicked by President Donald Trump to lead the Alexandria, Virginia US Attorney’s office, despite concerns about her qualifications.
  - A federal judge ruled that Halligan’s appointment was invalid because the 120-day interim period for US attorneys had expired prior to Senate evaluation, rendering her legally unqualified to serve.

### Summary

On November 29, 2025, the German far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) officially launched its new youth wing, Generation Germany, in Giessen, following the dissolution of its previous youth organization, the Young Alternative, in March 2025. The launch coincided with widespread protests, where thousands of demonstrators clashed with police, throwing stones and using water cannons to block access to the convention center, highlighting deep societal divisions over immigration and political ideology. The AfD, which finished second in the February 2025 national election with over 20% of the vote, now holds the largest opposition seat and attributes its growth to public dissatisfaction with Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s coalition government. The previous youth wing, Young Alternative, was classified as a right-wing extremist group by Germany’s domestic intelligence agency due to its anti-immigrant stance and links to extremist movements like the Identitarian Movement. AfD leaders, including co-leaders Alice Weidel and Tino Chrupalla, emphasized a shift toward greater party oversight and responsibility, stating that the party must learn from past mistakes and better integrate young members into its structure. While the new youth wing aims to be a training ground for future politicians, it remains to be seen whether it will move toward moderation or retain radical elements.

### Summary

The 2025 Miss Universe pageant faced a major scandal involving allegations of vote-rigging, secret pre-selection of finalists, and favoritism toward Miss Mexico Fátima Bosch due to business ties between her father and co-owner Raúl Rocha Cantú. Former judge Omar Harfouch accused the pageant of opaque voting and pre-scripted outcomes, leading to public outcry and the resignation of runner-up Olivia Yacé, who cited visa issues and perceived unfairness. Rocha Cantú, who is now under investigation for ties to organized crime networks, denied all allegations, stating the pageant is a private business with no public funding. Despite recent efforts to modernize, the pageant continues to face criticism for outdated standards, lack of transparency, and declining viewership, while still being valued in countries like the Philippines. The controversy underscores a broader crisis in pageantry: how commercial interests and political connections undermine fairness, while social media empowers contestants to speak out and demand accountability.

  - Controversies have overshadowed the pageant’s actual broadcast reach, with the 2025 finale only available via streaming in the U.S., not on traditional English-language TV.
  - Critics argue that pageants have become outdated, while supporters highlight the platform value of beauty queens in advocacy, fundraising, and personal empowerment, such as Miss Philippines Ahtisa Manalo who paid college fees through pageant earnings.

## How far can Democrats ride the affordability argument? A progressive running in deep-red Tennessee is about to find out - <small>`cnn`</small>

- <small>tags: `affordability, progressive politics, Tennessee politics, special election, Democratic strategy, Republican opposition, political messaging, cost of living, redistricting, national politics, 2026 election preview`</small>

### Summary

Aftyn Behn, a progressive Democratic candidate, is running in Tennessee’s 7th Congressional District in a deep-red area where President Trump won by 22 points in 2024. The race is seen as a test of how far Democrats can push the affordability argument, which has proven successful in other states. Behn, a former community health organizer and activist, emphasizes affordability in health care, groceries, and rent, framing the race as a response to Washington’s failure to address inflation and cost-of-living issues. Despite strong Republican spending—especially on ads highlighting her past comments about policing and country music—Behn argues these are out of context and misrepresented. The race has drawn national attention, with figures like Kamala Harris and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez participating in tele-rallies. While Republicans expect to win due to strong conservative turnout, Democrats believe voters are increasingly frustrated with the GOP’s lack of action on affordability, making the result a potential indicator of broader political shifts ahead of the 2026 election cycle.

  - Republicans are heavily investing in advertising, with over $2.5 million of the $4 million spent in ads coming from GOP-aligned groups, often attacking Behn’s past comments on policing and culture.
  - Behn’s campaign argues that her past remarks are out of context and mischaracterized, and that her focus on affordability and systemic change is rooted in grassroots organizing and activism.
  - The race is seen as a national barometer for political trends ahead of the 2026 elections, drawing national figures like Kamala Harris and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to participate in tele-rallies.
  - Despite a deep partisan lean, Democrats believe voters are frustrated with Washington’s failure to address inflation, health care, and grocery costs, making the race competitive.

### Summary

Northwestern University has agreed to pay $75 million as part of a settlement with the Trump administration to restore previously frozen federal funding, which was suspended due to a Title VI civil rights investigation into allegations of unlawful discrimination, including race-based admissions and a hostile environment for Jewish students. The settlement requires the university to overhaul its campus demonstration policies, implement mandatory antisemitism training for all students, faculty, and staff, and ensure compliance with federal anti-discrimination laws. The funding freeze caused significant disruption, including the resignation of President Michael Schill in September 2025. Unlike other universities like Brown and Columbia, Northwestern will manage its own compliance and will directly pay the federal government, with payments scheduled through 2028. The Department of Justice has confirmed the closure of the investigation and restored the university’s eligibility for future federal grants. This case is part of a broader federal effort to scrutinize university policies and campus speech, placing Northwestern among several elite institutions facing financial and policy repercussions.

### Summary

Volodymyr Zelensky has dismissed Andriy Yermak, his longtime head of the presidential office, amid a major corruption scandal involving alleged kickbacks in Ukraine’s energy sector. The resignation, which follows an anti-corruption raid on Yermak’s home, occurs at a critical moment as Ukraine faces intense U.S. pressure to sign a peace deal seen as favoring Russia. Yermak, who had led Ukraine’s diplomatic negotiations—including with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio—was widely unpopular due to corruption allegations, power abuses, and a lack of accountability. Ukrainian public opinion largely supports the dismissal as a sign of democratic strength, though concerns remain about Zelensky’s awareness of the misconduct and the potential for political instability. Russia has exploited the situation to question Zelensky’s legitimacy, while international allies like Poland’s Donald Tusk have described the timing as a 'fatal combination' amid diplomatic chaos. The event raises questions about the future of Ukraine’s leadership, the strength of its institutions, and the risks of political uncertainty during a war and peace negotiation phase.

  - Ukrainians largely approve of Yermak’s downfall, viewing it as a sign of democratic integrity, especially given that independent institutions investigated a high-ranking official.
  - Zelensky's decision to dismiss Yermak may be seen as a move to restore trust in his administration, though it raises questions about his awareness of corruption and the close, unaccountable power dynamic between him and Yermak.

### Summary

Following a shooting in Washington, DC that killed two National Guard members, President Donald Trump has blamed the Biden administration for failing to properly vet Afghan evacuees, claiming that over 85,000 Afghans were admitted without rigorous screening. The suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, had undergone multiple vetting rounds by the CIA and NCTC, including in 2011 and during the 2021 evacuation, with no prior ties to terrorism identified. A 2024 FBI audit found no systemic breakdown in vetting, but noted that the urgency of evacuation may have increased the risk of exploitation. Experts and organizations like AfghanEvac argue that the vetting process was thorough and ongoing. In response, the Trump administration has announced a full-scale review of green cards and asylum approvals for Afghans and nationals from 19 countries designated as 'of concern,' including Afghanistan, Iran, and Somalia. The review has halted processing of all Afghan asylum cases pending further evaluation of vetting standards.

### Key Takeaways
  - President Donald Trump blames the Biden administration for the Washington, DC National Guard shooting by accusing it of allowing millions of Afghans into the US without proper vetting.
  - The suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, was previously vetted by the CIA and NCTC, showing no ties to terrorist organizations and was granted permanent asylum in 2024 after multiple vetting steps.
  - A 2024 FBI audit found no systemic breakdown in the vetting process, but acknowledged that the urgency of evacuation may have increased the risk of bad actors exploiting the process.
  - The Trump administration has launched a full-scale review of green cards issued to Afghans and others from 19 countries listed in a June 2024 presidential proclamation, including Afghanistan, Iran, Somalia, and Venezuela.
  - AfghanEvac leaders and security experts dispute the claim that vetting was inadequate, noting that evacuees underwent vetting both abroad and in the US, including continuous checks post-arrival.
  - Trump administration officials claim that the vetting standards applied during the evacuation were less rigorous than those used previously, especially for permanent residency and integration.

### Summary

Following the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, DC, President Donald Trump intensified his anti-immigration agenda, vowing to permanently pause migration from 'Third World Countries' and expel individuals not seen as 'net assets.' The suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan national who entered under the Biden-era Operation Allies Welcome program and was granted asylum in April 2025, was vetted by intelligence agencies and deemed 'clean' prior to employment. Trump directed USCIS to conduct a full reexamination of Green Cards from 19 countries of concern, including Afghanistan, Iran, and Venezuela, and paused all asylum decisions until thorough vetting. The Treasury Department blocked undocumented immigrants from receiving federal tax benefits, and the State Department paused Afghan visa issuances. Critics, including AfghanEvac, warn that this response risks stigmatizing an entire community. The administration’s policies are seen as a major shift in immigration enforcement, aligning with Trump’s campaign promises to drastically reshape U.S. immigration rules, with significant implications for national security, public services, and refugee resettlement.

## Trump pushes long-running attack on Biden autopen use, claiming he’s ‘cancelling’ actions signed with it - <small>`cnn`</small>

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/28/politics/trump-biden-auto-pen)
- _Published: 2025-11-28 16:34:00Z_
- **Politics & Governance**
- <small>tags: `autopen, executive power, Donald Trump, Joe Biden, perjury, legal precedent, political attack, presidential authority, constitutional law, Truth Social`</small>

### Summary

President Donald Trump, in a post on Truth Social, claims he is 'cancelling' all executive actions signed by former President Joe Biden using the autopen, asserting that the actions are invalid because Biden did not personally sign them and that the autopen process was illegal. Trump alleges Biden was not involved in the autopen process and threatens perjury charges if he admits otherwise. The claim is challenged by legal precedent, including a 2005 Office of Legal Counsel memo and a 1929 solicitor general memo, which affirm that a president does not need to personally affix a signature to execute laws or issue pardons. A congressional probe has questioned Biden’s awareness of the content of some pardons, but found no evidence that decisions were made by others. Trump’s persistent focus on the autopen is part of a broader effort to delegitimize Biden’s executive actions and is viewed by legal experts as politically motivated rather than legally sound.

### Key Takeaways
  - Trump claims that all executive actions signed by President Joe Biden using an autopen are null and void, asserting they were not personally signed and thus legally invalid.
  - Trump alleges that Biden was not involved in the autopen process and that if he admits involvement, he will face perjury charges.
  - The claim is legally challenged by past legal opinions, including a 2005 Office of Legal Counsel memo under George W. Bush, which affirmed that a president need not personally affix a signature to execute a law or executive order.
  - A 1929 solicitor general memo indicates that the Constitution does not prescribe a method for issuing pardons, undermining Trump’s argument about the legitimacy of autopen-signed pardons.
  - A congressional probe has raised questions about Biden’s awareness of autopen-signed pardons, but found no direct evidence that others made the decisions behind them.
  - Trump's persistent focus on the autopen is part of a broader effort to delegitimize Biden’s actions during his presidency, framing them as illegitimate due to lack of personal involvement.
  - The debate is part of a larger political narrative where Trump claims that Biden's use of the autopen shows lack of control and legitimacy, and that such actions should be canceled.

### Summary

Honduras is set to hold general elections in November 2025 under a tense political climate marked by allegations of voting fraud, military interference, and significant foreign influence. The presidential race features three main candidates: Rixi Moncada, a left-wing candidate backed by the ruling LIBRE party and Xiomara Castro; Salvador Nasralla, a centrist-liberal with strong ties to U.S. policy; and Nasry 'Tito' Asfura, a right-wing businessman endorsed by U.S. President Donald Trump. The election is deeply polarized, with the political divide reflecting ideological clashes over economic policy, democracy, and foreign alignment. The National Electoral Council (CNE) faces growing pressure from both political parties and the military, including an unauthorized request for ballot records, raising fears of electoral manipulation. International bodies such as Human Rights Watch, the OAS, and the EU have expressed serious concerns about the integrity of the process. The U.S. exerts considerable influence through political endorsements, threats to tax remittances, and public statements, while China’s growing diplomatic presence in Honduras adds a new layer of geopolitical complexity. The outcome of the election could determine the future direction of Honduras’ foreign policy—whether aligned with U.S. interests or with alternative regional partnerships, such as those with Venezuela. This situation underscores the vulnerability of small nations in the face of global power dynamics and democratic erosion.

### Key Takeaways
  - Honduras is facing a pivotal presidential election in November 2025, marked by deep political divisions and allegations of voting fraud.
  - The ruling Liberty and Refoundation Party (LIBRE) supports Rixi Moncada, a left-wing candidate who is a former defense minister and aims to continue President Xiomara Castro’s social policies and economic democratization agenda.
  - Opposition candidates include centrist-liberal Salvador Nasralla, who has ties to the U.S. and supports labor reforms and stronger Western trade relations, and right-wing Nasry 'Tito' Asfura, endorsed by U.S. President Donald Trump and running on a free-market platform.
  - Allegations of fraud have intensified, with the military asking for ballot records—an action deemed illegal and politically disruptive by the National Electoral Council (CNE), raising fears of a repeat of electoral crises seen in Venezuela and Nicaragua.
  - The U.S. has exerted significant influence through political endorsements, public statements, and policy pressure, including Trump’s endorsement of Asfura and proposed tax on remittances, which are vital to Honduras’ economy.
  - Honduras has limited foreign policy leverage due to its dependence on U.S. trade, migration policies (such as TPS termination), and military presence, and the potential for a U.S.-aligned government to increase American military presence in Honduras.
  - Honduras has also established diplomatic ties with China in 2023, but no significant trade agreement has been reached, raising concerns about China’s growing influence in Latin America.
  - The political landscape reflects a broader regional struggle between U.S. influence and alternative regional alliances, with Honduras caught between U.S. pressure, economic dependence, and alignment with Venezuela.
  - International bodies such as Human Rights Watch, the OAS, and the EU have urged the Honduran government to protect electoral integrity and ensure the independence of the National Electoral Council (CNE).

### Summary

Andriy Yermak, Ukraine’s chief of staff and key peace negotiator under President Volodymyr Zelensky, has resigned following a joint anti-corruption raid by Ukraine’s National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office (SAPO) on his home. The raids, which occurred just weeks after a major investigation into energy sector corruption began, come at a critical time as Ukraine prepares for high-stakes peace negotiations with the United States. The resignation undermines Ukraine’s diplomatic credibility and creates uncertainty about leadership continuity in talks, especially since Yermak had recently led efforts to revise a Russian-backed 28-point peace plan. Russia is monitoring the situation closely, while the U.S. remains wary of maximalist demands. This crisis reflects deeper systemic corruption concerns in Ukraine, despite Zelensky’s anti-corruption campaign and reforms, and highlights vulnerabilities in governance, particularly after controversial moves in 2024 that reduced oversight of anti-corruption agencies, leading to public protests.

### Summary

A 29-year-old Afghan national, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, has been identified as the suspect in a deadly shooting near the White House in Washington, D.C. on the day before Thanksgiving. The attack, which killed West Virginia National Guard member Sarah Beckstrom and left fellow guard member Andrew Wolfe in critical condition, occurred during a routine patrol in Farragut Square. Lakanwal, who previously worked with the CIA in Afghanistan and was vetted under Operation Allies Welcome in 2021, was granted asylum by the Trump administration in 2024. Despite claims by President Donald Trump that he was inadequately vetted, investigators confirm he passed all security checks, including checks by the National Counterterrorism Center. The suspect reportedly had not been seen at his local mosque in over two weeks and drove from Bellingham, Washington to D.C. before the attack. The FBI is investigating the motive, which remains under examination. The incident has triggered a national political backlash, with Trump criticizing the Biden administration for allowing millions of Afghan immigrants into the U.S. and calling for a complete reexamination of all Afghan entries. USCIS has paused processing of Afghan immigration cases pending review, and officials have announced that Lakanwal will face murder charges, with potential life imprisonment or terrorism-related penalties.

## Orbán meets Putin in Moscow to shore up Hungary’s energy supplies, making use of Trump exemption - <small>`cnn`</small>

- **Politics & Governance**
- <small>tags: `energy security, Russia-Ukraine war, geopolitical diplomacy, US sanctions, Hungary, Vladimir Putin, Viktor Orbán, Donald Trump, energy dependence, European energy policy`</small>

### Summary

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow to ensure Hungary’s energy supplies remain secure amid US sanctions on Russian oil producers. The meeting follows a one-year exemption granted by former US President Donald Trump, citing Hungary’s landlocked status and difficulty accessing alternative oil sources. However, analysts argue this exemption is irrational, as neighboring landlocked Slovakia has already phased out Russian oil and enjoys lower fuel prices. Hungary’s dependence on Russian crude has increased sharply—86% of its 2024 crude imports were from Russia, with 92% of current-year imports still from Moscow. The article raises concerns that the exemption allows continued financial support for Russia’s war in Ukraine. The meeting also touched on efforts to end the war in Ukraine, with reports suggesting a future Trump-Putin summit in Budapest remains a possibility.

### Key Takeaways
  - Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orbán met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow to secure continued Russian energy supplies amid US sanctions on Russian oil producers.
  - The Trump administration granted Hungary a one-year exemption from sanctions on Russian energy, citing Hungary's landlocked status and difficulty accessing alternative oil sources.
  - Hungary's dependence on Russian crude oil increased significantly after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine: Russian oil accounted for 86% of Hungarian crude imports in 2024, up from 61% pre-invasion, and 92% of imports for the current year.
  - Analysts criticize the exemption as a 'terrible and unnecessary mistake' that allows continued funding of Russia's war in Ukraine, noting that landlocked Slovakia has already phased out Russian oil and has lower fuel prices than Hungary.
  - The meeting also included discussions on ending the war in Ukraine, with reports indicating Putin did not rule out a future summit with Trump in Budapest.
  - The exemption was granted despite the fact that the Czech Republic, another landlocked country, no longer imports Russian crude and has lower fuel prices, undermining the justification for the exemption.

## Ukraine’s Zelensky Faces Hideous Choice Between Bad Deal and No Deal - <small>`cnn`</small>

### Summary

Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky is facing a dire and morally complex decision in the ongoing peace negotiations with Russia, as U.S. President Donald Trump has stepped back from his Thanksgiving deadline for a deal. Despite the Trump administration’s 28-point peace plan, which includes a controversial demand for Ukraine to cede control of the Donetsk region — a demand Kyiv and Europe have consistently rejected — the negotiations remain stalled. Russian President Vladimir Putin continues to insist on retaining control of eastern Ukraine, reflecting a maximalist stance that undermines any credible peace effort. The article highlights that Ukraine is already struggling with a severe military manpower shortage, shrinking funding from European allies, and multiple active frontlines. A corruption scandal involving Ukraine’s chief-of-staff Andriy Yermak adds internal instability. The diplomatic process appears to be trapped in a cycle of failed proposals, with the core issue of territorial sovereignty remaining unresolved. As a result, the real question for Zelensky is whether he can accept a bad deal with territorial loss or risk a prolonged war with no end in sight.

### Key Takeaways
  - Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky faces a morally and strategically difficult choice: accept a peace deal that requires ceding control of eastern Donetsk region, which Kyiv and Europe consider politically and militarily unacceptable, or risk prolonged war with no resolution.
  - The Trump administration’s proposed 28-point peace plan includes a demand for Ukraine to give up Donetsk — a condition that Kyiv and its allies have consistently rejected, highlighting the deep divergence in strategic interests between the West and Moscow.
  - Despite the US and European support, Ukraine is facing a manpower and funding crisis, with limited military capacity to sustain multiple fronts (Zaporizhzhia, Pokrovsk, Kupiansk), making it extremely difficult to achieve any territorial gains or negotiate a lasting peace.
  - Russia’s persistent demand to retain control over Donetsk reflects its maximalist stance and the broader geopolitical tension, suggesting that peace will not come without significant territorial concessions.
  - The cycle of failed negotiations, including the recurring demand for Donetsk, indicates a structural problem in the peace process: the lack of mutual trust and the difficulty in bridging fundamental strategic differences.
  - The corruption scandal involving Ukraine’s chief-of-staff Andriy Yermak adds a layer of domestic instability, further complicating the political landscape and undermining public confidence in the peace process.
  - The idea of Ukraine joining NATO or Russia rejoining the G8 is speculative and unlikely due to ongoing political animosity and the lack of trust between Russia and the West.
  - The article underscores that while the war may appear close to resolution, the fundamental gaps in military, political, and economic realities prevent a sustainable or credible peace deal from emerging.

### Summary

As artificial intelligence drives a boom in data center construction across the U.S., states are facing mounting pressure on energy supplies, utility costs, and environmental sustainability. The competition between states—such as New Jersey and Virginia—over who bears the burden of rising power costs is intensifying, with political leaders calling for balanced policies that promote economic development without sacrificing affordability or community well-being. The shared PJM grid connects many states, creating cross-state energy demands that challenge regional governance. While data centers bring vital jobs and economic activity, especially in rural areas, critics argue that their massive power consumption and environmental footprint must be managed through enforceable sustainability standards, local input, and cost-sharing mechanisms. This issue is becoming a central part of the national political conversation on economic growth, affordability, and climate responsibility.

### Key Takeaways
  - Data centers are fueling economic growth, particularly in rural and underinvested areas, but are creating significant strain on regional power grids and increasing utility costs.
  - States are experiencing rising energy bills—up to 20% in New Jersey and 9% in Virginia—due to high power consumption by data centers.
  - The PJM grid, covering 13 states including New Jersey and Virginia, illustrates how energy demands are shared across neighboring states, creating cross-state policy challenges.
  - While data centers bring economic benefits like job creation and GDP growth (e.g., Virginia’s $9.1 billion contribution), they also raise concerns about sustainability, environmental impact, and cost burdens on consumers.
  - Political leaders are grappling with balancing economic development and affordability, with calls for data centers to invest in renewable energy, demand response, and energy efficiency.

### Summary

Local organizers in Cortina d’Ampezzo, Italy, have implemented a cap on Olympic ticket sales for the 2026 Winter Olympics due to transport congestion concerns, particularly stemming from delays in construction of the Apollonio-Socrepes gondola cable car. The gondola, critical for moving spectators from the town center to the Tofane Alpine Skiing Center, is behind schedule due to legal challenges, a ground crack in landslide-prone terrain, and a lengthy approval process. A 15% reduction in expected spectators (from 200,000 to 170,000) has been made to align with current transport capacity. Special traffic measures, including permit-based access and mandatory shuttle buses for fans, are being introduced. Despite challenges, Simico, the state infrastructure agency, asserts the gondola will be operational by end of December 2025, with final testing in January 2026. The event underscores broader transport challenges in a remote mountain town with limited public transport options, highlighting both immediate logistical risks and long-term benefits for regional development.

### Summary

The Trump administration has directed a full-scale reexamination of all green cards issued to individuals from 19 countries of concern, including Afghanistan, Iran, Libya, Somalia, and Venezuela, following the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, DC by an Afghan national, Rahmanullah Lakanwal. The reexamination will consider country-specific security factors such as the ability to issue secure identity documents. The Department of Homeland Security has paused processing of all asylum cases related to Afghan nationals and is reviewing all Biden-era asylum approvals. President Trump has called for a permanent pause on migration from 'Third World Countries' and plans to terminate millions of Biden-era immigration admissions, including those processed by the 'autopen,' while also targeting immigrants deemed not a net asset or incompatible with Western civilization. Over 190,000 Afghans have resettled since 2021, and the Alliance of Afghan Communities in the US has criticized the policy shift, arguing it threatens the legal pathways for other Afghans. This action reflects the administration’s broader anti-immigration rhetoric and intensified enforcement efforts in response to national security concerns.

### Summary

Russian President Vladimir Putin has acknowledged that a US-proposed peace plan could serve as a foundation for negotiations with Ukraine, but he has simultaneously reaffirmed his demand that Ukrainian troops withdraw from all occupied territories, threatening military action if they do not. Despite recent Russian advances, such as in Pokrovsk, experts like the Institute for the Study of War state that a Russian military victory is not inevitable. The original 28-point peace plan, which included demands for Ukraine to reduce its military and be barred from NATO, faced strong opposition from Ukraine and Europe, leading to its revision. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is preparing to meet with US officials to discuss the plan, emphasizing its personal and national significance. The conflict remains unresolved, with Russia occupying about 20% of Ukraine’s recognized territory, including key regions like Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia, which are viewed as vital to Ukrainian security. The upcoming talks, expected to take place in early next week between US envoy Steve Witkoff and Putin, could mark a pivotal moment in the war’s diplomatic trajectory.

## Trump Pledges to Help End Fighting in Sudan – Will It Be Enough? - <small>`cnn`</small>

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/28/politics/trump-sudan-war-negotiations)

- **Politics & Governance**
- <small>tags: `Sudan war, Donald Trump, peace negotiations, UAE arms supply, genocide allegations, humanitarian crisis, foreign policy, U.S. diplomacy, Qua, regional alliances, genocide, war crimes`</small>

### Summary

President Donald Trump has pledged to use his presidential influence to end the two-year civil war in Sudan, where the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have been fighting, displacing nearly 12 million people. The U.S. has been working through the Quad (Saudi Arabia, UAE, Egypt) to mediate peace, but progress has stalled. Trump’s involvement follows a personal request from Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman and marks a shift from prior U.S. inaction. However, experts warn that meaningful progress is unlikely due to resistance from Sudan’s top military leaders, accusations of arms supply from the UAE, and the deep-rooted ethnic and generational trauma in the conflict. While Trump may exert influence over regional allies, he lacks direct leverage over the warring factions. The article raises questions about whether Trump’s personal commitment—coupled with business ties to UAE—will translate into effective, sustainable peace, or if it will only yield short-term diplomatic gestures.

### Key Takeaways
  - President Donald Trump has pledged to use his presidential influence to halt the two-year war in Sudan, a conflict that has displaced nearly 12 million people.

## Trump says US land action against alleged drug trafficking networks in Venezuela will start ‘very soon’ - <small>`cnn`</small>

### Summary

President Donald Trump announced plans to launch land-based military strikes against alleged drug trafficking networks in Venezuela, asserting that such actions will begin 'very soon' in response to growing drug flows through land routes. He designated Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his allies as part of a foreign terrorist organization—specifically 'Cartel de los Soles'—a move that allows for new sanctions but does not authorize lethal force. The U.S. military has already conducted over 80 sea-based strikes and is now preparing for land operations under 'Operation Southern Spear', deploying more than 15,000 troops. However, legal experts and the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel have concluded that there is currently no legal basis for launching attacks inside Venezuela, and that prior actions were limited to maritime zones. The Trump administration has also maintained that it does not require congressional approval for such military actions, challenging longstanding constitutional norms related to war powers.

### Key Takeaways
  - President Donald Trump announced plans to launch land-based military strikes against alleged drug trafficking networks in Venezuela, stating that such actions will begin 'very soon' during a Thanksgiving call with service members.
  - Trump designated Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his allies as members of a foreign terrorist organization, specifically referencing 'Cartel de los Soles,' which experts believe describes corrupt government officials rather than a formal criminal cartel.
  - This designation allows the U.S. to impose new sanctions on Maduro’s assets and infrastructure but does not explicitly authorize the use of lethal force.
  - The U.S. military has deployed over 15,000 troops and more than a dozen warships in the region under 'Operation Southern Spear', and has already killed over 80 people in sea-based strikes against drug traffickers.
  - Legal experts and a Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel report that current U.S. legal authority does not permit lethal strikes inside Venezuela, citing a lack of legal justification for land-based attacks.
  - The Trump administration has maintained that it is not bound by the decades-old war powers law requiring congressional approval for military actions in foreign territories, and has declined to involve Congress in its Latin American military campaign.
  - Trump’s comments suggest a shift in U.S. policy toward Venezuela, signaling increased military and political pressure on Maduro’s regime amid allegations of drug trafficking and corruption.

### Summary

The Winter Egg, one of only three Imperial Eggs made by Fabergé in private hands, is set to be auctioned by Christie’s in London in November 2025, with an estimated sale price of over £20 million — surpassing its own previous record. Commissioned by Tsar Nicholas II in 1913 for his mother Maria Feodorovna, the egg is unique for its ice-like design crafted from clear quartz and adorned with rose-cut diamonds, designed by female workmaster Alma Pihl. Its value lies not in the diamonds, but in the artistic expression of nature, and it includes a surprise inner feature of a carved basket of wood anemones. After being sold to Wartski in the 1930s and disappearing from view until 1994, it has been on the market twice before, setting record prices. Due to sanctions and tariffs, neither Russia nor the United States can legally acquire it, making the sale a global and politically sensitive event. Experts believe the egg is the greatest of all Fabergé Imperial Eggs due to its originality and timeless design, and its auction marks a pivotal moment in the history of one of the world’s most valuable artworks.

## Democratic Attorneys General Sue to Block USDA Guidance That Makes Some Immigrants Ineligible for SNAP Benefits - <small>`cnn`</small>

- <small>tags: `immigration, SNAP, food stamps, refugees, asylum, legal challenge, USDA, state attorneys general, humanitarian protection, Trump administration, constitutional law, federal policy, civil rights, immigrant rights`</small>

### Summary

A coalition of 21 Democratic state attorneys general, led by New York Attorney General Letitia James, has sued the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to block new guidance issued on October 31, 2025, that makes certain immigrants — including refugees, asylum seekers, Afghan and Ukrainian parolees, Iraqi and Afghan Special Immigrants (SIV), and victims of severe trafficking — ineligible for SNAP (food stamp) benefits. The attorneys general argue that the guidance violates federal law, arbitrarily excludes protected immigrant groups, and incorrectly sets the 120-day exclusion period to begin on the day Trump’s domestic policy law took effect rather than on the day the guidance was issued. The lawsuit, filed in Oregon, seeks a federal judge to vacate and block the guidance, warning that it threatens the stability of the SNAP program and could impose significant financial burdens on states. The USDA declined to comment, and prior requests for clarification were ignored. This legal action follows a federal indictment dismissal against Letitia James, highlighting ongoing political tensions around immigration and food assistance policies.

### Key Takeaways
  - The USDA’s October 31, 2025, guidance declared certain immigrants — including refugees and asylum seekers — ineligible for SNAP benefits, even if they become lawful permanent residents.

### Summary

Two West Virginia National Guard members were fatally shot during a high visibility patrol near Farragut Square in Washington, D.C., in a targeted shooting that occurred on November 27, 2025. The suspect, identified as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan national who entered the U.S. in 2021 and applied for asylum in 2024, is in custody. Law enforcement officials say the suspect approached the guardsmen, fired at them, and was later identified through fingerprints. The two guardsmen remain in critical condition. President Donald Trump blamed the Biden administration for allowing the suspect into the country and called for a complete reexamination of all Afghan immigrant cases, leading USCIS to halt processing of such applications. The incident has reignited national debates over immigration vetting, National Guard deployment in the capital, and public safety in high-traffic areas. A federal judge previously ruled the National Guard's mobilization in D.C. illegal, though the administration is seeking an emergency stay.

### Summary

In November 2025, a Russian court convicted eight individuals—five of whom are Ukrainian or Armenian nationals—of terrorism and arms trafficking for a truck bomb attack on the key bridge linking Crimea to Russia in October 2022. The bridge, which spans the Kerch Strait and is critical to military supply lines, was targeted in an act the Ukrainian Security Service (SBU) claimed responsibility for, citing it as a counter-terrorism operation. The attack killed the truck driver and four others, prompting Russia to retaliate by attacking Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure. Among the accused is entrepreneur Oleg Antipov, who claimed innocence and asserted that all evidence and witnesses support their innocence. The case highlights the strategic importance of the bridge as both a logistical lifeline and a symbol of Russian control over Crimea, and reflects the broader tensions between Russia and Ukraine in the ongoing war.

## Venezuela calls Trump's call to close airspace a 'colonialist threat' - <small>`npr`</small>

### Summary

The Venezuelan government condemned President Donald Trump's call to close the airspace above Venezuela, labeling it a 'colonialist threat' that violates international law and undermines national sovereignty. Trump, in a Truth Social post, urged airlines, pilots, drug dealers, and human traffickers to consider the airspace above Venezuela closed, sparking immediate diplomatic backlash. Venezuela asserts that only its own institutional framework can regulate its airspace, rejecting any external authority. The U.S. military, under Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, has conducted at least 21 strikes under 'Operation Southern Spear,' killing 82 people on suspected drug boats, which Venezuela and Democratic lawmakers argue constitutes an unlawful use of force under the UN Charter. Critics, including Senator Chris Van Hollen, warn these actions could amount to war crimes, while Republican Senator Eric Schmitt defends them as within the president’s constitutional powers. Congress, including both Senate and House Armed Services Committees, has launched investigations into the Pentagon’s actions, citing a lack of legislative approval and insufficient evidence. Despite the controversy, Flightradar24 data shows commercial aircraft continue to fly in Venezuelan airspace, indicating that the closure call has not been enforced.

Following a deadly shooting in Washington, D.C., in which two West Virginia National Guard members—Sarah Beckstrom and Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe—were killed, authorities identified 29-year-old Afghan national Rahmanullah Lakanwal as the suspect, who is now facing a first-degree murder charge.

Concurrently, the Trump administration has abruptly halted all immigration processing from Afghan nationals and suspended asylum decisions nationwide, citing national security concerns, marking a significant shift in U.S. immigration policy in the wake of the incident.

### Summary

A deadly attack on two National Guard members in Washington, D.C., on November 23, 2025, has triggered a sweeping response from the U.S. government. The victims, 20-year-old Sarah Beckstrom and 24-year-old Andrew Wolfe, both from West Virginia, were ambushed and injured in a Metro station area. A 29-year-old Afghan national, Lakanwal, is accused of the attack and faces a first-degree murder charge. In response, President Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced restrictions on Afghan passport holders, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth deployed 500 additional National Guard troops to D.C. Critics and courts have raised concerns about the legality and proportionality of these actions, with a federal judge ruling the deployment unlawful. The FBI and Justice Department have not identified a motive for the attack, and advocates for Afghan allies warn that the policy could undermine the protections of those who risked their lives to support U.S. efforts in Afghanistan.

### Summary

Pope Leo’s visit to Lebanon has sparked hope among many, particularly in the country’s Christian communities, but has also generated frustration due to the decision not to travel to southern regions like Tyre and Alma al-Chaab, which have suffered extensive destruction from Israeli military actions. The visit occurs amid a year-old ceasefire that is frequently broken, economic collapse since 2019, and the devastating 2020 port explosion. Father Fadi El Mir, a Catholic priest involved in the visit logistics, emphasizes the Church’s mission to respond to poverty and injustice, especially in Catholic-run institutions. Despite appeals from local leaders like Mayor Chadi Sayah of Alma al-Chaab, who write to the Pope urging his presence as a 'source of strength' for Christian communities on the border, the Vatican refuses to move south due to security concerns. The article highlights the deepening humanitarian crisis, the failure of state and church support in the south, and the symbolic importance of religious leadership in a nation enduring prolonged conflict and economic collapse.

## What Was 'Operation Allies Welcome,' Which Allowed Some Afghans Entry Into the U.S.? - <small>`npr`</small>

- [source](https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5622991)
- _Published: 2025-11-27 14:45:00.000Z_
- **Politics & Governance**
- <small>tags: `Afghanistan, Operation Allies Welcome, Taliban, U.S. Immigration, National Security, Humanitarian Resettlement, Veteran Affairs, Security Vetting, Political Controversy`</small>

### Summary

Operation Allies Welcome (OAW) was a U.S. resettlement program established in 2021 to protect Afghans who had worked with U.S. forces from Taliban persecution after the fall of Kabul. It allowed them to enter the U.S. on parole for two years, with eligibility for Special Immigrant Visas based on service or family ties. Around 200,000 Afghans were resettled under the program, which included rigorous vetting by intelligence and law enforcement agencies. However, concerns emerged over data inaccuracies and security lapses, with reports indicating 55 individuals were later flagged on terrorism watch lists. The program came under intense scrutiny after Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan man who entered under OAW, shot two National Guard members in Washington, D.C., in November 2025. This incident prompted President Trump to criticize the program, and USCIS halted all new applications from Afghan nationals. Critics argue that the program's urgency and time constraints compromised security vetting, while supporters emphasize the humanitarian necessity of protecting those at risk. The incident has sparked debate about the long-term safety and integration of Afghan nationals in the U.S. and the adequacy of the vetting process.

### Key Takeaways
  - Operation Allies Welcome (OAW) was a U.S. government program launched in 2021 to resettle Afghans who had worked with U.S. forces and were at risk of persecution by the Taliban.
  - The program allowed Afghans to enter the U.S. on parole for two years without permanent immigration status, with eligibility for Special Immigrant Visas based on prior service or family ties.
  - Approximately 40% of evacuees were eligible for Special Immigrant Visas due to their contributions to the U.S. military efforts in Afghanistan.

### Summary

The Pentagon has launched an investigation into Senator Mark Kelly, a retired Navy fighter pilot and Arizona Democrat, over a video in which he urged troops to defy 'illegal orders.' The investigation, initiated after President Donald Trump accused Kelly and five other lawmakers of sedition, has sparked significant legal and constitutional criticism. Experts argue that the Pentagon lacks jurisdiction over retired service members who speak as civilians and that the application of the Uniform Code of Military Justice to such speech is legally flawed and constitutionally problematic. Critics, including former military prosecutors and constitutional law professors, maintain that Kelly's video only described lawful versus unlawful orders and did not incite mutiny. They also emphasize that the First Amendment protects such speech, and that the case violates separation of powers principles, as members of Congress are constitutionally protected from executive overreach. The debate highlights a broader tension between military authority and civilian democratic rights in the U.S. political system.

While the trial has been delayed due to the October 7, 2023 Hamas attacks, Netanyahu continues to portray himself as a victim of a 'deep state' conspiracy.

Japarov’s close alliance with Russia, including Putin’s visit to Bishkek, further underscores Kyrgyzstan’s shifting geopolitical alignment, while Western sanctions on Kyrgyz financial institutions highlight the region’s complex international dynamics.

## Is US President Donald Trump preparing to strike Venezuela? - <small>`aljazeera`</small>

### Summary

The article reports on escalating tensions between the United States and Venezuela, following President Donald Trump’s announcement that Venezuelan airspace is 'closed'—a move that has prompted Venezuela to accuse the US of colonialism and aggression. The US has intensified pressure through military deployments, including the USS Gerald R Ford and F-35 jets, and designated the Cartel de los Soles—a group historically tied to Venezuelan military figures—as a 'foreign terrorist organization' to justify counterterrorism operations. Critics, including constitutional experts and human rights observers, argue that these actions violate international law and the US Constitution, labeling the strikes as extrajudicial killings. Despite claims of combating drug trafficking, evidence shows that Venezuela is not a major source of drugs entering the US, with Mexico and Colombia being primary actors. International allies like France, Colombia, Brazil, Russia, and China have criticized the US actions. Analysts suggest that Trump’s aggressive stance is rooted in geopolitical competition, aiming to pressure Maduro into aligning with US strategic interests, especially in countering China and Russia in Latin America. Meanwhile, Maduro has consistently advocated for peace, rejecting war and emphasizing sovereignty and national defense.

### Key Takeaways
  - The US has declared Venezuelan airspace closed, raising fears of military action against Venezuela.
  - The Trump administration has designated the Cartel de los Soles—commonly associated with Venezuelan military officials—as a 'foreign terrorist organization', enabling a counterterrorism framework to justify actions against Maduro’s government.
  - Venezuela has responded with accusations of colonialism and illegal aggression, and has conducted military drills and large-scale mobilizations in preparation for potential attacks.
  - Critics, including constitutional experts and human rights observers, argue that US military actions—especially the boat strikes—constitute extrajudicial killings and violate both the US Constitution and international law.
  - Despite claims of fighting drug trafficking, there is little evidence linking Venezuela to major drug flows into the US; Mexico and Colombia are the primary sources of fentanyl and cocaine, respectively.
  - International allies including France, Colombia, Brazil, Russia, and China have criticized the US actions, calling them illegal, aggressive, or violations of sovereignty and international norms.
  - Trump’s rhetoric and military buildup are seen as part of a broader strategy to weaken Maduro’s regime, driven by strategic competition in Latin America and a desire to align Venezuela with US interests rather than China, Russia, or Iran.
  - Maduro has consistently rejected war and called for peace, while publicly pledging to defend Venezuela against 'imperialist' threats.
  - Domestically, Trump’s policy resonates with MAGA supporters due to its alignment with anti-communist, anti-authoritarian, and border security narratives, even if it lacks legal or factual grounding.
  - The US military has deployed massive assets—including the USS Gerald R Ford, F-35 jets, and thousands of troops—to the Caribbean, signaling a significant escalation of pressure.

### Summary

Honduras is holding a highly contentious presidential election on November 30, 2025, amid widespread allegations of voter fraud. The race is tied between three major candidates: Rixi Moncada (LIBRE), Nasry Asfura (National Party), and Salvador Nasralla (Liberal Party), with Moncada threatening to reject official results if fraud is proven.

The election is critical for Honduras, a country with deep-rooted poverty, political instability, and a history of democratic challenges, where millions of voters—especially youth—hope for a peaceful and transparent outcome.

## Netanyahu writes to Israeli president requesting pardon in corruption cases - <small>`aljazeera`</small>

### Summary

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has formally requested a pardon from President Isaac Herzog for corruption charges stemming from 2019 allegations involving bribery, fraud, and breach of trust. The request, which includes documents signed by both Netanyahu and the Prime Minister, is being reviewed by the Ministry of Justice and the president’s legal advisors. Despite Netanyahu’s claims that the ongoing trial divides the country and burdens his ability to lead, legal experts say the pardon would not halt the trial, and the only way to stop proceedings is for the attorney general to intervene. The request has drawn strong opposition from the opposition, particularly Yair Lapid, who insists that a pardon requires an admission of guilt and political retirement. The situation is further complicated by the ICC’s 2024 arrest warrants for Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on war crimes and crimes against humanity charges, adding international legal dimensions to the case. The United States President Donald Trump has publicly urged the Israeli president to grant the pardon, reflecting transnational political influence.

  - The United States President Donald Trump has repeatedly urged President Herzog to pardon Netanyahu, including in a letter earlier in November and during a parliamentary address in October.
  - Despite the ceremonial role of the Israeli presidency, President Herzog has the authority to grant a pardon under unusual circumstances.
  - Legal experts, including former justice ministry director Emi Palmor, state that a pardon cannot stop the ongoing trial; the only way to halt proceedings is for the attorney general to order a halt.
  - Netanyahu claims the trial divides the country and that a pardon would help restore national unity; he also cites the three-times-per-week court appearances as a burden to governing.
  - The opposition, led by Yair Lapid, has strongly opposed the pardon request, stating that it requires an admission of guilt, remorse, and immediate political retirement.

### Summary

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has formally requested a pardon from President Isaac Herzog over ongoing corruption charges involving bribery, fraud, and breach of trust, which he has denied. The request, made public after US President Donald Trump urged a full pardon, has ignited fierce debate: opposition figures argue that a pardon without an admission of guilt or retirement from politics undermines democratic values and the rule of law, while Netanyahu claims the trial is destroying national unity and that a pardon is essential for healing and national stability. The Israeli judiciary and public are divided, with the president required to consult legal authorities before acting, and critics fearing a precedent that weakens judicial independence. Additionally, the International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant against Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant over alleged war crimes in Gaza, which Netanyahu denies and calls antisemitic, adding a complex layer to the controversy.

## Venezuela calls Trump airspace closure warning 'colonialist threat' - <small>`bbc`</small>

### Summary

In late November 2025, US President Donald Trump declared the airspace above and surrounding Venezuela as closed, prompting Venezuela to condemn the move as an illegal, colonialist threat. The Venezuelan government accused the US of attempting to depose President Nicolás Maduro, whose re-election was widely disputed. The US responded with a significant military presence, including the deployment of the USS Gerald Ford aircraft carrier and approximately 15,000 troops, citing efforts to combat drug trafficking. However, Venezuela claims these actions are politically motivated and part of a broader strategy to remove its government. The US also designated the Cartel de los Soles as a foreign terrorist organization, a move Venezuela strongly rejected. The situation escalated when the FAA issued a military activity warning, leading to airline suspensions. In response, Venezuela suspended its own take-off and landing rights and conducted coastal military drills. US lawmakers, including Chuck Schumer and Marjorie Taylor Greene, criticized Trump for bypassing Congress and violating constitutional norms on war declarations. Meanwhile, regional leaders like Colombian President Gustavo Petro criticized US actions as an attempt to dominate Latin America, while others expressed support for Trump’s stance, reflecting deep regional divisions.

### Summary

The article explores the enduring influence of Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender, on America’s elite social and political circles, revealing that despite his criminal convictions and public exposure, he maintained extensive communication with powerful figures such as Stacey Plaskett, Lord Peter Mandelson, Larry Summers, and Noam Chomsky. These exchanges, uncovered in over 20,000 pages of personal documents, show how wealth, privilege, and charisma allowed Epstein to navigate elite networks even after his 2008 conviction. Key figures like Plaskett and Mandelson were directly affected by their contact with Epstein, with Mandelson being dismissed from office and Plaskett facing public scrutiny. Larry Summers and Chomsky faced reputational fallout, illustrating how connections with Epstein carried moral and professional consequences. Howard Lutnick, who distanced himself immediately upon meeting Epstein, represents a rare instance of early rejection. The article concludes that Epstein’s network reveals a deeper cultural pattern: that power, privilege, and financial influence often override accountability, and that the fallout from such relationships continues to reverberate across politics, academia, and finance.

## Chancellor says she can be trusted with the UK's finances despite claims she misled the public - <small>`bbc`</small>

- <small>tags: `UK politics, Chancellor Rachel Reeves, fiscal policy, productivity forecast, public finances, market manipulation, financial crisis, taxation, government ethics, political controversy`</small>

### Summary

Chancellor Rachel Reeves has denied accusations that she misled the public about the UK's financial health in the lead-up to her Budget, despite claims from Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch that she used a pessimistic forecast as a 'smokescreen' to justify tax increases. Reeves maintains that she was transparent about a significant downgrade in fiscal headroom—from £9.9bn to £4.2bn—due to a productivity downgrade, and that she acted in good faith to ensure financial resilience. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) had previously indicated stronger financial conditions, including higher wage forecasts, which Reeves did not disclose. Critics, including Badenoch, argue that Reeves should resign, claiming she misrepresented the situation to manipulate market reactions and increase taxes. The controversy has prompted formal investigations by the Financial Conduct Authority into possible market abuse and by Reform UK into potential breaches of ministerial ethics. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is expected to back Reeves, stating her measures will help reduce inflation and ease cost of living pressures.

## Where did house cats come from? Ancient DNA shakes up their origin story - <small>`cnn`</small>

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/28/science/domestic-cats-origins-ancient-dna)

- <small>tags: `domestication, ancient DNA, Felis catus, African wildcat, leopard cat, Silk Road, Levant, Neolithic era, human-wildlife interaction, archaeogenetics, evolution, China, ancient Egypt, trade routes`</small>

### Summary

Ancient DNA analysis has overturned the long-held belief that domestic cats originated in the Levant during the Neolithic era. Instead, new research shows that modern domestic cats (Felis catus) originated in North Africa, with ancestors closely related to the African wildcat (Felis lybica lybica). These cats spread to Europe with the Roman Empire and to China via the Silk Road by around 730 AD. Prior to domestic cats, a different feline species, the leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis), lived in commensal relationship with humans in China for over 3,500 years, benefiting from shared environments but never becoming fully domesticated. This was likely due to its predation on chickens, which intensified after the Han Dynasty when poultry farming shifted to cage systems. Environmental changes and agricultural shifts during the turbulent period between the Han and Tang dynasties contributed to the leopard cat's retreat into natural habitats. The findings highlight the complexity of early human-animal relationships and emphasize the role of ancient trade routes and genetic studies in reshaping our understanding of domestication history.

### Key Takeaways
  - Domestic cats (Felis catus) originated in North Africa, not the Levant, as previously believed.
  - The ancestors of modern domestic cats are closely related to the African wildcat (Felis lybica lybica).
  - Ancient DNA analysis from cat skeletal remains across Europe, the Middle East, and Asia reveals that domestic cats spread to Europe with the Roman Empire about 2,000 years ago.
  - Prior to domestic cats, a different feline species — the leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis) — lived in commensal relationship with humans in China for over 3,500 years.
  - The leopard cat never became fully domesticated due to its predation on chickens, which increased conflict with human settlements after the Han Dynasty.
  - The disappearance of leopard cats coincided with environmental changes, such as a colder, drier period after the fall of the Han Dynasty, which reduced agricultural output and disrupted their niche.
  - The human-leopard cat relationship ended, and leopard cats retreated into natural forest habitats, where they remain today as elusive wild felines.

## Scientists found tryptophan, the ‘sleepy’ amino acid, in an asteroid. Here’s what it means - <small>`cnn`</small>

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/27/science/tryptophan-asteroid-bennu-nasa-sample)
- _Published: 2025-11-28 13:23:00-04:00_
- **Science & Technology**
- <small>tags: `Asteroid, Tryptophan, OSIRIS-REx, NASA, Origins of life, Extraterrestrial amino acids, Space sample return, Bennu, Prebiotic chemistry, Astronomy`</small>

### Summary

Scientists have detected tryptophan, an essential amino acid known for its role in human sleep and protein synthesis, in samples from asteroid Bennu, a space rock that formed 4.5 billion years ago and orbits near Earth every six years. This discovery, made through the NASA OSIRIS-REx mission’s return of a pristine sample in 2023, increases the known count of amino acids in space from 14 to 15 — all of which are used by living organisms on Earth. The finding supports the theory that early Earth may have received key building blocks of life from asteroids like Bennu and Ryugu. Such molecules, referred to as 'molecular fossils,' suggest that the chemistry of life began in space and was later delivered to Earth. The study, published in PNAS, underscores how sample-return missions are crucial to avoiding contamination and obtaining accurate extraterrestrial chemistry data, with researchers confirming that the tryptophan is likely not terrestrial in origin.

### Key Takeaways

## Does adolescence last until 32? Scientists unlock brain’s five eras - <small>`aljazeera`</small>

- [source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/26/does-adolescence-last-until-32-scientists-unlock-brains-five-eras)
- _Published: 2025-11-26 11:33:11+00:00_
- **Science & Technology**
- <small>tags: `brain development, adolescence, neuroscience, age of maturity, cognitive development, mental health, Western countries, white matter, grey matter, personality stability`</small>

### Summary

A new study published in Nature Communications reveals that adolescence may extend into early adulthood, lasting until around age 32 in Western countries, challenging traditional definitions. Using nearly 4,000 brain scans from individuals up to age 90, researchers identified four pivotal turning points in brain development at ages 9, 32, 66, and 83. The study finds that personality and intelligence stabilize by age 32, marking the end of a key phase of adolescence. This phase is characterized by increased white matter integrity and significant neurological change. In contrast, the brain remains stable from age 32 to 66, with no major turning points, while late-life decline begins in the 60s due to reduced white matter and increased risk of dementia and hypertension. The findings challenge existing definitions from WHO and The Lancet, suggesting adolescence is a longer, more complex biological process shaped by cultural and biological factors.

### Key Takeaways
  - Adolescence may extend beyond age 20 and continue until around 32 in Western countries, based on brain development patterns.
  - The brain undergoes five distinct phases of development, with four major turning points at ages 9, 32, 66, and 83.
  - At age 32, personality and intelligence plateau, coinciding with significant increases in white matter integrity and volume.
  - The shift at age 32 represents the most directional change in brain development compared to other life stages.
  - Adolescence is not solely defined by biological puberty but is influenced by cultural, historical, and social factors.
  - After age 32, the brain enters a long phase of stability with no major turning points until the 60s, when cognitive decline begins.
  - Decline in white matter integrity and reduced brain connectivity are observed in the early 60s, linked to dementia and hypertension.
  - The study challenges traditional definitions of adolescence (e.g., WHO’s 10–19 years or The Lancet’s 20s) by showing it extends into early adulthood.

### Summary

Australia is implementing a nationwide ban on social media platforms for users under 16, effective December 10, 2025, targeting platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, YouTube, Reddit, Twitch, X, and Kick. The policy, driven by concerns over mental health, online bullying, and exposure to harmful content—inspired by the book 'The Anxious Generation' and public campaigns like '36 Months'—requires platforms to prove they are effectively blocking underage access or face fines of up to $32 million. Tech companies like Meta and Snapchat are responding with account deactivation and feature removals. While some teens and parents welcome the change, others, especially content creators and marginalized youth, express grief and concern about losing vital social and emotional connections. Critics raise issues around age verification accuracy for borderline teens and the potential for workarounds like VPNs. The ban has drawn international attention, with countries like the UK, EU nations, and Malaysia adopting similar measures. Legal challenges are underway, and the policy has sparked a broader global conversation about digital safety, children's rights, and the balance between protection and freedom.

### Summary

Unclaimed Baggage, a store in Scottsboro, Alabama, founded in 1970, sells items from lost luggage after airlines have exhausted efforts to reunite them with owners. Airlines typically spend 90 to 120 days trying to recover lost bags, with United Airlines and Southwest confirming they send unclaimed suitcases to the store after that period. The store receives about 7,000 new items daily, including clothing, electronics, jewelry, and unusual items like shark teeth, live snakes, and even a custom NASA camera. While the store does not reunite lost items with owners, it gives them a second life through resale, donation, or charity—donating eyeglasses to the Lions Club and destroying sensitive personal data. The store reflects shifting cultural trends, from Walkmans in the 1970s to AirPods and Taylor Swift merchandise today. Customers like Vee Aronds and Wade Dubose visit for emotional, cultural, or commercial reasons, with some purchasing high-value items such as a vintage Louis Vuitton duffel or a Rolex watch sold for $32,000. Despite its focus on resale, the store maintains a sense of hope and redemption, with one known case where a woman found her lost ski boots after years of being in the store.

### Summary

Three elderly Austrian nuns — Sister Regina (86), Sister Rita (81), and Sister Bernadette (88) — returned to their former convent, Schloss Goldenstein in Salzburg, after being removed in 2023 and fleeing to a nursing home with the help of former students. The return sparked widespread public attention, with over 100,000 Instagram followers following their daily lives, including prayer, community activities, and physical exercise like boxing. After a two-year dispute, the Archdiocese of Salzburg has agreed to allow them to stay under strict conditions: closing their social media accounts, returning to a secluded monastic life, and being placed on a waiting list for nursing home care. They will receive 24-hour medical and spiritual care, but a lawyer representing the nuns says the conditions are so restrictive that he would not advise them to accept the offer. The nuns’ return has become a symbol of resistance, community, and the complex balance between institutional authority and personal autonomy in religious communities.

### Summary

Florida University has hired Tulane head coach Jon Sumrall as its new head football coach, selecting him after Lane Kiffin reportedly chose LSU. Sumrall, a 43-year-old former linebacker at Kentucky and head coach with two consecutive Sun Belt championships, signed a six-year, $44.7 million contract averaging $7.45 million annually. The move comes amid fan criticism of Athletic Director Scott Stricklin, who faced backlash for not landing Kiffin, and reflects a broader trend of recruiting from Group of Five conferences to rebuild in the competitive Southeastern Conference. Sumrall is expected to bring in an NFL-style general manager, Dave Caldwell, who has Super Bowl and AFC title game experience, to manage salary cap and transfer portal demands. The Gators, currently 4-8, are hoping Sumrall can restore success, especially after the firing of Billy Napier, who was criticized for poor performance and missteps. Sumrall’s rapid success at non-Power Five programs and his track record of reaching conference title games make him a notable hire, though it may be seen as a consolation prize by some fans.
