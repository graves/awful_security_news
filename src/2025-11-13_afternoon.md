### Summary

On Thursday, November 13, 2025, U.S. stocks plunged following the end of the longest government shutdown in history. The Dow fell 832 points, the S&P 500 dropped 1.79%, and the Nasdaq Composite slid 2.49%, with tech stocks especially hard hit. Investors reacted to a data blackout caused by the shutdown, leading to heightened uncertainty about inflation and employment data. Market sentiment deteriorated, with the Fear and Greed Index moving into 'extreme fear' and the VIX volatility index rising 20%. Expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut in December dropped sharply—from 96% to 47%—as traders assessed delayed economic data. Tech stocks like Tesla, Palantir, and Nvidia fell significantly due to concerns over overvaluation and AI momentum. The sell-off occurred amid the end of the third-quarter earnings season, reducing fundamental support and increasing market sensitivity to sentiment and data. Investors are rotating out of tech into more affordable sectors like finance and healthcare, signaling a broader reassessment of risk in the economy.

### Summary

The IRS has announced cost-of-living adjustments to retirement savings limits for 2026, increasing the 401(k) and 403(b) contribution limits to $24,500, and raising the catch-up contribution limits for those aged 50 and over to $8,000 (totaling $32,500), with even higher limits for those aged 60–63.

### Summary

In early 2025, an estimated 24% of U.S. households are living paycheck to paycheck, spending over 95% of their income on essentials. This trend, exacerbated by a widening wage gap—where low- and middle-income workers see minimal wage growth compared to high-income earners—is fueling a 'K-shaped economy' where affluent Americans thrive while lower-income families struggle. Real-life examples like Austin H. and Vanessa Jones highlight personal and financial hardship, while data from Bank of America and Fitch Ratings show rising financial distress, including increased car loan delinquency and minimum credit card payments. Experts warn that widespread financial strain could weaken consumer spending and increase unemployment risk, signaling a deepening affordability crisis rooted in inflation outpacing income gains over the past five years.

### Summary

On November 12, 2025, U.S. stocks remained near record highs, driven largely by strong performance in artificial intelligence-related companies such as Advanced Micro Devices and Nvidia.

AMD surged after CEO Lisa Su highlighted projected AI-driven revenue growth, while Nvidia and Palantir showed volatility, reflecting investor skepticism. Profitable companies like Holdings saw gains, but others like Circle Internet Group fell despite beating expectations, indicating that market sentiment outweighs fundamentals. Meanwhile, falling 10-year Treasury yields and a high probability of a Federal Reserve rate cut in December suggest favorable conditions for equities. Global markets, including Germany and South Korea, also rose, signaling broader confidence in economic recovery.

## Slow growth raises stakes even higher for the Budget - <small>`bbc`</small>

- [source](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93x5xw22n6o)

- <small>tags: `UK economy, slow growth, GDP, Jaguar Land Rover, cyber-attack, Bank of England, Budget, tax policy, consumer spending, business investment, G7, monetary policy, economic uncertainty`</small>

### Summary

The UK economy has returned to slow growth, with a 0.1% increase in the July-to-September quarter below forecasts and a contraction in September due in part to a cyber-attack on Jaguar Land Rover. While the ONS notes that flat vehicle production would have improved GDP, broader trends such as reduced consumer spending, weakened business investment, and persistent cost pressures indicate a flagging economic momentum. Despite a potential for the UK to remain one of the fastest-growing G7 economies, the upcoming Budget faces the dual challenge of providing fiscal certainty to break the cycle of policy speculation and addressing a significant fiscal gap without raising taxes excessively, particularly on workers and investors. A further Bank of England rate cut is now likely, signaling improved market confidence, but uncertainty in tax policy continues to negatively impact key sectors, especially the property market.

### Key Takeaways
  - The UK economy has returned to slow growth, with a 0.1% growth in the July-to-September quarter, below forecasts, and a contraction in September.
  - The September contraction is partly attributed to a cyber-attack on Jaguar Land Rover that disrupted car production.
  - If vehicle production had remained flat, GDP in September would have increased, indicating the cyber-attack significantly impacted economic performance.
  - Broader economic momentum has flagged, with slowdowns in consumer-facing services and business investment being key concerns.
  - High employment costs and ongoing policy uncertainty are contributing to consumer caution, reflected in high savings rates and subdued spending.
  - The Budget aims to break the cycle of speculation about tax changes by increasing fiscal buffers and reviewing borrowing rules more regularly.
  - The Budget will attempt to target tax increases away from worker pay and investors, but fiscal constraints make this difficult.
  - A further Bank of England rate cut is now likely, with potential cuts next year, as reflected in declining borrowing costs and falling mortgage rates.
  - The chancellor will use the growth figures to demand discipline from backbenchers, especially regarding difficult Budget decisions.
  - The property market has been affected by tax speculation, adding to economic uncertainty.
  - Despite strong early-year growth, the UK economy has failed to break the trend of slow growth, and no growth was recorded when adjusted for population size.
  - The UK economy may still be the second-fastest-growing G7 economy this year, but the Budget faces a challenging task: providing certainty, boosting confidence, and closing a large fiscal gap.

### Summary

Sonder, a short-term rental company based in Montreal that operated in over 40 cities, has declared bankruptcy and initiated insolvency proceedings globally after failing to meet financial obligations and technical integration challenges with Marriott. The collapse followed the termination of a key partnership with Marriott, which had allowed Sonder rooms to be booked through Marriott's Bonvoy platform. Financial strain stemmed from prolonged difficulties integrating Sonder's technology with Marriott's systems, leading to revenue decline and operational failures. Customers reported being unable to access their rooms, retrieve belongings, or receive any communication or support, especially when relying on digital access codes. Many felt betrayed because Sonder was perceived as a reliable, brand-backed option, similar to Airbnb. While Marriott said it does not charge customer cards directly and assists with refunds via credit card issuers, customers have criticized the lack of communication and support. The incident underscores risks in technology integration and brand partnerships in the short-term rental industry.

### Key Takeaways
  - Sonder, a short-term rental company founded in Montreal and operating in over 40 cities, declared bankruptcy and initiated insolvency proceedings across all its territories.

- <small>tags: `peak oil, clean energy, climate change, oil demand, LNG, data centers, artificial intelligence, International Energy Agency, U.S. policy, OPEC, energy transition, climate goals`</small>

### Summary

The International Energy Agency (IEA) has revised its outlook, predicting that global oil and natural gas demand will continue to grow through 2050, contradicting earlier projections of a peak by 2030. This shift reflects the current policies scenario, which is based on real-world government decisions rather than climate goals. The IEA forecasts oil demand to reach 113 million barrels per day by mid-century and LNG supply to grow from 560 bcm in 2024 to 1,020 bcm by 2050, driven by rising power demand from data centers and artificial intelligence. Despite global commitments to limit warming to 1.5°C, the report indicates that the world will fail to meet this target. The agency has faced criticism from the U.S. government, particularly from former Energy Secretary Chris Wright and former President Donald Trump, who dismissed the peak oil forecasts as 'nonsensical.' OPEC has also challenged the notion of peak oil, calling it 'misguided.' The article underscores a growing tension between clean energy ambitions and the continued expansion of fossil fuel and energy infrastructure.

## Why home insurance is unaffordable, even in places without wildfires or hurricanes - <small>`npr`</small>

- [source](https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5535565)

- **Environment & Climate**
- <small>tags: `climate change, home insurance, hailstorms, insurance affordability, Great Plains, Nebraska, Cozad, property damage, rising premiums, climate resilience, economic impact, insurance industry, weather disasters`</small>

### Summary

The article explores how home insurance in the central U.S., particularly in states like Nebraska, has become unaffordable due to increasing hailstorm damage linked to climate change. A severe hailstorm in Cozad, Nebraska, on June 29, 2024, caused widespread damage to homes, vehicles, and public infrastructure, with an estimated $100 million in local damage and contributing to $160 billion in nationwide insured losses from hail in 2024. Despite being a non-coastal region without hurricanes or wildfires, the central U.S. now faces some of the highest home insurance costs in the country. In Nebraska, the average cost of homeowners insurance reached nearly $6,400 — over $4,000 above the national average — due to rising premiums driven by climate-related weather events. Insurance companies are raising prices to cover repair costs, and many policies now have higher deductibles, leaving homeowners, especially seniors and small businesses, to pay much of the cost out of pocket. The article highlights personal stories of residents like the Avalos couple and Jennifer McKeone who were forced to sell properties due to unaffordable costs. While institutions like the Cozad Community Hospital are investing in resilient infrastructure to reduce future risks, the overall trend shows a growing affordability crisis in the central U.S. as climate change increases the frequency and severity of hailstorms. The financial data from the Treasury Department, AM Best, and the Insurance Information Institute underscores that rising insurance costs are not only a local issue but a national systemic problem exacerbated by climate change and inflation.

### Key Takeaways
  - Hailstorms, especially in the central U.S., are becoming more frequent and damaging due to climate change, leading to massive insured property damage.
  - The Great Plains, particularly Nebraska, now face some of the most expensive home insurance in the country, with Nebraska’s average homeowners insurance cost reaching nearly $6,400 — nearly $4,000 above the national average.
  - Insurance companies are raising premiums to cover increasing repair costs from hail, wind, and other extreme weather, with some areas seeing price increases of up to 45% in the Southern Plains.
  - Even in areas without hurricanes or wildfires, home insurance is becoming unaffordable due to the rising risk of hailstorms, which cause widespread damage to roofs, siding, and vehicles.
  - Homeowners and businesses, especially seniors and small local institutions like hospitals, are struggling to afford premiums or are forced to sell properties or cut back on maintenance due to cost burdens.
  - Insurance coverage is shrinking, with higher deductibles and reduced payout amounts for repairs like roof replacements, even after major storms.
  - Insurance companies are profiting from rising claims and disaster-related losses, with the industry reporting $26 billion in profits in 2024 after a $10 billion loss in 2023.
  - The Cozad hailstorm caused an estimated $100 million in damage to a town of just 4,000 people and contributed to an estimated $160 billion in U.S. hail-related insured damage in 2024.
  - In response to rising risks, institutions like the Cozad Community Hospital are investing in climate-resilient construction (e.g., hail-resistant roofing), showing proactive adaptation to insurance affordability crises.

- <small>tags: `Alaska, Native American rights, environmental protection, wildlife refuge, land exchange, road construction, migratory birds, subsistence, conservation litigation, climate and land use, federal environmental policy`</small>

### Summary

Alaska Native tribes and conservation groups have filed lawsuits challenging a federal land exchange that would allow a road to be built through the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge. The road, proposed to connect King Cove to Cold Bay, is seen by King Cove residents as essential for emergency medical evacuations due to unreliable weather and water travel. However, tribes and environmental groups argue that the road would threaten migratory bird populations—such as emperor geese and black brant—that are vital for subsistence and cultural continuity. The land exchange involves a transfer of approximately 490 acres to King Cove Corp and 1,739 acres to the refuge, with the corporation responsible for funding and permitting. Multiple lawsuits are being pursued by tribes like Hooper Bay, Paimiut, and Chevak, as well as conservation groups including the Center for Biological Diversity and Defenders of Wildlife, citing inadequate environmental analysis and potential harm to sensitive habitats. The U.S. Interior Department has declined to comment on the litigation.

### Key Takeaways
  - Alaska Native tribes and conservation groups are challenging a federal land exchange that would allow a road to be built through the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge.
  - The road is proposed to connect King Cove to Cold Bay via a 19-mile corridor, much of which would pass through protected wildlife habitat.

### Summary

Hundreds of Indigenous activists, including leaders from the Tupinamba community and organizers like Leo Cerda, protested at the COP30 climate summit in Belem, Brazil, demanding that their lands be protected from agribusiness, oil exploration, and illegal logging. The protest occurred as Brazil’s state-run oil company Petrobras received a license for offshore drilling near the Amazon River, contradicting Indigenous claims of land sovereignty. Despite President Lula da Silva’s public support for Indigenous voices, activists argue that more concrete action is needed. The Amazon rainforest, described as a massive carbon sink, is central to global climate stability, and Indigenous groups assert their right to be at the negotiating table. A joint statement from Indigenous communities calls for the exclusion of mining and extractive industries from the Amazon, Congo, and Borneo-Mekong basins. The protest also underscores the contrast between fossil fuel lobbying—over 5,350 lobbyists in recent years—and the call for Indigenous inclusion in climate policy, especially as COP30 coincides with the ICJ’s ruling that nations must meet climate obligations under international law. The U.S. absence from the summit further highlights global disparities in climate leadership and accountability.

### Summary

Rev. Jesse Jackson, 84, a civil rights leader and protégé of Martin Luther King Jr., has been hospitalized with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), a rare neurodegenerative disorder affecting movement and eye control. The Rainbow PUSH Coalition confirmed that Jackson has managed this condition for over a decade, having previously been diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease in 2017. Jackson has a long history of advocacy, including founding Operation PUSH in 1971 to improve economic conditions in Black communities and launching the National Rainbow Coalition in 1984 to promote equal rights. The organizations merged into the Rainbow PUSH Coalition in 1996. His health has been a public concern since 2017, with prior hospitalizations due to gallbladder surgery, Covid-19, and a fall at Howard University. In 2023, he retired as president, succeeded by Rev. Frederick Douglass Haynes III. This hospitalization underscores the ongoing health challenges faced by aging public figures and the lasting influence of civil rights leaders on social justice movements.

- <small>tags: `deportation, Gaza healthcare crisis, medical ethics, international humanitarian law, Palestinian patients, healthcare access, human rights, military actions and health, medical evacuation, Palestinian-Israeli relations`</small>

### Summary

Israeli authorities plan to deport over 89 sick Palestinian patients — including children, the elderly, and those with critical medical conditions — from East Jerusalem back to Gaza, despite the fact that Gaza's healthcare system is nearly nonfunctional due to extensive destruction. Among the patients is Yamen Al-Najjar, a 16-year-old with a rare bleeding disorder who has been in treatment since 2023. His mother, Haifa Al-Najjar, has spent two years seeking international medical evacuation, only to be confronted with the decision to return him to Gaza. The World Health Organization reports that 94% of Gaza’s hospitals are damaged or destroyed, and medical experts, including Physicians for Human Rights Israel (PHRI), have condemned the deportations as illegal and immoral under international humanitarian law. Patients like Nafez Al Qahwaji with kidney failure and Nael Ezzeddine with a heart condition express fear of immediate death in Gaza. This is not the first time such plans have been proposed — a similar attempt in March 2024 was halted by a court order. The article highlights both the humanitarian crisis and the moral responsibility of Israel, which destroyed Gaza’s healthcare infrastructure, to ensure that patients continue receiving medical care in safe and functional settings.

## FDA and HHS Reconsider Black Box Warning on Menopausal Hormone Therapy - <small>`cnn`</small>

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/health/fda-hormone-therapy-menopause-balance)

- <small>tags: `hormone therapy, menopause, black box warning, FDA decision, women’s health, medical ethics, public health policy, cardiovascular health, dementia prevention, transdermal estrogen, systemic estrogen, Women’s Health Initiative, scientific evidence, regulatory review, health policy reform`</small>

### Summary

In November 2025, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary announced the removal of the long-standing black box warning on hormone therapy for menopause symptoms, reversing a policy established in 2003 after the Women’s Health Initiative study raised concerns about heart disease and cancer risks. Makary and colleagues argue that newer evidence shows significant long-term benefits, including reduced heart disease and dementia risks, and claim hormone therapy is as impactful as vaccines. However, medical experts and advocacy groups remain deeply divided, citing flawed data, outdated studies, and a lack of new clinical trials, especially for systemic hormone therapies like pills. Critics point out that the FDA did not follow standard advisory committee procedures and that claims of broad benefits—such as preventing heart disease or extending life—exceed approved indications. The decision is particularly controversial because it removes warnings from systemic therapies while leaving only a caution for women with uteruses who take estrogen alone. Experts stress that hormone therapy should be used with caution, tailored to individual health profiles, and that non-hormonal alternatives like Veozah and Lynkuet are available. The article underscores the need for a balanced, evidence-based approach that acknowledges both benefits and risks to ensure patient safety and informed decision-making.

### Key Takeaways
  - The FDA and HHS have announced the removal of the long-standing black box warning on hormone therapy for menopause symptoms, citing new scientific evidence that shows benefits in reducing heart disease, dementia, and improving quality of life.
  - The decision was driven by a review of newer research indicating that transdermal hormone therapies (like creams and patches) may have lower risks than systemic forms (like pills), and that the original black box warning was based on flawed, outdated, or misinterpreted data.
  - Medical experts and advocacy groups remain divided, with concerns that the removal of the warning is scientifically unjustified for systemic hormone therapies (e.g., pills, injections) and could lead to overuse, especially among women without clear medical need.
  - The FDA's decision was made without convening a traditional advisory committee, raising concerns about transparency and adherence to standard regulatory processes.
  - Experts stress that hormone therapy is not a panacea — it has both benefits and risks that vary by individual health status, age, and medical history, and should be discussed on a case-by-case basis.
  - Non-hormonal alternatives for managing menopausal symptoms (such as Veozah and Lynkuet) have been FDA-approved, offering patients additional options and encouraging more balanced decision-making.
  - The removal of the warning was particularly controversial because it omitted key findings from major studies, such as randomized controlled trials showing no benefit on heart disease, and relied on older or less rigorous research.

### Named Entities
- **Robert F. Kennedy Jr.**
    - U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services
    - He publicly supported the removal of the black box warning, calling it a correction of a major medical mistake, and emphasized its importance in restoring confidence in women’s health treatments.
- **Dr. Marty Makary**
    - U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner
    - He led the FDA’s review and announced the decision to remove the black box warning, citing new evidence of long-term health benefits and calling it one of the greatest errors in modern medicine.
- **Women’s Health Initiative (WHI)**
    - Large-scale government-funded clinical trial on hormone therapy
    - The WHI study in 2002 led to the original black box warning, and its early termination and misinterpretation became a foundational reason for the 20-year restriction on hormone therapy use.
- **Black box warning**
    - FDA regulatory label indicating significant risks
    - The 22-year presence of this warning on hormone therapy products caused widespread avoidance of treatment, and its removal is central to the current debate over patient access and medical evidence.
- **Estrogen-containing products**
    - Hormone therapy treatments including pills, creams, sprays, patches, and injections
    - These products are at the center of the controversy, with different forms having varying safety profiles and benefits, and the FDA’s decision targets the class broadly.
- **Transdermal estrogen (creams, gels, patches, sprays)**
    - Topical hormone therapy applied to the skin
    - Experts argue that these forms do not significantly raise blood estrogen levels and thus may have lower cardiovascular risks than systemic forms, leading to calls for targeted warning removal.
- **Systemic estrogen (oral pills, injections)**
    - Hormone therapy that increases estrogen levels throughout the body
    - These are considered riskier due to potential links with blood clots and heart disease, and critics argue the FDA’s removal of the warning applies them too broadly, without sufficient data.
- **Vaginal estrogen**
    - Estrogen used to treat vaginal atrophy and dryness
    - For over a decade, medical groups have advocated for removing the black box warning on vaginal estrogen, which is localized and not linked to systemic risks, highlighting a key distinction in hormone therapy risk.
- **Dr. Leslie Cho**
    - Interventional cardiologist and director of Women’s Cardiovascular Center at Cleveland Clinic

- **Dr. Steven Fleischman**
    - President of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)
    - He supported the removal of the warning as it may encourage more patient-doctor discussions, but emphasized that systemic estrogen therapies have different risks and should not be used universally.
- **Nina Zeldes**
    - Health researcher at Public Citizen’s Health Research Group
    - She criticized the FDA for making unsubstantiated claims about hormone therapy's benefits and warned that such claims undermine public trust in regulatory decisions.
- **Dr. Cynthia Stuenkel**
    - Clinical professor of medicine at University of California, San Diego
    - She argued that the black box warning remains relevant for oral estrogen and systemic hormone therapies, and that a nuanced, form-specific approach is needed rather than a broad removal.
- **Dr. Stephanie Faubion**
    - Physician and medical director of Menopause Society at Mayo Clinic
    - She noted that patients are increasingly seeking hormone therapy for non-menopausal symptoms, indicating a potential overreach in public messaging and medical recommendations.
- **Veozah and Lynkuet**
    - Non-hormonal drugs approved by the FDA for managing hot flashes
    - They represent a growing range of alternatives to hormone therapy, supporting the call for balanced, individualized treatment decisions rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.
- **JAMA and JAMA Internal Medicine**

## Could COVID-19 mRNA vaccines also fight cancer? - <small>`aljazeera`</small>

- [source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/27/could-covid-19-mrna-vaccines-help-fight-cancer)

- **Health & Public Safety**
- <small>tags: `mRNA vaccines, cancer treatment, immunotherapy, cancer immunology, vaccines and disease, medical breakthrough, cancer survival, immune system, clinical trial, public health`</small>

### Summary

New research from the University of Florida and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center suggests that mRNA vaccines used to prevent COVID-19 could enhance the immune system’s ability to detect and attack cancer cells, particularly in previously hard-to-treat 'cold' tumors. By activating dendritic cells and boosting immune surveillance, the vaccines appear to improve survival rates—doubling median survival in advanced lung cancer patients and extending survival in metastatic melanoma patients. These findings, based on data from over 1,000 patients and supported by mouse experiments, are being validated in a Phase 3 clinical trial. The research is being highlighted as potentially revolutionary, with implications for designing a universal, off-the-shelf cancer vaccine. However, the results are still preliminary and not yet proven in large-scale human trials, though they represent a major shift in understanding how mRNA technology may benefit oncology beyond pandemic response.

### Key Takeaways
  - mRNA COVID-19 vaccines may enhance the immune system’s ability to detect and attack cancer cells, especially in 'cold' tumors that are traditionally hard to treat.
  - Patients with advanced lung cancer who received mRNA vaccines before immunotherapy saw a near doubling of median survival (20.6 months to 37.3 months).
  - In metastatic melanoma, vaccinated patients had median survival of over three years compared to less than two years in non-vaccinated patients.
  - The mechanism appears to involve activation of dendritic cells, which then recruit T cells to attack tumors.
  - The effect is strongest in patients with immunologically 'cold' tumors—those previously unresponsive to immune detection.
  - Combining mRNA vaccines with immune checkpoint inhibitors may create a more effective treatment strategy by activating the immune system and removing cancer’s protective shield (PD-L1).
  - Findings are preliminary and are being validated in a planned Phase 3 clinical trial.
  - The research suggests a potential future for a universal, off-the-shelf cancer vaccine based on mRNA technology.

- <small>tags: `measles outbreak, vaccination hesitancy, public health, Canada, United States, Mexico, MMR vaccine, herd immunity, global health, vaccine misinformation, Americas region, outbreaks, 2025 public health crisis`</small>

### Summary

Canada has lost its measles elimination status after a large, multi-jurisdictional outbreak began in October 2024, affecting all provinces and territories. This outbreak, along with rising cases in the US, Mexico, and the UK, has led to the loss of regional elimination status in the Americas. The primary driver is declining vaccination rates due to vaccine hesitancy, fueled by misinformation and post-pandemic distrust. The MMR vaccine, which is 97% effective, is essential for herd immunity, requiring at least 95% coverage. Experts emphasize that the region’s status is reversible through sustained vaccination programs, political commitment, and public health outreach. The outbreak has resulted in over 12,000 cases and 28 deaths across the Americas, with the US facing a January 2025 deadline to prove transmission control. This marks a significant reversal of decades of progress in global measles control.

## The Trump administration is ‘actively evaluating’ portable mortgages. What you need to know - <small>`cnn`</small>

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/homes/portable-mortgages-what-to-know)
- _Published: 2025-11-13 05:30:00-05:00_
- **Human Rights & Immigration**
- <small>tags: `housing affordability, mortgage reform, Trump administration, portable mortgages, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, mortgage-backed securities, real estate policy, homeownership, economic policy`</small>

### Summary

The Trump administration is actively evaluating a proposal for portable mortgages, which would allow homeowners to transfer their existing mortgage rates to a new property when moving. This initiative aims to increase housing supply by encouraging homeowners to relocate, thus freeing up homes for sale. However, experts raise significant concerns about the feasibility, legal complexity, and potential disruption to mortgage-backed securities markets. The Federal Housing Finance Agency, led by Director Bill Pulte, is leading the review, noting that such a system would require substantial legal and financial rework. Other proposals, like a 50-year mortgage and expanded assumable loans, are also being considered but face criticism for limited benefits and practical barriers. While the idea could theoretically improve affordability, it may not significantly increase supply and could backfire due to market instability and logistical challenges.

### Key Takeaways
  - The Trump administration is actively evaluating portable mortgages, a proposal that would allow homeowners to transfer their existing mortgage rates to a new property when moving.
  - Portable mortgages aim to address housing market supply shortages by encouraging homeowners to move, thus freeing up homes for sale and increasing availability for buyers.
  - A key challenge is that mortgage agreements are legally tied to a specific property address, making transfer difficult and potentially creating logistical and legal hurdles.
  - The proposal could disrupt mortgage-backed securities markets, as fewer loans would be paid off early, potentially increasing interest rates for investors and raising market risk.
  - Experts such as Susan Wachter and Justin Demola have expressed skepticism, noting that portable mortgages may not significantly increase supply and could backfire due to market disruption.
  - The administration is also considering a 50-year mortgage and expanding assumable loan options, though both face criticism — the 50-year mortgage for minimal savings and assumable loans for limited adoption.
  - The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), under Director Bill Pulte, is leading the evaluation of these options, with the agency stating it is studying a 'wide variety of options' to lower housing costs.

### Named Entities
- **Trump administration**
    - A U.S. government executive branch, currently headed by President Donald Trump, responsible for policy decisions and implementation.

- **50-year mortgage**
    - A proposed mortgage option with a 50-year term, currently under consideration by the administration.
    - It reflects an attempt to reduce monthly payments, though experts argue the long-term cost savings are minimal and could increase overall interest expenses.
- **assumable loans**
    - Mortgages that can be transferred to a new buyer without a new loan or rate reset, commonly available with FHA loans.
    - The administration is exploring ways to expand assumable loan availability, which may help buyers take over existing mortgages and reduce entry barriers for first-time homebuyers.
- **mortgage-backed securities (MBS)**
    - Financial instruments created by bundling mortgages and selling them to investors, which fund mortgage lending.
    - Portable mortgages could disrupt the MBS market by reducing loan prepayment rates, increasing risk and potentially raising interest rates for investors.

## Gaza girl shares story of being found alive in morgue after Israeli attack - <small>`aljazeera`</small>

- [source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/13/gaza-girl-shares-story-of-being-found-alive-in-morgue-after-israeli-attack)

- **Human Rights & Immigration**
- <small>tags: `Gaza, Israel, human rights, child trauma, war on Gaza, ceasefire, UNICEF, morgue survival, civilian casualties, mental health crisis`</small>

### Summary

A 12-year-old girl from Gaza, Raghad al-Assar, was declared dead after an Israeli attack on her home in June 2024, only to be found alive eight hours later in a morgue when a man noticed her fingers moving. Two of her sisters were killed, and she suffers from severe trauma, including nightmares and anxiety, due to the attack. Her father, Mohammed, was working at the time of the attack and learned of the destruction through a relative’s call. The broader context of Israel’s war on Gaza—spanning since October 2023—has resulted in at least 69,187 Palestinian deaths, 170,703 injuries, and the near-total collapse of Gaza’s healthcare system. Despite a ceasefire agreed in October 2023, attacks continue, with at least 260 new deaths since the truce began. The story underscores the devastating personal and systemic consequences of the conflict, especially for children and families, and highlights urgent needs for medical treatment and international humanitarian support.

### Key Takeaways
  - Raghad al-Assar, a 12-year-old girl from Gaza, was declared dead after an Israeli attack on her home in June 2024 and was found alive in a morgue after eight hours due to involuntary movement of her fingers.
  - Two of Raghad’s sisters were killed in the same attack, and her eldest sister suffers from severe injuries including burns, deep wounds, and vision loss.
  - The Israeli attack resulted in significant trauma, with Raghad suffering long-term mental health issues such as nightmares, anxiety, and panic attacks when exposed to war sounds.
  - Raghad’s father, Mohammed, was working at the time of the attack and only learned of the destruction when a relative called, leading to the family’s search for Raghad in rubble.
  - The attack has left the family in dire need of medical treatment, with Raghad and her sister hoping to receive care abroad to restore their health.

## Pointed questions and gasps in courtroom: Takeaways from hearing on fate of Trump’s handpicked prosecutor Lindsey Halligan - <small>`cnn`</small>

### Summary

The U.S. court system is under legal scrutiny regarding the appointment of Lindsey Halligan, an interim US Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, who was appointed by the White House after the previous interim attorney was pressured to pursue indictments against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James—both of whom are facing criminal charges. The dispute centers on whether the 120-day limit for interim US attorneys is a strict rule or a flexible guideline, with defense attorneys arguing that Halligan’s appointment bypassed constitutional safeguards and violated the Appointments Clause. The Justice Department counters that the appointment was within legal authority, emphasizing the attorney general’s discretion. Judge Cameron McGowan Currie raised concerns about Attorney General Pam Bondi’s lack of review of the grand jury proceedings and questioned the legitimacy of the special counsel Jack Smith’s appointment in the Florida classified documents case, where a prior judge found that Smith was improperly appointed due to lack of Senate confirmation. The judge has indicated that a final decision on Halligan’s appointment will be issued before Thanksgiving, with both trials scheduled for January 2026. This case has broader implications for executive power, separation of powers, and the role of the Senate in confirming key legal appointees.

### Summary

Lindsey Halligan, the interim U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia appointed by President Donald Trump, is at the center of a legal challenge by former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, who argue that her appointment violates federal law by exceeding the 120-day limit for interim US Attorneys. The defense claims that Halligan’s role is invalid and that a new indictment against Comey—whose statute of limitations has expired—would be impossible. The Justice Department counters that the indictments do not depend on Halligan's lawful status.

  - Both Comey and James are currently charged: Comey with false statements and obstruction of Congress; James with bank fraud and false statements related to a mortgage in Norfolk, Virginia.

## How Venezuela’s aging Soviet-era military stacks up next to US forces in the Caribbean - <small>`cnn`</small>

### Summary

The article analyzes the military imbalance between the United States and Venezuela in the Caribbean, highlighting the US’s significant naval build-up—including the USS Gerald R. Ford carrier, 15,000 troops, and advanced fighter jets—as a potential signal of military readiness in response to Venezuela’s aging Soviet-era armed forces. Venezuela’s Bolivarian National Armed Forces (FANB), bolstered by Russian weapons like Su-30 fighter jets, T-72 tanks, and anti-aircraft systems, are portrayed as politically aligned and well-known in the region, but critically weakened by over a decade of economic collapse, lack of maintenance, and a massive exodus of young, potential military personnel. Experts, including analysts from CRIES and the IISS, emphasize that Venezuela’s military has low operational capability, with its Navy particularly underdeveloped and its Bolivarian Militia largely untrained and serving more as a political and intelligence tool than a combat force. The article raises concerns about potential conflict, especially in the context of possible US military action under a leader like Donald Trump, underscoring the vulnerability of Venezuela’s outdated and poorly maintained defense infrastructure compared to the modern, technologically superior US forces.

### Key Takeaways
  - The US has significantly increased its military presence in the Caribbean, including the deployment of the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier, over 15,000 personnel, multiple warships, and 10 F-35 fighter jets, raising speculation of a possible conflict with Venezuela.
  - Venezuela’s military, the Bolivarian National Armed Forces (FANB), is largely equipped with Soviet-era Russian weapons such as Su-30 fighter jets, T-72 tanks, S-300 and Buk anti-aircraft systems, and Igla-S portable missile systems, distinguishing it from regional militaries that use more Western arms.
  - Despite its large nominal size, Venezuela's military faces serious operational deficiencies due to over a decade of economic decline, inflation, oil production drops, and US sanctions, leading to poor maintenance, lack of spare parts, and reduced combat readiness.
  - The Bolivarian Militia, claimed by Maduro to number over 8 million, is widely considered untrained and ineffective in combat, functioning more as a political and intelligence network than a viable military force.
  - The Venezuelan armed forces are politically entrenched, with high numbers of generals and admirals appointed based on loyalty rather than merit, creating a top-heavy, less professional command structure.
  - The Navy remains the weakest branch, lacking modern vessels and adequate anti-aircraft defenses, with only one frigate and one submarine in active service, and no viable anti-aircraft capability.
  - The Su-30MK2 fighters, while advanced for Latin America, have suffered multiple crashes and are plagued by maintenance issues, indicating systemic obsolescence and a lack of support infrastructure.
  - The US military build-up is seen as a strategic counterweight to Venezuela’s aging Soviet-era forces, raising concerns about regional stability and the potential for escalation.

## Timeline of US Strikes on Boats That Have Killed 80 - <small>`cnn`</small>

### Summary

The U.S. military, under the Trump administration, conducted 21 strikes between September 2 and November 10, 2025, resulting in 80 deaths and the destruction of 21 boats. The campaign was justified as an 'armed conflict' with drug cartels, with the administration labeling traffickers as 'unlawful combatants' and claiming they could act without judicial review based on a classified Justice Department finding. Targets were often linked to organizations like Tren de Aragua, and the strikes expanded from the Caribbean to the Pacific. However, no public evidence was presented to confirm narcotics presence or affiliations with terrorist groups. Survivors were briefly detained and repatriated, with some, like Andrés Fernando Tufiño Chila from Ecuador, facing controversy over their legal status. The campaign provoked strong diplomatic backlash from Venezuela, Colombia, and human rights groups, who accused the U.S. of extrajudicial killings and violating international norms. Despite the administration's claims of targeting narco-terrorists, the lack of verifiable intelligence and transparency raised serious legal and ethical concerns.

### Summary

Germany is implementing a new military service plan to strengthen its armed forces, mandating 18-year-old men to complete a suitability questionnaire and, from 2027, undergo mandatory medical screening. The plan aims to expand the Bundeswehr from 182,000 to 255,000–260,000 troops over ten years, supported by 200,000 reservists. This shift is driven by security concerns following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and concerns from the defence chief about a potential attack within four years. While the initial service is voluntary for women, men are required to participate, and compulsory enlistment remains a parliamentary option if goals are not met. Public opinion is divided, with youth strongly opposed due to safety and moral concerns. However, figures like Defence Minister Boris Pistorius and Rheinmetall CEO Armin Papperger argue that a stronger military enhances deterrence and national security. The move reflects a broader trend of European rearmament under NATO pressure, with significant financial and technological gains for Germany’s defence industry.

### Key Takeaways
  - Germany is introducing a new military service plan to increase troop numbers, requiring 18-year-old men to complete a suitability questionnaire and, from 2027, undergo mandatory medical screening.

  - Public opinion is divided, with a majority of 18- to 29-year-olds opposing mandatory service, citing personal safety and moral objections.
  - Defence Minister Boris Pistorius has stated there is no cause for fear, emphasizing that a stronger military reduces the likelihood of conflict.
  - The decision follows Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and a shift in Germany’s defence policy under Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who declared that 'the rule for German defence now has to be whatever it takes'.
  - Rheinmetall, Germany’s largest defence firm, has reported increased revenue due to European re-armament and supplies to Ukraine, with CEO Armin Papperger stating increased investment in AI, satellites, and military vehicles.
  - Armin Papperger previously claimed he was the target of a Russian assassination plot, though no confirmation was given, and he stated Europe is in a non-peaceful, hybrid or cold-war-like state.

### Summary

A gold pocket watch belonging to Isidor Straus, a wealthy American businessman and co-owner of Macy's, was recovered from the Titanic wreckage after the ship sank in 1912.

## Ukraine’s Dilemma as Pokrovsk Teeters: Save Lives or Keep Holding On - <small>`nytimes`</small>

### Summary

Ukraine is facing a critical strategic decision in the eastern city of Pokrovsk, where Russian forces are advancing and threatening to capture the city—a move that would give Russia a key platform to push further into the Donetsk region. Kyiv is torn between holding the city to inflict heavy Russian losses and risking catastrophic troop attrition or withdrawing to save lives. Past battles like Bakhmut and Avdiivka show that prolonged resistance leads to unsustainable casualties and encirclement, despite initial successes. Ukrainian commanders and analysts warn that similar patterns could repeat, especially as Russian forces exploit poor weather and tactical gaps to infiltrate. With Myrnohrad now under encirclement threat and supply lines at risk, there is growing concern that Ukraine may be repeating past mistakes. The decision to stay or retreat hinges on military capacity, political will, and the ability to adapt to rapidly changing battlefield conditions.

### Key Takeaways
  - Ukraine faces a critical strategic decision in Pokrovsk: whether to withdraw and save lives or hold on to delay Russian advances.
  - Holding cities like Bakhmut and Avdiivka initially inflicted heavy Russian losses, but prolonged resistance led to unsustainable attrition and troop exhaustion.
  - The Ukrainian military lacks capacity for prolonged urban warfare, particularly due to limitations in drone use and troop numbers in built-up areas.
  - Russian forces are exploiting poor weather and tactical gaps to gain ground, including in Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad, where encirclement threats are rising.
  - Ukrainian commanders and analysts warn that a repeat of past mistakes — such as holding positions beyond viable defense limits — could lead to catastrophic losses or collapse of key lines.
  - The political dimension of the conflict is significant: Kyiv aims to prevent Moscow from claiming victories to maintain morale and counter Western skepticism about Ukraine’s war effort.

### Summary

In a surprising move during a critical House vote to end a 43-day government shutdown, Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington accused Rep. Chuy García of Illinois of undermining democratic elections by retiring just before the next election and having his chief of staff, Patty Garcia, file to run in his place. Gluesenkamp Perez invoked procedural powers to sanction García, accusing him of 'anointing an heir' and violating the principles of free and fair elections. García defended his decision, citing personal grief and family responsibilities, and stated he followed all state filing rules. Critics, including Sen. Andy Kim, called the move undemocratic, while others, like Rep. Delia Ramirez, defended García as a devoted public servant and argued the criticism was politically motivated, especially given Gluesenkamp Perez’s vote against a key health care provision. The incident highlights deep internal divisions within the Democratic Party during a time of national political strain.

## The Political Danger of the Epstein Files for Trump - <small>`cnn`</small>

### Summary

The article analyzes how newly released emails between Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell reveal alleged connections between Trump and Epstein, including claims that Trump spent time with victim Virginia Giuffre and was aware of Maxwell's recruitment of minors from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort. Although no criminal charges have been filed against Trump, the emails and Trump’s political response—such as resisting a House petition to release the full Epstein files and holding a Situation Room meeting to pressure GOP lawmakers—have heightened public suspicion. Despite limited public attention, polling shows widespread disapproval of Trump’s handling of the issue, low trust in the administration’s transparency, and a significant portion of Americans willing to believe Trump had criminal involvement, which poses a serious political danger to his credibility and legitimacy.

### Key Takeaways
  - Trump has not been accused of wrongdoing related to Jeffrey Epstein, but the release of new emails suggests he had close contact with Epstein and was aware of Epstein’s activities involving minors.
  - The emails indicate Epstein expressed surprise that Trump’s name had not surfaced in accusations and noted that Trump had spent hours with Virginia Giuffre at Epstein’s house.
  - In 2019, Epstein reportedly stated that Trump knew about Maxwell recruiting girls from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort, saying 'of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop.'
  - Virginia Giuffre, who died by suicide, acknowledged meeting Trump and has not accused him of wrongdoing.
  - Trump acknowledged being aware of Maxwell recruiting employees from Mar-a-Lago, but the key issue is whether he knew such recruitment involved minors like Giuffre.
  - Trump's administration resisted a House petition to release the full Epstein files, leading to criticism over lack of transparency.
  - The White House held a Situation Room meeting with a GOP lawmaker, raising concerns about political maneuvering and perceived obstruction.
  - Despite no Republican removing their name from the petition, Trump publicly pressured Republicans to withdraw, deepening public suspicion of a cover-up.
  - Americans broadly disapprove of Trump’s handling of the Epstein files: 57% disapprove vs. 19% approve in a Reuters-Ipsos poll.
  - Only 44% of Republicans approved of Trump's handling; 33% of Republicans believe he hasn’t gone far enough to investigate the matter.
  - A majority of Americans (26%) are willing to rule out that Trump engaged in criminal activity with Epstein, even though no charges have been filed.
  - Low trust in the administration's transparency: 63% of Americans and 38% of Republican-leaning Americans distrust the administration's statements.
  - 73% of Americans (per Quinnipiac poll) believe the Justice Department is not being transparent about the investigation.

## Judge Orders Release of Hundreds Arrested in Illinois Immigration Crackdown - <small>`cnn`</small>

### Summary

A federal judge, Jeffrey Cummings, ordered the release of 615 individuals arrested during Operation Midway Blitz, a Trump administration-led immigration crackdown in Illinois between June 2025 and October 2025. The ruling, supported by the National Immigrant Justice Center and ACLU, finds that the arrests violated a 2022 settlement agreement banning warrantless detentions in Chicago, with federal agents conducting mass arrests without judicial oversight. The decision directly challenges the administration’s approach to mass detention, especially targeting vulnerable individuals like educators and families. The case gained national attention after the arrest of teacher Diana Galeano, whose detention was later ruled unlawful by another judge, highlighting concerns about constitutional rights, racial profiling, and the use of force. Senior Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino faced criticism for aggressive tactics and false claims of violence, with Judge Sara Ellis issuing a preliminary injunction against such practices. DHS responded by calling the ruling dangerous, but the court’s decision marks a significant legal setback for federal deportation efforts and reinforces public and legal skepticism of mass immigration enforcement.

  - Judge Sara Ellis issued a preliminary injunction against the use of force by Bovino, citing false claims of tear gas use and misconduct.

### Summary

The Trump administration has designated four European Antifa groups — Antifa Ost, FAI/FRI, Revolutionary Class Self-Defense, and Armed Proletarian Justice — as Specially Designated Global Terrorists, placing them in the same category as ISIS-K and al-Shabaab. This move follows President Donald Trump’s September 2025 order to classify Antifa as a domestic terrorist organization. The U.S. State Department cites a range of violent actions, including bombings, attacks on government offices, and threats against political and economic institutions, as justification. The designation includes specific incidents in Germany, Italy, and Greece, with the groups accused of promoting anti-American, anti-capitalist, and anti-Christian ideologies. As a result, U.S. assets linked to these groups will be blocked, and American citizens are prohibited from knowingly supporting them. This policy reflects a broader effort by the administration to counter what it views as violent, ideologically driven left-wing movements.

### Summary

State attorneys general from North Carolina and Utah, along with major tech companies OpenAI and Microsoft, have formed a joint AI Safety Task Force to develop voluntary safeguards for AI developers. The initiative aims to protect users—especially children—from harmful content and unintended psychological effects such as delusions or self-harm. With no comprehensive federal AI regulation in place and Congress showing limited action, the task force fills a critical policy gap by fostering collaboration between state regulators, industry leaders, and law enforcement. While the safeguards are voluntary, the task force enables coordinated legal action if companies cause harm.

### Summary

British journalist Sami Hamdi, a political commentator and human rights defender, was detained for over two weeks by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) after speaking out about Israel’s war in Gaza. He claims he was targeted not for visa violations but for his critical reporting on the humanitarian crisis, which he describes as a genocide. During detention, he alleged inhumane conditions, including being held in a small cell with over 80 people and forced to wait hours for medical care, while being shackled without charges. Hamdi argues that the detention represents an attack on free speech and the right to report on global atrocities. The incident is linked to a broader pattern under the Trump administration of revoking visas and detaining pro-Palestinian foreign nationals, such as student Momodou Taal. Critics, including CAIR and activist Hussam Ayloush, claim the action reflects an abuse of power and undermines the rule of law. The article also notes that an independent UN inquiry concluded Israel committed genocide in Gaza, a claim Israel denies, adding context to the moral weight of the reporting.

### Summary

Gisella Cardia and her husband Gianni Cardia, a self-styled clairvoyant couple from Rome, have been charged with fraud after years of drawing large numbers of Catholic pilgrims to a field shrine dedicated to the Madonna of Trevignano, where they claimed the statue wept blood and multiplied food such as gnocchi and pizza. Between 2018 and 2024, they collected nearly €400,000 from devotees, promising it would go to a children’s hospital, but prosecutors allege the funds were misused for personal expenses like a $40,000 car and site improvements. Forensic testing confirmed that blood found in a coffin linked to a reported confrontation matched Gisella Cardia’s DNA, suggesting the blood was staged. The Vatican dismissed the claims as not supernatural. The couple is set to face trial in April 2025, and their lawyer describes the trial as a necessary step to clarify the facts and end public speculation.

### Summary

Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt commuted the death sentence of Tremane Wood, a death row inmate convicted of participating in a 2002 robbery that resulted in the stabbing and death of 19-year-old Ronnie Wipf, to life in prison without parole. The decision follows a 3-2 recommendation from the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board, which cited ineffective trial representation and prosecutorial misconduct, including concealed witness plea deals. Wood’s attorney, Amanda Bass Castro Alves, argued that his brother Zjaiton Wood, who confessed to the murder, was the actual killer, and that Tremane Wood was unfairly treated at trial. Despite the U.S. Supreme Court denying a request to halt execution, the governor cited both the victim’s family’s wishes and the severity of the crime in justifying the commutation. The decision marks the second time Stitt has granted clemency in nearly seven years, sparking debate over justice, fairness, and the role of mercy in capital punishment.

A court transcript reveals Mindich allegedly mentioned Zelensky’s influence in decision-making, marking the first indirect reference to the president in such a case. The situation is intensified by ongoing power cuts and heating outages, driven by Russian attacks on power plants. Despite public trust in Zelensky remaining at around 60%, critics warn that the scandal could damage his legitimacy, especially if Western allies perceive it as a failure of governance. The National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) has conducted extensive investigations and property searches. International actors like the American Chamber of Commerce stress accountability as vital to Ukraine’s credibility and long-term support.

## Border Patrol Headed to Charlotte, North Carolina? Officials Say They Were Left in the Dark - <small>`cnn`</small>

### Summary

Gregory Bovino, the top U.S. Border Patrol official under the Trump administration, is reportedly moving to Charlotte, North Carolina, as part of a broader campaign to deploy federal immigration enforcement in Democratic-led cities. Local officials, including City Councilmember Malcom Graham and Mayor Vi Lyles, have been kept in the dark and express frustration over the lack of prior communication. The move has sparked widespread fear among residents, especially given viral videos of violent immigration sweeps in other cities and the recent stabbing of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska in Charlotte, which Trump cited to advocate for 'law and order' in the city. Although Charlotte is far from the U.S. border and has not previously been singled out, it has become a target due to its large immigrant population and political alignment with Democrats. The state government, led by Governor Josh Stein, has called for transparency and coordination, but federal authorities have not confirmed or coordinated with local entities. The situation echoes past operations in cities like Chicago, where officials were blindsided and residents felt vulnerable. The Carolina Migrant Network reports increased ICE activity and fear, prompting them to prepare for potential enforcement. Bovino’s personal ties to North Carolina, including his education and upbringing in the region, suggest a deeper connection to the city, and his public endorsement of visiting Charlotte underscores the political significance of the operation.

  - Local officials have emphasized that federal operations should be coordinated with state and local authorities to avoid fear and disruption, and that such coordination has not yet occurred.
  - Although Charlotte is not near a U.S. border, it has been selected due to political symbolism and the Trump administration’s broader campaign against Democratic-led cities.

### Summary

Newly released emails from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate reveal that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, the former Duke of York, repeatedly pleaded with Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell in 2011 to confirm he had no involvement in alleged sexual trafficking activities involving Virginia Giuffre. The emails, dated March 2011, show Andrew expressing distress over a newspaper report claiming he had met Giuffre in London, New York, and on Epstein’s private island, Little St. James, where she allegedly participated in an orgy with underage girls. Giuffre, who died by suicide in April 2024, had long accused Andrew of sexual activity with her while underage. Andrew denied all allegations and reached an out-of-court settlement with her in 2022. The revelations have prompted renewed scrutiny, especially after the U.S. House Oversight Committee released the documents. The article also highlights Peter Mandelson’s continued contact with Epstein as late as 2016, leading to his dismissal as Britain’s ambassador to the U.S. The connections between high-profile figures and Epstein’s network have raised broader concerns about accountability, vetting, and the role of politics in enabling criminal activity.

## The government shutdown is over. Here’s what travelers need to know about Thanksgiving flights - <small>`cnn`</small>

### Summary

The US government shutdown, which ended on November 13, 2025, caused significant disruptions to air travel due to staffing shortages, particularly among air traffic controllers. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reduced flights at 40 major airports by 6%, a cut paused after improved staffing levels. Despite the end of the shutdown, airlines like Delta and the trade group Airlines for America anticipate a return to full capacity within days, though residual disruptions may persist into the Thanksgiving period. Experts warn that long-term staffing shortages—exacerbated by an increase in daily retirements from 4 to 15–20—will continue to impact air travel. Travelers are advised to prepare by enabling flight alerts, researching alternatives, using loyalty points or miles for backup tickets, and considering car rentals for short regional routes. While most travel insurance policies do not cover known government shutdowns, those with 'Cancel For Any Reason' coverage offer more protection. A key takeaway is that travelers should act proactively—such as switching to Amtrak or other modes—before disruptions occur to avoid stress and uncertainty during the holiday season.

### Key Takeaways
  - Flight schedules will not return to normal immediately after the government shutdown ends due to lingering staffing shortages and operational delays.
  - The FAA reduced flights at 40 major airports by 6% due to air traffic controller shortages, but this cut has been paused as staffing levels have improved.
  - Airlines like Delta expect to return to full capacity in the days following the shutdown, though residual disruptions may persist into Thanksgiving.
  - A longstanding air traffic controller shortage worsened during the shutdown, with an increase from 4 to 15–20 retirements per day, which will affect travel well beyond the shutdown period.
  - Travelers should prepare by downloading airline apps, enabling notifications, researching alternatives, and having a backup plan, especially for domestic flights departing after 9 a.m.
  - Flight cancellations are not typically due to passenger demand, but due to flight reductions (not seat or passenger reductions), meaning fewer flights than seats are operated.
  - Travelers should consider using loyalty points or miles to purchase a backup ticket and avoid basic economy fares, which may not be eligible for future waivers.
  - A one-way car rental has become a viable alternative, especially for short regional routes, as regional jets are among the first to be canceled.
  - Travel insurance coverage for events like government shutdowns is often limited or excluded unless explicitly covered under 'Cancel For Any Reason' or 'Interruption For Any Reason' policies.
  - Some travelers have proactively switched to alternative modes of travel (e.g., Amtrak) to avoid stress and uncertainty during the holiday period.

### Summary

The government shutdown, which lasted 43 days and ended on November 13, 2025, has not restored normal operations. Despite reopening, federal agencies face massive backlogs, unpaid wages, and ongoing disruptions.

## Flying Will Stay Rough After the Shutdown. Why? Spirit Airlines - <small>`cnn`</small>

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/13/business/holiday-travel-spirit-airlines)

### Summary

Spirit Airlines, once a major force in setting low fares across the U.S. airline industry, is now significantly downsized due to financial strain and ongoing bankruptcy reorganization. Despite recent government-mandated flight cancellations ending, Spirit’s holiday schedule has shrunk by nearly one-third, reducing its flight count by 11,000 and eliminating nearly 2 million available seats. This reduction weakens its influence on pricing, allowing major carriers like American, Delta, and United to raise fares—leading to a projected 6% increase in Thanksgiving week and 7% rise during the holiday period. While Spirit remains operational, its diminished presence and financial instability suggest a long-term shift in the airline market, where consumer savings from Spirit’s no-frills model are no longer being realized.

### Key Takeaways
  - Spirit Airlines has drastically reduced its flight schedule, losing nearly 2 million available seats due to a one-third reduction in routes, affecting the overall pricing landscape of U.S. domestic flights.
  - The decline in Spirit’s operations has diminished its downward pressure on airline fares, leading to higher prices for consumers during the holiday season, with domestic flights expected to rise 6% by Thanksgiving and 7% by year-end.
  - Spirit Airlines has been in financial distress since 2020 and is currently in its second bankruptcy reorganization, with substantial doubt over its ability to remain operational in the next 12 months.
  - Even though Spirit is not shutting down immediately, its reduced route presence has led to a significant decrease in overlap with other major carriers, weakening its historical influence on pricing.
  - Spirit Airlines previously saved consumers hundreds of millions of dollars, and its CEO emphasized its critical role in making air travel more affordable.

## Black Soldiers in WWII Removed From U.S. Military Cemetery Spark Local Outcry - <small>`cnn`</small>

### Summary

During World War II, Black soldiers like Jefferson Wiggins were tasked with burying American soldiers in Margraten, Netherlands, despite facing systemic racism and being excluded from combat roles. In 2024, a panel highlighting their contributions was installed at the cemetery’s visitor center, but it was removed in March 2025 by the American Battle Monuments Commission (ABMC) after an internal review. The removal sparked outrage from Dutch officials, including the mayor of Eijsden-Margraten and the Limburg Province, who argue that the panel was intended to be permanent and represents a vital part of shared history. Janice Wiggins, the widow of Wiggins, advocated for its inclusion after discovering no mention of Black soldiers’ service in the exhibits. The ABMC claims the panel was removed due to content being outside its commemorative mission, though no external consultation occurred. The case raises broader concerns about the representation of African American service members in U.S. military history, especially given the 1973 fire that destroyed records of many soldiers. Efforts are ongoing to reinstate the panels, with appeals being made to U.S. diplomatic representatives.

### Summary

A peace agreement between Thailand and Cambodia, brokered by US President Donald Trump and signed in Kuala Lumpur in October 2025, is collapsing after a deadly clash on November 12, 2025, in a border village in Banteay Meanchey province.

### Summary

The article details how Donald Trump is being drawn deeper into the Jeffrey Epstein scandal through newly released emails that reference his connections with Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. These emails, including one from April 2011, indicate that Epstein described Trump as 'borderline insane' and noted his presence at Epstein’s home. Despite White House denials of wrongdoing, officials such as Attorney General Pam Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche have engaged in actions—such as meeting with Maxwell and releasing transcripts—that appear designed to suppress the narrative. This has sparked political controversy, with Republican lawmakers like Nancy Mace and Tim Burchett publicly backing the release of Epstein files, signaling growing internal dissent. The situation has also led to broader political fallout, including the dismissal of UK royal family members and political figures due to ties to Epstein, demonstrating the scandal’s global reach.

### Summary

U.S. lawmakers, including Representatives Raja Krishnamoorthi and Joe Courtney, have demanded answers from the Trump administration over reports that Chinese firms are supplying Iran with sodium perchlorate— a key precursor in ballistic missile propellants—since late September 2025. The shipments, totaling approximately 2,000 tons and delivered to Iran’s Bandar Abbas port, are seen as a direct violation of UN sanctions reinstated in September 2025, which prohibit support for Iran’s ballistic missile programs. The chemicals, though not explicitly named in the UN ban, are precursors to ammonium perchlorate, which is explicitly banned. China denies direct involvement, citing adherence to international obligations and opposition to sanctions. The situation raises concerns about coordination between China, Iran, Russia, and North Korea, especially amid recent diplomatic talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Several vessels involved in the shipments are under U.S. sanctions, and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps is believed to be procuring the materials. The U.S. government's prior sanctions on Chinese and Iranian entities have been questioned as ineffective, prompting congressional calls for a stronger response and greater transparency.

### Key Takeaways
  - Chinese firms are reportedly shipping sodium perchlorate, a key missile propellant precursor, to Iran from late September to mid-October 2025.
  - The shipments amount to approximately 2,000 tons and could provide enough chemical for around 500 ballistic missiles, indicating significant rebuilding of Iran’s missile arsenal.
  - The deliveries occur despite UN sanctions reinstated in September 2025, which prohibit international support for Iran’s ballistic missile programs and nuclear delivery systems.
  - Sodium perchlorate is a direct precursor to ammonium perchlorate, a material explicitly banned by UN sanctions for use in ballistic missiles.
  - China and Iran maintain a long-standing diplomatic and economic alliance, with Chinese entities using a network of vessels to facilitate shipments, some of which are under U.S. sanctions.
  - Several cargo ships and Chinese entities involved in these shipments are under U.S. sanctions, suggesting possible violation of export controls and international sanctions.
  - China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated it is following export controls and opposes sanctions, arguing that such measures hinder diplomatic solutions to the Iranian nuclear issue.
  - The Trump administration previously imposed sanctions on entities in China and Iran involved in missile propellant procurement, but the new shipments suggest a failure to deter Chinese support.
  - The shipments raise concerns about emerging coordination between China, Iran, Russia, and North Korea, especially amid recent high-level diplomatic talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

### Summary

President Donald Trump signed a bipartisan funding bill on November 12, 2025, ending a 43-day government shutdown—the longest in U.S. history.

### Summary

Newly released emails from Jeffrey Epstein's estate, obtained by the House Oversight Committee, include references to Donald Trump, suggesting he was aware of Epstein’s activities involving minors. In a 2011 email, Epstein calls Trump the 'dog that hasn't barked,' referencing a conversation with a victim—identified as Virginia Giuffre—who reportedly spent hours with Trump at Epstein’s house. A 2019 email indicates Trump asked Ghislaine Maxwell to stop recruiting at Mar-a-Lago, implying knowledge of the activities. In 2015, Epstein and author Michael Wolff discuss strategies to deflect questions about Trump’s ties to Epstein, including suggesting Trump deny having been on Epstein’s plane or at his home. These emails deepen questions about Trump’s awareness and potential involvement in Epstein’s operations, especially given Trump’s past evasive statements. The White House denies any wrongdoing and claims the emails prove nothing, but the revelations have intensified scrutiny and raised concerns about a possible cover-up. The emails also challenge Ghislaine Maxwell’s claims of not knowing Trump or his connections to Epstein, and suggest Epstein and Wolff viewed the information as politically damaging. The timeline of these emails coincides with heightened political scrutiny of Epstein’s case, including investigations into the DOJ’s handling of his case and the potential for a cover-up.

  - The emails suggest Epstein and Michael Wolff believed that information about Trump’s ties to Epstein could be used to damage his political image or reputation, especially during the 2016 election cycle.
  - Virginia Giuffre, a prominent Epstein survivor, claims she had spent time with Trump at Mar-a-Lago and that Trump referred to her working for his friends, raising questions about awareness of the nature of the recruitment.
  - The White House and Trump administration dismissed the emails as proof of wrongdoing, claiming they 'prove absolutely nothing' and accused Democrats of selectively leaking the documents to create a 'fake narrative'.

### Summary

Congress is passing a compromise bill to end a prolonged federal government shutdown by providing funding for most federal agencies through January 30, 2026, while excluding full-year funding for all agencies. The bill fully funds food assistance programs including SNAP and WIC, replenishes key contingency funds, and ensures retroactive pay for nearly 1.4 million furloughed federal workers. It also includes significant security funding for lawmakers, the Capitol Police, and Supreme Court justices. A key point of compromise is that the bill does not guarantee extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies, which will be voted on next month. The legislation reverses staffing reductions and prevents further layoffs, while also requiring the Justice Department and FBI to notify lawmakers when they are under investigation—following revelations about the 'Arctic Frost' probe. This bipartisan effort reflects both the urgency of restoring federal operations and the complex political negotiations that define the current legislative landscape.

## The Epstein files petition now has its 218th signature. What happens next? - <small>`cnn`</small>

### Summary

Adelita Grijalva’s swearing in as a U.S. Representative provided the final signature needed to activate a discharge petition that would force a vote in the U.S. House on a bill to compel the release of Jeffrey Epstein’s case files. The petition, led by Republican Thomas Massie and Democrat Ro Khanna, aims to overcome leadership resistance and ensure accountability by forcing transparency on Epstein-related crimes. While Speaker Mike Johnson has committed to bringing the bill to the floor next week, the effort faces significant challenges, including Republican skepticism, with Senate Majority Leader John Thune and former attempts by Chuck Schumer indicating that the bill is unnecessary due to prior document releases. The measure would still need approval by the GOP-controlled Senate—currently unlikely given opposition—and faces strong opposition from President Donald Trump, who has criticized the effort. Despite these hurdles, the House vote would mark a symbolic and political milestone, forcing Republicans to confront their stance on transparency versus loyalty to the executive branch.

### Key Takeaways
  - Adelita Grijalva's swearing in provided the 218th and final signature required to activate a discharge petition forcing a vote on a bill to compel the release of the Jeffrey Epstein case files.
  - The discharge petition, spearheaded by Republican Thomas Massie and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, is designed to bypass leadership opposition and force a floor vote, even if the bill is unlikely to pass.

  - The bill would still need approval by the GOP-controlled Senate, which currently lacks interest, with Majority Leader John Thune stating it is 'not sure what that achieves' and previous attempts to pass similar legislation being blocked.
  - The effort faces significant hurdles, including procedural delays, potential delays by leadership, and a lack of bipartisan consensus, especially given the Justice Department's prior release of thousands of pages related to the Epstein case.
  - Even if passed by the House, the bill would require 60 votes in the Senate to advance, which is unlikely given Republican opposition.
  - The issue is politically sensitive, as President Donald Trump has publicly opposed the effort, forcing Republicans to choose between aligning with the President or supporting transparency on Epstein-related crimes.

### Summary

In a high-profile case involving the June 14, 2025, killings of Minnesota lawmakers Melissa and Mark Hortman and John and Yvette Hoffman, Vance Boelter, a 58-year-old politically conservative evangelical, was charged with murder and attempted murder. Prosecutors have turned over over 130,000 pages of documents, over 800 hours of audio and video, and 2,000 photographs, which the defense says is overwhelming and has delayed review due to a federal shutdown. Boelter claims he was conducting an undercover investigation into alleged vaccine-related deaths and opened fire when people tried to push him out the door, but state officials have dismissed this narrative. The case, framed as a political assassination, has sparked debate about federal capital punishment, as Minnesota has abolished the death penalty since 1911. The U.S. Attorney General, Pam Bondi, has not yet decided whether to seek the death penalty, and the next court hearing is scheduled for February 12, 2025.

### Key Takeaways
  - Prosecutors have turned over over 130,000 pages of PDF documents, over 800 hours of audio and video recordings, and over 2,000 photographs related to the June 14 killings of Melissa Hortman, her husband Mark, John Hoffman, and his wife Yvette.

  - The case is being handled federally, despite Minnesota having abolished capital punishment in 1911, and the Trump administration's push for expanded federal death penalties is noted as a background context.
  - Boelter’s attorney has not commented on the substance of the allegations, and the defense has reported significant delays in reviewing the massive volume of evidence due to the federal government shutdown.

### Summary

On November 12, 2025, the Department of Homeland Security reported that Border Patrol agents in Chicago’s Little Village neighborhood were shot at during an immigration enforcement operation, with a suspect from Mexico arrested. The incident occurred around 9:30 a.m. when a man in a black Jeep fired at agents, who were reportedly 'boxed into a street and alleyway' by a hostile crowd. Although no agents were injured, the incident intensified public outrage. Federal agents were also accused of using flash-bang grenades and pepper spray without warning, with eyewitnesses, including Alderman Mike Rodriguez and Pastor Matt DeMateo, claiming they didn’t hear any prior warnings. A federal judge, Sara Ellis, previously ruled that Border Patrol Chief Greg Bovino lied about being hit by a rock and using tear gas, calling the government’s claims 'simply not credible.' The Trump administration appealed this ruling, raising legal and political tensions. Local officials and community leaders condemned the operations as provocative, illegal, and violent, calling them 'state-sponsored terrorism' and advocating nonviolent resistance. The conflict reflects a broader national debate over federal immigration enforcement, civil liberties, and the legitimacy of state violence against peaceful protesters.

### Summary

Dana Williamson, a former top aide and chief of staff to California Governor Gavin Newsom, has been indicted on 23 federal charges, including bank and wire fraud, tax fraud, and false statements, for allegedly stealing over $225,000 from Xavier Becerra’s dormant campaign account through a scheme involving Sean McCluskie, his former chief of staff.

The scheme continued even after Williamson joined Newsom’s administration, and she is also accused of falsifying tax returns to claim over $1 million in personal expenses as business deductions. McCluskie pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges and agreed to pay $225,000 in restitution. The investigation, which began under the Biden administration, raises serious questions about campaign finance integrity, political accountability, and the ethics of public service. Becerra, a former U.S. health secretary and California attorney general, is not implicated in the charges.

## Speaker Johnson’s narrow majority shrinks further after Democrat Adelita Grijalva sworn in - <small>`cnn`</small>

- <small>tags: `House of Representatives, narrow majority, government shutdown, Jeffrey Epstein files, political instability, bipartisan petition, Congressional vacancy, Speaker Mike Johnson, democratic gains, Republican challenges`</small>

### Summary

Following a week-long delay, Democratic Representative Adelita Grijalva was sworn in as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, reducing Speaker Mike Johnson’s narrow Republican majority to 219 to 214 Democrats. This shift, occurring amid the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, creates significant legislative challenges for Republicans, who now face a razor-thin margin and increased vulnerability on party-line votes. The swearing-in enables a high-profile vote to compel the release of Jeffrey Epstein case files, driven by bipartisan petitions from Reps. Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna. The current House composition—narrower than any since the Great Depression—is further complicated by two vacant seats (Tennessee and Texas), with both expected to be filled by special elections in the coming months. Historically, such tight majorities have led to instability, with past Congresses experiencing shifts due to resignations and deaths. This fragile balance makes the passage of key legislation, such as Trump’s tax and spending cuts, extremely difficult, as seen in previous failed votes involving Republican dissent.

### Key Takeaways
  - House Speaker Mike Johnson’s narrow majority has been reduced further after the swearing-in of Democrat Adelita Grijalva, now making the House’s partisan balance 219 Republicans and 214 Democrats.
  - The House majority is the narrowest in nearly 100 years, creating significant challenges for Republican legislative efforts and increasing the risk of failure on key votes.
  - The swearing-in of Grijalva, which was delayed for weeks, is expected to enable a critical vote on the release of Jeffrey Epstein case files through a bipartisan petition led by Rep. Thomas Massie and Rep. Ro Khanna.
  - A tie vote in the House results in failure, and the required majority for passage is 218 if all 435 seats are present and voting, making the current margin extremely fragile.
  - Two House seats are still vacant: one in Tennessee (expected to be filled by special election next month) and one in Texas (runoff scheduled early next year).
  - The previous House majority of 219 to 215 was reduced due to former GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz’s resignation, and the current dynamic reflects an ongoing shift in party control due to vacancies and special elections.
  - Historically, such narrow majorities have led to instability, with past Congresses experiencing shifts in control due to deaths, resignations, and special elections.

## The Last Penny Was Minted in Philadelphia Today — A 238-Year Legacy Ends - <small>`cnn`</small>

- <small>tags: `penny discontinuation, U.S. Mint, currency policy, retail challenges, economic sustainability, historical coins, exact change laws, consumer cost, monetary policy, retail regulations`</small>

### Summary

The U.S. Mint in Philadelphia minted the final U.S. penny on November 12, 2025, marking the end of a 238-year tradition that began in 1787. The decision to stop producing pennies was initiated by President Donald Trump in February 2025, citing high production costs—nearly four cents per coin, exceeding its face value. Despite being phased out, the penny remains legal tender. However, its removal has caused significant logistical and financial challenges for retailers, who face legal risks from rounding prices or failing to provide exact change, especially for SNAP recipients. Some states and cities enforce exact change laws, and consumer costs increase due to rounding, estimated at $6 million annually. Advocacy groups like Americans for Common Cents argue for better transition planning, noting that countries like Canada and Australia had clear policies in place. The penny's legacy includes historical significance, such as Benjamin Franklin’s design and the 1909 Lincoln cent, and personal nostalgia, as seen in memories shared by individuals like Joe Ditler. While public outcry is muted, the discontinuation underscores broader challenges in U.S. monetary policy and retail adaptation.

The move is seen as a political alignment with Russia, particularly given President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev’s recent meetings with Vladimir Putin in Moscow, and has sparked debates about Kazakhstan’s sovereignty and commitment to human rights and non-discrimination.

## Rumors swirl of a plot to oust Keir Starmer as the embattled British leader denies attacking his rivals - <small>`cnn`</small>

- <small>tags: `UK Politics, Labour Party, Leadership Crisis, Keir Starmer, Wes Streeting, Budget Announcement, Public Approval, Political Rivalry, Internal Party Conflict, Tax Policy`</small>

### Summary

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is facing a major political crisis after rumors emerged that senior Labour Party members, including Health Secretary Wes Streeting, are being briefed against him as part of a potential leadership challenge. Starmer denied authorizing such briefings, asserting that attacks on cabinet members are unacceptable and that he appointed them for their expertise. The timing of the reports—just before a crucial budget announcement that may involve tax increases—has intensified public and political scrutiny. Starmer’s popularity has collapsed, with only 17% of Britons approving of his leadership, and the situation raises serious questions about party cohesion, internal control, and leadership stability. A 'Wes for Leader' website suggests Streeting may be seeking to challenge Starmer, though he denies any intention to do so. This crisis follows a previous failed leadership bid by Andy Burnham and comes amid broader political tensions with opposition figures like Kemi Badenoch and Nigel Farage, who are likely to exploit the government’s fiscal and cultural controversies.

### Key Takeaways

  - The internal political crisis threatens the stability of Labour's governing operation and raises questions about Starmer's control over cabinet appointments and party dynamics.
  - Historically, ousting a Labour leader requires 80 MPs to support a challenger, making a leadership change politically difficult despite the current unrest.

### Summary

Donald Trump has threatened to sue the BBC for $1 billion over alleged defamatory and misleading edits in a documentary titled 'Trump: A Second Chance?' that aired in October 2024. The documentary, part of the BBC’s 'Panorama' series, was criticized for splicing together two different comments from Trump’s January 6, 2021 speech—where he said he would 'cheer on' lawmakers and later said he would 'fight like hell'—to create a false impression of incitement. A leaked memo from former BBC adviser Michael Prescott accused the broadcaster of editorial missteps, including misleading edits, which led to internal criticism and a public apology by BBC Chair Samir Shah. In response, BBC leadership—including Director General Tim Davie and CEO Deborah Turness—resigned amid growing pressure over editorial integrity and perceived bias. The lawsuit, filed through Trump’s lawyer and set to be pursued in Florida (which allows 24 months for a defamation claim), raises serious questions about the BBC’s impartiality and financial sustainability. This incident reflects a broader pattern of Trump challenging media outlets over editing claims, following similar cases with ABC and CBS. The controversy underscores tensions between political figures and media institutions, especially in a polarized environment where trust in public broadcasters is eroding.

### Summary

Gregory Bovino, the top U.S. Customs and Border Protection official, is planning to leave Chicago as early as this week to relocate his operations to Charlotte, North Carolina, and then to New Orleans, as part of President Donald Trump’s broader immigration enforcement strategy. The move follows a federal court ruling by Judge Sara Ellis, who found Bovino had lied about the use of force during protests and issued a preliminary injunction restricting the use of tear gas and less-lethal munitions. Local officials in Charlotte and New Orleans have denied any involvement in planning federal operations. While ICE will continue operations in Chicago, city leaders such as Mayor Brandon Johnson and Governor JB Pritzker have criticized the crackdown as politically motivated and harmful to civil liberties, arguing it normalizes armed military presence on American streets. Bovino maintains that decisions are based on intelligence and leadership guidance from President Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

### Summary

The BBC held an unexpected board meeting on November 12, 2025, amid a legal threat from President Donald Trump over a serious editing error in a 2024 documentary about him.

However, Trump has used similar threats to extract concessions from other media, like Paramount, and such actions raise concerns about media independence. The BBC has faced criticism for its slow response, and the event has sparked broader debate about whether UK media will uphold editorial integrity or yield to political pressure.

## Trump Pens Letter Asking Israeli President to Pardon Netanyahu in Corruption Trial - <small>`cnn`</small>

- <small>tags: `Trump, Netanyahu, Israel, pardon, corruption trial, foreign intervention, judicial independence, Middle East politics, political accountability, U.S.-Israel relations`</small>

### Summary

US President Donald Trump has written a letter to Israeli President Yitzhak Herzog urging a full pardon for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is facing criminal charges of fraud, bribery, and breach of trust — the first incumbent Israeli prime minister to be prosecuted while in office. Trump frames the case as a politically motivated 'witch hunt' against a steadfast wartime leader and ally, echoing past interventions where he has defended international allies from prosecution, such as former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and French far-right leader Marine Le Pen. Although Herzog’s office acknowledges Trump’s support for Israel and respects the request, it emphasizes that pardons must follow established legal procedures and that no formal request has been submitted by Netanyahu or his associates. The letter has triggered strong reactions across the Israeli political spectrum, with far-right figures endorsing the pardon and opposition leaders highlighting that legal requirements like guilt and remorse must be met. The trial, which began in May 2020 and has seen repeated delays, is expected to last years, highlighting the deep political and legal tensions surrounding Netanyahu’s leadership.

- <small>tags: `government shutdown, FAA, air traffic controllers, aviation crisis, funding measure, back pay, public safety, personal impact, bipartisan agreement, health and safety concerns`</small>

### Summary

A government shutdown in early 2025 has left thousands of federal workers—particularly 5,000 FAA equipment specialists and 14,000 air traffic controllers—without pay for over 40 days. This has led to widespread travel delays, flight cancellations at 40 US airports, and a crisis in aviation safety, with Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy calling it a 'crisis within aviation.' Many controllers have taken unscheduled leave due to exhaustion, illness, or financial pressure, and President Donald Trump urged them to return to work with a $10,000 bonus offer. A bipartisan Senate funding measure now moves to the House, signaling a potential end to the shutdown. Personal stories, such as that of Atlanta mother Amanda James and her husband—a controller—highlight the emotional and financial toll on families, including postponed medical care and the need for side jobs.

## How Japan’s new prime minister has brought China’s ‘wolf warriors’ back out - <small>`cnn`</small>

### Summary

Japan’s new prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, the country’s first female leader, ignited a major diplomatic crisis with China by declaring in parliament that a Chinese attack on Taiwan would be a threat to Japan’s survival and could trigger a military response. This statement, which marked a significant departure from past Japanese leadership caution, was met with fierce retaliation from Beijing, including a deleted threatening post from Chinese consul general Xue Jian and aggressive rhetoric from state media and officials like Hu Xijin, who warned of 'beheading' invaders. The incident reflects a resurgence of China’s 'wolf warrior' diplomacy and deepens existing tensions rooted in historical grievances, especially the Nanjing Massacre and Japan’s colonial rule over Taiwan. Despite China’s claim that Taiwan was returned to Chinese sovereignty in 1945, Takaichi’s comments challenged that narrative and sparked widespread anger, with China accusing Japan of interfering in its internal affairs. The conflict occurs against a backdrop of strained Japan-China relations, especially during the 80th anniversary of WWII’s end, when China held a major military parade and amplified anti-Japanese sentiment. While Takaichi later clarified her remarks as hypothetical, the incident underscores the risks of direct confrontation over Taiwan and the enduring fragility of regional diplomacy in East Asia.

### Summary

The U.S. House of Representatives entered a 54-day government shutdown in mid-September 2025, during which it canceled all sessions and did not conduct any legislative business. Speaker Mike Johnson sent members home after approving a stopgap funding bill, citing the need to wait for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer’s approval to reopen the government. While some members, like Kevin Kiley and Mark Alford, used the time for productive work or grassroots outreach, Democrats condemned the shutdown, arguing it violated democratic norms and undermined accountability. Criticism focused on Speaker Johnson’s decision to send members home, especially the failure to swear in newly elected Democrat Adelita Grijalva, and on the lack of bipartisan engagement. The event prompted widespread frustration and debate about the functioning of Congress, with members calling it a 'nut roll' for Americans and warning of future repetition if no reforms are made.

### Key Takeaways
  - The House of Representatives was effectively shut down for 54 days, with no legislative activity, after Speaker Mike Johnson sent members home following the approval of a stopgap funding bill.

## Trump’s 2026 redistricting scheme could wind up hurting democracy more than Democrats - <small>`cnn`</small>

### Summary

President Donald Trump's strategy to push red states into creating more GOP-leaning congressional districts has sparked a political arms race, but the outcomes are not as favorable for Republicans as anticipated. While Republicans have gained a few districts in states like Texas, Ohio, North Carolina, and Missouri, Democrats have responded with successful ballot measures in California and a favorable court decision in Utah, creating new safe seats. Voter trends, particularly gains among Hispanic communities, and the historical difficulty of opposition parties gaining seats in midterms suggest that the GOP’s net gain in 2026 will likely be minimal—only three to five seats—making it unlikely that Democrats will be ousted from House control. More significantly, the article warns that this redistricting race risks normalizing partisan gerrymandering, weakening competitive districts and undermining American political norms, which may become a lasting legacy of the Trump era.

### Key Takeaways
  - Trump’s redistricting strategy may not prevent Democrats from controlling the House in 2026, despite GOP efforts to draw more GOP-leaning districts.
  - Democrats have gained ground in California and Utah due to new maps and voter sentiment, especially in response to GOP actions in Texas.
  - The redistricting arms race risks normalizing aggressive partisan gerrymandering, weakening competitive districts and eroding political norms.
  - Legal challenges and potential Supreme Court rulings on the Voting Rights Act could dramatically alter redistricting dynamics in the South.
  - The GOP may gain only three to five seats in 2026, which is unlikely to shift control of the House, given historical patterns and opposition party performance.
  - Democrat gains in key states like Virginia and increased support among Hispanic voters are undermining GOP redistricting plans.
  - Without redistricting changes, Democrats need to flip three seats; even with GOP gains, they’d need to flip six to eight, a feat not achieved since 2002.

## The U.S. Just Produced Its Last Penny After a More Than 200-Year Run - <small>`npr`</small>

- [source](https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5407493)

- <small>tags: `U.S. penny phase-out, Monetary policy, Treasury Department, Abraham Lincoln, Ben Franklin, Nickel cost efficiency, Cashless payments, Coin production, Economic efficiency, Global comparison`</small>

### Summary

The U.S. Mint has produced its final penny on November 12, 2025, ending a 232-year tradition that began in 1793. The decision to discontinue penny minting stems from the fact that each penny costs nearly 4 cents to produce, resulting in a financial loss. The Treasury Department estimates that eliminating penny production will save about $56 million annually. Although over 114 billion pennies are in circulation, most do not circulate and remain in storage, contributing to inefficiency. Businesses may face challenges in making change, potentially leading to price rounding to the nearest nickel. Countries like Canada, Australia, and New Zealand have already eliminated their one-cent coins, offering precedent. Meanwhile, the government is exploring ways to make nickel production profitable by changing coin composition. Despite the discontinuation, pennies remain legal tender. Abraham Lincoln, featured on the penny and $5 bill, and Ben Franklin, known for financial wisdom, remain iconic figures in American history, symbolizing continuity despite policy changes.

## The government shutdown is over, but not everything is back to normal - <small>`npr`</small>

### Summary

After a 43-day government shutdown — the longest in U.S. history — the federal government officially reopened on November 13, 2025, following a bill passed by Congress and signed by President Trump. While operations have resumed, lasting impacts persist: federal workers await back pay, air travel remains disrupted due to staffing shortages and schedule adjustments, national parks face months of recovery from lost services and revenue, the IRS is operating under severe staffing limitations with a massive backlog, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics may never release key October economic reports. The current funding bill only extends through January 30, 2026, raising concerns of another shutdown. Experts warn that the shutdown has created long-term instability in critical services, economic data, and public trust, with potential ripple effects into the 2026 tax season and beyond.

### Key Takeaways
  - The 43-day government shutdown is over, but the impacts are long-lasting, affecting federal workers' back pay, air travel, national parks, SNAP benefits, tax processing, and economic data reporting.

  - The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is back, but with inconsistent payments across states — some receiving full benefits, others partial or none — and uncertainty about future stability.
  - Air travel disruptions are expected to persist due to staffing shortages and airline schedule adjustments; the FAA has frozen reductions at 6%, but recovery is gradual.
  - National parks are struggling to recover from reduced staffing and lost revenue, with experts warning it could take months to fully restore services.

  - The Bureau of Labor Statistics may never release key October employment and inflation reports, which could permanently impair economic data analysis.

### Summary

Democrats on the House Oversight Committee released new emails from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate that mention President Donald Trump, including references to Trump spending hours at Epstein’s house and allegedly knowing about his sex trafficking operations. These revelations raise serious questions about the nature of the relationship between Trump and Epstein, especially in light of Trump’s prior campaign promise to release such documents to expose hidden truths. The White House dismissed the emails as a 'fake narrative' and claimed they prove nothing, while critics argue they reveal a pattern of cover-up. The timing of the release coincides with the House returning to session after a seven-week shutdown, with Democrats and four Republicans pushing for a vote to release more Epstein files. House Speaker Mike Johnson delayed the vote by refusing to swear in Democrat Adelita Grijalva, whose inclusion completed the bipartisan petition to act. The controversy continues to be a major political issue, especially as Trump has consistently denied any connection to Epstein, despite prior denials and public revelations, including a 2015 email suggesting a strategy to 'let Trump hang himself' for political gain.

## California Plans to Revoke 17,000 Commercial Driver's Licenses Given to Immigrants - <small>`npr`</small>

- <small>tags: `immigration, commercial driver's licenses, federal vs state policy, transportation safety, legal status and driver licensing, public safety, political controversy, border enforcement`</small>

### Summary

California plans to revoke 17,000 commercial driver's licenses issued to immigrants after discovering that the licenses expired after the drivers' legal status in the U.S. ended, in response to federal criticism from Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy. The action follows a fatal crash in Florida in August 2025 involving an unauthorized driver and earlier fatal crashes in Texas and Alabama. While California claims the revocation is based on state law requiring licenses to expire no later than the end of a person’s legal status, the state's governor Gavin Newsom maintains all drivers had valid federal work authorizations. The federal government has introduced stricter rules limiting commercial licenses to only H-2a, H-2b, and E-2 visa holders, with states required to verify immigration status in federal databases. Despite these new rules not being in place at the time the licenses were issued, drivers are being given 60-day notices before their licenses expire. The Transportation Department has threatened to withhold $160 million in federal funding if California does not eliminate all allegedly illegal licenses, and the broader issue reflects ongoing national debates over immigration enforcement and transportation safety.

### Key Takeaways
  - California plans to revoke 17,000 commercial driver's licenses issued to immigrants due to violations of state law regarding expiration dates tied to legal status.
  - The revocation follows criticism from Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, who claims California improperly issued licenses to undocumented individuals and asserts that the state acted negligently.
  - California's governor, Gavin Newsom, maintains that all drivers had valid federal work authorizations and that the revocation was based on state law requiring licenses to expire no later than the end of a person's legal status in the U.S.

  - The new federal rules make it extremely difficult for immigrants to obtain commercial licenses, limiting eligibility to only 10,000 of 200,000 noncitizen holders, with retroactive enforcement not applied.
  - Duffy threatened to revoke $160 million in federal funding from California if the state does not eliminate all allegedly illegal licenses and address compliance concerns.
  - The action is part of a broader federal push to ensure that only legally authorized individuals operate commercial vehicles, following fatal crashes involving undocumented drivers in Florida, Texas, and Alabama.

## SNAP Funding Pause to Soon End, but Anxiety and Anger May Linger - <small>`npr`</small>

### Summary

The end of a two-week government shutdown in November 2025 marks the anticipated return of SNAP benefits for 42 million Americans, but the suspension of funding during the shutdown has sparked widespread anxiety, financial hardship, and public distrust. Recipients like Jacqueline Giammona and Brittany Jansen describe the emotional toll of facing food insecurity, while experts like Craig Gundersen and Crystal FitzSimons warn that the disruption undermines SNAP’s long-standing role as a safety net and could normalize future political attacks on the program. President Donald Trump’s false claims about SNAP have fueled misinformation and eroded public confidence. The U.S. Department of Agriculture initially suspended $8 billion in benefits, citing fiscal constraints, but legal rulings required it to access reserves to cover the shortfall. Advocates fear that uncertainty over funding will deter people from applying for help, and call for legislative action to permanently protect SNAP from being used as a political tool during shutdowns. Despite the setbacks, the crisis has raised national awareness of the program’s importance and prompted greater public and bipartisan support for its continued stability.

## The longest government shutdown in U.S. history comes to a close - <small>`npr`</small>

- [source](https://text.npr.org/g-s1-97607)

- <small>tags: `government shutdown, Affordable Care Act, SNAP, bipartisan compromise, federal funding, healthcare policy, political negotiation, U.S. politics, Congressional debate, economic impact`</small>

### Summary

The longest government shutdown in U.S. history, lasting 43 days and beginning in October 2025, ended on November 12, 2025, after President Trump signed a bipartisan funding bill passed by the House. The bill extends government operations through January 2026 and includes provisions to reverse layoffs, provide backpay, and protect federal workers. However, it does not address the core demand from Democrats: extending enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies that expire at year-end. A December vote on a Democrat-drafted subsidy extension has been proposed via a bipartisan deal with Senate Majority Leader John Thune, but this lacks guarantees and is viewed by many Democrats as insufficient. The shutdown caused significant hardship, including 42 million SNAP recipients losing food aid and millions of federal workers going without pay. Despite bipartisan support from six Democrats and one independent in the House, many senators, including Sen. Tammy Baldwin and Sen. Tim Kaine, remain critical of the resolution, arguing it failed to achieve meaningful policy outcomes. With Congress still required to pass nine additional appropriations bills, political tensions and unresolved issues in health care policy remain central to upcoming legislative efforts and future elections.

### Key Takeaways
  - The longest government shutdown in U.S. history, lasting 43 days, ended on November 12, 2025, after President Trump signed a bipartisan funding bill.

  - A bipartisan agreement between Senate Majority Leader John Thune and Democrats to hold a December vote on extending ACA subsidies was reached, but this lacks guarantees and is not acceptable to many Senate Democrats.
  - Senate Democrats believe the shutdown failed to achieve its policy goals, and remain skeptical of the December plan, citing no cost reductions or long-term solutions.
  - Rep. Jared Golden and others call for renewed bipartisan efforts to pass legislation extending ACA premium tax credits, emphasizing ongoing opportunity for health care reform.
  - President Trump refrained from active negotiation during the shutdown, allowing Senate Majority Leader Thune to lead GOP strategy, which may impact party dynamics.

### Summary

Since September 2023, over 1,000 musicians and labels, including Lorde, Björk, and Massive Attack, have joined the 'No Music for Genocide' campaign to geo-block their music from Israel, in response to what organizers believe constitutes genocide in Gaza. The movement draws on historical precedents like the anti-apartheid 'Sun City' boycott, arguing that cultural boycotts are a powerful form of nonviolent resistance. Artists such as Aja Monet and Julia Holter emphasize moral and personal responsibility in the face of civilian suffering. The campaign faces backlash, including from the Israeli embassy and institutions like Cornell University and City Parks Foundation, which canceled events featuring artists like Kehlani, citing antisemitism or 'security' concerns. The boycott has created confusion among Israeli fans, with some music still available on platforms like Spotify. Critics, including Haaretz reporter Linda Dayan, argue it alienates Israelis who oppose the war and fails to support humanitarian aid. The movement is part of a broader global resistance to state violence and military intervention, linking Gaza to historical patterns of Western involvement in the Middle East.

### Summary

The United States officially ended production of the penny on November 12, 2025, at the U.S. Mint in Philadelphia, marking the conclusion of over 230 years of use. While the coin remains legal tender, it is no longer being manufactured due to its production cost—nearly 4 cents—exceeding its face value. The decision was driven by economic efficiency, with President Donald Trump previously calling it 'wasteful'. The final pressing was a ceremonial event attended by U.S. Treasurer Brandon Beach and mint employees, who expressed both emotion and resignation. Retailers faced logistical challenges due to the abrupt phaseout, with some businesses offering incentives to collect pennies. Historians and collectors lament the loss of the penny as a cultural artifact that reflects American history, politics, and values. Canada's 2012 discontinuation of its penny provides international precedent. Despite the economic rationale, the decision has drawn criticism for lacking public guidance and sensitivity to consumer needs.

### Summary

A group of 17 transgender Air Force members are suing the U.S. government for unlawfully revoking their early retirement pensions and benefits, following a policy change that denies those who have served 15 to 18 years the option to retire early and instead forces separation without benefits. The policy, implemented by the Air Force and supported by the Pentagon, is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to restrict transgender service members, citing gender dysphoria as a diagnostic criterion. Advocates like GLAD Law and individuals such as Master Sergeant Logan Ireland argue that the policy is cruel, discriminatory, and contradicts the values of service and leadership. The lawsuit claims that service members lose up to $2 million in lifetime benefits and health insurance, with legal challenges continuing despite a U.S. Supreme Court decision allowing the ban to be enforced temporarily.

### Key Takeaways

  - Legal advocates, such as GLAD Law, have criticized the policy as 'cruel' and argue it disproportionately harms transgender individuals by stripping them of long-term financial and health protections.

## Trump Ends 43-Day Government Shutdown Amid Partisan Gridlock and Federal Worker Backlash - <small>`apnews`</small>

### Summary

President Donald Trump ended a record 43-day government shutdown on November 13, 2025, by signing a funding bill that concluded a deep partisan dispute over the extension of Affordable Care Act tax credits. The shutdown, which began on October 12, caused widespread financial hardship for federal workers, including over 670,000 furloughed employees and 730,000 working without pay. The conflict centered on Democrats’ demand to protect health care subsidies for low-income Americans, while Republicans used unilateral actions — including threats to fire workers and cancel projects — to pressure Democrats into compromise. The bill passed with a party-line vote in the House and was previously approved by the Senate. Key outcomes include the restoration of Medicare telehealth and home care programs, the return of federal workers to full operations with a phased backpay schedule, and the reopening of major Smithsonian museums. However, the shutdown also triggered legal challenges, including a lawsuit by the Justice Department to block California’s new congressional map, and sparked criticism from advocacy groups like Voto Latino over the neglect of health care access. Additionally, the administration designated four European left-wing groups as terrorist organizations, and First Lady Melania Trump promoted an executive order to support foster youth. Federal workers and public officials alike questioned whether the political battle was worth the sacrifices endured, highlighting broader concerns about government accountability and the impact of partisan politics on everyday lives.

## James Comey, Letitia James argue US attorney in their cases hired illegally - <small>`aljazeera`</small>

### Summary

James Comey and Letitia James, both prominent critics of President Donald Trump, are challenging their criminal indictments, claiming they were politically motivated and initiated by an illegal appointment of interim US Attorney Lindsey Halligan, who was appointed without Senate confirmation and beyond the 120-day interim limit. Halligan, previously in Trump’s legal team, took over from Erik Siebert, who was removed under pressure from the president and failed to bring charges against either Comey or James. The legal teams argue that the prosecutions are retaliatory and that key procedural irregularities — including a missing court reporter during a critical portion of the grand jury proceedings and only 14 out of 23 grand jurors voting to indict Comey — undermine the legitimacy of the cases. The Justice Department maintains the appointments are lawful and the charges valid, but Judge Cameron McGowan Currie has expressed skepticism, noting that Attorney General Pam Bondi could not have reviewed a missing portion of the transcript. A watchdog group, Campaign for Accountability, has also raised ethical concerns, accusing Halligan of violating professional conduct standards. All three individuals — Comey, James, and Bolton — have pleaded not guilty, and the cases remain pending as the judge prepares to rule by Thanksgiving.

### Key Takeaways

  - Lindsey Halligan, an insurance lawyer previously in Trump’s legal team, was appointed interim US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia without Senate confirmation and beyond the 120-day interim limit, raising concerns about procedural violations.

  - The Justice Department argues that successive interim appointments are lawful and that the lack of a full transcript does not invalidate the charges, but federal judge Cameron McGowan Currie has expressed skepticism, noting that Attorney General Pam Bondi could not have reviewed the missing portion of the transcript.
  - The Campaign for Accountability has filed a complaint alleging that Halligan violated professional ethics by conducting indictments without career prosecutors and with only 14 out of 23 grand jurors voting to indict, and by allegedly making false statements to grand juries and the court.
  - The cases of Comey, James, and Bolton are being treated as politically motivated, with Trump publicly advocating for their prosecution and criticizing the prior US attorney, Erik Siebert, for failing to act.
  - All three individuals have pleaded not guilty to the charges, and their legal teams argue that the prosecutions constitute political retribution and undermine the independence of the Department of Justice.

## Italy’s PM Meloni determined to continue sending migrants to Albania - <small>`aljazeera`</small>

- <small>tags: `Migration Policy, Italy, Albania, Human Rights, EU Law, Asylum, Deportation, Legal Challenges, Political Leadership, Detention Centres`</small>

### Summary

Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is pushing forward with a policy to send migrants and asylum seekers to Albania for detention and processing, under Italian legal oversight, despite strong opposition from Italian judges, human rights groups, and the European Court of Justice. The plan, first approved in February 2024 and implemented starting in October 2024, involves sending up to 36,000 people annually over five years to two centres near Shengjin, Albania. However, legal challenges have repeatedly blocked repatriation, especially for asylum seekers from Egypt and Bangladesh, which the European Court of Justice has ruled do not meet the standard of being 'safe' countries. The ECJ emphasized that such designations must be based on strict, transparent, and accessible evidence, and that a country must protect its entire population. As a result, the centres have remained largely empty, and the plan is widely criticized as dehumanizing and unlawful, with high construction costs in Albania compared to Italy. The policy remains under legal and ethical scrutiny, pending the implementation of the EU Migration and Asylum Pact in 2026.

### Key Takeaways
  - Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has reaffirmed her government’s commitment to sending migrants and asylum seekers to Albania for processing, despite legal and judicial challenges.
  - The plan involves Italian-run detention centres near Shengjin, Albania, where migrants would be held for about a month under Italian legal oversight and video-hearing of cases from Rome.
  - The agreement was initially approved by the Albanian Parliament in February 2024 and first implemented in October 2024 with a ship carrying 16 asylum seekers.
  - Italian courts have repeatedly ruled against detaining migrants and repatriating them to countries like Egypt and Bangladesh, citing lack of safety and human rights concerns.
  - The European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled in August 2025 that Italy must meet strict legal standards in designating countries as ‘safe’ for repatriation and that a country must offer adequate protection to its entire population to qualify.
  - The proposed centres in Albania have remained largely unused due to legal challenges and have been criticized by human rights groups as dehumanizing and illegal.
  - The construction cost of the Albanian centres is estimated to be seven times higher than equivalent centres in Italy, raising concerns about cost-efficiency and value.
  - The EU migration and asylum pact, scheduled to come into effect in 2026, is expected to formalize the operational framework for the plan.

### Summary

A major corruption scandal involving former business partner Timur Mindich and allies of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has erupted in Ukraine, centered on alleged bribes and kickbacks from contracts with the state-run nuclear power company Energoatom. The investigation, led by Ukraine’s NABU and SAPO, uncovered audio and video evidence of secret payments, including $1.2 million to former deputy prime minister Oleksiy Chernyshov and $100,000 in cash, with multiple high-level officials, including former Justice Minister German Haluschenko and Energy Minister Svitlana Grinchuk, resigning. The scandal threatens Ukraine’s energy stability during wartime, as nuclear power is critical for electricity. It also raises concerns about systemic corruption in military and defense procurement, with ties to Firepoint and international donor concerns, especially from Germany. The case echoes past political failures, such as the Amber Affair under Petro Poroshenko, and experts warn that internal political instability could weaken Ukraine’s war effort, potentially leading to battlefield losses. Zelenskyy initially resisted anti-corruption agencies but has since backed down after public protests, signaling a shift in political will.

### Summary

Italy has launched a formal investigation into allegations that wealthy Italian citizens participated in 'sniper safaris' to Sarajevo between 1992 and 1996, during the Bosnian siege, where they allegedly paid to shoot at civilians under the direction of Bosnian-Serb forces. The investigation, led by Milan prosecutor Alessandro Gobbis, stems from a legal complaint filed by journalist Ezio Gavazzeni, with support from lawyers Nicola Brigida and former judge Guido Salvini. Testimonies from Bosnian military intelligence officer Edin Subasic and former Sarajevo mayor Benjamina Karic reveal that Italian intelligence agency Sismi was aware of the trips and had previously intervened. Participants reportedly paid up to 100,000 euros, with targeted victims including children and the elderly. Evidence also suggests involvement from foreign nationals, including Russian nationalist Eduard Limonov and American former Marine John Jordan. The case raises serious ethical and legal concerns about complicity, moral indifference, and the failure of international institutions to act against atrocities during wartime.

Pakistan’s Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi stated that both suicide bombers in recent attacks—targeting the Islamabad District Judicial Complex and a Cadet College in South Waziristan—were Afghan nationals, escalating tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan. The attacks killed at least 12 and injured over 30, prompting Pakistan’s Defence Minister Khawaja Asif to declare the country in a 'state of war' and suggest possible military strikes in Afghanistan.

### Summary

Australia is implementing a social media ban for children under 16, effective December 10, 2025, which includes platforms such as Reddit, Kick, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, and YouTube.

## US shutdown ends: What happens now, when will services resume? - <small>`aljazeera`</small>

- <small>tags: `government shutdown, Affordable Care Act, healthcare subsidies, furloughed workers, SNAP, economic impact, political compromise, Congressional deadlock, federal funding, air traffic control, data collection, infrastructure projects, 2025 US politics, policy deadlock`</small>

### Summary

The 43-day government shutdown in the United States ended after President Donald Trump signed a finance bill passed by both the Senate and House of Representatives. The bill funds federal operations, food assistance programs like SNAP, and infrastructure projects through January 2026. However, it does not extend health insurance subsidies under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which expire on December 31. This lack of extension caused significant political and economic consequences, including millions of furloughed workers, disrupted air traffic, delayed economic data releases, and potential premium hikes for low-income Americans. While some Democrats broke ranks to end the shutdown, others criticized the compromise, especially on healthcare. A December Senate vote on ACA subsidies is scheduled, but its success is uncertain. If no resolution is reached by January, another shutdown could occur, and affected Americans may face sharply increased health costs or loss of coverage. Experts warn of ongoing disruptions and long-term economic damage, including a permanent data blind spot from the shutdown.

### Key Takeaways
  - A 43-day government shutdown ended after a bipartisan agreement in the Senate and a congressional vote in the House, ending furloughs and restarting essential services.
  - The new finance bill funds SNAP, federal agencies, and infrastructure projects until January 2026, but fails to extend ACA subsidies, which expire on December 31.

### Summary

The release of over 20,000 pages of documents from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate by the US House Oversight Committee has reignited controversy over Donald Trump’s relationship with Epstein. Key emails reveal that Epstein allegedly told his associate Ghislaine Maxwell that Trump spent hours at his house with a victim, identified as Virginia Giuffre. Another email exchange with journalist Michael Wolff suggests that Epstein and Wolff discussed a strategy to politically attack Trump, with Wolff claiming he was trying to convince Epstein to come forward. Trump has denied any wrongdoing and dismissed the documents as a 'hoax,' while the White House maintains they prove nothing. The release has triggered a political battle between Democrats and Republicans, with Democrats asserting a moral duty to expose abuse and complicity, and Republicans claiming the documents were cherry-picked and politically biased. Survivors, including Nancy Mace and Lauren Boebert, have emphasized the personal and emotional stakes. The US House of Representatives has voted to end a 43-day government shutdown and is scheduled to vote next week on releasing all sealed Epstein files, though the Senate and President Trump must also approve the action. The Justice Department has cited victim privacy as the reason for withholding files, while Elon Musk claimed Trump is in the Epstein files, adding to public speculation. This case highlights broader political tensions over power, accountability, and the role of transparency in government.

### Summary

A massive police raid on 28 October 2025 in Rio de Janeiro, involving 2,500 officers and resulting in 121 deaths including four police officers, was aimed at dismantling the Comando Vermelho (CV) gang, which controls key favelas like Alemão and Penha.

### Summary

On the 10th anniversary of the 2015 Bataclan massacre, which killed 130 people during a concert and remains a defining moment in French history, France faces renewed concerns over the enduring threat of jihadist terrorism. A 27-year-old French woman, Maëva B, a former girlfriend of surviving jihadist Salah Abdeslam, has been arrested on suspicion of plotting a violent jihadist act, linked to encrypted communications and face-to-face meetings with Abdeslam. Despite the decline of the Islamic State, experts like Gilles Kepel warn of a shift to 'ambient jihadism'—a home-grown, socially networked form of radicalization fueled by political instability, trauma, and online influence. While French intelligence has successfully thwarted six plots in 2025, the threat remains high, especially amid a deepening political crisis. The article highlights the emotional and societal impact of the attacks, with survivors and activists opposing any form of restorative justice involving perpetrators, arguing that terrorism is not a common crime. National commemorations, including the illumination of the Eiffel Tower, reflect both remembrance and ongoing vigilance.

## Trump celebrates as Democrats face fallout from end of shutdown - <small>`bbc`</small>

### Summary

After 43 days—the longest government shutdown in U.S. history—federal workers are back on pay, national parks reopen, and services resume. The shutdown stemmed from Senate Democrats using the filibuster to block Republican funding, demanding extensions of low-income healthcare subsidies. Only a few Democrats supported reopening, with little in return. Leadership, including Chuck Schumer and Gavin Newsom, faced criticism for perceived weakness, with Newsom calling the deal a 'surrender.' President Donald Trump celebrated the end, claiming it was a victory and accusing Democrats of failing to uphold the rules. The episode also reignited debate over the Jeffrey Epstein case, with a new petition triggered by Congresswoman Adelita Grijalva's swearing-in. Trump accused Democrats of deflection, while the unresolved subsidy issue and looming need for new funding create ongoing political and economic risks for both parties.

### Key Takeaways
  - The shutdown ended after 43 days, the longest in U.S. history, due to a deadlock over funding and healthcare subsidies.

  - Only a handful of Democrats supported reopening the government, receiving minimal concessions such as a Senate vote on subsidies, with no guarantee of Republican support.

  - Governor Gavin Newsom, a potential 2028 presidential candidate, expressed dismay at the shutdown, indicating broader Democratic discontent and potential weakening of party cohesion.
  - President Donald Trump celebrated the end of the shutdown, calling it a 'very big victory' and claiming Republicans 'broke him' in the face of Democratic resistance.
  - Trump criticized Democrats for focusing on the Jeffrey Epstein case, claiming it was a deliberate effort to deflect from the failure of the shutdown and other political missteps.
  - Congress will need to approve additional funding by the end of January to avoid another shutdown, signaling ongoing fiscal and political uncertainty.
  - The healthcare subsidy issue remains a pressing concern for millions of Americans, as insurance costs are expected to double or triple at year-end.

### Summary

Starbucks workers at 65 unionized U.S. stores have gone on strike in a bid to demand better pay, staffing, and resolution of hundreds of unfair labor practice charges. The action, led by Starbucks Workers United, coincides with Red Cup Day, a major holiday sales event, to amplify public attention. Workers argue that new policies—like banning non-customers from bathrooms and enforcing dress codes—have increased their workload without adequate staffing, leading to long shifts and job dissatisfaction. Despite Starbucks claiming it offers one of the best jobs in retail with an average hourly wage of $30, union members say pay has not kept pace with inflation and healthcare costs. Talks stalled after a mediator was brought in, and union members voted down a contract offer in April. The strike could expand if no agreement is reached, and workers are urging customers to support them by refusing to buy coffee from Starbucks.

- <small>tags: `education policy, Nigeria, mother-tongue teaching, English language, WAEC, Neco, Jamb, education reform, linguistic diversity, government policy reversal`</small>

### Summary

Nigeria has reversed a three-year-old policy that mandated teaching in indigenous languages in primary schools, reinstating English as the sole medium of instruction from pre-primary through university. The decision, led by Education Minister Tunji Alausa, was based on poor academic performance in national exams (WAEC, Neco, Jamb) in regions that adopted the mother-tongue approach. While some, including parents and experts, welcome the move as a step toward global competitiveness and early English proficiency, others argue it was abandoned too soon without sufficient investment in teacher training, curriculum development, and long-term evaluation. The reversal underscores the ongoing struggle in Nigeria to balance linguistic heritage with the practical demands of national education and global economic integration.

  - Education Minister Tunji Alausa cited failing exam results as justification for the reversal, pointing to regional disparities in student performance.
  - Critics argue the policy was scrapped prematurely, noting that significant investments in teacher training, materials, and curriculum development are needed for such a linguistic shift to succeed.

  - The decision reflects a broader tension in Nigeria between preserving linguistic diversity and ensuring national educational coherence and global readiness.

### Summary

California is revoking 17,000 commercial driver's licences issued to immigrants who are no longer legally allowed in the U.S., following an audit that revealed licences were issued with incorrect expiration dates and violated state law. The action is tied to federal efforts led by Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy to restrict undocumented immigrants from commercial driving after a fatal crash in Florida involving an undocumented truck driver. Governor Gavin Newsom has defended the state's actions, noting that affected drivers had valid federal work authorizations and that federal rules were not in effect at the time of licence issuance. The federal rules have been placed on hold by a court due to a pending lawsuit. California remains the only state to complete a full audit, while others are delayed by the 43-day government shutdown. The policy raises significant concerns about economic impact, legal compliance, and the credibility of federal enforcement claims.

### Key Takeaways

## Why Ukraine is bracing for its 'worst winter' of the war - <small>`bbc`</small>

- [source](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly98qp99l8o)

- <small>tags: `Ukraine war, winter crisis, energy attacks, Russian military strategy, civilian suffering, war fatigue, diplomatic stagnation, national resilience, public morale, international support`</small>

### Summary

Ukraine is bracing for its worst winter of the war due to intensified Russian attacks on energy infrastructure, particularly targeting power and gas networks in eastern regions. These attacks, including massive drone and missile strikes, are designed not only to create extreme hardship for civilians through cold and darkness, but also to disrupt the economy and weaken public trust in the government. While the Ukrainian government and citizens remain resilient — evidenced by cultural activities like football matches — the psychological toll is severe, with high rates of insomnia and fear among the population. International diplomacy is stalled, and concerns over war fatigue and shifting European support could undermine Ukraine’s long-term survival. Despite these challenges, Ukrainian leaders maintain that this winter is a decisive moment — if Ukraine survives until 1 April, it will have won the war. The article underscores both the physical and psychological resilience of Ukrainians, rooted in a long history of endurance against foreign aggression.

### Key Takeaways

  - Ukrainian leadership, including President Volodymyr Zelensky and Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko, emphasize that Ukraine must preserve energy and light, even as it faces extreme cold and attacks.
  - Ongoing diplomatic efforts — including planned summits with Donald Trump — are stalled due to Russia’s maximalist war aims and Western sanctions.

### Summary

Alejandro Carranza, a Colombian fisherman from Santa Marta, was killed in a U.S. military strike on September 15, 2025, during a fishing trip. His family and Colombian President Gustavo Petro accuse the United States of violating international law by conducting extrajudicial killings, arguing that the boat was not confirmed to carry illicit drugs or pose an immediate threat. The Trump administration claims the strikes target drug trafficking linked to Venezuela, particularly under Nicolás Maduro, but has not provided verifiable evidence. The family, supported by local fishermen and legal experts, asserts that Carranza was a peaceful fisherman who lived a modest life and had no connection to drug smuggling. The incident has sparked diplomatic tensions, with Colombia suspending intelligence sharing with the U.S., and has deeply traumatized the family and fishing community, leading to fears of retaliation and a decline in fishing activities. The family has hired American lawyer Dan Kovalik to file a legal claim, arguing that killing suspected individuals without arrest or trial is illegal and undermines the rule of law.

### Key Takeaways
  - The U.S. military strike on September 15, 2025, killed Alejandro Carranza, a Colombian fisherman, and two others on his boat in the Caribbean Sea.

  - Fishermen in Santa Marta are now fearful and reluctant to go fishing, leading to a decline in fishing activity during tuna season.

## What’s Behind the Coming House Vote on Releasing the Epstein Files - <small>`nytimes`</small>

- <small>tags: `Epstein files, discharge petition, House of Representatives, transparency, bipartisan effort, Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell, Justice Department, political pressure, procedural rule, contempt of Congress, Trump opposition, Senate opposition, public demand for transparency`</small>

### Summary

A bipartisan effort led by Representatives Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna, through a discharge petition with 218 signatures, successfully forced the House of Representatives to schedule a vote on a bill requiring the Justice Department to release its investigation files into Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell within 30 days. Despite opposition from Speaker Mike Johnson and President Trump, who have criticized transparency efforts as politically risky, the petition overcame procedural barriers, including resistance from Republican leaders and attempts by the White House to remove signatures. The vote was accelerated from early December to the next week due to political urgency and procedural timelines. While the bill would likely pass the House if all signatories support it, it faces strong opposition in the Senate and is expected to be vetoed by President Trump. Support may extend beyond the petition signatories, with some Republican members like Don Bacon backing the measure. The effort reflects a growing public demand for transparency, driven by constituent pressure and political tensions within the Republican Party.

### Key Takeaways
  - The discharge petition mechanism allows a bill to bypass committee control and go directly to the House floor if 218 members sign it, serving as a procedural tool to force legislative action despite leadership resistance.
  - The Epstein files bill seeks to compel the Justice Department to release investigation materials into Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell within 30 days, aiming for greater transparency.
  - Despite President Trump and House Republican leadership opposing the bill, bipartisan support from members like Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna pushed the vote forward through procedural means.
  - The final signature from Representative Adelita Grijalva triggered the petition’s activation and effectively froze signatures, preventing removal even if members resigned or left office.
  - Speaker Mike Johnson, though opposed to the bill, relented and scheduled the vote due to the petition’s procedural success and the political pressure from constituents and party members.
  - The bill may gain broader support, including from uncommitted Republican members, such as Representative Don Bacon, who support the transparency effort despite not signing the petition.
  - The Senate would likely block the bill due to lack of majority support, requiring 60 votes to act, and President Trump would almost certainly veto it.
  - Republican leaders feared political fallout from releasing Epstein files, as Trump criticized those pushing for transparency as 'stupid' or 'foolish', yet constituents demanded revelations.
  - The public demand for transparency from Epstein-related files, fueled by constituent pressure and social media, created significant momentum behind the bipartisan effort.

### Summary

Maurene Comey, a former Manhattan federal prosecutor and daughter of former FBI director James B. Comey, sued the Trump administration in September 2025, alleging she was fired without cause as retaliation for her father’s political opposition to President Donald Trump. Despite the lawsuit being filed, the Justice Department has failed to assign any office or lawyer to handle it, with the Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Federal Programs Branch offices all declining due to personal and professional ties. The absence of a response led Judge Jesse M. Furman to issue a court order requiring the department to respond by November 21. The case underscores broader concerns about the politicization of the Justice Department under the Trump administration, including directives from Attorney General Pam Bondi that require prosecutors to comply with supervisors, leading to widespread office-wide recusals and a breakdown in normal legal accountability. The Merit Systems Protection Board, which normally handles such employee complaints, is also seen as ineffective due to prior administrative actions.

## Hochul Vetoed 7 of His Bills in a Single Day. Could It Be Personal? - <small>`nytimes`</small>

### Summary

In October 2025, Governor Kathy Hochul vetoed seven bills sponsored by Senator James Skoufis, a moderate Democrat from Rockland and Orange Counties. The bills, which cover issues like public records access, grocery delivery pricing, and nursing home transparency, appear to stem from a broader political conflict. Skoufis had previously criticized Hochul as 'authoritarian' and accused her administration of bid-rigging in the controversial consolidation of the $11 billion Consumer Directed Personal Assistance Program (C.D.P.A.P.), managed by Public Partnerships L.L.C. His committee launched investigations and document requests into the contractor and the Department of Health. While Hochul’s office claims the vetoes are based on legislative merit, insiders suggest they were politically motivated to deter Skoufis’s inquiry. Skoufis counters that the criticism boosts his political support. The controversy, involving both program failures and political strategy, is shaping up as a key issue in the 2026 gubernatorial race.

  - The controversy over the C.D.P.A.P. program rollout, including allegations of bid-rigging and poor execution, has become a central issue in the 2026 gubernatorial race.
  - Hochul’s office denies accusations of retaliation, maintaining that vetoes are based on legislative merit, but insiders suggest the vetoes were politically motivated to deter Skoufis’s inquiries.
  - Skoufis claims that criticism of Hochul boosts his district’s support, indicating a political benefit from the conflict.

## Does the Subway Still Need Train Conductors? - <small>`nytimes`</small>

### Summary

The New York City subway is facing a pivotal policy decision regarding the long-standing requirement of a two-person crew, with Governor Kathy Hochul set to decide by the end of 2025 whether to extend the rule. A new study by NYU’s Marron Institute shows that only 6% of global train lines still require two-person crews, suggesting the practice is outdated and costly. While transit labor leaders argue that conductors enhance safety and customer service, critics point to significant annual savings—over $440 million—possible through one-person operation, which could help address a projected $800 million fiscal shortfall by 2030. The M.T.A.’s investment in automation technology like C.B.T.C. is at risk if the two-person rule is maintained, and future transit projects like the Interborough Express could face delays or limitations. The debate reflects a broader tension between tradition, safety, and modernization in public transit operations.

### Key Takeaways
  - Only 6% of global train lines still require two-person crews, according to a New York University study, suggesting the New York subway’s practice is outdated compared to international standards.
  - The M.T.A. currently spends about two-thirds of its $20 billion annual budget on labor, highlighting significant fiscal pressure and potential for cost-saving through automation.
  - A transition to one-person operation could save over $440 million annually, which could help address projected $800 million shortfall by 2030.
  - The presence of conductors is defended as a safety measure, especially for crime deterrence and emergency evacuations, by transit labor leaders such as John Samuelsen.
  - Supporters of one-person operation argue that it allows for more frequent service and better use of operational savings, while critics say the safety benefits are overstated.
  - The M.T.A.’s investment in Communications-Based Train Control (C.B.T.C.) systems is undermined if the two-person rule is maintained, as it limits the potential for remote control and automation.
  - A proposed light-rail line, the Interborough Express (IBX), could benefit from full automation, which would improve service frequency and passenger satisfaction.
  - The bill currently under consideration would require a conductor on nearly all subway trains, which could cost an additional $10 million annually and restrict future transit innovations.

## How Pakistan’s Spending Blitz Helped Win Over Trump and Flip U.S. Policy - <small>`nytimes`</small>

### Summary

In early 2025, Pakistan launched a high-stakes lobbying campaign in Washington by spending millions on contracts with firms linked to former Trump administration figures, including George Sorial and Keith Schiller. This effort coincided with a dramatic shift in U.S. trade policy, where tariffs on Pakistani goods were slashed from 29% to 19%—one of the lowest among Asian nations—while India’s tariff rose to 50%. The campaign included a private lunch between Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir and President Trump at the White House, a first for a Pakistani military leader. The timing and outcomes suggest a direct influence of these lobbying activities on policy changes. India responded by hiring similar firms with Trump allies, but was outspent and outmaneuvered. Concurrently, the Trump administration weakened enforcement of the Foreign Agents Registration Act, allowing more foreign influence to go unmonitored. Experts like Michael Kugelman attribute the turnaround to a combination of strategic diplomacy and targeted lobbying.

### Key Takeaways
  - Pakistan spent significantly more than India on lobbying in Washington in early 2025, hiring firms with close ties to former Trump administration personnel.
  - The contracts included high-profile firms like Seiden Law and Javelin Advisors, whose founders included George Sorial and Keith Schiller — a former bodyguard of President Trump.

  - As a result of these lobbying efforts, President Trump reduced Pakistan’s tariff to 19% — one of the lowest among major Asian economies — while raising India’s tariff to 50%.
  - The timing of the lobbying activity and policy changes suggests a direct causal link between political influence efforts and shifts in U.S. trade policy.

## Trump v. James and Maurene Comey - <small>`nytimes`</small>

- <small>tags: `civil service reform, presidential power, unitary executive theory, federal employment, political retaliation, Laura Loomer, James Comey, Maurene Comey, legal precedent, federal judiciary, government accountability`</small>

### Summary

The article explores the legal and political implications of the Trump administration’s actions in dismissing Maurene Comey, a federal prosecutor and daughter of former FBI Director James Comey, without cause or explanation. The case raises serious concerns about the erosion of civil service protections, especially under the 1978 Civil Service Reform Act, which mandates fair, merit-based employment practices. Maurene Comey’s firing, allegedly motivated by her political ties to her father, is being challenged as a violation of federal employment laws. The case is seen as a potential landmark in American justice, with broader implications for federal employee protections and executive power. The article also highlights how social media influencers like Laura Loomer have amplified political pressure on federal officials, and how the precedent set by such actions could expand presidential authority under the unitary executive theory. The outcome may influence future judicial interpretations of executive power and federal employment rights.

### Key Takeaways
  - Maurene Comey was fired without cause or explanation, in violation of the Civil Service Act, which requires federal employees to be terminated for cause and based on merit.
  - The firing of Maurene Comey is being challenged in court as a potential breach of civil service protections established since 1883, especially under the 1978 Civil Service Reform Act.
  - The case raises significant constitutional and legal questions about whether the president can unilaterally fire federal employees without just cause or notice, especially those outside political appointees.
  - The case is seen as a test of the long-standing merit-based civil service system, which historically insulated federal jobs from political interference.
  - Laura Loomer, a right-wing social media influencer, publicly called for Maurene Comey’s firing, citing her father’s past role in the FBI as a 'national security risk'.
  - The broader implication is that if the president can dismiss federal employees arbitrarily—especially for reasons tied to political affiliation or family ties—this undermines trust in public institutions and may discourage qualified individuals from joining federal service.
  - The case may influence future legal interpretations of executive power under the 'unitary executive' theory, particularly in relation to the independence of federal agencies and employee tenures.

- <small>tags: `presidential pardon, Donald Trump, Jan. 6 Capitol riot, democratic integrity, constitutional reform, executive overreach, political loyalty, historical precedent, systemic abuse of power, American democracy`</small>

### Summary

The article details how multiple individuals, including Jonathan Braun, Christopher Moynihan, Eliyahu Weinstein, and Matthew Huttle, were previously granted pardons by President Donald Trump despite committing serious crimes ranging from sexual assault and fraud to threats against democratic leaders. It argues that these pardons are not based on innocence or justice, but rather on personal relationships, political loyalty, or financial benefit to Trump or his allies. The article draws historical parallels to past abuses of the pardon power, such as Andrew Johnson's pardons of Confederates, and warns that unchecked presidential pardons threaten the integrity of American democracy. It calls for constitutional reform—specifically an amendment requiring two-thirds of the Senate to approve pardons—to prevent executive overreach and ensure accountability. The piece emphasizes that pardons are being used not as a tool of justice, but as a mechanism of political reward, and urges a reevaluation of the constitutional balance of power to protect democratic institutions.

- <small>tags: `xenotransplantation, pig kidneys, organ shortage, immunology, NYU Langone Health, Revivicor, clinical breakthrough, immunotherapy, transplant research, medical innovation`</small>

### Summary

Doctors at NYU Langone Health have made significant progress in xenotransplantation by successfully implanting genetically modified pig kidneys into human recipients. In a brain-dead recipient, Maurice Miller, the pig kidney functioned for 61 days despite immune rejection episodes, which were effectively treated with standard immunosuppressive drugs. The study revealed detailed immune reaction pathways and identified potential biomarkers for early rejection detection. In a living recipient, Tim Andrews, the pig kidney functioned for 271 days, demonstrating long-term viability. These findings, published in the journal Nature, mark a major step toward making pig-to-human kidney transplants a realistic medical option, especially given the current shortage of human kidneys—over 90,000 people in the U.S. are waiting for transplants, with 11 dying daily. Researchers now plan to expand the study to 20 additional patients to confirm consistency across individuals.

- <small>tags: `bees, insect cognition, time perception, animal behavior, science, neuroscience, cognitive flexibility, foraging behavior, bee intelligence`</small>

### Summary

A new study led by doctoral student Alex Davidson and senior lecturer Elisabetta Versace at Queen Mary University of London demonstrates that bumblebees can process the duration of light flashes — specifically distinguishing between 0.5 and 5 seconds — and use this temporal information to decide where to forage for food. This is the first evidence of such time-processing ability in insects, challenging the long-standing belief that insects are simple reflex machines. The bees learned to associate short flashes with sweet food and long flashes with bitter food, even when food cues were absent, indicating that they process time duration based on novel stimuli. The research, published in the journal Biology Letters, highlights the cognitive flexibility and complex inner lives of bees, suggesting that small brains can achieve sophisticated learning and time perception. Experts from University College London and the University of Exeter support the findings, emphasizing their implications for understanding both insect cognition and the nature of time perception across species. This study shifts how scientists view bees — not as passive pollinators, but as animals capable of flexible, adaptive, and time-sensitive decision-making.

### Key Takeaways
  - Bees can process the duration of light flashes and use this information to make foraging decisions.
  - This is the first evidence of time-processing ability in insects, challenging the long-held belief that insects are merely reflexive machines.
  - Bees can distinguish between novel stimuli (flash durations) they have never seen before, showing flexibility and complex cognition.
  - The ability may be linked to efficient foraging behavior, where time management maximizes rewards and minimizes energy costs.
  - The study suggests that cognitive complexity does not require large brains — bees with small brains exhibit sophisticated learning and memory.

### Summary

The article discusses the controversy surrounding claims by U.S. President Donald Trump that the United States would resume nuclear weapons testing. Energy Secretary Chris Wright clarifies that the planned tests are noncritical and involve only component testing, not nuclear explosions. These noncritical tests, including subcritical experiments, are used to ensure nuclear weapon reliability without detonation. Experts from the Arms Control Association and Chatham House emphasize that resuming explosive nuclear testing would violate decades of global nuclear restraint, escalate tensions, and provoke responses from Russia, China, and North Korea. While China’s nuclear arsenal is growing rapidly—projected to reach 1,000 warheads by 2030—the article notes no credible evidence of active nuclear tests by any country, including China, Russia, or Pakistan. The U.S. maintains its nuclear stockpile through advanced simulations and component testing, and agencies like the National Nuclear Security Administration assert that no new explosive tests are needed. The article underscores the importance of distinguishing between noncritical and explosive testing, and warns that any shift toward explosive testing would undermine global nuclear stability and trigger dangerous arms competition.

### Summary

Escaramuza, an all-female equestrian sport from Mexico, has long challenged gender norms in traditional male-dominated horsemanship. Documented by photographer Constance Jaeggi through her two-year journey across the U.S., the sport is celebrated for its vibrant fashion and strong sisterhood, yet also reveals deep-seated gender inequality and historical misogyny.

The cultural work of Jaeggi, including her collaboration with poets Ire’ne Lara Silva and Angelina Sáenz, gives voice to both the beauty and the pain of this community. Escaramuza's rise in the U.S. reflects broader themes of immigration, feminism, and cultural resilience, as women strive to prove that horsemanship is not a male monopoly, and that future generations can see themselves reflected in the sport.

## A decade after the Bataclan attacks, France is still grappling with how to remember - <small>`npr`</small>

### Summary

A decade after the November 13, 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris — which killed 130 people at the Bataclan concert hall, cafés, and the national stadium — France continues to grapple with how to remember and process the trauma. While extensive memorials, public rituals, and legal actions have been taken, new research shows that collective memory is fading, especially for events at the cafés and stadium. Historian Denis Peschanski and neuroscientist Pierre Gagnepain have conducted long-term studies showing that survivors experience a 'double peine' — both psychological trauma and the erosion of public memory — and that intentional memory suppression may aid recovery by reducing intrusive thoughts. MRI scans reveal that neural changes linked to memory control improve over time, but about a third of survivors remain in chronic PTSD. Survivors like Arthur Dénouveaux, who now leads the support group Life for Paris, reflect on the personal journey from victimhood to resilience, emphasizing that healing is not about forgetting, but about living with the past in a way that allows for forward movement.

### Key Takeaways
  - France is still grappling with how to remember and process the November 13, 2015 terrorist attacks, which killed 130 people across Paris.

- **Society & Culture**
- <small>tags: `education, disability, South Korea, blind students, Suneung exam, exam accessibility, education equity, persecution of perseverance, systemic barriers, student experience`</small>

### Summary

The article reports on the extreme challenges faced by blind students in South Korea during the Suneung college entrance exam, which lasts up to 13 hours for them due to braille test materials and extended testing time. With the exam beginning at 08:40 and concluding around 21:48, blind students endure intense physical and cognitive strain, navigating thick braille test booklets, relying on screen-reading devices, and managing memory without visual cues. Despite the difficulty, students like Han Donghyun and Oh Jeong-won emphasize perseverance and personal growth, viewing the exam as a test of will. A major systemic issue is the delayed release of braille versions of essential study materials like the EBS textbooks—available only months before the exam—compounding preparation challenges. The article highlights the need for equitable access to education and calls for policy reforms, with the Korean Blind Union planning a constitutional petition to demand better accessibility and fairness in the exam system.

### Key Takeaways

## Caste census: The case for and against counting castes in India - <small>`bbc`</small>

- <small>tags: `caste, census, affirmative action, social justice, India, colonial history, rights-based policy, social hierarchy, Dalits, Adivasis, OBCs, Anand Teltumbde, BR Ambedkar, political critique, welfare policy`</small>

### Summary

India is poised to conduct its first nationwide caste census in the 2027 census, marking a major shift in social policy after decades of political hesitation. While advocates argue that detailed caste data can make affirmative action more targeted and equitable—especially in education and employment—critics like scholar-activist Anand Teltumbde warn that such a census may reinforce caste hierarchy, reify colonial practices, and turn social inequality into a bureaucratic ledger. Critics argue that caste is too pernicious to be managed and that true social justice requires the destruction of caste, not its enumeration. In contrast, scholars like Satish Deshpande, Mary E John, and Sonalde Desai stress that caste data are essential to understanding both privilege and deprivation, and that a well-designed census could enable more inclusive, rights-based welfare policies. However, challenges remain in data classification, sub-categorization, and potential misuse of results for political gain. The debate reflects a deeper tension between data-driven policy and the need to dismantle systemic inequality.

### Key Takeaways
  - The proposed 2027 caste census in India marks a significant policy shift, aiming to provide a clearer picture of who benefits from affirmative action policies.
  - Critics, including scholar Anand Teltumbde, argue that counting castes reinforces a hierarchical system and may entrench caste-based discrimination rather than dismantle it.
  - Supporters, such as sociologists Satish Deshpande and Mary E John, believe a comprehensive caste census is necessary to reveal both privilege and deprivation and to enable fairer welfare policies.
  - A key concern is that caste data may be misused to redraw quotas or exploit caste identities politically, potentially leading to increased social polarization.
  - Scholars emphasize the need to link caste data with income and educational indicators to develop a rights-based, rather than caste-based, welfare system.
  - The sub-categorization of castes into subgroups raises significant methodological challenges in data collection and interpretation, with no standardized approach currently in place.
  - The historical legacy of British caste censuses (1871–1931) is seen as a colonial tool of control, which continues to influence contemporary debates on caste and data collection.
