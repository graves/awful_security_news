### Summary

A federal court ruled on Thursday that Alabama engaged in intentional discrimination by not creating a second congressional district majority Black, despite repeated court rejections of maps with only one such district. The court, made up of one Clinton appointee and two Trump appointees, found that Alabama's congressional plan was designed to dilute Black votes across districts, making it impossible to have two majority-Black districts.

The proposed system will aim to improve air traffic control reliability and safety, although some experts have raised concerns about the potential cost and timeline for its implementation. The project aims to replace the current system that has been criticized for poor quality, problems, and vulnerabilities, such as the fire set by a contract employee in 2014 that caused significant delays and cancellations. The new system also includes addressing staffing shortages and training issues, with the FAA planning to increase staffing levels and fill training classes through 2028.

The decision came after months of negotiations between Democrats and Republicans, with the final tally being 49-48, with Republicans joining Democrats in voting against the bill. The main concerns from Democrats included addressing issues like anti-money laundering, foreign issuers, national security, and consumer protection. Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren argued that the bill was not adequately regulated and could supercharge Trump's corruption, undermining consumer protection and potentially destabilizing the financial system. Senate Republicans, however, maintained their support for the legislation, even organizing a visit from David Sacks, the White House's czar on AI and cryptocurrency, to educate senators. The bill had advanced out of the Senate Banking Committee in March, but reached a stalemate due to Democrats' insistence on further changes and Republicans' push for the immediate vote.

### Key Takeaways
  - Senate Democrats blocked the GENIUS Act, a bill aiming to regulate cryptocurrency, due to concerns over President Donald Trump's crypto dealings and lack of necessary guardrails to protect consumers and the financial system.

## Foods in kids’ lunch boxes may impact age of first period, study suggests

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/06/health/nutrition-early-menstruation-wellness)
- _Published: 2025-05-08 14:02:00-04:00_

### Summary

A new study published in the journal Human Reproduction suggests that a more inflammatory diet may increase the likelihood of children experiencing their first menstrual period at an earlier age, while a healthier diet may delay it. The study, based on data from 7,500 children ages 9 to 14, used two dietary indices to measure the quality of the diets of the children. The research found that a healthy diet was associated with a later first period compared to a less healthy diet, regardless of body mass index (BMI). The study suggests that diet may play a role in influencing the age at which menstruation starts, beyond just body weight, and highlights the need for access to healthy meal options for all children and adolescents. Other factors that may influence early menstruation include exposure to high levels of air pollution and personal care products containing endocrine-disrupting chemicals. However, there are databases available to find safer personal care products, and the study recommends guidelines for healthy dietary patterns.

### Key Takeaways
  - Eating a more inflammatory diet was associated with a 15% greater chance of kids having their first period in the next month, while a healthier diet reduced the risk by 8%.

- _Published: 2025-05-08 13:47:00-20:47_

### Summary

Cameron Hamilton, who was appointed by President Donald Trump as the acting administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), was fired one day after he testified before the House Appropriations Committee. In his testimony, Hamilton defended FEMA and emphasized the need for reforms to improve the agency, stating that FEMA's current system is outdated and causes delays in aid for those in need. The administration, led by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, has been calling for FEMA's 'elimination' and has been considering raising the threshold for federal disaster assistance, which could reduce the number of major disaster declarations. Hamilton's dismissal came amid discussions about dismantling FEMA and was met with criticism by the administration, which views FEMA as inefficient and unnecessary.

## One trade ‘deal’ done, 199 to go - US Trade Deal with UK Provides a Framework but Challenges Remain for China

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/08/economy/trade-deal)
- _Published: 2025-05-08 13:39:00-04:00_

### Summary

The article discusses President Donald Trump's first trade deal with the United Kingdom, describing it as a framework for negotiations that may provide some temporary benefits but is unlikely to significantly improve the overall trade situation. The article notes that the US and China's high tariffs on each other's goods have effectively halted trade, and the Trump administration is set to meet with Chinese officials in Geneva to negotiate a potential deal. The article highlights the difficulties of completing numerous trade deals within the short time frame until the tariffs on dozens of nations are due to be reinstated, and the potential economic disruptions that could result from the high tariffs. Despite the US economy's contraction due to tariffs, the article suggests that the trade situation with China remains critical and poses significant challenges for potential resolution.

### Key Takeaways
  - The US trade deal with the UK was described as a concept of a plan rather than a formal agreement, indicating that it may not provide substantial economic benefits.
  - The Trump administration faces the challenge of negotiating over a hundred trade deals by July 8th, including with China, which is the most important economic partner.
  - The high tariffs on Chinese imports, currently at 145%, have led to a contraction in the US economy.
  - The US and Chinese officials are set to meet in Geneva this weekend to negotiate a potential trade deal, but there is no guarantee of success.
  - The article mentions that the stock market cheered the announcement of the trade deal with the UK but emphasizes the difficult task ahead, particularly regarding the trade relationship with China.
  - The article suggests that the 90-day tariff pause on some UK goods may provide little meaningful economic benefit due to the complex nature of trade negotiations.
  - The article concludes by stating that the Trump administration may need to reinstate tariffs on some countries in the future, indicating a potential shift in their trade policy.
  - The article also notes that without a significant reduction in tariffs on Chinese imports, trade between the US and China could remain effectively halted.
  - The US and China have historically high tariffs on each other's goods, with US tariffs on Chinese goods at 145% and Chinese tariffs on US goods at 125%.
  - The article warns that even with a trade deal with China, it could take a significant amount of time, possibly two to three years, for trade to normalize.
  - The article suggests that the US and China could face economic disruptions due to high tariffs, with goods being stockpiled to avoid the tariffs, and a potential shortage of goods in the coming weeks.
  - The article implies that the Trump administration's aggressive trade policies have been met with resistance and have led to a significant contraction in the US economy.

- _Published: 2025-05-08 12:08:00-20:08_

### Summary

President Donald Trump has announced he will rescind a set of AI export curbs that were put in place during the Biden administration. The move could have sweeping impacts on the global distribution of critical AI chips, as well as which companies profit from the new technology and America’s position as a world leader in artificial intelligence. The AI export curbs, which were set to take effect on May 15, have been panned by tech giants. The curbs sorted countries into three tiers subject to specific AI-related trade regulation, with those in the top tier facing the least restrictions. Tech executives called for more innovation and faster AI adoption, emphasizing the importance of building machines that help people pursue better jobs. Nonprofit media watchdog Common Sense Media released a report saying AI apps pose 'unacceptable risks' to children and teens, raising concerns about the potential harm from AI chatbots. The hearing also discussed the challenge of balancing the ability to move quickly while adopting necessary standards and export controls to prevent technology from being diverted to China.

## Boeing now plans to deliver new Air Force One jets in 2027, before Trump leaves office

- _Published: 2025-05-08 11:39:00-20:39_

### Summary

Boeing now plans to deliver new Air Force One jets in 2027, before President Trump leaves office, according to a top Air Force official. This comes as the delays in the delivery of these jets, which have been ongoing since 2017, have caused significant cost overruns for Boeing, totaling $2.5 billion. While this is one to two years earlier than Boeing had most recently predicted, it still represents a major improvement in the timeline. The Air Force, led by Acting Acquisitions Chief Darlene Costello, has proposed this new delivery date to meet the needs of the Trump administration. The challenge is not the basic jet itself, but the complex requirements to turn a run-of-the-mill Boeing 747 into the flying communication and command post fit for the president of the United States. The Boeing contract, known as VC-25B, has been a critical project for the company, accounting for 42% of its government revenue, and the delays have been a point of contention between the administration and the company.

## Cinnamon could affect the metabolism of prescription medications, according to a new study

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/08/health/cinnamon-interactions-medications-wellness)
- _Published: 2025-05-08 10:57:00.000Z_

### Summary

The study published in the journal Food Chemistry: Molecular Sciences revealed that cinnamon, while potentially beneficial for some health conditions, could also interact negatively with prescription medications, particularly in individuals with chronic conditions. Researchers found that cinnamaldehyde, the primary active ingredient in cinnamon, can be rapidly metabolized into cinnamic acid, which can activate drug metabolism receptors. This rapid metabolism could lead to potential herb-drug interactions, prompting the authors to recommend caution, especially for those using blood thinners, diabetes medications, cancer treatments, or other health conditions. Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and expert on cinnamon's health impacts, advised that while a small amount of cinnamon used in cooking is unlikely to cause issues, taking concentrated cinnamon supplements over a prolonged period could pose risks. She emphasized the importance of consulting a healthcare provider before using cinnamon supplements and noted that dietary supplements, even those labeled as 'natural,' may not be safe in all circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the efficacy of dietary supplements, and consumers are encouraged to be cautious and inform their healthcare providers about any supplements they are using.

### Summary

In the Boston Celtics' recent playoff series against the New York Knicks, the Celtics lost a crucial game despite having a 20-point lead in the third quarter. Jaylen Brown, a Celtics star, criticized the team's performance, stating it was 'inexcusable' to lose two games with a 20-point lead. The Knicks won their second game of the series, bringing them to a 2-0 series lead in the Eastern Conference semifinals. The Celtics' offense faltered in the fourth quarter, missing 14 of their final 15 shots and shooting poorly from beyond the arc in both games.

- _Published: 2025-05-08 09:36:00-04:00_

### Summary

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced on Thursday that its well-known 'billion-dollar weather and climate disasters' database will be retired. This move will make it difficult for the public to track the cost of extreme weather and climate events since 1980, which has allowed taxpayers, media, and researchers to monitor disaster costs. The database, which has been updated since 1980, will be archived but will not be updated after 2024. The Trump administration has been focused on eliminating programs and departments related to 'climate,' and this database's discontinuation is another step in that direction. NOAA's budget proposal for fiscal year 2026 plans to cut NOAA's spending by 24%, leading to further staff reductions and cuts in data collection and public access.

- _Published: 2025-05-08 09:29:00-20:25_

### Summary

Axial Seamount, a mile-wide underwater volcano situated on the Juan de Fuca Ridge, is showing signs of an impending eruption. The volcano has experienced increased seismic activity and magma buildup, with scientists predicting it could erupt soon. The last eruption, in April 2015, involved about 10,000 small-scale earthquakes and magma flowing about 25 miles across the seafloor for a month. Located off the coast of Oregon, Axial Seamount is situated on a geological hot spot where searing gushes of molten rock rise from Earth’s mantle. The volcano's frequency of earthquakes has recently picked up, signaling an eruption could be near. The National Science Foundation's Ocean Observatories Initiative Regional Cabled Array, which monitors the activity of Axial Seamount, reported a dramatic increase in the frequency of earthquakes, indicating the volcano's inflation with increasingly more magma. The next eruption could potentially be mild, and while it may be noticeable underwater due to magma flows, it is unlikely to be felt on land. Scientists are planning to livestream the eruption, which has never been done before, if it occurs.

## The Bank of England cuts interest rates as tariffs endanger global economic growth

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/08/economy/bank-of-england-rate-cut-tariffs-intl)
- _Published: 2025-05-08 09:26:00-04:00_

### Summary

The Bank of England has cut its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point, citing lower UK inflation. This brings the main cost of borrowing in Britain to 4.25%, marking the fourth cut the central bank has made since starting to reduce rates in August last year. The move is driven by the central bank's belief that 'substantial progress' has been made in reducing inflation over the past two years, and by the intensified uncertainty surrounding global trade policies, particularly due to US President Donald Trump's tariffs. The Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey has expressed hope that a trade deal between the UK and the US would help reduce uncertainty and economic shock. However, the higher US tariffs could also lower UK inflation, providing the Bank of England with more room to cut rates if the economy needs a boost. The article also highlights that economic growth forecasts have been downgraded for numerous countries, including the United Kingdom, by entities such as the International Monetary Fund. Additionally, the article mentions that the UK's output has contracted in April, as indicated by a survey, and the potential impact of redirected Chinese exports on the UK market, which could lower prices and inflation.

### Key Takeaways
  - The Bank of England has cut its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point.
  - The cut brings the main cost of borrowing in Britain to 4.25%.
  - Uncertainty surrounding global trade policies has intensified.

## Trump’s diversity purge freezes hundreds of millions in medical research at universities across the country

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/08/politics/universities-medical-research-funding-frozen-trump-diversity-purge)
- _Published: 2025-05-08 13:00:00-15:00_

### Summary

A U.S. District Judge has raised concerns regarding the deportation of a 2-year-old girl named VML from the United States to Honduras without proper legal procedures. This case highlights the broader issue of the Trump administration's anti-diversity push at universities across the country. The Trump administration has targeted hundreds of millions in federal grants for medical research, leading to mass funding cuts and policy changes at universities. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is a major funder that canceled funding for several projects, including those focusing on maternal health, autism, diabetes, and cancer research. Many universities, particularly public and smaller institutions, lack the resources to fight the administration's demands. The impact on health care research, including maternal health studies, has raised concerns among scientists and public health experts, who worry about the potential for fewer life-saving treatments and cures. Despite the Trump administration's stance, Americans overwhelmingly support programs to reduce maternal and infant mortality, as per a Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health poll published last month. The article also mentions the legal battle between Harvard University and the Trump administration over $2.2 billion in federal grants.

### Key Takeaways
  - The Trump administration is freezing hundreds of millions of dollars in medical research grants at universities, particularly those that have diversity and inclusion programs and that boycott Israeli companies.
  - The anti-DEI mandate signed by Trump in his second term is broadening the scope of the previous executive order, affecting universities across the country.

### Summary

A priceless treasure trove of biodata gathered from generations of Americans by Harvard University researchers may soon be lost due to additional funding cuts by the Trump administration, a leading nutrition researcher told CNN. The latest round of cuts to Harvard by the Trump administration will halt funding for the upkeep of dozens of giant freezers filled with DNA, blood, urine, stool, and tissue samples used for ongoing research. The biological samples and data from the Nurse’s Health Study, one of the largest and longest investigations ever done on women’s risk factors for chronic disease, and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, which has chronicled the health and diet of men via questionnaires, have led to major advances in science. Researchers are scrambling to try to protect the samples and the data they have, as they can’t last more than a few weeks or a couple of months, depending on the aspect of the study. However, the carefully preserved biological samples, accompanied by decades of disease follow-up data, offer tremendous opportunities for research, including identifying biomarkers for early detection of diseases, understanding risk factors, and informing effective prevention strategies. Harvard University, which receives 46% of its funding from the federal government, was already reeling from the $2.2 billion cuts in federal grants and contracts announced by the Trump administration in mid-April. The federal government has a responsibility to ensure that taxpayer dollars do not flow to institutions that allow open harassment of Jewish students or tolerate antisemitic intimidation, according to Andrew Nixon, director of communications for the US Department of Health and Human Services. However, the university is contesting the Trump administration's funding cuts, saying it

- _Published: 2025-05-08 12:59:00-20:59_

### Summary

The recent clashes between India and Pakistan, sparked by the April 22 massacre in Indian-administered Kashmir, have escalated into one of the most serious tensions in decades. Despite Pakistan claiming to shoot down Indian fighter jets and launch attacks, India insists these were not in response to a military strike. Both nations have claimed victory and the situation remains tense, with analysts and experts predicting potential for either de-escalation or escalation. The conflict highlights the ongoing challenges faced by both nations, including political instability, insurgency, climate catastrophes, and economic disarray. With both nuclear-capable nations, the situation is considered unpredictable and dangerous. Internationally, there have been calls for de-escalation and mediation efforts, though the United States, which historically mediates such crises, may face limitations in its ability to intercede. Meanwhile, Pakistan's powerful army general Asim Munir vowed to match any aggression from India, further complicating the situation.

### Key Takeaways
  - India and Pakistan are claiming victory after the recent clashes, but the situation remains tense and could escalate further.
  - The conflict has the potential to become an all-out war, with both nations facing significant risks and consequences.
  - Both nations have nuclear capabilities, making the situation even more unpredictable and dangerous.

## Why Trump isn’t leading an emergency effort to ease the India-Pakistan crisis

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/08/politics/kashmir-india-pakistan-trump)
- _Published: 2025-05-08 02:06:00-04:00_

### Summary

An analysis by Stephen Collinson from CNN suggests that the Trump administration may not be inclined to lead an emergency effort to ease the India-Pakistan crisis. The article points out that this shift in leadership is due to Trump's limited ambitions for global convening and his win-loss worldview, which sees little difference between allies and adversaries. Collinson also mentions that past successful US efforts in conflict resolution have required months and years of slow confidence-building and intensive preparatory diplomacy, which the current administration has not shown motivation for. Additionally, the article notes that international efforts to end the crisis may not be led by the United States, as other regional actors, such as Qatar and creditors to Pakistan, may take the lead if the situation does not worsen significantly. The article also highlights the complex geopolitical implications of the crisis, including the changing relationship between India and Pakistan, the impact of the conflict on regional powers like Qatar and Saudi Arabia, and the potential for the situation to escalate further if India responds to new Pakistan attacks.

### Key Takeaways
  - The current Trump administration may not be inclined to lead an emergency effort to ease the India-Pakistan crisis, as it has a different approach to global diplomacy and is less inclined to build international coalitions for conflict resolution.
  - This shift in leadership is due to Trump's limited ambitions for global convening and his win-loss worldview, which sees little difference between allies and adversaries.

Al-Sharaa also emphasizes the need for Israel to respect the UN-brokered accord, stating that Syria is committed to it. Furthermore, the article mentions that the United Arab Emirates has been involved in setting up a back-channel for talks between Israel and Syria, though this is denied by the UAE's foreign minister. The article highlights the complexity and ongoing nature of these negotiations, which have taken place since the fall of the Syrian government in December 2021, with Israel reportedly taking more territory and conducting multiple attacks in Syria to secure its position and prevent the re-establishment of military capabilities and militant groups.

### Summary

REAL ID enforcement, a security standard for boarding planes and accessing federal facilities, went into effect on May 8, 2025. Despite some airports experiencing smooth operations initially, many travelers were caught off guard by the new requirements. The Department of Homeland Security reported that 81% of travelers were REAL ID compliant, but some states had lower compliance rates. As summer travel begins, officials advise travelers to update their REAL IDs ahead of time, as it's becoming increasingly necessary to meet the new standard for air travel. In states with low compliance rates, such as Illinois (below 50%), Alabama (33%), and North Carolina (52%), it's vital for residents to obtain REAL IDs as early as possible. The TSA is collaborating with states and airlines to achieve closer to 100% compliance, ensuring a secure travel experience for all passengers.

## Judge orders release of detained international student who says he was targeted for supporting Palestinian human rights

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/07/us/mohammed-hoque-minnesota-state-university-mankato)
- _Published: 2025-05-07 13:14:00-17:14_

### Summary

A federal judge in Minnesota ordered the release of a detained international student, Mohammed Hoque, after finding that the Trump administration failed to provide sufficient evidence to justify his arrest and detention. The judge, Jerry Blackwell, ruled that Hoque's arrest matched a pattern of activity by the administration targeting non-citizens for speaking out in support of Palestinian human rights. Hoque, a Bangladeshi national, was arrested by the Department of Homeland Security in March and detained for four decades until a judge intervened. The judge's ruling highlights concerns about First Amendment violations and viewpoint-based targeting, noting that the government had failed to present evidence supporting Hoque's arrest and continued detention. Hoque's case is part of a larger trend of student visa cancellations and revocations of statuses across the U.S. amid a Trump administration crackdown. The judge's decision comes after Hoque's attorneys filed a lawsuit and a habeas petition seeking to stop his transfer out of Minnesota. The case will now proceed along with the immigration proceedings the Department of Homeland Security has initiated against Hoque.

### Summary

A U.S. federal judge has ruled that a 2-year-old girl, VML, was deported to Honduras without the proper legal process. The judge, Terry Doughty, says this was done despite the court's request to clarify VML's situation. The judge's ruling comes amid criticisms of the Trump administration for its rapid removal of noncitizens from the country. VML and her family were taken into ICE custody on Tuesday for a routine meeting, which was the trigger for their deportation.

This case highlights ongoing concerns about the Trump administration's practices of rapid deportation without proper legal process.

## Exclusive: Some ‘Les Mis’ cast members plan to boycott Trump’s attendance at Kennedy Center performance next month

### Summary

At least 10 to 12 performers of the musical 'Les Misérables' have planned to boycott the show on June 11, the night President Donald Trump will attend at the Kennedy Center, in protest against his administration's efforts to reshape the center and control American institutions. This boycott highlights the friction between the Trump administration and members within the center, which has been thrust into the middle of culture wars. Some cast members were given the option to not perform on the night of Trump's appearance, but both major cast members and members of the ensemble decided to sit out. The move follows Trump's installation of himself as chairman of the Kennedy Center, including replacing trustees with Trump appointees, and his appointment of Richard Grennell, a longtime confidant, to the director role earlier this year. The Kennedy Center is facing financial struggles and has canceled performances, including the tour of the children's musical 'Finn,' in response to Trump's takeover.

## House GOP infighting turns ugly over Trump’s 'big beautiful bill'

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/07/politics/medicaid-republicans-divided-house-trump-bill)
- _Published: 2025-05-07 18:51:00-05:00_

### Summary

A rift has emerged within the House Republican conference over President Donald Trump's proposed legislation, particularly over the issue of Medicaid reform. Speaker Mike Johnson is pushing for a House vote on the bill before Memorial Day, but tensions are high due to disagreements among Republicans over the scope of Medicaid cuts and the overall spending. While Johnson and his leadership team aim to secure the votes needed to pass the bill, centrists in the conference are resisting significant Medicaid cuts and are demanding a smaller number of cuts. The disagreements have led to a two-hour meeting where multiple centrists stated they will not support any plan that does not include the $1.5 trillion in spending cuts Trump's party is aiming for. The tensions are expected to impact the party's ability to pass the bill with a unified front, as Johnson and his team seek to mollify the more centrist members who are unwilling to cut more than $1.5 trillion, which many in the conservative wing consider too much. The battle is not just about Medicaid, as the bill also includes new immigration restrictions, increased defense spending, and a two-year extension of the debt limit. The infighting highlights the internal challenges facing the Republican Party as it tries to deliver on the president's agenda while maintaining support from the party's diverse base.

## As House Republicans Plan to Cut Medicaid, Some Have Staked Their Alliances on the Program's Future

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/07/politics/enrollment-medicaid-republican-representatives-dg)
- _Published: 2025-05-07 18:45:00-20:45_

### Summary

As the House Republicans plan to reduce billions in funding from Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) for tax, immigration, and spending cuts, a CNN analysis highlights that over 60 Republican lawmakers represent districts with higher-than-average Medicaid enrollment. This raises questions about their potential stance on the cuts. Most US adults polled do not want decreases in Medicaid spending. The article also mentions that the budget blueprint proposed by House Energy and Commerce Committee includes instructions to cut $880 billion in funding from programs in their jurisdiction, with Medicaid being one of the programs affected. Despite Republican leaders' intentions to eliminate waste, fraud and abuse, the feasibility of reaching the proposed cuts without impacting benefits is unclear. The article also notes that New Mexico and California, with the highest enrollment rates, are primarily represented by Democratic senators, and some Republican lawmakers have expressed concerns about Medicaid cuts. Some have signed letters supporting Medicaid and opposing cuts, including Rob Bresnahan and Juan Ciscomani. However, Republicans representing high Medicaid enrollment districts could face pressure to break from party lines, especially those who won their seats in close elections last year.

### Key Takeaways
  - House Republicans are considering significant cuts to Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) budgets, which could affect nearly 80 million individuals reliant on these programs for critical healthcare.
  - Many Republican districts with higher-than-average Medicaid enrollment rates could face pressure to vote against such cuts, especially those who won their seats in close elections.
  - Republican lawmakers from high Medicaid enrollment districts have expressed concerns about Medicaid cuts, including representatives Nick Begich, Juan Ciscomani, Ken Calvert, Jeff Hurd, and Rob Bresnahan.

## Ex-model takes the stand in Harvey Weinstein’s retrial. The prior jury never heard about her

### Summary

Days into Harvey Weinstein's retrial, a 2006 sexual assault allegation was introduced through the testimony of Kaja Sokola, a former model. Prior to her testimony, prosecutors had privately spoken with Sokola about an alleged assault. This is the first time that Sokola's claims were introduced to the jury. Weinstein denies the allegations and has had his case overturned by an appeals court. Kaja Sokola claims Weinstein forced her to perform oral sex in a Manhattan hotel shortly after meeting her. She claims that the assault was instigated after Weinstein arranged for her to be an extra in a film and met her sister. Kaja Sokola testified that she was not interested in modeling, but in acting and writing, and that she was pressured into the industry by her mother and sister. Her testimony is part of a broader pattern of sexual misconduct allegations against Weinstein, which has been at the center of the #MeToo movement.

### Summary

A federal judge, Brian Murphy, ruled that deporting migrants to Libya would violate his previous order, stating that the Department of Homeland Security could not delegate immigration responsibilities to the Department of Defense or other countries in the absence of written notice and an opportunity to contest the deportation ahead of time.

## Washington, DC sees spike in homes for sale amid DOGE federal worker layoffs

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/07/business/washington-homes-for-sale-doge-layoffs)
- _Published: 2025-05-07 16:27:00-20:27_

### Summary

The number of active home listings in Washington, DC surged by 25.1% year-over-year in the four weeks ending April 27, according to a report from real estate website Redfin. This dramatic increase is attributed to steep layoffs in the federal workforce, driven by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which has cut federal funding and jobs to reduce government spending. The layoffs have led to an influx of homes for sale in the area, with many homes in the suburbs of DC showing the largest increases. Despite the high number of new listings, real estate agents report that the housing market remains tight, and listings do not meet the demand. The layoffs are also noted to affect the uncertainty surrounding administration changes, which could further impact the local housing market.

## Attacks on Harvard by Trump administration have built for months. A timeline of the dispute

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/04/26/us/harvard-university-trump-timeline)
- _Published: 2025-05-07 14:25:00-20:25_

### Summary

The U.S. Trump administration has been aggressively pressuring Harvard University to address what it deems as campus antisemitism. This has led to a series of events, including the Trump administration's issuance of executive orders, issuing letters demanding changes, and threatening to cut off funding. The conflict began in January 2023 when Trump signed an executive order calling for tougher enforcement of government efforts against antisemitism. It escalated when Claudine Gay, the then-president of Harvard, was asked in a congressional hearing whether 'calling for the genocide of Jews' would violate Harvard's rules against bullying and harassment. Gay's response and the resulting backlash, combined with a plagiarism scandal, led to her resignation. Harvard then launched a task force to combat antisemitism, tightening its policies on protests and harassment. Despite these efforts, the administration's demands continued, including revoking visas and cutting off federal funding. In April 2023, Harvard sued the Trump administration over these funding threats, claiming they violated the First Amendment. The conflict has had significant impacts on Harvard's relationship with the federal government, including the threat of revoking its tax-exempt status and cutting off research grants. The lawsuit has also led Harvard to change its name for its Office of Equity, Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging to Community and Campus Life, further emphasizing the university's commitment to addressing these issues.

### Key Takeaways
  - The Trump administration has been aggressive in pressuring Harvard University to address what it deems as campus antisemitism, culminating in Harvard suing the administration over funding threats.
  - The controversy began with Trump signing an executive order in January 2023 calling for tougher enforcement of government efforts against antisemitism, including recommendations on how higher education institutions should handle it.
  - The Trump administration has escalated its demands by issuing letters, threatening to revoke visas, and cutting off funding, with Harvard rejecting these demands and filing a lawsuit.

### Summary

Cardinals failed to elect a new pope on the first day of the conclave at the Sistine Chapel, leading to three more days of voting. With no clear frontrunner and no formal list of papal candidates, the cardinals face a battle between those who want to continue with the late Pope Francis' reforms and those who prefer a more traditional papacy. The conclave, which takes place against the backdrop of clerical sexual abuse scandals, will continue until a new pope is elected or the cardinals decide to break their secrecy oath and end the process. The unpredictability of the conclave is further complicated by the fact that many cardinals are not familiar with each other due to Pope Francis' changes in the selection process.

## Key takeaways from the Fed’s latest decision to hold rates steady as it warns of stagflation

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/07/economy/fed-rate-decision-may)
- _Published: 2025-05-07 16:05:00.000Z_

### Summary

The Federal Reserve announced it will hold interest rates steady, warning of stagflation due to President Donald Trump's trade policies. The central bank kept its benchmark lending rate unchanged at a range of 4.25% to 4.5%, extending a holding pattern that began in January. Despite the risks of higher unemployment and inflation, the Fed stated that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. The Fed is waiting for more data to show how the US economy is responding to President Trump’s significant policy changes, and remains on hold at this meeting. Jerome Powell emphasized that the labor market remains solid, allowing the Fed to remain comfortably on hold for more data to trickle in. However, some economists argue that the Fed would be quicker to respond to any signs of a weakening job market, as it did last year when it delivered a bold half-point cut after unemployment climbed steadily over a few months.

### Key Takeaways
  - The Federal Reserve decided to hold interest rates steady as it warned of stagflation due to President Donald Trump's trade policies.
  - The economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace, but the risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation have risen.
  - The Fed is waiting for more data to show how the US economy is responding to President Trump’s significant policy changes.
  - The Fed is standing pat at this meeting and will remain on hold until further data is available to determine the appropriate course of action.

- _Published: 2025-05-07 15:50:00-20:50_

### Summary

Harvard board chair Penny Pritzker has become a target in the ongoing conflict between the Trump administration and Harvard University. While President Donald Trump and Harvard President Alan Garber have been engaged in a legal battle over academic freedom and funding, hedge fund CEO Bill Ackman has publicly criticized Pritzker for her handling of the pro-Palestinian encampment and protests over the Hamas-Israel conflict at the university. The controversy stems from Pritzker's leadership during a painful and disorienting time at Harvard, which has seen disciplinary and academic policy changes as part of a 16-month probe into antisemitism and anti-Muslim bias. Ackman and Education Secretary Linda McMahon have called for a change in leadership at the Harvard Corporation, citing Pritzker's recent failures. As Harvard's federal funding has been frozen, Pritzker faces a tough fight for both her prestigious role and the future of the university from which she earned her bachelor's degree in economics. The Pritzker family's connections with Trump and the family's contentious history with the former president further complicate the situation.

### Summary

The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has unveiled a pilot program for the National Institutes of Health to tap into Medicare and Medicaid data to search for the root causes of autism. However, this initiative has sparked widespread concern and controversy due to privacy issues and the potential misuse of data. The project, proposed by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., aims to find causes of autism by September and involves the use of insurance claims, medical records, and data from wearable technology. The Autism Science Foundation, the Autism Self Advocacy Network, and other autism advocates have voiced their concerns about privacy and the lack of transparency in the project. This has led to a 'flood' of concerned calls, emails, and texts from the autism community, indicating the fear and apprehension about the potential impact on medical care and the diagnosis of autistic patients. The project also faces criticism for potentially weaponizing medical diagnoses, which could lead to fear among providers and patients. There are also limitations to the CMS data, as it focuses on certain portions of the population and raises questions about the scope and burden of a condition in public health.

### Summary

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) announced plans to use information from Medicare and Medicaid to create a real-world data platform to investigate the causes of autism. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. expressed the intention to use this database to uncover the root causes of autism and other chronic diseases. The initiative, however, has raised concerns over privacy and potential misuse of data, with Helen Tager-Flusberg, the director of the Center for Autism Research at Boston University and leader of the Coalition of Autism Scientists, warning of the possibility of data being abused. Critics, including Helen Tager-Flusberg, express doubts about the administration's assurances regarding privacy protections. Meanwhile, Jay Bhattacharya, the NIH Director, pushed back on a September deadline to find the cause of autism, stating that a realistic timeline would be a year, and questioned the notion that vaccines cause autism.

### Summary

The U.S. government has granted refugee status to 54 Afrikaans South Africans, white descendants of mainly Dutch colonizers. The sources say the group is expected to land in the U.S. at Dulles Airport on May 12, three days after the executive order was signed by President Trump in February 2022. The executive order prioritized humanitarian relief for Afrikaners in South Africa who faced racial discrimination. The Afrikanders, who are described as economically privileged and have family ties in the U.S., were granted P1 refugee status, which is given to individual cases referred by designated entities for resettlement. The sources noted that the interview process and granting of refugee status was unusually quick. However, the UN's International Organization for Migration has refused to be involved in the process. There is controversy surrounding the granting of refugee status to Afrikaners, with President Trump and his adviser Elon Musk claiming persecution of Afrikaners in South Africa, while the South African government disputes these claims.

## A firing squad tried to shoot a prisoner in the heart. They missed, autopsy indicates.

- [source](https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5389846)
- _Published: 2025-05-08 14:41:00-20:41_

### Summary

In a controversial execution, a 36-year-old South Carolina man, Mikal Mahdi, was executed by a firing squad on April 11, 2025. An autopsy revealed that only two bullet wounds were found on his body, not the three shots intended, suggesting a botched execution. Pathologists noted that the wounds did not directly hit his heart, causing him to suffer and bleed out for around 21 seconds. The South Carolina Supreme Court ruled in 2024 that firing squads could be used as an execution method, which is now being challenged due to concerns about the accuracy of the method and the state's documentation of the process. The autopsy report did not include important visual evidence, such as X-rays or photos of bullet fragments, which could help understand what happened during the execution. Mikal Mahdi's lawyers filed a notice with the court on May 8, 2025, citing the botched execution and the lack of evidence as reasons to question the legality of the process. The article highlights the ongoing debate over the use of firing squads as an execution method and the need for transparency and accuracy in the process.

- _Published: 2025-05-08 15:23:00-04:00_

### Summary

More than 70 million Americans, who are low-income or disabled, have health insurance paid for by the state and federal government called Medicaid. The article discusses states trying to revive Medicaid work requirements, which involve requiring adults to prove they are working in order to qualify for Medicaid. This idea is popular among Republicans and has been attempted in Arkansas, Ohio, and Arizona, among other states. The article highlights concerns from Medicaid recipients and advocates who worry about losing health care if they can't prove they are working. Arkansas' governor proposed new work requirements that include state-funded job assistance for those who don't work, but it's unclear if the federal government will approve the changes. There is debate over whether these requirements are beneficial or costly, with some studies showing they don't result in increased employment. The article also mentions that if all states adopted these work rules, up to 5 million people could lose their Medicaid coverage, potentially leading to more hardships for those affected.

- _Published: 2025-05-08 17:51:00-05:00_

### Summary

World Central Kitchen, a leading humanitarian aid group based in the United States, has closed its soup kitchens across Gaza due to the ongoing Israeli blockade, which has led to food shortages and dwindling supplies. The closure of these soup kitchens is a stark reminder of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, which has been severely impacted by the 19-month-long war and the Israeli blockade. The World Food Program had previously reported that Gaza's food stocks had run out, and the situation has worsened with the closure of 30% of the U.N. nutrition centers in Gaza. The blockading of humanitarian assistance has not only led to the closure of community kitchens but has also resulted in critical shortages of water and fuel, making it difficult for the local population to access essential resources. The Israeli military, responsible for airstrikes in Gaza and Lebanon, continues to target Hamas infrastructure, leading to the deaths and injuries of civilians. The prolonged conflict has caused a significant toll on both civilians and combatants in Gaza, with over 52,760 deaths and 119,264 wounded as of the latest reports. Additionally, the Israeli military has placed journalist Ali Samoudi, a renowned Palestinian journalist, on six months of administrative detention, highlighting the broader human rights issues at play in the conflict. Despite the dire humanitarian situation, the Israeli government maintains that its blockade is necessary to pressure Hamas to release hostages and that aid should be directed to

### Key Takeaways
  - World Central Kitchen has suspended its operations in Gaza due to the blockade and lack of food supplies.
  - Over 10,000 children have been treated for acute malnutrition in Gaza since the beginning of the year.

## Press freedom 'no longer a given' in the U.S., says journalism nonprofit

- [source](https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5384970)
- _Published: 2025-05-08 11:40:00-12:40_

### Summary

The Committee to Protect Journalists released a report titled 'Alarm bells: Trump's first 100 days ramp up fear for the press, democracy' in late April, in which it outlined concerns about the White House's actions related to press freedom. This report was published amid growing criticisms of the Trump administration's rapid removal of noncitizens from the country and its targeted attacks against journalists in newsrooms. The report points to access issues, like Trump barring the Associated Press from White House pool events and FCC's investigation into outlets like NBC, ABC, CBS, as well as NPR. Katherine Jacobson, the lead author of the report, expressed concerns about the real chilling effect and potential curtailment of media freedoms, and she highlighted the impact on journalists' ability to do their work and on the American public's understanding of events in those rooms that are excluded from due to limited access. The report advises journalists to conduct risk assessments and follow guidance offered by CPJ and other journalism organizations for safety practices while reporting or traveling abroad for work, ensuring staff and freelancers have access to safety protocol training, secure devices, insurance, and legal aid. The article also mentioned the Trump administration's actions, including the FCC's investigation into NPR and PBS underwriting practices, and the White House's actions against journalists in newsrooms, as well as the Biden administration's changes to the rules for hard passes to enter the White House grounds, which limited the number of pass holders and increased the exclusion of journalists from covering certain events. The article suggests that the impact of the Trump administration's actions on press freedom could be felt for decades to come.

### Summary

Thousands of staff have left their jobs since January at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as part of the Trump administration's effort to dramatically reduce the government workforce. Former and current CDC employees are feeling demoralized and anxious about the sweeping cuts that have eliminated programs dedicated to areas such as injury prevention, sexual, reproductive, and oral health, workplace hazard reduction, maternal health, and environmental health. The agency's workforce has been reduced to the point where some staff members feel they are being watched, and many fear for their future. Dr. Anne Schuchat, a former acting director who worked at the agency for 33 years, described the situation as a 'five-alarm fire' that will take decades to recover from and could result in many people dying due to these interruptions. The agency's restructuring, according to an HHS spokesperson, is a necessary, strategic effort to align with evolving public health needs. However, there is growing concern that these cuts will have a significant impact on the health of the American public, leading to an increase in illnesses and deaths.
