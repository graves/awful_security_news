Nancy Mace berated Charleston airport police due to missing escort, incident report says \n       \n  By Taylor Romine, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:53 PM EDT, Sat November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  US Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina allegedly berated police officers at Charleston International Airport Thursday morning, allegedly “loudly cursing” at officers and saying they were “f**king incompetent,” according to an incident report from police.\n \n\n   \n  Mace, who  closely aligns herself  with President Donald Trump and is  currently running  for South Carolina governor, has repeatedly shared concerns about her safety in the past. Last December, she reported being  “physically accosted”  on Capitol grounds.\n \n\n   \n  One officer said in their report: “Any other person in the airport acting and talking the way she did, our department would have been dispatch (sic) and we would have addressed the behavior.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Mace’s office for comment. Mace’s Director of Operations Cameron Morabito told CNN in a statement, “Apparently, simply arriving at an airport now makes headlines if you’re leading the race for governor.”\n \n\n   \n  “We are forced to take the congresswoman’s safety extremely seriously,” Morabito said. “After the world watched Charlie Kirk’s assassination, the threats against her have only intensified. Our security procedures are based solely on legitimate safety concerns, and any attempt to politicize this reality is both dangerous and reckless.”\n \n\n   \n  Mace also briefly spoke with the Times, saying she did complain to the airport because she is concerned about her safety given recent death threats against her. “We all get frustrated when it’s not taken seriously,” she told the outlet.\n \n\n   \n    Mace ran late, arrived in different vehicle\n \n\n   \n  Two Charleston County Aviation Authority police officers were informed at 6 a.m. they would need to escort Mace from the curb to her flight, according to an incident report filed by the officers. They were told she would arrive at 6:30 a.m. in a white BMW, the report says.\n \n\n   \n  At 6:20 a.m., three officers went to the ticketing curb area and waited for her car, the report said. They were informed at around 6:35 a.m. she was running 15 minutes late and kept waiting for the car, they said, not seeing a white BMW.\n \n\n   \n  Security video provided to CNN by the airport shows Mace arriving at a sidewalk entrance area at 6:50 a.m. in a dark gray sedan. No other people were visible in the video. Airport officials said they had no further comment.\n \n\n   \n  A little before 7 a.m., officers were told Mace was waiting at the Transportation Security Administration known crewmember entrance, and the officers made their way over “in less than a minute,” the report said.\n \n\n   \n  When officers met Mace to escort her, they said she was “very irate” and “began loudly cursing and making derogatory comments to us and about the department.”\n \n\n   \n  “She repeatedly stated we were ‘f**king incompetent,’ and ‘this is no way to treat a f**king US Representative’,” one officer said in his report. “She also said we would never treat (US Sen.) Tim Scott like this.”\n \n\n   \n  A different security video provided to CNN by the airport shows the TSA security checkpoint with Mace speaking with two airport officials at the known crewmember entrance. It appears an airport employee made a call to an unknown person, and approximately three minutes later the two officers arrived to escort Mace. It took about seven minutes from the time Mace appears at the known crewmember entrance and starts interacting with airport employees to when the escorting officers arrive, according to the video.\n \n\n   \n  Mace allegedly continued cursing at the officers and into her phone while they walked with her to the gate, according to the account of one officer. After she boarded her flight, an airline employee and several other TSA agents said they were shocked and upset by her behavior, the officer said.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/us/harvard-university-goldenson-explosion","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"07:21:00-04:00","title":"Officials investigate ‘intentional’ explosion at Harvard University medical building that left no injuries","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"An apparent intentional explosion occurred at Harvard University's Goldenson medical building on November 1, 2025, around 2:48 a.m., prompting a joint investigation by Harvard University Police, Boston police, and the FBI.

November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A cryptic reference to “pumpkin day.” An online chat about an ISIS-inspired attack. A shooting range visit to practice high-speed reloads with AK-47s.\n \n\n   \n  A  potential terrorist attack over Halloween weekend  was thwarted by the FBI, according to a social media post by agency Director Kash Patel.\n \n\n   \n  Details of the alleged plot are scarce but two law enforcement sources with knowledge of the case told CNN about the “pumpkin day” reference, the online chat and the shooting range activity.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know and don’t know about the potential terror attack:\n \n\n   \n    Two arrests, and others being questioned\n \n\n   \n  Two people were arrested, and three others were being questioned, according to two law enforcement officials with knowledge of the case. Their ages range from 16 to 20s.\n \n\n   \n  Patel  wrote on X  the FBI “thwarted a potential terrorist attack and arrested multiple subjects in Michigan who were allegedly plotting a violent attack over Halloween weekend.”\n \n\n   \n  “The FBI swept out from the Detroit field office last night and through this morning, taking people into custody, executing search warrants and doing subpoenas for phones, computers and other material,” John Miller, CNN’s chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst, said Friday.\n \n\n   \n  An attorney who said he is representing one of the adults in custody urged people to wait for “verifiable facts” before jumping to conclusions. His client, a 20-year-old US citizen who has not been publicly identified, is cooperating with authorities and has not been formally charged, attorney Amir Makled said.\n \n\n   \n  “We are confident that, once the facts are reviewed objectively, it will be clear there was never any planned ‘mass-casualty’ event or coordinated terror plot of any kind,” Makled said in an email to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “The reality here involves a small group … with a lawful interest in recreational firearms, not a terrorist cell or organized attack. All firearms were legally obtained and registered,” Makled said.\n \n\n   \n  The attorney said he is concerned about “rhetoric that’s harmful to the large Arab and Muslim population in the state of Michigan, specifically in Dearborn” since reports of the alleged plot emerged.\n \n\n   \n  Laraib Irfan said he woke up to what he described as loud bangs from “smoke bombs” in the predawn and saw FBI agents outside his neighbor’s house two doors down on their quiet Dearborn street. He said he is “close” to the family that lives in the home and is “just trying to find answers” about what happened. Some occupants of the home were handcuffed outside.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re like family. They’re like friends. We’re always talking with each other,” he said of the neighbors.\n \n\n   \n  “I can’t believe that something like that would even go down on my block,” he added.\n \n\n   \n    How the alleged plot was uncovered\n \n\n   \n  The ISIS-inspired plot unfolded in online chatrooms, according to the two law enforcement officials.\n \n\n   \n  An FBI undercover person was introduced into the chatroom in the early stages of discussion, the officials added.\n \n\n   \n  “This all relates to an investigation that started months ago into people who were communicating online with each other here in the United States … but also talking to people overseas, possibly connected to ISIS,” said Miller, citing conversations with law enforcement officials who had been briefed.\n \n\n   \n  The participants discussed whether to carry out an ISIS-inspired plot in the US – “though what that plot was, when that plot would be, what the target would be, was unclear as they discussed various options in terms of timing,” Miller said.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not clear what the two people arrested were charged with and whether charges have been filed.\n \n\n   \n  Miller said the FBI moved in this week when a group of people who were being monitored “went to a shooting range with AK-47s and other weapons, fired a large number of rounds of ammunition, practiced tactical high-speed reloads, and in the discussions it was picked up a reference to what we’re told is ‘pumpkin day’ – a possible reference to Halloween.”\n \n\n   \n  The individuals taken into custody had discussed in their communications whether they were ready to carry out an attack, multiple law enforcement officials briefed on the investigation said. Some said they needed more time and training, but a younger member of the group had said that it was time to act, two officials added.\n \n\n   \n  There was also a discussion at one point about taking a one-day trip to New York City to see the sights, including visiting Rockefeller Center and looking at the Statue of Liberty, the officials said. There was no talk about the trip being a reconnaissance for an attack, but the conversation caught the attention of both the FBI and the NYPD as the investigation continued.\n \n\n   \n    ‘No current threat to public safety’\n \n\n   \n  The FBI’s Detroit field office confirmed “the FBI in Michigan were present in the cities of Dearborn and Inkster … conducting law enforcement activities,” spokesperson Jordan Hall told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “There is no current threat to public safety.”\n \n\n   \n  The Dearborn Police Department said it “has been made aware that the FBI conducted operations in the City of Dearborn.”\n \n\n   \n  “We want to assure our residents that there is no threat to the community at this time,” the police department said.\n \n\n   \n  In the city of Inkster, the FBI carried out “law enforcement activities at a storage facility located on Michigan Avenue,” Police Chief Tamika L. Jenkins said.\n \n\n   \n  She said local FBI agents confirmed there is no threat to residents. But to assuage any concerns, Inkster police “will have additional personnel deployed throughout the evening to ensure the safety and well-being of all residents, particularly those participating in Halloween festivities,” the police chief said.\n \n\n   \n  Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer thanked the FBI and Michigan State Police.\n \n\n   \n  “I was briefed by Director Patel on the thwarted potential terrorist attack in our state,” she posted on X. “As details continue to develop, I am grateful for the swift action of the FBI and MSP protecting Michiganders.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/politics/trump-pentagon-nigeria-action","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"20:59:00-04:00","title":"Trump says he’s ordered Pentagon to ‘prepare for possible action’ in Nigeria","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has accused Nigeria of committing mass violence against Christians, claiming the country is a 'Country of Particular Concern' under the International Religious Freedom Act.

the Defense Department to prepare for possible military action in Nigeria as he continues to accuse the nation of violence against Christians — an accusation Nigeria has repeatedly denied.\n \n\n   \n  In a social media post criticizing what he called the “mass slaughter” of Christians in the country, Trump  wrote  the United States would “immediately stop all aid and assistance to Nigeria” and warned the government there to “move fast.”\n \n\n   \n  In the lengthy message, Trump said the US “may very well go into that now disgraced country, ‘guns-a-blazing,’ to completely wipe out the Islamic Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities.”\n \n\n   \n  “I am hereby instructing our Department of War to prepare for possible action,” Trump wrote. “If we attack, it will be fast, vicious, and sweet, just like the terrorist thugs attack our CHERISHED Christians! WARNING: THE NIGERIAN GOVERNMENT BETTER MOVE FAST!”\n \n\n   \n  “Yes sir,” US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth posted on social media with a screenshot of Trump’s comments. “The killing of innocent Christians in Nigeria — and anywhere — must end immediately. The Department of War is preparing for action. Either the Nigerian Government protects Christians, or we will kill the Islamic Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities.”\n \n\n   \n  The announcement comes after Trump accused Nigeria of religious freedom violations on Friday, claiming that “Christianity is facing an existential threat in Nigeria” and designating the nation as a “Country of Particular Concern” under the  International Religious Freedom Act . The label is a suggestion that his administration has found that Nigeria has engaged or tolerated “systematic, ongoing, (and) egregious violations of religious freedom.”\n \n\n   \n  In a social media post after the designation, but before Trump’s mention of the military, Nigerian President Bola Ahmed Tinubu  wrote , “The characterisation of Nigeria as religiously intolerant does not reflect our national reality, nor does it take into consideration the consistent and sincere efforts of the government to safeguard freedom of religion and beliefs for all Nigerians.”\n \n\n   \n  He added that Nigeria is “working with the United States government and the international community to deepen understanding and cooperation on protection of communities of all faiths.”\n \n\n   \n  Tinubu’s press secretary, responding to a social media post from US Secretary of State Marco Rubio condemning the “slaughter of thousands of Christians,” called the characterization “a gross exaggeration of the Nigerian situation,” adding that “Christians, Muslims, churches and mosques are attacked randomly.”\n \n\n   \n  “What our country requires from America is military support to fight these violent extremists in some states of our country, not designation as a nation of particular concern,” said Bayo Onanuga.\n \n\n   \n  Both Christians and Muslims have been victims of attacks by radical Islamists in Nigeria. The violence in the country is driven by varying factors: Some incidents are religiously motivated and affect both groups, while others arise from disputes between farmers and herders over limited resources, as well as communal and ethnic tensions.\n \n\n   \n  Although Christians are among those targeted, local reports indicate that most victims are Muslims living in Nigeria’s predominantly Muslim north.\n \n\n   \n  Spokespersons for the White House and Tinubu’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/snap-federal-judges","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"17:40:00-05:00","title":"Two Federal Judges Require Trump Administration to Use Emergency Funds to Partially Cover Food Stamp Benefits","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Two federal judges, John McConnell in Rhode Island and Indira Talwani in Massachusetts, ruled that the Trump administration must use emergency funds — including a $5.3 billion contingency fund — to partially cover food stamp (SNAP) benefits for tens of millions of Americans in November due to a government shutdown.

cover food stamp benefits \n       \n  By Devan Cole, Tami Luhby, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:40 PM EDT, Sat November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Two federal judges said Friday that the Trump administration must tap into billions of dollars in emergency funds to at least partially cover  food stamp benefits  for tens of millions of Americans in November.\n \n\n   \n  The rulings from judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island reject a controversial US Department of Agriculture claim that it could not use a contingency fund, which the agency says has $5.3 billion remaining in it, to help cover the benefits amid the month-long government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Hours later, President Donald Trump said he has instructed the administration’s lawyers to ask the courts how it can legally fund the benefits as quickly as possible because the attorneys “do not think we have the legal authority to pay SNAP with certain monies we have available.”\n \n\n   \n  “Even if we get immediate guidance, it will unfortunately be delayed while States get the money out,” Trump  posted  on Truth Social Friday evening. “If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding, just like I did with Military and Law Enforcement Pay.”\n \n\n   \n  The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, costs between $8 billion and $9 billion a month, so the judges’ orders will not cover all of the needed payments for November.\n \n\n   \n  “There is no doubt that the … contingency funds are appropriated funds that are without a doubt necessary to carry out the program’s operation.” US District Judge John McConnell in Rhode Island said. “The shutdown of the government through funding doesn’t do away with SNAP, it just does away with the funding of it.”\n \n\n   \n  During proceedings Friday, McConnell said he was ordering the government to use the contingency fund to ensure at least some benefits could be distributed.\n \n\n   \n  “There is no doubt, and it is beyond argument that irreparable harm will begin to occur, if it hasn’t already occurred, in the terror it has caused some people about the availability of funding for food for their family,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  In a written ruling released Saturday, McConnell wrote that the administration must make a partial payment to SNAP beneficiaries using the contingency funds by Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  But he wrote the USDA should, within its discretion, find additional funds to provide full benefits to recipients. If the agency chooses this option, it must make the full payment by the end of Monday, as making the full payment is simpler than calculating partial payments.\n \n\n   \n  In his ruling, McConnell also responded directly to Trump’s comments Friday, writing, “the Court greatly appreciates the President’s quick and definitive response to this Court’s Order and his desire to provide the necessary SNAP funding.”\n \n\n   \n  McConnell’s ruling during a hastily scheduled hearing came minutes after US District Judge Indira Talwani in Boston made a similar order. Both judges, appointees of President Barack Obama, also said that USDA is allowed to tap into another bucket of money of nearly $17 billion to pay November SNAP benefits in full, but that decision is currently up to the administration.\n \n\n   \n  Though Talwani stopped short on Friday of requiring the administration to tap into the contingency fund, she said the USDA was required to use money in that rainy-day fund to partially cover November benefits and gave it until Monday to decide whether it would use only those funds or also dip into a separate pot of money.\n \n\n   \n  “This court has now clarified that Defendants are required to use those Contingency Funds as necessary for the SNAP program. And while these contingency funds reportedly are insufficient to cover the entire cost of SNAP for November, Defendants also may supplement the Contingency Funds by authorizing a transfer of additional funds … to avoid any reductions,”  Talwani said in a 15-page order. \n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration opposes tapping into those other funds, arguing in court it will hurt the child nutrition programs that the revenue supports.\n \n\n   \n  Even with Trump’s directive and the judge’s rulings, millions of recipients will still face delays in getting their benefits, which were scheduled to start being distributed on November 1. It will take time for the Department of Agriculture and states to get the money flowing again.\n \n\n   \n  In the program’s decades-long history, a government shutdown has never prevented it from distributing SNAP funds to states, which administer the benefits, though the program was at risk during the 2018-2019 impasse.\n \n\n   \n  The Boston lawsuit was filed earlier this week by a group of Democratic attorneys general and governors from 25 states and Washington, DC, while the case in Rhode Island was brought Thursday by a coalition of cities, non-profits, unions and small businesses.\n \n\n   \n  As the government shutdown nears its one-month mark, courts are increasingly being asked to intervene to stave off a series of dramatic developments. Earlier this week, a federal judge in California indefinitely blocked the administration from laying off thousands of federal workers, saying the government was unlawfully using the shutdown as legal justification for the layoffs.\n \n\n   \n  The administration could seek appeals. Asked earlier Friday by CNN what the department would do if courts required USDA to tap into the contingency fund, Secretary Brooke Rollins said, “We’re looking at all the options.”\n \n\n   \n    Delayed payments\n \n\n   \n  States stopped the process of issuing benefits for November after the USDA sent them a letter on October 10 ordering them to do so. States send SNAP enrollees’ information to vendors every month so they can load funds onto recipients’ benefit cards.\n \n\n   \n  Each state has a specific date by which they must send the information ahead of the new month in order for benefits to go out on time, according to the lawsuit. Payments are made on a staggered basis throughout the month.\n \n\n   \n  Talwani acknowledged the likely delay in benefits during a hearing Thursday, and also asked about the process of providing partial payments to recipients next month since the contingency fund alone won’t cover the full amount.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re dealing with the reality that … the benefits aren’t going to be there on November 1,” she said.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/politics/snap-benefits-november-most-affected-vis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"17:55:00Z","title":"Millions of Americans Could Face Delays in SNAP Food Assistance Due to Government Shutdown","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A government shutdown has disrupted the distribution of SNAP food benefits for millions of Americans, with delays affecting approximately 3 million recipients on November 1 and growing to 26.6 million by November 10.

Millions of Americans could still face delays to their benefits, which were scheduled to be distributed Saturday but were disrupted by the government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Nearly 42 million people — or about 1 in 8 Americans — received food stamps in May, according to the latest USDA data.\n \n\n   \n  About 3 million people were set to receive their food stamps on November 1, according to estimates from Code for America, which works with governments of all levels to improve access to food assistance and other safety net programs. That figure grows to about 13.7 million by November 5 and 26.6 million by November 10. The remaining enrollees are scheduled to receive their November benefits after that.\n \n\n   \n    Who relies on SNAP benefits for food assistance\n \n\n   \n  Overall, 12% of the US population relies on SNAP for food assistance. SNAP participation ranges widely across the United States, with the highest shares in New Mexico, Louisiana and the District of Columbia.\n \n\n   \n  Households with children, an elderly individual or a non-elderly person with a disability received 83% of SNAP benefits in fiscal year 2023, according to the USDA.\n \n\n   \n  Among recipients themselves, about 39% were children, while 20% were elderly and 10% were non-elderly individuals with a disability.\n \n\n   \n  Households receive about $350 a month, on average, in SNAP benefits.\n \n\n   \n  Nearly three-quarters of the households that rely on the benefits to afford groceries have an income below 100% of the federal poverty level.\n \n\n   \n  The assistance doesn’t expire at the end of each month, but beneficiaries typically use all the funds in the month they receive them, said Lauren Bauer, a fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution.\n \n\n   \n  Unfortunately, there aren’t a lot of good alternatives to food stamps.\n \n\n   \n  Americans can turn to food pantries and other community food assistance programs, but these groups have been under pressure from rising food prices and increased need in recent years.\n \n\n   \n  “The shutdown adds another layer of strain to an already stretched emergency food system,” Celia Cole, CEO of Feeding Texas, the state association of food banks, said in a statement, noting that more than 3.5 million Texans receive food stamps.\n \n\n   \n  States don’t have enough money to cover $8 billion in monthly food stamp benefits, though several have said they will beef up their food assistance programs in November.\n \n\n   \n  Multiple states have said they will pour millions of dollars into their emergency food programs — but it will be far less than the typical federal outlays in most cases.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/snap-benefits-november-judge-ruling","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"17:38:00-04:00","title":"Will SNAP benefits be paid in November?

November? Here’s what we know about the judges’ rulings \n       \n  By Tami Luhby, Devan Cole, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:38 PM EDT, Sat November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Two federal judges have said the Trump administration is required to use  emergency funds  to provide at least partial  food stamp benefits  to tens of millions of Americans in November, as the federal government shutdown drags on.\n \n\n   \n  And President Donald Trump on Friday evening said that he’s instructed the administration’s lawyers to ask the courts how it can legally fund the benefits as quickly as possible.\n \n\n   \n  “Even if we get immediate guidance, it will unfortunately be delayed while States get the money out,” Trump  posted  on Truth Social. “If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding, just like I did with Military and Law Enforcement Pay.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, the much-needed assistance won’t come that quickly for many food stamp recipients. Also, it remains unclear whether they’ll receive their full benefits or a smaller amount since the US Department of Agriculture’s contingency fund doesn’t have enough money to cover the total cost.\n \n\n   \n  Several legal and procedural challenges must be overcome before the benefits can start flowing to the nearly 42 million people in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, the formal name for food stamps. The US Department of Agriculture halted November allocations, arguing it  doesn’t have the funds  to provide them, which prompted  a coalition of Democratic-led states  and a group of cities, non-profits, unions and small businesses to sue earlier this week.\n \n\n   \n  It’s now unclear whether the administration will appeal the rulings. However, the Justice Department signaled during a hearing on Thursday that it would do so if US District Judge Indira Talwani in Boston issued an adverse ruling.\n \n\n   \n  Though Talwani stopped short on Friday of requiring the administration to tap into the contingency fund, she said the USDA was required to use money in that rainy-day fund to partially cover November benefits and gave it until Monday to decide whether it would use only those funds or also dip into a separate pot of money.\n \n\n   \n  A judge in Rhode Island said during proceedings Friday in a separate case over the SNAP payments that he was ordering the government to use the contingency fund to ensure at least some benefits could be distributed.\n \n\n   \n  In a written ruling released Saturday, the judge, John McConnell, wrote that the administration must make a partial payment to SNAP beneficiaries using the contingency funds by Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  But he wrote the USDA should, within its discretion, find additional funds to provide full benefits to recipients. If it chooses to do this, the agency must make the full payment by the end of Monday since it is simpler to make the full payment than calculate partial payments.\n \n\n   \n  The administration could also appeal this decision.\n \n\n   \n  In his ruling, McConnell also responded directly to Trump’s comments Friday, writing, “the Court greatly appreciates the President’s quick and definitive response to this Court’s Order and his desire to provide the necessary SNAP funding.”\n \n\n   \n    Delayed payments\n \n\n   \n  Whatever happens in court, it will take time for SNAP recipients to get access to any assistance in November.\n \n\n   \n  States stopped the process of  issuing benefits for November  after the USDA sent them a letter on October 10 ordering them to do so. States send SNAP enrollees’ information to vendors every month so they can load funds onto recipients’ benefit cards, often days or weeks before the new month begins. Those steps need to take place before SNAP can restart.\n \n\n   \n  The delay will be felt immediately. Some 3 million recipients should receive their benefits on November 1, according to an estimate by Code for America, which works with all levels of government to improve access to food assistance and other safety net programs. The number grows to nearly 13.7 million by November 5, with remaining SNAP enrollees getting their allotments on a staggered basis during the month.\n \n\n   \n  “They are not going out on time,” Gina Plata-Nino, interim director of SNAP at the Food Research & Action Center, an advocacy group, said of the November benefits.\n \n\n   \n  Still, providing full payments would be the fastest way to get assistance to food stamp recipients.\n \n\n   \n  “If the administration complies with the courts’ rulings to release the SNAP contingency funds immediately and supplements those amounts using its legal transfer authority, which the courts also affirmed, then SNAP benefits could begin to be issued with only a short delay,” said Dottie Rosenbaum, director of federal SNAP policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n \n\n   \n    Partial payments harder to do\n \n\n   \n  However, the process could become much more complicated — and time consuming — if the USDA opts to only tap into its contingency fund and doesn’t augment it with leftover tariff revenue dedicated to child nutrition programs, as it did with the  WIC nutrition assistance program .\n \n\n   \n  The emergency fund only has $5.3 billion remaining in it, while benefits total about $8.2 billion for the month, according to court filings submitted by the Justice Department, which represents the USDA in the case. (Other expenses and benefits bring the total closer to $9 billion.)\n \n\n   \n  The USDA also has access to nearly $17 billion in tariff revenue, but a Justice Department attorney told a judge Friday that using the funds for SNAP would hurt the child nutrition programs that the money supports. Both Talwani and the judge in Rhode Island, John McConnell, left it up to the USDA to decide whether to use the additional resources to pay full benefits in November.\n \n\n   \n  If only the contingency fund were tapped, the USDA would have to reduce benefits for all SNAP recipients, which it has never done, according to a declaration filed by the agency official who oversees the program. Also, state agencies would need to recode their systems to issue the smaller benefit amounts, which could result in payment errors.\n \n\n   \n  “Because no template, processes, or past experience exist to inform a reduction in benefits, there are multiple variables which could lead to significant problems in attempting to reduce benefits for every SNAP household in the country,” Patrick Penn, deputy undersecretary of the USDA’s Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services, said in his declaration. “The ability, time and resources to accomplish this system change would vary greatly among State agencies, with some State agencies working with systems that are decades old.”\n \n\n   \n  For at least some states, the process could take anywhere from a few weeks to several months, Penn said, drawing upon informal conversations with state agencies.\n \n\n   \n  Before states could even act, the USDA would also have to determine how to calculate and authorize the reduced allotments. This effort could be hampered if its employees have been furloughed during the shutdown or laid off or departed amid the Trump administration’s efforts to downsize the federal government, Plata-Nino said.\n \n\n   \n  While some states have identified potential ways to issue smaller benefits quickly, the methods must be programmed, tested and verified, which could take time, she noted.\n \n\n   \n  If recipients receive partial benefits in November, they would get retroactive payments to make them whole once the government reopens, she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/fbi-fires-agent-trump-investigations","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"13:52:00-04:00","title":"FBI forces out special agent who helped oversee Trump investigation, sources say","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The FBI has reportedly forced out Aaron Tapp, a senior agent who previously oversaw investigations into former President Donald Trump’s attempts to overturn the 2020 election, including the Arctic Frost probe into fake electors.

helped oversee public corruption cases, including an investigation that became part of former special counsel Jack Smith’s probe into President Donald Trump, according to two sources familiar with the matter — another apparent casualty of the Trump administration’s retribution push.\n \n\n   \n  Aaron Tapp, the special agent in charge of the FBI’s San Antonio office, was previously the deputy assistant director of the Criminal Investigative Division at FBI headquarters.\n \n\n   \n  Tapp will be retiring from the bureau later this month, a third person briefed on the matter told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  For a time he had oversight of probes into Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. One of these investigations — known as Arctic Frost — focused on the fake electors scheme, in which Trump allies sought to have Trump electors counted as electoral college votes from states that Joe Biden won.\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks, Republicans have released FBI records showing details of the Arctic Frost investigation and accused Smith and FBI leaders of political motives in using grand jury subpoenas to obtain phone records of nine GOP lawmakers. The records, obtained in 2023, covered four days surrounding the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot . The FBI didn’t obtain the contents of the calls.

Eric Bradner, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:09 PM EDT, Sat November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Former President Barack Obama urged voters to break with President Donald Trump and “set a glorious example for the nation” on Saturday as he campaigned with the Democratic nominees for governor in Virginia and New Jersey ahead of Tuesday’s elections.\n \n\n   \n  In his first of two events Saturday, a rally with former Rep. Abigail Spanberger — the Democrat facing Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears in Virginia’s governor race — Obama told the crowd in Norfolk that after the first nine months of Trump’s second term, “the stakes are now clear.”\n \n\n   \n  “We don’t need to speculate about the dangers to our democracy. We don’t need to wonder about whether vulnerable people are going to be hurt, or ask ourselves how much more coarse and mean our culture can become. We’ve witnessed it. Elections do matter,” he said. “We all have more power than we think. We just have to use it.”\n \n\n   \n  With the Democratic Party out of power in Washington and without a clear national leader, Obama is reprising his role as the party’s biggest and most unifying draw, delivering a closing message in the final days of elections that will serve as a temperature check on Trump’s first year and set the stage for next year’s midterms.\n \n\n   \n  On Saturday evening, Obama will be in Newark with Rep. Mikie Sherrill, who is taking on GOP former state lawmaker Jack Ciattarelli in New Jersey’s gubernatorial contest.\n \n\n   \n  Before heading out to the rallies on Saturday, Obama called Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for mayor in New York City. He has not endorsed Mamdani — aides attribute that to a policy of generally not getting involved in mayoral elections. But according to a person familiar with the conversation, he called Mamdani’s campaign “impressive to watch,” and offered to be a “sounding board” going forward.\n \n\n   \n  In Virginia, the former president was sharply critical of Trump — though he only once used his name.\n \n\n   \n  “All of us are being tested right now,” Obama said. “Trump and the Republicans — they want you to think it’s part of their story, that things only happen from the top down; that a few people in power make decisions and the rest of us have to live with the consequences. But real change has always come from the bottom up; from ordinary folks who look around and say, we can do better, and then join together to make change happen.”\n \n\n   \n  Obama said he knew what Trump planned to do, but added that he “will admit, it’s worse than even I expected.”\n \n\n   \n  He said he worries about “how quickly basic democratic rules and norms have been weakened.” Obama also said he is concerned about “the growing concentration of economic power in this country,” and that business leaders, law firms and universities “have been willing to bend the knee to this president’s autocratic impulses” to avoid confrontation.\n \n\n   \n  He also criticized Trump’s replacement of career prosecutors with loyalists at the Justice Department, his “shambolic tariff policy” and said the White House every day delivers “lawlessness and recklessness and mean-spiritedness and just plain craziness.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s like every day is Halloween, except it’s all tricks and no treats,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Nine years after leaving office, Obama remains the Democratic Party’s most powerful surrogate — a reality underscored by his high-profile appearances on the final weekend of two of 2025’s most important contests. Obama has also  stepped up his warnings  about what he says is the damage being wrought to the country by President Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n  The crowd in Norfolk, Virginia, on Saturday waited about five hours for Obama to speak, but that didn’t damper their enthusiasm. When Spanberger introduced Obama, the cheers for him were so loud you couldn’t hear her. The 7,000-seat arena was near capacity.\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger sought to tie Tuesday’s election to a signal Democrats can send to the nation.\n \n\n   \n  “With the political turmoil coming out of Washington right now, this election is an opportunity, because in just three more days, when the polls close, Virginia voters can and will send a message. Amid the recklessness and the heartlessness out of Washington, Virginia can and will flip statewide seats from red to blue,” Spanberger said.\n \n\n   \n  The event served as an important base motivator on the last day of early voting.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m concerned about the deterioration of the country, the way people are treated. The sadness of everything that’s happening, it’s heartbreaking,” Gail Buchanan of Chesterfield, Virginia told CNN at the rally.\n \n\n   \n  Also of note, Virginia’s Democratic nominee for attorney general, Jay Jones, spoke though he was not listed as a planned speaker. Jones has been under fire for  violent language  he sent about a colleague in recently surfaced text messages in 2022.\n \n\n   \n  Obama is the closer after a number of ambitious Democrats have  also hit the trail  for Sherill and Spanberger. The list of Democratic governors to campaign with Spanberger and Sherrill includes Kentucky’s Andy Beshear, Maryland’s Wes Moore, Illinois’ JB Pritzker, Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro and Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer.\n \n\n   \n  Obama has slowly ramped up his involvement in both gubernatorial elections. He cut ads for both candidates that began airing in mid-October.\n \n\n   \n  After voting in Bridgewater on Friday, Ciattarelli — whose near miss in the 2021 New Jersey governor’s race was an early indicator of the state’s rightward shift in the 2024 presidential race, when Trump closed his losing margin from 16 percentage points in 2020 to 6 points last year — downplayed any impact Obama’s appearance with Sherrill might have in the closing days of the campaign.\n \n\n   \n  “This is what I refer to as the choreography of campaigns, but at the end of day, I really believe this, particularly in New Jersey, a candidate has to win the race, and that’s why I get up and down the state every day and engage with people every day, shake hands every single day.” Ciattarelli said. “I think we’ve done that a hell of a lot better than my opponent.”\n \n\n   \n  The Virginia and New Jersey governor’s races, which are held a year after presidential elections, are widely viewed as an important gauge of the nation’s political mood almost a year into a new presidency. One year into Obama’s White House tenure, Republican Bob McDonnell’s win in Virginia and Chris Christie’s win in New Jersey offered previews of the red wave that was to come in the 2010 midterms.\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger and Sherrill are favored in the blue-leaning states, but wins are no lock: Four years ago, Republican Glenn Youngkin won the Virginia governor race; in New Jersey, Sherrill hasn’t been able to pull away after several public polls found her with a single-digit edge over Ciattarelli.\n \n\n   \n  Both of Obama’s Saturday stops — Newark and Norfolk — are in areas with significant Black populations. Over the last several election cycles he has appeared often with Virginia Democratic candidates at base-rallying events in the Hampton Roads region.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Arlette Saenz, Eva McKend Eric Fiegel and Dalia Abdelwahab contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/politics/nypd-nyc-mayoral-election","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"14:22:00Z","title":"Hotly contested mayoral election isn’t just about the candidates.

mayoral election isn’t just about the candidates. The NYPD’s future is also at stake \n       \n  By Mark Morales, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:22 PM EDT, Sat November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  With the  high-stakes New York mayoral contest  hanging in the balance, the largest police department in the country may find itself caught between the promise of reform and the stability that followed a couple of scandal-scarred years.\n \n\n   \n  If  Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani  wins the election, his choice to lead the NYPD through a period of political transition is already in the job: current Commissioner Jessica Tisch.\n \n\n   \n  While Tisch has managed to earn praise from representatives from both political parties as well as business leaders, her stance on various key issues, from the use of the NYPD’s gang database to the deployment of a specialized unit that responds to protests and major events, stands in opposition to what Mamdani has promised during the campaign.\n \n\n   \n  Despite their stark differences in policing strategies, Mamdani has said each hire he makes for his new administration would be in lock step with his vision for the future. Tisch has declined to publicly address the prospect of staying on as police commissioner, but Mamdani has said he is confident she would accept the position, leaving former police officials and advocates to wonder how both would coexist.\n \n\n   \n  While the New York City police commissioner technically answers to and is appointed by the mayor, a savvy police executive can always carve out some autonomy despite an administration’s reform promises.\n \n\n   \n  “She has leverage over him at the moment, and leverage in the sense of negotiating,” former NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton said of Tisch, a former sanitation department commissioner. “I think she would be willing to stay if some of her conditions, whatever they may be, be met.”\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani officially announced his intention to keep Tisch as commissioner from a debate stage on October 22.\n \n\n   \n  “I make the decision to retain Commissioner Tisch not only to build on the results that we’ve seen under her tenure, but also to deliver on the agenda that I’ve been running on,” Mamdani told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  In response, Tisch said she was staying out of the fray.\n \n\n   \n  “As I’ve said many times, it is not appropriate for the Police Commissioner to be directly involved or to seem to be involved in electoral politics,” Tisch said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n    Flashback to over a decade ago\n \n\n   \n  Public safety has been a major issue in the hotly contested mayor’s race that pits Democratic socialist Mamdani against former New York Gov. and  independent candidate Andrew Cuomo  and the  Republican candidate, Curtis Sliwa . Cuomo and Sliwa each have said they would keep Tisch as police commissioner.\n \n\n   \n  Judging by the early voting numbers,  New Yorkers are already flocking to the polls .\n \n\n   \n  Throughout the course of the campaign,  Mamdani has moderated some of his most controversial stances  on policing, distancing himself from a previous call to defund the police and apologizing for calling police officers “racist” and “wicked.”\n \n\n   \n  Bratton, an experienced police executive who ran the NYPD twice, was in a similar position in which Tisch may find herself when he came back for the second time during the start of Bill de Blasio’s administration in 2014.\n \n\n   \n  While de Blasio was known as a progressive who rankled many of the rank-and-file, Bratton said they shared the same vision when it came to incorporating neighborhood policing, de-escalation training, more police officers on the street and a robust budget to operate the department, Bratton said.\n \n\n   \n  As a condition of accepting the appointment, Bratton said, he made sure he could pick his team and had the freedom to make decisions without interference.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani and Tisch appear to be further apart philosophically than he was from de Blasio, according to Bratton.\n \n\n   \n  “The worst thing that can happen for (Mamdani) is, if (Tisch) were to step away, a successor comes in, crime goes up and disorder goes up. And the potential for that is very, very significant,” Bratton said.\n \n\n   \n   Bratton’s retirement as police commissioner in September 2016  came at a time of record declines in crime but heightened distrust of police by minority communities, after the death of Eric Garner, who died at the hands of police on Staten Island in 2014, sparked protests.\n \n\n   \n    Conflicting philosophies emerge\n \n\n   \n  Tisch took over as police commissioner in November of last year, just a week before prosecutors allege Luigi Mangione gunned down the UnitedHealthcare CEO in midtown Manhattan. Since then, Tisch has made her mark on the department, replacing many loyalists of former Mayor Eric Adams who were in positions of power, shuffling others around, and accepting the resignation of  former Chief of Department Jeffrey Maddrey  after he was embroiled in an overtime-for-sexual-favors scandal.\n \n\n   \n  She’s also touted the importance of the controversial NYPD gang database used to track gang members, attacked the “Raise the Age” law, which increased the age of criminal prosecution from 16 to 18, and gone after bail reform laws – all positions that are at odds with Mamdani.\n \n\n   \n  The candidate has also spoken out about disbanding the NYPD’s Strategic Response Group – an elite unit that specializes in responding to major events, whether they be protests or even the midtown mass shooting at 345 Park Ave. Mamdani also wants the final disciplinary decision on officers to go from the police commissioner to the Civilian Complaint Review Board, the city agency charged with oversight of the NYPD – though that would need a change to the law. Both are ideas that routinely spark sharp criticism from law enforcement circles.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the seeming differences, if Tisch were to stay, it would provide stability for officers not only out on the street, but for high-ranking officials who would otherwise be walking on eggshells inside police headquarters as they wait for a new administration to take over.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it calms a lot of the cops who may have been nervous. That there’s not going to be this big, dramatic change overnight,” said  former NYPD Chief of Department Kenneth Corey,  who was the highest-ranked uniformed member of the department on Adams’ first day as mayor in 2022. “Whether they like (Tisch) or not, she’s the devil they know and it also helps calm the business community, who are also very worried about the prospect of what crime would look like under a Mamdani administration.”\n \n\n   \n    Mental health response would be focus\n \n\n   \n  While there may not be wholesale changes to the NYPD if Tisch stays as police commissioner, there would be new initiatives under Mamdani, such as a new civilian agency called the Department of Community Safety. The agency would focus on a community-based prevention approach targeting homelessness and people experiencing mental illness.\n \n\n   \n  Its hallmark won’t be adding more police but rather adding more mental health professionals and violence interrupters – a plan Mamdani says he hopes would free up officers to respond to other crimes.\n \n\n   \n  In 2023, the NYPD responded to under 180,000 calls that involved an emotionally disturbed person, out of roughly 9 million 911 calls, according to statistics unveiled at a city hall hearing in 2024.\n \n\n   \n  Corey said he tried to get a similar plan off the ground but had trouble with appropriate staffing.\n \n\n   \n  “The city is not the greatest employer when it comes to pay. You’re going to hire clinicians and social workers and people with advanced degrees. You’re not going to pay them a whole lot of money,” Corey said. “Then you’re going to tell them, ‘Oh, by the way, you know you’re working Christmas morning, or you’re working the midnight shift every weekend.’ These are the challenges we ran into when we’ve tried to do that before, even as a co-response model. There are just not enough of these clinicians and mental health professionals who are willing to go out into the street and do this kind of work in the hours that it needs to be done.”\n \n\n   \n   Richard Aborn , president of the nonprofit   Citizens Crime Commission of New York City, supports mental health professionals being involved but wonders about safety.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it makes a lot of sense to have mental health teams go on calls when there’s an emotionally disturbed person, but having a mental health team go exclusively could be dangerous,” Aborn said. “The question is, how are you going to assess that? A call comes into 911, there’s a person locked up in the bedroom screaming, ‘I’m going to kill you.’ Who’s going to assess whether it’s just a mental health team or if police officers go along?”\n \n\n   \n  Corey recalled a scenario when a woman called 911 asking for help for her son, telling dispatchers they were nonviolent.\n \n\n   \n  “If you heard her, she almost sounded like she was sleeping,” Corey said about the woman’s 911 call. “And she’s just ‘no, he’s not violent. He just needs to go. Somebody just needs to take him to the hospital so he can get his medicine,’ and 11 seconds after the police officers were in the apartment, there was a cop flat on his back. This guy was straddled, with a butcher knife, over him, and (NYPD) shot him.” The man was killed in the shooting, according to Corey.\n \n\n   \n    The specter of the National Guard\n \n\n   \n  Looming in the distance as well is the threat of potential federal intervention into crime-fighting in New York City, should Mamdani win the election.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani has spoken out about President Donald Trump sending National Guard troops into Democrat-run major cities, a move the president says is to restore law and order. Mamdani previously told CNN he would respond to the attempt by filing a lawsuit.\n \n\n   \n  “What we would do in running this city, is first, to actually take this administration to court and to do so immediately as opposed to being pressured to do it,” Mamdani said, adding he would follow in the footsteps of other leaders like  Boston Mayor Michelle Wu. \n \n\n   \n  Bratton is among those current and former law enforcement leaders who say the sheer size and scope of the NYPD, in addition to low crime numbers, are strong indicators New York City doesn’t need the National Guard – who are already deployed but work in a different capacity  –  to patrol the streets in that way.\n \n\n   \n  It may not even come to that, Bratton said, if Tisch, a billionaire heiress from one of New York City’s most prominent families, remains at the helm.\n \n\n   \n  “Jesse and her family have very good relations with a number of the Trump side of the house,” Bratton said. “Jesse also brings a form of stability against the tide that we know is going to put pressure up against New York, and she has the ability, I think, to dissipate some of what’s going on in Los Angeles and Chicago.”\n \n\n   \n  Tisch took over for interim police commissioner Tom Donlon, who has since gone on to  file a lawsuit alleging corruption  at the highest levels of the NYPD. She became the fourth police commissioner appointed during the Adams administration – a constant change that became emblematic of the instability and air of corruption   at the department.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the department is struggling with staffing issues as members continue to either retire or get poached by other police departments in other cities. There are currently less than 35,000 members with the NYPD, a figure that’s less than highs in 2000 and 2019, according to statistics provided by the Police Benevolent Association.\n \n\n   \n  So far this year, roughly 300 officers have left the department each month, according to the union’s statistics.   NYPD recruit classes continue to lag behind the number of recruits in previous classes, according to a union official.\n \n\n   \n  As staffing is a constant issue, Mayor Eric Adams announced a plan to potentially add 5,000 new police officers to the department by 2029, a move that would boost the department’s headcount to the largest it’s been in the last 20 years.\n \n\n   \n  While the move opens the door to adding more officers, it still leaves the issue of actually finding enough recruits to fill the hiring surge. In April, city officials changed the eligibility standard for recruits, eliminating the need for college credit. The move bolstered applications, with 4,000 ineligible applicants – who did not meet the requirements – reopening their cases, according to city officials.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani, who credited Tisch with rooting out corruption, believes she has shown during a turbulent period that she’s committed to the department.\n \n\n   \n  The high turnover among top police executives, is something Corey says rank and file officers – who may find themselves having to execute  progressive strategies they may not agree with – have noticed.\n \n\n   \n  “What the cops have learned at the bottom is that, ‘If I don’t like your idea, I don’t actually have to do it,’” Corey said. “‘I just need to slow walk it, because you’re going to be gone soon, and so will your idea.’”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/uk/us-lawmakers-urge-andrew-to-address-epstein-links-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"10:57:00-05:00","title":"US Lawmakers Intensify Calls for Andrew to Address Epstein Ties","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following the removal of Prince Andrew from the royal family and his eviction from Windsor Castle by King Charles III, US lawmakers—particularly members of the House Oversight Committee—have intensified their calls for Andrew to testify about his alleged ties to Jeffrey Epstein.

latest in a series of Trump administration actions to limit media access.\n \n\n   \n  The new rule says journalists cannot access what’s known as the “Upper Press” office space, where White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt works, “without an appointment.”\n \n\n   \n  This area has been accessible to White House correspondents for decades, supporting a free flow of information between the president and the public.\n \n\n   \n  The White House says the clampdown is due to security concerns.\n \n\n   \n  “This policy will ensure adherence to best practices pertaining to access to sensitive material,” a White House memo asserted on Friday night.\n \n\n   \n  In response, the White House Correspondents’ Association, which represents hundreds of credentialed reporters, said it “unequivocally opposes any effort” to limit journalists from areas that have long been accessible for newsgathering, “including the press secretary’s office.”\n \n\n   \n  “The new restrictions hinder the press corps’ ability to question officials, ensure transparency, and hold the government accountable, to the detriment of the American public,” the association said.\n \n\n   \n  As CNN’s Jeff Zeleny explained, reporters routinely “wait in the hall” by the press secretary’s office and seek information from communications aides. “When there is breaking news, that often happens,” Zeleny said.\n \n\n   \n  Now, “reporters will only have access to a smaller set of offices of junior advisers, junior aides, junior press secretaries,” according to the White House.\n \n\n   \n  White House communications director Steven Cheung’s office is also deemed off-limits due to the change.\n \n\n   \n  Cheung, who regularly expresses hostility toward reporters on social media platform X, asserted in a Friday night post that, “some reporters have been caught” taking pictures of sensitive information and “eavesdropping on private, closed-door meetings.”\n \n\n   \n  That claim came as news to White House press corps leaders, who are not aware of colleagues being “caught.”\n \n\n   \n  Early in Bill Clinton’s presidency, Clinton aides similarly attempted to bar journalists from the “upper press” area, causing an outcry. That ban was rescinded.\n \n\n   \n  Journalists had normal access to the offices during President Trump’s first term in office. But in his second term, Trump and his aides have taken several steps to stymie news coverage and circumvent traditional media outlets.\n \n\n   \n  Last winter, the administration blocked the Associated Press   from attending some White House events, leading to a First Amendment lawsuit that is still working its way through the courts.\n \n\n   \n  The administration has also stopped publishing transcripts of Trump’s remarks; has taken control of daily press pool assignments; and has invited fawning pro-Trump commentators to presidential Q&As.\n \n\n   \n  Some cabinet secretaries have followed Trump’s lead. Last month, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth implemented severe new restrictions for Pentagon press pass credentialing, leading virtually every major media outlet to reject the rules and give up access to the Pentagon complex.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Samantha Waldenberg contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/entertainment/xania-monet-billboard-ai","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"09:00:00-04:00","title":"Xania Monet is the first AI-powered artist to debut on a Billboard airplay chart, but she likely won’t be the last","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Xania Monet, the first known AI artist to debut on a Billboard airplay chart, has gained significant traction with chart appearances on the Hot Gospel Songs and Hot R&B Songs charts.

Michelle, and Muni Long.”\n \n\n   \n  Monet was designed by Telisha Nikki Jones, a poet from Mississippi who writes the lyrics Monet is seen performing with help from Suno, “a generative artificial intelligence music creation program,” the bio explains.\n \n\n   \n  Monet released a full-length album “Unfolded” in August, which had 24 songs. A seven-track EP, “Pieces Left Behind,” followed in September.\n \n\n   \n  A press release from Monet’s representative touted the AI singer’s “smooth, soulful sound” and “human-like delivery.” But Romel Murphy, who says he’s Monet’s manager and spoke with  CNN’s Victor Blackwell,  insisted that there is no intent to replace human singers and songwriters.\n \n\n   \n  “AI doesn’t replace the artist. That’s not our goal at all. It doesn’t diminish the creativity and doesn’t take away from the human experience,” he said. “It’s a new frontier and like anything would change some people are receptive and some people are apprehensive.”\n \n\n   \n  Billboard recently reported that “in just the past few months, at least six AI or AI-assisted artists have debuted on various Billboard rankings.”\n \n\n   \n  “That figure could be higher, as it’s become increasingly difficult to tell who or what is powered by AI — and to what extent,” according to the publication. “Many of these charting projects, whose music spans every genre from gospel to rock to country, also arrive with anonymous or mysterious origins.”\n \n\n   \n  Murphy doesn’t appear to see an issue and likens it all to the music of Michael Jackson and Prince, who died in 2009 and 2016 respectively.\n \n\n   \n  “They both have music catalogs that are expanding decades to this day. Youth are still listening to those songs and they’re no longer with us and they’re connected to their music,” Murphy said. “So it is the music because they don’t have the history of the contact or the concert live field, but they still love those songs. Music has to evolve as well.”\n \n\n   \n  “We just have to keep the integrity and be intentional about the realness of it and push the music to the world,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Monet’s representative for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, working musicians are – as expected– troubled.\n \n\n   \n  “There is an AI R&B artist who just signed a multimillion-dollar deal … and the person is doing none of the work,” Kehlani  said  of Monet in a now-deleted video posted to TikTok. “This is so beyond out of our control.”\n \n\n   \n  The human singer added: “Nothing and no one on Earth will ever be able to justify AI to me.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/europe/ukraine-pokrovsk-russia-fighting-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"11:12:00-04:00","title":"Fighting intensifies around key town in Ukraine amid fresh attacks on Russian energy","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Fighting around Pokrovsk in eastern Ukraine is escalating, with Russian forces advancing and attempting to encircle the town and its neighbor Myrnohrad.

By Tim Lister, Kosta Gak and Victoria Butenko, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:12 AM EDT, Sat November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Fighting for control of the strategic hub of Pokrovsk in eastern  Ukraine  is intensifying, with the Russian Defense Ministry claiming to have eliminated a group of Ukrainian special forces sent to help defend the area.\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks,  Russian  units have begun penetrating Pokrovsk itself and have closed in on the last resupply routes used to sustain Ukrainian forces in the town.\n \n\n   \n  The Ukrainian special forces had landed in a helicopter on the northwestern outskirts of Pokrovsk, according to the Russian Defense Ministry. Drone footage shared by an unofficial Russian Telegram channel showed Ukrainian soldiers fanning out from a Blackhawk helicopter. Eleven of the troops that had landed were killed, the Defense ministry claimed. It’s unclear when the mission took place.\n \n\n   \n  A source in Ukrainian intelligence told CNN that the claim was untrue. Stabilization efforts led by the head of Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence Kyrylo Budanov continue in Pokrovsk, the source added.\n \n\n   \n  The Ukrainian 7th Aerial Assault Corps also said there had been a successful landing in the Pokrovsk area. “It was a complex operation that required the synchronized actions of various units,” it said.\n \n\n   \n  Ukrainian units have managed to improve their tactical position in several districts of the city, according to the Corps. “We are increasing the number of assault groups in Pokrovsk,” it said, adding that 85 Russian soldiers had been killed in Pokrovsk over the past week.\n \n\n   \n  The Ukrainian military’s commander, General Oleksandr Syrskyi, said Saturday that Pokrovsk and the neighboring town of Myrnohrad were “not surrounded or blocked, and we are doing everything we can to maintain logistics.”\n \n\n   \n  “A comprehensive operation to destroy and dislodge enemy forces from Pokrovsk is ongoing,” Syrskyi said, adding that he had visited the area to coordinate its defense.\n \n\n   \n  Enemy units continued “to attempt to infiltrate residential areas and cut off our supply routes,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  For its part, the Russian Defense Ministry asserted Saturday that its units “continue to destroy surrounded Ukrainian Armed Forces formations in the area of the railway station” in Pokrovsk, and had repelled several attempts by Ukrainian forces to break out of the town. It added that the encirclement of Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad was tightening.\n \n\n   \n  President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Tuesday that about 200 Russian troops had infiltrated Pokrovsk. Geolocated video has shown Russian soldiers in the southern part of the town, moving in small groups.\n \n\n   \n  Ukrainian forces have tried to counter-attack, according to the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War, and had marginally advanced north of the town.\n \n\n   \n  Were Pokrovsk to fall, it would be the largest urban area to be taken by Russian forces since they seized Bakhmut in May 2023. The town is a junction for road and railway lines and occupying it would bring Russian forces closer to the larger cities of Kramatorsk and Kostiantynivka in the industrial belt of Donetsk.\n \n\n   \n  According to the unofficial Ukrainian DeepState website, which analyzes the battlefield, Russian forces gained 267 square kilometers of Ukrainian territory in October — the same as in September.\n \n\n   \n  Efforts by the US President Donald Trump to get a ceasefire agreed in Ukraine have come to nothing, with the Kremlin insisting that the root causes of the conflict - including NATO’s expansion eastwards and what it has called the “Nazification” of Ukraine - must be addressed before there can be a truce.\n \n\n   \n  Moscow has said that the original goals of what it calls its Special Military Operation are non-negotiable: sovereignty over four eastern regions of Ukraine, including Donetsk.\n \n\n   \n    Pipelines blown up\n \n\n   \n  As Russian forces edge forward along several parts of the frontline, Ukraine have continued their long-range efforts to destroy and disrupt Russia’s energy and military infrastructure.\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, Ukrainian saboteurs blew up up three pipelines carrying fuel in the Moscow region, according to the country’s defense officials – the latest attack in a campaign by Kyiv to target refineries, pumping stations and pipelines.\n \n\n   \n  “The ‘Koltsevoy’ oil pipeline, which supplied the Russian occupation army,” was disabled on Friday in a special operation, according to a statement from Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence (DI).\n \n\n   \n  It published an image showing what appeared to be devices placed on three separate pipelines near Ramenskoye, south of Moscow, which were under anti-drone netting. Video published by DI showed an explosion that sent flames hundreds of meters into the air.\n \n\n   \n  “All three lines used by the aggressor to transport gasoline, diesel, and aviation fuel were successfully and simultaneously blown up,” DI said.\n \n\n   \n  Unlike many recent attacks using drones and missiles, the Ukrainians used a sabotage team to lay explosive devices at the site, according to the DI video.\n \n\n   \n  There’s been no word from the Russian authorities on the explosion nor on any disruption to fuel supplies. But the local authorities in the nearby district of Zhukovsky reported power cuts for some consumers on Friday without specifying the cause.\n \n\n   \n  The pipeline that forms a ring around Moscow is fed from several refineries. It is capable of pumping up to 3 million tons of aviation fuel, up to 2.8 million tons of diesel fuel, and up to 1.6 million tons of gasoline annually, according to DI.\n \n\n   \n  Ukraine began  targeting  Russian energy infrastructure on a persistent basis in the summer, using longer-range drones and missiles to attack facilities deep inside Russian territory.\n \n\n   \n  “Our strikes have had more impact than the sanctions [against Russia]” said Budanov. “We have caused much greater damage to the Russian Federation through direct action than any economic levers of influence that have been introduced so far.”\n \n\n   \n  Ukraine’s President Zelensky said earlier this month that as much as  20%  of Russian refining capacity had been taken out of action, and several Russian regions have reported petrol shortages.\n \n\n   \n  Russia has imported more fuel from Belarus to compensate for the shortages.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/politics/early-voting-elections-nyc-virginia-new-jersey","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"09:00:00-04:00","title":"What early voting data says about NYC, Virginia and New Jersey elections","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Early voting data from New Jersey, Virginia, and New York City suggests that Democratic candidates are in stronger positions heading into the November 4 election compared to the same point in 2024.

\n  By Edward Wu, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:00 AM EDT, Sat November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Early voting data suggests that  Democratic candidates for governor in New Jersey and Virginia  are heading into the final weekend in a slightly stronger position than Kamala Harris was at the same time last year.\n \n\n   \n  In New York City,  Andrew Cuomo  may be in a stronger position than in the primary, but there are signs of increased activity from younger voters, a key part of  Zohran Mamdani’s base .\n \n\n   \n  CNN’s experts analyzed the pre-election voting data in all three locations, comparing to 2024 in New Jersey and Virginia to better reflect the changes in early voting patterns over the last four years.\n \n\n   \n  Although early voting analysis can provide hints about which candidates may be well positioned heading into November 4, it is impossible to know who pre-election voters supported or how candidates will do on Election Day, when many of the ballots will be cast.\n \n\n   \n    New Jersey: A Democratic turnout advantage\n \n\n   \n  In New Jersey, Democrats have turned out at a higher rate than Republican voters in both mail and early in-person voting, putting the Democratic candidate for governor, US Rep. Mikie Sherrill, in a stronger position than Harris was last year at this point. Harris eventually won the state by about 6 points.\n \n\n   \n  Through the end of Thursday, registered Democrats led registered Republicans in mail ballot returns by over 41 points, a couple of points better than the 39-point gap at this point last year. But unlike last year, Democrats also hold a nearly 2-point lead in in-person early voting. Last year at this time, Democrats trailed in in-person voting by 2 points.\n \n\n   \n  Mail ballots also represent a larger portion of the pre-election vote so far. As a result, registered Democrats represent a larger share of the total pre-election electorate than they did at this point last year.\n \n\n   \n    New York City: Older voters have turned out more; younger voters are catching up\n \n\n   \n  Among registered Democrats, a group that will make up the lion’s share of New York City mayoral voters, older voters have turned out more so far than they did during the primary, when strong backing from younger voters helped propel Mamdani to a surprise victory. But the electorate is still younger than in past mayoral elections and has only been getting younger as the week has gone on.\n \n\n   \n  A CNN analysis of early voting data from the New York City Board of Elections has found that through October 31, about 53% of registered Democratic voters (55% of all voters so far) are ages 50 and up, while almost 16% of Democratic voters are ages 18 to 29 (15% of voters overall).\n \n\n   \n  That’s more weighted towards older voters than the total Democratic   primary electorate, when about 48% were 50 or older and about 18% of voters were 18-29, according to data from L2.\n \n\n   \n  Polls have shown that younger voters overwhelmingly favor Mamdani, while Cuomo, who is running as an independent, has a smaller lead among older voters.\n \n\n   \n  This year’s turnout is still younger than the city’s last mayoral election in 2021, when just 9% of voters were ages 18 to 29 and 62% were ages 50 and older.\n \n\n   \n  Over the course of the week, daily turnout among Democrats has gotten younger: while older voters outnumbered younger ones by about 50 percentage points on the first day of early voting, that dropped below 20 points on the seventh day.\n \n\n   \n  The geographic distribution of Democratic votes has also been more favorable to Cuomo than it was in the June primary, with turnout strongest so far in precincts where Cuomo did best and relatively weaker in strong Mamdani areas. The most Cuomo-friendly precincts have cast 125% of their primary early in-person totals while the most Mamdani-friendly precincts have cast 85% of their early voting totals.\n \n\n   \n  Still, if the precinct-level Mamdani vs. Cuomo vote from the primary stayed the same, the changes so far in geographic distribution alone wouldn’t be nearly enough for Cuomo to overtake Mamdani among Democratic early voters.\n \n\n   \n    Virginia: Spanberger appears in slightly stronger position\n \n\n   \n  While voters don’t register by party in Virginia, the geographic breakdown of votes cast so far suggests Democratic candidate Abigail Spanberger is in slightly stronger position heading into the final stretch than Harris was at the same point in last year’s election, when she won Virginia by less than 6 points.\n \n\n   \n  The geographic distribution of early in-person votes has slightly favored Republicans, while the distribution of mail ballots is similar to what it was at this point last year. But mail ballots, in which Democrats typically perform better, make up a larger share of the pre-election vote this year (24%) than they did at this point last year (21%), resulting in a geographic breakdown of the combined pre-election vote that is more Democratic-leaning relative to the same point in the 2024 election.\n \n\n   \n  Through Thursday, counties where Trump won last year are averaging 61% of their in-person votes cast at the equivalent point last year, while Harris-won counties are at just over 57%. The worst performing counties so far have been places where Trump won more than 75% of the vote – they’re at just 54% of the in-person votes they’d cast at this point last year.\n \n\n   \n  And that gap between Trump- and Harris-won counties has been narrowing over the course of the last week, dropping from 10 points to 4 points now, largely coinciding with an increased number of voting locations opening in large Democratic-leaning counties such as  Arlington  and  Fairfax .\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/business/berkshire-hathaway-profits-buffett","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"10:02:00-05:00","title":"Berkshire profit rises, cash soars to record","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Berkshire Hathaway reported a 34% rise in operating profit and a 17% increase in net income for the third quarter of 2025, driven by stock market gains.

Richard Quest, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:00 AM EDT, Sat November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump has made it clear that his favorite method to gain leverage over opponent countries on the other side of a negotiating table is to  raise tariffs . It doesn’t matter whether the offense is trade-related or not.\n \n\n   \n  If there had been any lingering doubt (and I doubt there was), it was erased when Trump announced last week that he was  increasing tariffs  on Canada by 10% because he didn’t like an  anti-tariff commercial  Ontario aired across the United States. Ontario Premier Doug Ford’s TV ad quoted the late former President Ronald Reagan, who in 1987 criticized the use of general tariffs as a weapon of trade policy.\n \n\n   \n  It might seem obvious that there is no direct causal trade link between Ontario’s and, by extension Canada’s, action and Trump’s threat of raising Canada’s tariffs by 10%. Nevertheless, Trump’s response was hardly a surprise.\n \n\n   \n  The Canadian incident shows countries on the other side of the negotiating table with the United States face a near-impossible situation.\n \n\n   \n  First, they must negotiate trade deals by coming to Washington with a transactional mindset: “What can we offer up?”\n \n\n   \n  Second, they must, at the last minute, be prepared for the US president to want more — so they better have something else up their sleeve they can give as an offering.\n \n\n   \n  And there’s a third wrinkle: Never mind reciprocal tariffs — the United States is in the business of retaliatory tariffs for seemingly unrelated issues. It means no country can know what decision, policy or indiscretion will offend Trump, who may retaliate at virtually any time with further tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  This is uncharted territory, and it is not the normal way of doing business. Traditionally, tariffs have been used to correct a perceived trade imbalance and to protect the home market by making imports more expensive.\n \n\n   \n  What seems clear is that Trump’s love of tariffs will ensure they remain at the heart of US economic policy. I see no scenario in which the president, even after having negotiated a trade deal, doesn’t reserve to himself the right unilaterally to change his mind, threaten and then launch a fresh tariff.\n \n\n   \n  Some of Trump’s tariffs contain at least a scintilla of geo-political logic. For example, his decision to punish India with 50% tariffs came because the country is still buying oil from Russia. One could – just about – argue the tariff was supporting some wider, strategic goal in halting the Russia-Ukraine war.\n \n\n   \n  With others, it remains difficult or impossible to understand the trade purpose of tariffs. Take Brazil’s case: Trump thinks it’s wrong to prosecute the former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro for allegedly plotting to overturn an election. Describing the prosecution as “a witch hunt that should end immediately,” Trump raised the tariff to 50% due “in part to Brazil’s insidious attacks on Free Elections, and the fundamental Free Speech Rights of Americans.” (The previous tariff had been around 10%.)\n \n\n   \n  According to the Brazilian Specialty Coffee Association, exports of special coffees are now down 70% and the IMF is warning of a more general slowdown in Brazil’s economy because of the tariffs.  The tariff weapon has hit its mark.\n \n\n   \n  Then there’s Colombia. After Colombian President Gustavo Petro criticized Trump’s bombings of alleged drug smugglers off the Caribbean coast, Trump called Petro “an illegal drug leader” who is “low rated” and very unpopular. The punishment: cutting off foreign aid and an unspecified increase in tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  For a country where democracy is often fragile at best, the economic disruption from increased tariffs could have devastating political effects.\n \n\n   \n  Trump also imposed steep tariffs on South Africa for its perceived ill treatment of White farmers and land reforms.\n \n\n   \n  The list goes on. Last week’s threat against Canada only confirmed the trend.\n \n\n   \n  After the last few weeks and months, countries have been warned. No one should be surprised if and when the weapon is fired.\n \n\n   \n  So far, the only country that has stood up to Trump and won is China. Xi Jinping has mastered the careful art of letting Trump appear to win while quietly claiming victory at home.  Xi played his hand perfectly  and came away from their meeting this past week with a reduction in tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  But there’s one final wrinkle: The US Supreme Court next week will hear Trump’s appeal of two lower court rulings that found his use of tariffs as leverage to be an illegal use of his emergency powers. If the Supreme Court upholds those rulings, Trump’s favorite tool could be significantly blunted.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/uk/andrew-sandringham-estate-explained-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"09:22:00-04:00","title":"What we know about Sandringham, Andrew’s new home","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Prince Andrew, formerly a prominent royal figure, is being stripped of his titles and is being relocated from Royal Lodge in Windsor to Sandringham, a historic royal estate in Norfolk, following a public scandal tied to his alleged friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

   \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The rapid fall from grace of the now  former Prince Andrew , culminating in his humiliating exile by  King Charles III  to the Sandringham estate, has been no less than stunning.\n \n\n   \n  His titles and honors are in the process of being formally stripped – he will henceforth be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor – and he’s been served notice to surrender his 75-year lease of  Royal Lodge , the huge mansion he has lived in for more than two decades.\n \n\n   \n  It is not yet known exactly when Andrew will leave Windsor, west of the British capital London, for the monarch’s retreat in rural Norfolk.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know about the sprawling estate that Andrew will soon call home.\n \n\n   \n    The late Queen’s favorite retreat\n \n\n   \n  Andrew has agreed to move out of the 30-room royal residence he has shared with his ex-wife  Sarah Ferguson  within the grounds of Windsor Great Park and into a new home in Sandringham. The estate was beloved by the late Queen Elizabeth II and is now said to be a favorite escape for Andrew’s elder brother King Charles and Queen Camilla.\n \n\n   \n  Buckingham Palace is keen for Andrew to move to the country estate, roughly 100 miles north of London, as soon as is practical. But it will not happen immediately, a royal source told CNN on Friday. That’s because giving notice, surrendering the lease and other formalities related to the relocation - which is similar to buying a house - could make it a protracted process.\n \n\n   \n   Sandringham  was purchased in 1862 by Queen Victoria for her eldest son and heir Albert, later Edward VII, who had just turned 21. It has been the private home of five generations of British monarchs and is where the royal family traditionally gathers to celebrate Christmas each year.\n \n\n   \n    Christmas family tradition\n \n\n   \n  Sandringham is perhaps the most famous stately home in Norfolk, on England’s east coast. The massive estate is spread across an estimated 20,000 acres, with 600 acres of royal parkland and some 150 properties.\n \n\n   \n  Since its purchase, each monarch has helped develop it over the years. The main house was completed in 1870, with a ballroom added 13 years later. Guest and staff accommodation came in the 1890s. It underwent a major overhaul in 1975 when more than 100 rooms in the service wing were demolished “to remove dry rot, save on heating costs and move the kitchens closer to the Dining Room,” according to the Sandringham website.\n \n\n   \n  The house was also the location for Queen Elizabeth II’s first televised Christmas broadcast in 1957.\n \n\n   \n  Within the grounds sits St. Mary Magdalene Church which is routinely used as a place of worship by the Windsors when in residence. It has become a tradition to see the family walk to it every Christmas morning, greeting well-wishers along the way.\n \n\n   \n  The estate also includes an organic farm, sawmill, residential and commercial properties, local parishes and communities.\n \n\n   \n  King George V described Sandringham as “the place I love better than anywhere else in the world” while his son and Queen Elizabeth II’s father George VI once wrote, “I have always been happy here and I love the place.”\n \n\n   \n  The property’s gardens were the first part of the estate to be opened to the public in 1908 by Edward VII. Elizabeth II later opened the main house to the public in 1977 to coincide with her silver jubilee year.\n \n\n   \n  Her husband Philip took responsibility for the estate’s management when Elizabeth acceeded to the throne in 1952. Conservation was at the heart of his approach to ensure that it was maintained for future generations.\n \n\n   \n    So where might Andrew live?\n \n\n   \n  No family members live at Sandringham House permanently these days, but King Charles frequently visits the grand property. Within its vast grounds there are several properties where the monarch could house his brother.\n \n\n   \n   York Cottage , previously known as Bachelor’s Cottage, was given to then-Duke and Duchess of York – the future George V and Queen Mary – as a wedding gift in 1893 by Edward VII. In recent years it has been used as accommodation for vacationers as well as estate staff and has also been used as the estate office for Sandringham, according to the Times of London. It was also reportedly considered for Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex before they stepped back as working royals.\n \n\n   \n   Gardens House  is another viable option. It was previously the home of the estate’s head gardener. The four-bed, three-bath property is currently being used as a holiday let. “This light and airy red brick Edwardian property accommodates up to eight guests, with each room thoughtfully furnished with a blend of rustic pieces, modern comforts, and botanical prints,” the Sandringham website reads.\n \n\n   \n   The Folly  is another available property on the estate. It too is being offered to travelers looking for the chance to “experience the serene splendour” of Sandringham. The original structure dates back to the 1800s and over the years has served as a hunting lodge and a space for ladies to enjoy afternoon tea. It can sleep six guests in its three bedrooms and features a wraparound balcony with a staircase that leads to a turret which “offers panoramic views across the estate,” according to its listing.\n \n\n   \n   Park House  is an additional property on the estate, but it would require some work. It was where Diana, the former Princess of Wales was born and spent much of her childhood. In the early 80s it was offered to charity Leonard Cheshire, which transformed it into a hotel for disabled people. There were plans for it to be renovated in 2019 which were put on hold due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n \n\n   \n   Wood Farm  is a farmhouse on the estate that has strong ties to Andrew’s parents. It is also where his father, Prince Philip, based himself after retiring from public duties in 2017 at the age of 95. However, it is not thought to be where Andrew will end up.\n \n\n   \n  Another option, though it seems incredibly unlikely, is  Anmer Hall,  which was gifted to Prince William and Catherine, Princess of Wales by the late Queen when they wed in 2013. The couple, along with their three children, do not live there permanently but are still thought to spend time during school breaks at the 10-bedroom Georgian property.\n \n\n   \n    Why is the move happening now?\n \n\n   \n  Andrew is losing his royal titles and styles, as well as his Windsor home after weeks of snowballing scrutiny over his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  Public fury was compounded after the publication of a  posthumous memoir from Virginia Giuffre  in October, in which she repeated her claims that she had sex with Andrew on three separate occasions as a teenager while being trafficked by Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew has always denied the claims made against him. But it is understood that the King took action after the recent developments sparked renewed outrage and threatened to taint the monarchy’s reputation further.\n \n\n   \n  His decision to essentially banish his disgraced brother to Sandringham came after consulting legal and constitutional experts, as well as his wider family and the government.\n \n\n   \n  Downing Street said Friday that it backed the King’s actions to remove Andrew’s titles and honors. “Our hearts go out to the family of Virginia Giuffre and all the victims who suffered from Jeffrey Epstein’s despicable crimes in all of this. We should never forget that,” a spokesperson said.\n \n\n   \n    And who will pay for relocation?\n \n\n   \n  Sandringham House and its extensive surrounding estate have been handed down through the generations and is privately owned by the sovereign.\n \n\n   \n  In comparison, Andrew’s current home in Windsor is part of the Crown Estate, which manages the royal family’s land and property holdings on behalf of the British state.\n \n\n   \n  It is understood that the disgraced royal will move to an undisclosed property, with the relocation privately financed by Charles, who will also make financial provisions for his sibling.\n \n\n   \n  His ex-wife Sarah Ferguson is also moving from Royal Lodge but she will make her own living arrangements and is not expected to join Andrew at Sandringham.\n \n\n   \n  The two Pembroke Welsh corgis,  Muick and Sandy, that once belonged to Queen Elizabeth II  will remain in the care of Andrew’s family, Buckingham Palace confirmed to Britain’s PA Media news agency on Friday. However, the palace did not specify if the dogs would stay with Ferguson, head to Norfolk with Andrew or be passed on to their daughters Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/science/nasa-moon-lunar-lander-options","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"09:32:00-04:00","title":"Inside NASA’s scramble to find a backup moon plan — and the wild ideas companies are pitching","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"NASA is under pressure to find a faster path to the Artemis III moon landing due to delays in SpaceX’s Starship rocket development, which has faced multiple test failures and has not yet achieved operational orbital flight.

NASA’s scramble to find a backup moon plan — and the wild ideas companies are pitching \n       \n  By Jackie Wattles, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:32 AM EDT, Sat November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A suggestion made last week by acting NASA administrator Sean Duffy that SpaceX could be booted from the agency’s upcoming moon-landing plans has rocked the space industry.\n \n\n   \n  Now, behind the scenes, pitches for alternate paths to the lunar surface are quietly starting to take shape.\n \n\n   \n  SpaceX currently has a $2.9 billion contract to prepare its gargantuan Starship rocket system to ferry astronauts to the moon’s surface as part of NASA’s Artemis III mission. However, citing delays in Starship’s development and competitive pressure from China, NASA asked SpaceX and Blue Origin — which holds a separate lunar lander contract with the space agency — to submit plans to expedite development of their respective spacecraft by October 29.  Both companies have responded.\n \n\n   \n  But the space agency is also asking the broader commercial space industry to detail how they might get the job done more quickly, hinting that NASA leadership is prepared to sideline its current partners.\n \n\n   \n  CNN spoke with half a dozen companies about how they plan to respond to NASA’s call to action, which the agency will formally issue once the government shutdown ends, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  While some of the potential proposals appear more straightforward than the current moon-landing plan that uses Starship, each involves constructing and testing new spacecraft designs, a process that typically takes at least six or seven years, noted Casey Drier, the chief of space policy at the nonprofit exploration advocacy group Planetary Society.\n \n\n   \n  This could pose an issue for NASA’s timeline. China aims to land its astronauts on the lunar surface by 2030, and Duffy has repeatedly indicated he views beating China as a national security imperative.\n \n\n   \n  Artemis III is currently slated to happen as early as mid-2027, and NASA has signaled that the current pace of Starship development is threatening to push that target months or years into the future.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s a certain part of the moon that everyone knows is the best,” Duffy said, referring to the moon’s largely unexplored south pole region — the target landing site for NASA’s Artemis III astronauts.\n \n\n   \n  “We have ice there. We have sunlight there. We want to get there first and claim that for America,” he said in  August .\n \n\n   \n  Experts who spoke with CNN for this article said that reevaluating SpaceX’s lunar lander contract could be wise. Spending years to develop an entirely new spacecraft could still potentially be faster, some argued, than waiting for Starship, which presents extremely difficult engineering challenges due to its sheer size and unprecedented design.\n \n\n   \n  Still, SpaceX has ticked a few boxes that might give it a significant leg up on the competition. Though in light of NASA’s broader lunar ambitions, experts say the real contest is about much more than speed.\n \n\n   \n    More power, more problems\n \n\n   \n  Touted as the most powerful rocket system ever built, Starship has launched on 11 eye-popping suborbital test flights, relighting engines in space, reusing boosters and demonstrating the ability to deploy satellites along the way.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement posted to its website on Thursday, SpaceX also said it has “completed 49 milestones tied to developing the subsystems, infrastructure, and operations needed to land astronauts on the Moon.” And the “vast majority” of its contractual testing milestones for NASA have happened on schedule, according to the company.\n \n\n   \n  NASA did not immediately respond to a request for comment on SpaceX’s claims.\n \n\n   \n  Starship has also faced significant setbacks — particularly this year. In the first six months of 2025, three prototype vehicles exploded during test flights and another burst into flames during routine ground testing, causing damage to SpaceX’s surrounding infrastructure in Texas. The hangups prompted national security hawks to voice worries that SpaceX won’t deliver Starship in time to realize NASA’s goals.\n \n\n   \n  Under the current plan, NASA would launch its astronauts aboard the Orion capsule atop the Space Launch System rocket, both of which NASA developed. After reaching lunar orbit, the astronauts would transfer to Starship, which would ferry two people down to the moon’s surface and then back to lunar orbit.\n \n\n   \n  But Starship is likely still a long way from being capable of carrying out such an endeavor.  So far, the company has only attempted to fly Starship on hour-long, suborbital test flights. It has not yet sent a vehicle to orbit on an operational mission, nor has it attempted to top off Starship’s fuel during a flight — a step that will be necessary for lunar missions because of Starship’s massive size and design.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not clear how many refueling flights would need to be launched prior to Starship carrying out Artemis III. As CNN previously reported, the number could be  anywhere from 10 to 40 . And transferring cryogenic propellants, of the kind Starship relies on, has never been attempted before with any spacecraft.\n \n\n   \n  “SpaceX is not going to be able to make this work before 2030,” said Doug Loverro, a former chief of human spaceflight at NASA, expressing a sentiment recently  echoed  by two prior NASA administrators.\n \n\n   \n  The company did not provide details about its plan to expedite work on the NASA contract. SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment from CNN, nor does the company typically answer questions from reporters.\n \n\n   \n    Retrofitting Blue Moon\n \n\n   \n  One alternative option that Duffy mentioned during a TV blitz last week is using a spacecraft built by Blue Origin. The Jeff Bezos-funded company already has a contract to provide lunar landers for use later in the Artemis program, including the Artemis V mission.\n \n\n   \n  And because Blue Origin already has an Artemis contract, it could be simpler for NASA to switch up the order in which it relies on its contractors rather than bringing a new company into the mix.\n \n\n   \n  Right now, Blue Origin is developing two models of its Blue Moon landers: Mark 1 for cargo, and Mark 2, the vehicle designed for humans and intended for use during Artemis V.\n \n\n   \n  But to expedite the creation of a lunar lander that could be used for the Artemis III mission, Blue Origin plans to propose a new design that leverages elements of both Mark 1 and Mark 2, according to an industry source familiar with the plan that hasn’t been made public.\n \n\n   \n  Then, to get the vehicle to the moon, Blue Origin would make use of one or more Mark 1 landers that have been essentially converted into small rocket stages that could boost a scaled-down version of Mark 2 out of Earth orbit and to its destination.\n \n\n   \n  The approach would require multiple launches, but likely fewer than the current plan with Starship, the source noted. Blue Origin’s plan also does not require the launch of refueling tankers or transferring super-chilled propellants between spacecraft in orbit.\n \n\n   \n    A team effort\n \n\n   \n  Lockheed Martin — which previously worked on Blue Origin’s lander design but is not actively part of a partnership — also intends to throw its hat in the ring.\n \n\n   \n  Notably, as a legacy NASA contractor, the company built the  $20.4 billion Orion spacecraft  that astronauts will ride when they take off from Earth.   Orion has already flown one successful mission around the moon — Artemis I — and is slated for a crewed test flight to lunar orbit as soon as February.\n \n\n   \n  Now, Lockheed says it can piece together a two-stage lunar lander that uses spare parts harvested from Orion.\n \n\n   \n  The company would make use of Space Shuttle-era OMS-E engines — which are also  used on Orion  — to serve as the propulsion for an “ascent stage” of the lunar lander, providing the thrust for the vehicle to lift off the moon after a mission is completed.\n \n\n   \n  But the vehicle also needs a descent stage to get down to the lunar surface in the first place.\n \n\n   \n  For that component, Lockheed plans to work with another commercial space outfit, though it has not yet decided which one, said Rob Chambers, Lockheed’s director of human spaceflight strategy, and Tim Cichan, the company’s chief architect of space exploration, during a video call last week.\n \n\n   \n  There are two paths Lockheed could take   for its descent stage that could determine which company it teams up with.   It could use a cryogenically fueled lunar lander similar to Blue Origin’s Mark 1. Or it could go with a vehicle that uses more stable propellants such as hypergolic fuels.\n \n\n   \n  If Lockheed decides to go with cryogenic fuels, which must be kept at super-cold temperatures, it would need to launch its ascent stage and descent stage on separate rockets and dock them in orbit.\n \n\n   \n  In that scenario, it may also need to launch additional “boost stages” to kick them out to the moon, Cichan said.\n \n\n   \n  If Lockheed opts for a descent stage with more stable fuels, however, the whole lander could launch in one piece. But it would need to be topped off with fuel in orbit, Cichan added.\n \n\n   \n  He noted  that the refueling process in that case would not, however, be as complex as attempting to refuel cryogenically powered spacecraft, such as Blue Origin’s lander or SpaceX’s Starship, in orbit.\n \n\n   \n  Transferring stable fuels between vehicles in orbit is a less risky proposition and has been taking place on the International Space Station since 2000, Cichan explained. “The Russians and Soviets have been doing it all the way back to the ‘70s,” Cichan said. “So that’s very known technology.”\n \n\n   \n  When asked what would make Lockheed’s proposal competitive with Blue Origin or SpaceX, Chamers said the company’s “approach is quickest because it leverages existing hardware, minimizes the required cadence of launches, and does not rely on technologies like cryogenic refueling or long duration storage that have never been performed on orbit.”\n \n\n   \n  Other commercial space companies contacted by CNN — including Firefly Aerospace and Northrop Grumman — said simply that they were “ready to support” NASA in its endeavor to find a faster way to complete the Artemis III mission.\n \n\n   \n  They did not confirm whether they would formally respond to the space agency’s anticipated request for   companies to submit proposals.\n \n\n   \n    Back to the drawing board\n \n\n   \n  Experts who spoke with CNN suggested that NASA should stretch its imagination when it comes to the spacecraft that will land astronauts on the moon.\n \n\n   \n  “Nobody’s put together a true concept of design,” Loverro said.\n \n\n   \n  “All of that’s doable very quickly,” he noted, adding that he believes a new lander could go from concept to reality within five years.\n \n\n   \n  Loverro suggested that NASA should leverage in-house expertise by leaning on its own Jet Propulsion Laboratory, or JPL, which he said should be empowered to rapidly pursue a lunar lander development program.\n \n\n   \n  While JPL couldn’t do the job alone, because the center is focused on robotic exploration and does not have human spaceflight experience, Loverro noted, the laboratory   has built a reputation over decades for its engineering precision and ability to pull off complex missions on unforgiving timelines.\n \n\n   \n  “You really want that that kind of program management leadership that JPL embodies so well,” Loverro said.\n \n\n   \n    Expensive red herrings\n \n\n   \n  One huge consideration with any of these proposals is the price.\n \n\n   \n  From NASA’s vantage point, SpaceX’s Starship is by far the cheapest proposal because the company is spending so much of its own money on the project. The company even  estimates  it is funding 90% of Starship’s production, test and launch facilities.\n \n\n   \n  None of the other companies CNN spoke with about alternative proposals for NASA’s lunar lander offered cost estimates for bringing their ideas to fruition.\n \n\n   \n  But as with any spaceflight project, it’s safe to assume they won’t be cheap.\n \n\n   \n  NASA’s funds are already limited. While Congress has been on board with supporting the Artemis program — adding $10 billion to bolster lunar efforts in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” — it’s not clear whether lawmakers would throw even more money at the project in an attempt to speed things up.\n \n\n   \n  The space agency also can’t easily cancel existing contracts with either SpaceX or Blue Origin.\n \n\n   \n  Drier noted, however, that support for the Artemis program does seem to be a stand-out unifying force for lawmakers. He also highlighted the fact that the current administration clearly views Artemis as a priority, allowing work on the program to continue  despite the ongoing government shutdown .\n \n\n   \n  But considering the time and money space programs tend to consume, an attempt to hash out a new moon landing plan for Artemis III is an idea that “is probably three years too late to make a difference,” Drier added.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s only ever been one example of a successful human lunar lander in history: The contract for that was awarded in 1962, and it was first demonstrated on Apollo 9 in 1968,” Drier noted.\n \n\n   \n  “So that’s six years — and that cost about 30-ish billion dollars” for the lunar lander alone when adjusted for inflation, which is an exorbitant amount of money that exceeds the agency’s entire annual budget since the mid-1990s, he added.\n \n\n   \n  The space agency’s funding levels have remained far below the highs hit during the Apollo era in the decades since the program concluded.\n \n\n   \n  Another key consideration is time: It’s possible that pursuing one of these alternative options does successfully expedite the Artemis III mission. It’s also possible this pursuit will be an expensive red herring — sucking time and resources away from realizing the plan NASA has been working toward for years.\n \n\n   \n    ‘A base not a race’\n \n\n   \n  In addition to the flurry of conversations around rushing to cobble together a lunar lander, another discussion has been percolating — one that questions whether NASA should be trying to expedite Artemis III at all.\n \n\n   \n  Drier is among the experts who told CNN that they did not view simply landing on the moon before China as essential. The more important goal, they argue, is to pave the way for a permanent lunar base where astronauts can live and work.\n \n\n   \n  SpaceX has appeared to support this viewpoint,  saying in its Thursday statement that Starship “will be a central enabler that will fulfill the vision of NASA’s Artemis program, which seeks to establish a lasting presence on the lunar surface, not just flags and footprints, and ultimately forge the path to land the first humans on Mars.”\n \n\n   \n  The company argues that is why Starship remains the best option for NASA’s Artemis program: The vehicle boasts a massive cargo bay and immense power that could be transformational — opening up possibilities once considered unthinkable, such as delivering 100 metric tons of cargo to the moon in one trip, according to SpaceX.\n \n\n   \n  In the public imagination, the new “space race” — as much as it really is a race — may be won or lost the moment the next astronaut sets foot on the moon. But perhaps the true winner will be the country that is able to build lasting infrastructure, experts say.\n \n\n   \n  “It makes great press fodder to frame this as competition,” said one space policy source, who was among several that spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity to discuss controversial issues. “But this is about the long game and the sustainability.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/travel/travel-news-holiday-travel-season-planning","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"08:00:00-04:00","title":"It’s time to plan holiday trips","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article offers a travel-focused round-up covering holiday travel trends, including optimal booking times and risks due to staffing shortages during the government shutdown.

holiday trips \n       \n  By Jeanne Bonner, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:00 AM EDT, Sat November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In our travel news round-up this week: advice for holiday travelers, a robot that could save old languages from dying out, plus a new super-luxurious overnight train in Italy.\n \n\n   \n    Holiday travel preview\n \n\n   \n  Have you thought about holiday travel yet? Time is just about up if you want the best deals on flights for Thanksgiving and Christmas, according to travel company Kayak, which uses search data to analyze trends. The booking “sweet spot for holiday savings” stretches from mid-October to early November, the company says.\n \n\n   \n  Holiday travel set a record in the US last year, and it’s forecast to surpass 2024 levels. Aviation analytics firm Cirium told CNN that passenger bookings on major US airlines for Thanksgiving are up 2.2 percent from last year.\n \n\n   \n  Reservations for Christmas week are up as well, but less than 1 percent, Cirium said.\n \n\n   \n  Hoping to avoid the crowds?  Kayak suggests  flying out for Thanksgiving on Monday, November 24. That day will be the cheapest. As for Christmas, the most affordable day to fly domestically or internationally will be Christmas Eve.\n \n\n   \n  A rush of passengers would be welcome news to America’s travel industry, which the U.S. Travel Association estimates has lost out on $1 billion in consumer spending every week of the government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Air traffic controller staffing shortages have already caused delays at facilities across the country during the monthlong shutdown, and it could get worse.\n \n\n   \n  Americans could face a travel “disaster” as Thanksgiving approaches, Vice President JD Vance and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy  warned on Thursday , after a roundtable at the White House with aviation, travel and union leaders.\n \n\n   \n  “Look it could be a disaster. It really could be, because at that point you’re talking about people have missed three paychecks. They’ve missed four paychecks. How many of them are not going to show up for work?” Vance said.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s going to lead to massive delays,” he continued.\n \n\n   \n  At LaGuardia Airport in New York earlier this week, Duffy said safety would never be compromised, but staffing shortages often result in slower rates of departures and arrivals.\n \n\n   \n  “If we have issues, we will slow it down,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  AAA recommends travelers arrive at the airport extra early in case of TSA security line delays caused by potential staffing shortages.\n \n\n   \n    Still time to get spooked\n \n\n   \n  Halloween weekend’s not over yet, and some “spooky explorers” hunt for ghosts all year long. Here’s why paranormal tourists  spend big money on terrifying trips . And ghosts aren’t the only attractions around the globe that are  macabre and mysterious .\n \n\n   \n    Italy’s ‘dolce vita’ just got sweeter\n \n\n   \n  A luxurious new train service in Italy is giving travelers a taste of the good life while spiriting them through the stunning countryside, with glimpses of Tuscany’s famed hill towns.  CNN spent 24 hours on board .\n \n\n   \n  The aptly named Dolce Vita Orient Express, which was unveiled earlier this year, is Italy’s first homegrown luxury train. It’s meant to evoke the panache of post-war Italy as exemplified by the films of Federico Fellini, including,  chiaramente , the 1960 classic, “La Dolce Vita.”\n \n\n   \n  Travelers can choose among 18 itineraries. A single day on the train is a 24-hour fever dream of wood paneling, wine and pampering. And it all begins at Rome’s updated Ostiense station.\n \n\n   \n  While train travel is often the way to go in Europe, it continues to face obstacles in the US.  America’s fast train  — NextGen Acela — made its public debut on August 27, but the new trains are rarely able to reach their max speed of 160 miles per hour because of the tracks they’re riding on.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Welcome to Paradise’\n \n\n   \n  After Anesu Masube’s mother died shortly before Christmas in 2017, he rushed back to his native Zimbabwe from Washington, DC, and he expected it to be  the worst flight of his life .\n \n\n   \n  His last-minute booking saddled him with the middle seat, which is especially uncomfortable for someone like Masube, who’s 6-foot-3-inches tall.\n \n\n   \n  But he managed to get moved to an exit row where the woman beside him greeted him by saying with a smile, “Welcome to Paradise.”\n \n\n   \n    In case you missed it\n \n\n   \n   Are American tourists easily distinguishable from Canadians? \n \n\n   \n  Let  the debate  begin.\n \n\n   \n   A private phone number, secret opening times, and no interest in Michelin. \n \n\n   \n  Inside one of Tokyo’s  invite-only  restaurants.\n \n\n   \n   This new tech could save old languages from dying out \n \n\n   \n  It’s a  robot  that’s works like a talking Elmo   toy.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/us/michigan-church-shooting","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"06:49:00-05:00","title":"FBI says shooter in deadly Michigan church attack was motivated by hatred toward the Mormon faith","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The FBI confirmed that Thomas Jacob Sanford, a former Marine who shot and set fire to a church in Grand Blanc Township, Michigan, on September 28, 2025, was motivated by anti-religious beliefs against The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

deadly Michigan church attack was motivated by hatred toward the Mormon faith \n       \n  By Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:49 AM EDT, Sat November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  The former Marine who  opened fire in a Michigan church  and set it ablaze in September was motivated by “anti-religious beliefs” against The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the FBI confirmed Friday.\n \n\n   \n  While  friends of the gunman  in the deadly shooting have said he harbored hatred for what is widely known as the Mormon church, the FBI had previously declined to specify the motivation behind the attack that left four people dead and the church burned to the ground, except to say it was a “targeted” act of violence.\n \n\n   \n  The gunman,  Thomas Jacob Sanford , 40, was killed by  law enforcement  responding to the shooting.\n \n\n   \n  “I am confirming this is a targeted act of violence believed to be motivated by the assailant’s anti-religious beliefs against the Mormon religious community,” Jennifer Runyan, special agent in charge of the FBI Detroit field office, said in a prerecorded video message. The agency declined to share further information on what led to its conclusion.\n \n\n   \n  Sanford drove his pickup truck into the side of a Latter-day Saints chapel in Grand Blanc Township, 60 miles (80 kilometers) northwest of Detroit, on Sunday, Sept. 28, and began shooting at congregants. Authorities have said he used gasoline as an accelerant to then light the church on fire.\n \n\n   \n   Body camera footage  released by Grand Blanc Township police shows an officer yelling, “Drop the gun! Drop the gun! Drop it now!” One of the officers tells another, “I’ve got your back, back here man. Yeah stay there. Shoot him!”\n \n\n   \n  The FBI said Friday that nine people were injured in the attack. The previous official count had been eight.\n \n\n   \n  “During our investigation, an additional individual was determined to be “injured” during the Grand Blanc critical incident,” a spokesperson said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  The agency declined to comment Friday on the nature of the additional injury.\n \n\n   \n  The four people who were killed have been identified through family and friends as Craig Hayden, William “Pat” Howard, John Bond and Thelma Armstrong.\n \n\n   \n  Lisa Louis, who was in the chapel when her father, Hayden, was fatally shot, wrote in a letter that after looking into the shooter’s eyes, she  forgave him , “with my heart.”\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, top church leaders preached a  message of love and forgiveness  in the wake of the attack while gathered for the faith’s twice-annual general conference in its home state of Utah. Its members responded by raising hundreds of thousands of dollars in an  online fundraiser for the gunman’s family .\n \n\n   \n  The church said it strengthened its security protocols for the conference and, days later, for the  funeral of its oldest-ever president , who died a day before the Michigan shooting.\n \n\n   \n  The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints did not have a comment Friday.\n \n\n   \n  Brandt Malone, a member of the faith who was attending services at a nearby church on the morning of the shooting, said the FBI’s statement “did confirm some of our darkest fears — that this attack was motivated by hatred.”\n \n\n   \n  “This affects all believers of all religious traditions, and it hurts that there are those out there who are motivated by the darkest of feelings,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Malone grew up attending events at the church where the attack occurred. He said local Latter-day Saints have been uplifted by an outpouring of love from the Grand Blanc Township community and other religious congregations.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities have released little information about Sanford and the attack. People who knew him have said he began vocalizing anti-Mormon sentiments years ago after living in Utah, where he dated and broke up with a girlfriend who was a member of the faith. Sanford had moved to Utah after leaving the Marines and told his friends he had become addicted to methamphetamines.\n \n\n   \n  An attorney acting as a spokesperson for Sanford’s family did not immediately return a request for comment.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/americas/rescue-efforts-storm-melissa-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"07:19:00-04:00","title":"Caribbean islands reel from Hurricane Melissa’s devastating impact as storm heads north","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, one of the most powerful storms in over 150 years, devastated the Caribbean, with Jamaica bearing the brunt of the destruction as it made landfall as a Category 5 storm.

tore through the region as one of the most powerful Atlantic storms in more than 150 years.\n \n\n   \n  Torrential downpours and forceful winds have  already unleashed  widespread destruction along the storm’s path in Jamaica, Cuba and the Bahamas.\n \n\n   \n  Melissa lashed Bermuda as a Category 1 storm overnight Thursday into Friday as the storm passed the islands, bringing quick-hitting bursts of strong wind and rain. The storm is expected to weaken and become post-tropical as it races south of Newfoundland into cooler Atlantic water.\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of the storm, authorities in Bermuda closed the Causeway – a transport link connecting the main island with the smaller St. David’s Island. All schools will be shut and ferries canceled on Friday, among other measures, out of an “abundance of caution,” said Michael Weeks, Bermuda’s national security minister, according to Reuters.\n \n\n   \n  The storm has damaged homes, caused severe flooding and widespread power outages, and forced the evacuation of hundreds of thousands across the Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n  At least 50 people are known to have died, Reuters reported, though the full toll of the catastrophic storm may take days or weeks to be determined.\n \n\n   \n  Emergency officials have begun to pick up the pieces, clearing roads to reach isolated communities in need of relief, as several international efforts have also been launched.\n \n\n   \n  The regional Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART), activated by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on October 29, has deployed and will be on the ground today.\n \n\n   \n    Jamaica hardest hit\n \n\n   \n  Jamaica took the  heaviest battering . Melissa made landfall there as a  Category 5 storm , with estimated maximum sustained winds of 185 mph (295 kph).\n \n\n   \n  “Complete and utter destruction” is how CNN’s Derek Van Dam described the streets of Jamaica’s hard-hit coastal town of Black River on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  People gathering around the Black River Bridge searched for water, food and news about their loved ones. The Jamaican Defense Forces have landed in the area by helicopter, but desperation is setting in for residents, Van Dam reported.

1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Leaders of Pacific countries and territories, including China’s Xi Jinping, adopted a joint declaration on trade and investment at a major summit in South Korea Saturday. But the leader of one global powerhouse is conspicuously absent: Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n  The US president flew out of South Korea Thursday, moments after his  landmark meeting  with his Chinese counterpart that appeared to  de-escalate the protracted trade conflict  between the world’s two largest economies.\n \n\n   \n  With Trump choosing to skip the annual summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation – which groups together countries accounting for more than half of global trade – Xi stepped into the limelight by calling for unity, cooperation and proposing a global body to govern artificial intelligence.\n \n\n   \n  Despite his absence, Trump’s protectionist trade policies and punishing global tariffs have loomed over the two-day event in the city of Gyeongju. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stood in for Trump during the discussions.\n \n\n   \n  The grouping of 21 economies on both sides of the Pacific signed the “Gyeongju Declaration,” which included commitments to cooperate on economic recovery and growth. The leaders also adopted an AI initiative and a framework to respond to demographic changes caused by low birth rates and aging populations.\n \n\n   \n  “The world is undergoing rapid changes unseen in a century,” Xi told the forum in his opening remarks Friday. “The more turbulent the times are, the more we must stand together in solidarity.”\n \n\n   \n  “China’s door to openness will not close; it will only open wider,” Xi said.\n \n\n   \n  Decisions made in Gyeongju are non-binding — and leaders have faced difficulty reaching consensus in the past including on thorny issues like Russia’s war in Ukraine. But a major focus for the forum this year was on strengthening supply chains and encouraging cooperation as economies worldwide reel from Trump’s tariff offensive.\n \n\n   \n  In their declaration, the leaders acknowledged that “the global trading system continues to face significant challenges,” and as su﻿ch they would “support efforts to ensure resilient supply chains” and “create new drivers of growth” through digital innovations, including AI.\n \n\n   \n  “We are standing at a critical inflection point with a rapidly changing global economic order,” South Korean president and APEC chair Lee Jae Myung said in his address to the summit Friday. “Only cooperation and solidarity can surely lead us to a better future.”\n \n\n   \n  Lee also sat down for talks with Xi, who is on a state visit to South Korea, in the first summit meeting between the two leaders. The two discussed ways to expand cooperation and advance denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula, according to the South Korean presidential office.\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of the talks, Lee said the relationship between Seoul and Beijing has “not completely recovered yet” and there was a need to “find the path for helping one another.” He looked forward to China playing a role in promoting peace on the peninsula, Lee said.\n \n\n   \n  North Korea called talk of denuclearization a “pipedream” that will never be realized. The country’s Vice Foreign Minister Pak Myong Ho accused South Korea of lacking “common sense” for refusing to acknowledge Pyongyang as a nuclear-armed state, the state-run Korea Central News Agency reported Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  Among the high-profile meetings Xi had on the sidelines of APEC was with Japan’s newly installed Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, a staunch conservative who has criticized China’s growing military presence in the region and called for cooperation with Taiwan, the self-ruled island that Beijing claims as its own.\n \n\n   \n  Xi told Takaichi that China was ready to “work with Japan for constructive, stable bilateral ties that meet requirements of the new era,” Chinese state news agency Xinhua reported.\n \n\n   \n  “I aim to maintain communication with you and therefore jointly promote the development of China-Japan relations along the right track,” Xi said.\n \n\n   \n  Takaichi faced a tough balancing act in her meeting with Xi. China remains Japan’s largest trading partner and Takaichi inherited a country facing  mounting economic woes. \n \n\n   \n  She told reporters after the meeting that China and Japan agreed to build a “strategic mutually beneficial relationship.” But Takaichi said she also expressed concerns to Xi on sensitive issues including Chinese export controls on rare earths, China’s activity in the East China Sea, and the detention of Japanese nationals in China.\n \n\n   \n  “I also asked China to resume Japanese beef and seafood imports,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The meeting appeared in stark contrast to the  warm camaraderie  showed by Takaichi and Trump in Tokyo just days before, when the two allies had embarked on a “new golden age” of relations. Takaichi and Trump demonstrated a close bond complete with smiles, fist pumps and jokes.\n \n\n   \n  For Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who is involved in an escalating trade war with Trump, meeting with Xi marked a “turning point” in their relationship, according to his office.\n \n\n   \n  In an earlier speech that echoed Xi and Lee’s addresses to APEC, Carney told the forum that the world was “facing another hinge moment in history.”\n \n\n   \n  “Our world is undergoing one of the most profound shifts since the fall of the Berlin Wall,” he said. “That old world… of steady expansion of liberalized trade and investment… that world is gone.”\n \n\n   \n  Carney had been looking for a reset of Canada-China relations after years of worsening ties and  diplomatic rows . Trade negotiations with the US, Canada’s biggest trading partner, are at  a dead end , and Carney said at the APEC summit that he was aiming to double non-US exports over the next decade in an effort to diversify away from the US.\n \n\n   \n  The two leaders “affirmed their commitment to renewing the relationship between their two countries in a pragmatic and constructive way” and discussed a framework “to deepen cooperation across a range of areas – from clean and conventional energy, to agriculture, manufacturing, climate change, and international finance,” the prime minister’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  Carney also accepted an invitation to visit China and both leaders “directed their officials to move quickly to resolve outstanding trade issues and irritants.”\n \n\n   \n  Speaking to reporters on Saturday, Carney said that he had apologized to Trump for a  political advertisement  that angered the President so much that he terminated trade talks with Canada.\n \n\n   \n  “I did apologize to the President,” Carney said when asked by a reporter about the issue on Saturday. “The President was offended by the ad. It’s not something I would have done… which is to put in place that advertisement, and so I apologized to him.”\n \n\n   \n  The ad was released last month by the government of Canada’s Ontario province and featured audio from  a speech by former US President Ronald Reagan  criticizing tariffs on foreign goods.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/business/how-to-help-snap-benefits","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"03:00:00Z","title":"How to Help SNAP Recipients as the Shutdown Drags On","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As a government shutdown delays the disbursement of SNAP benefits scheduled for November 1, 2025, millions of Americans risk food insecurity.

shutdown drags on \n       \n  By Ramishah Maruf, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:00 AM EDT, Sat November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  More likely than not, someone in your community — whether  friend, family or neighbor  — uses   SNAP benefits.\n \n\n   \n  As  millions of people could lose access to food assistance programs  during the government shutdown, many Americans are trying — in however small a way — to fill in the gaps for people at risk of being left behind.\n \n\n   \n   Two federal judges ruled that the Trump administration has to tap into emergency funds  to at least partially cover November food assistance. But the aid, which was scheduled to disperse on the first of the month, will still be delayed reaching recipients.\n \n\n   \n  Tee Tran, the owner of Vietnamese restaurant Monster Pho in Oakland, California, knows the struggle all too well. He was one of the thousands of Vietnamese boat people, eventually reaching California in 1989, where his mother worked five jobs and used SNAP benefits to keep food on the table. Now he’s decided to give away free meals to children receiving help through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, and a discount for their parents.\n \n\n   \n  “When I see these kids going through this and not having food, it really makes me think of me,” Tran said. “I know how it’s like when you look up to your parents and they want to give you so much … but financially they can’t do it.”\n \n\n   \n  But even though people are pitching in as much as they can to help, there are few options for families that help as much as food stamps. \n \n\n   \n  “No food bank, no charitable organization, can fill the gap if November SNAP isn’t provided,” Stefanie Shuman, Food Bank For New York City’s communications director, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    Check with local businesses\n \n\n   \n  Kevin Cassidy, the owner of a chain restaurant on Long Island called KC’s Pizza & Wings, made a heartfelt post on social media saying he would provide a free meal, no questions asked, to anyone presenting a SNAP/EBT card. He didn’t expect the flood of support.\n \n\n   \n  In two days, he said he got over $1,000 in donations and hundreds of messages from people around the country asking how they can help. Now, he’s planning on prepping pre-made meals, working with a local food bank and using community donations to give out gift cards to local grocers.\n \n\n   \n  “Everyone is struggling a bit, and when you help others it comes back tenfold. The only way to receive is to give,” Cassidy said.\n \n\n   \n  Tran, the owner of Monster Pho, said he has lost 30% of his business in the past six months because of tariffs, immigration restrictions and reduced spending from his customers. That’s why he’s offering free meals to children and a discount to their parents, to help as much as he can without going under.\n \n\n   \n    Donate to a food bank\n \n\n   \n  Food Banks say that cash donations are more helpful than giving food directly if people are able to do so, because they are able to buy a lot more food in bulk themselves. In New York City, for example, $1 can provide up to 5 meals at Food Bank For NYC.\n \n\n   \n  Many companies also match employee donations to organizations such as these, so check with your employer, as well.\n \n\n   \n  The money goes a long way, especially right now.  Food banks have already been feeling the strain  due to increased lines and higher prices of food.\n \n\n   \n    Grocery Buddies\n \n\n   \n  Other people are using online forums to act as “grocery buddies” for families at risk of losing benefits,  CNN previously reported .\n \n\n   \n  Neighbors post in these community groups that they are willing to be a “grocery buddy,” offering help to whoever needs. Then, the parties figure what that help will look like, whether that means shopping together, using gift cards or something else.\n \n\n   \n    Local food pantry and mutual aid groups\n \n\n   \n  For those donating physical food, food bank groups said the best options are non-perishables. Key items include proteins such as canned chicken, tuna and salmon, as well as beans and nut butters. Pastas and rice also have a long shelf life.\n \n\n   \n  Other items food banks and local groups tend to need are hygiene products, such as tampons, pads, diapers and wipes, which can eat away at peoples’ grocery budgets.\n \n\n   \n    Call your local representative\n \n\n   \n  Other advocates say an easy and free way to take action is to call your local representative as the government is still shut down.\n \n\n   \n  Some local and state governments have stepped up to attempt to fill the gap left by SNAP, though it’s still not enough to totally cover the amount of aid.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s no face to hunger. It’s oftentimes, again, working families… (when) the wage has not kept pace with the cost of living,” Shuman said.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Tami Luhby and Alisha Ebrahimji contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/judge-blocks-trump-citizenship-proof-voting-form","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"10:57:00-04:00","title":"Federal judge rules Trump can’t require citizenship proof on federal voting form","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal judge in Washington, DC, ruled that President Donald Trump lacks constitutional authority to require documentary proof of citizenship on federal voter registration forms, finding such a requirement violates the separation of powers by assigning election regulation responsibilities to Congress and the states, not the executive branch.

request to add a documentary proof of citizenship requirement to the federal voter registration form cannot be enforced, a federal judge ruled Friday.\n \n\n   \n  US District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly in Washington, DC, sided with Democratic and civil rights groups that sued the Trump administration over a March executive order to overhaul US elections.\n \n\n   \n  She ruled that the proof-of-citizenship directive is an unconstitutional violation of the separation of powers, dealing a blow to the administration and its allies who have argued that such a mandate is necessary to restore public confidence that only Americans are voting in US elections.\n \n\n   \n  “Because our Constitution assigns responsibility for election regulation to the States and to Congress, this Court holds that the President lacks the authority to direct such changes,” Kollar-Kotelly wrote in her opinion.\n \n\n   \n  She further emphasized that on matters related to setting qualifications for voting and regulating federal election procedures, “the Constitution assigns no direct role to the President in either domain.”\n \n\n   \n  Kollar-Kotelly echoed comments she made when  she granted a preliminary injunction over the issue. \n \n\n   \n  The ruling grants the plaintiffs a partial summary judgment that prohibits the proof-of-citizenship requirement from going into effect. It says the US Election Assistance Commission, which has been considering adding the requirement to the federal voter form, is permanently barred from taking action to do so.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, Sophia Lin Lakin of the ACLU, one of the plaintiffs in the case, called the ruling “a clear victory for our democracy. President Trump’s attempt to impose a documentary proof of citizenship requirement on the federal voter registration form is an unconstitutional power grab.”\n \n\n   \n  A message seeking comment from the White House was not immediately returned.\n \n\n   \n  While a top priority for Republicans, attempts to implement documentary proof-of-citizenship requirements for voting have been fraught. The US House passed a citizenship mandate last spring that has stalled in the Senate, and several attempts to pass similar legislation in the states have proved equally difficult.\n \n\n   \n  Such requirements have created problems and confusion for voters when they have taken effect at the state level. It presents particular hurdles for married women who have changed their name, since they might need to show birth certificates and marriage certificates as well as state IDs. Those complications arose earlier this year when a proof-of-citizenship requirement took effect for the first time during local elections in New Hampshire.\n \n\n   \n  In Kansas, a proof-of-citizenship requirement that was in effect for three years created chaos before it was overturned in federal court. Some 30,000 otherwise eligible people were prevented from registering to vote.\n \n\n   \n  Voting by noncitizens also has been shown to be rare.\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuit brought by the DNC and various civil rights groups will continue to play out to allow the judge to consider other challenges to Trump’s order. That includes a requirement that all mailed ballots be received, rather than just postmarked, by Election Day.\n \n\n   \n  Other lawsuits against Trump’s election executive order are ongoing.\n \n\n   \n  In early April, 19 Democratic state attorneys general asked a separate federal court to reject Trump’s executive order. Washington and Oregon, where virtually all voting is done with mailed ballots, followed with their own lawsuit against the order.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/politics/shutdown-congress-divided","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"The problem is everybody wants to win: Congress bitterly deadlocked as shutdown pain skyrockets","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. government is on the brink of its longest shutdown in history due to a deep political deadlock between Congress and President Donald Trump.

skyrockets \n       \n  By Sarah Ferris, Adam Cancryn, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EDT, Sat November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The government shutdown is on the verge of becoming the longest in US history — and lawmakers still have no idea how much longer it will go.\n \n\n   \n  In Washington, senators left town for the weekend deadlocked and more frustrated than ever, while  critical safety net programs  could soon lose federal funding for the first time.\n \n\n   \n  Two federal judges said Friday that the Trump administration must tap into billions of dollars in emergency funds to at least partially cover food stamp benefits for the month of November. President Donald Trump said later Friday he’d instructed administration lawyers to ask the courts how it can legally fund the benefits, adding that if “given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding, just like I did with Military and Law Enforcement Pay.”\n \n\n   \n  But he noted that even immediate guidance from the courts would result in delayed benefits for food stamp recipients — which could still only be  a partial and short-term fix . Tens of millions of Americans are still bracing for a crisis that will leave them without the government assistance they need to eat, heat their homes or take care of their kids while they work.\n \n\n   \n  And after a week abroad, Trump announced his return with a missive that threatens to further complicate the path out of the shutdown: calling for eliminating the Senate filibuster in a “nuclear” move that even his closest congressional allies worry would only do more damage in the long run.\n \n\n   \n  “Right now, the problem is everybody wants to win,” GOP Sen. Jim Justice of West Virginia, who has advocated for Trump to get more directly involved in negotiations to reopen the government, said of the standoff in the Senate. “And you’ve got a lot of people really hurting, and that really upsets me.”\n \n\n   \n  “I imagine being a parent with a couple kids, and how you’re going to fill their refrigerator and pack their lunches and get on with their lives when the things that they’ve depended on now is gone, because we can’t even agree to just open things up,” fumed Sen. John Fetterman, a Democrat from Pennsylvania who has repeatedly bucked his party and sided with Republicans on the funding bill.\n \n\n   \n  Privately, lawmakers of both parties have acknowledged in recent days they need to find a way out of the shutdown in the next week or two or else face even more dire consequences, according to interviews with a half-dozen sources.\n \n\n   \n  And publicly, many are hopeful that the skyrocketing pressure on both Republicans and Democrats will force the two sides to find a deal.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s going to be a flood of phone calls from people saying, wait, wait, wait, wait, my health care is going to go up by that much?” Sen. Chris Coons, a centrist Democrat from Delaware, told CNN, referring to the spiking premiums that his party has made a central demand in the funding fight. But he said phone lines would, too, be lighting up for Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  “I also think Democrats are going to get a flood of calls from people saying, wait, wait a minute. My SNAP and WIC is going to be…? So I think there will be building pressure on both parties to find a path forward.”\n \n\n   \n  Behind the scenes, Senate and House GOP leaders are confident Democrats will cave shortly after the November 4 elections, several of the sources said. Many point to a flurry of talks with some centrist Democrats to end the shutdown, perhaps in exchange for a vote to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies that remain Democrats’ biggest demand in the funding fight, as well as a commitment to full-year spending bills.\n \n\n   \n  “I hope it frees people up to move forward with opening government,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune said of Election Day on Tuesday, claiming Democrats would be more willing to yield when they’re not “concerned about turnout” in key races in Virginia and New Jersey.\n \n\n   \n  Yet several people close to Democratic leaders insist the party is unwilling to back down for a show vote. After more than 30 days of insisting on a clear commitment on the health care issue, many Democrats will be unswayed by unofficial commitments: They want to hear directly from Trump.\n \n\n   \n  As the shutdown has dragged on, even some Republicans have grown antsy as Johnson has kept the House out of session since September 19 and lawmakers have remained in their districts.\n \n\n   \n  “People ask, ‘Do you like being here in the district?’ Of course I do because I get to see all of my constituents,” GOP Rep. Stephanie Bice of Oklahoma told reporters on Tuesday from Washington. “But I also would tell you that we are built to work here. We are all built to be here and doing our jobs and late nights and early mornings and trying to figure out a path forward. And so, it’s a little unusual.”\n \n\n   \n  Many House lawmakers concede they don’t know what will happen if the shutdown extends past November 21, the date of the House-passed government funding extension.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats also pointed to Trump’s late-night call for nuking the filibuster, which injected fresh uncertainty into the situation and raised further questions about the role the president might play in resolving the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  In a Friday statement, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said that “if Democrats won’t do what’s best for the American people, the nuclear options will need to be invoked,” though she did not offer a specific timeline. Top GOP leaders, meanwhile, were quick to swat away the suggestion of weakening the custom, while maintaining that Trump and Republicans in Congress were united in ending the shutdown without ceding any ground to Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  That includes Trump’s resistance to any further meetings with Hill leaders, despite constant requests from Democratic senators.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Jacky Rosen, a Nevada Democrat, shot down GOP leaders’ offer earlier this month to guarantee a vote on the floor on ACA subsidies in exchange for Democratic votes to end the shutdown, quipping, “I’m not sure that Leader Thune is really the leader of the Senate.”\n \n\n   \n  White House officials have insisted that their stance remains unchanged, and that there won’t be any negotiations until Democrats cave and reopen the government.\n \n\n   \n  “Let them open up the country, and we’ll meet,” Trump said Friday. “We’ll meet very quickly. But they have to open up the country.”\n \n\n   \n  But in the days before Trump returned to the US, aides had privately discussed options for enticing Democrats to give in, including agreeing to undo the administration’s recent mass firing of federal workers in exchange for reopening the government, two people familiar with the deliberations told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Those conversations were preliminary and did not yield any final decisions, the people familiar cautioned, especially amid concerns that it would hand Democrats an opportunity to claim they won the shutdown fight.\n \n\n   \n  Another suggestion discussed by GOP officials — that Trump invite Republican and Democratic leaders to the White House next week to try to broker an end to the impasse — was swiftly ruled out. One senior congressional GOP aide stressed that it was never a real option.\n \n\n   \n  Still, the behind-the-scenes activity offers a window into the increasing urgency to end the shutdown before more pain hits Americans across the country — and the lingering concern within the administration over which side will bear the brunt of the political fallout.\n \n\n   \n  In recent polling, more voters still blame Trump and Republicans for the shutdown than they do Democrats. And while the expiration of food aid has pushed more Democrats to seek an end to the shutdown, it’s also worried a swath of Republicans who represent the millions of red-district voters reliant on SNAP — and are already under pressure over high prices, health care and other economic issues.\n \n\n   \n  “The question becomes, who politically gets the blame?” said one GOP adviser involved in the shutdown discussions. “If Republicans are really feeling the tide shifting on that one there may be a more political imperative to get this solved.”\n \n\n   \n  Within Trump’s orbit, aides and advisers are largely resigned to the shutdown blowing past the 35-day record set during his first term, three people close to the White House said.\n \n\n   \n  Yet they are still holding out some hope that the impasse won’t last much beyond Tuesday’s elections, believing Democrats are increasingly eager to find an off-ramp.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats, meanwhile, insist it’s Trump who needs to offer them one.\n \n\n   \n  “We could end this at any moment, if we can get the right people in the room, and that includes the president. He spent an hour on this, as far as I could tell, in a month. An hour. How much time has he spent on his ballroom?” Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona told reporters this week.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/us/portland-national-guard-deployment-trial","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Federal Judge to Rule on National Guard Deployment in Portland Amid Legal Battle Over ICE Facility Security","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal court in Portland is poised to rule on whether National Guard troops can be deployed to protect the ICE facility amid a legal battle between the Trump administration and Oregon and California.

Here’s what the trial revealed \n       \n  By Jason Kravarik, Elizabeth Wolfe, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EDT, Sat November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A trial to decide the  fate of the National Guard deployments  in Oregon concluded Friday, leaving Portland residents, Trump administration officials and hundreds of soldiers in limbo as they await the judge’s decision.\n \n\n   \n  US District Judge Karin Immergut presided over the three-day trial that featured a surprising revelation: National Guard troops were on the ground at Portland’s ICE facility earlier this month even after the judge ordered them not to show up.\n \n\n   \n  The trial also provided insight on what top federal and National Guard officials knew — and didn’t know — when President Donald Trump called for hundreds of troops to protect the ICE facility that has faced months of protests.\n \n\n   \n  As Oregon and California challenge the effort to send 400 soldiers from their states to the facility, federal attorneys argued during the trial it’s within Trump’s presidential authority to respond to the daily protests outside the facility that have subjected the building and its agents to what it described as coordinated violence.\n \n\n   \n  But state and city attorneys called the move “one of the most significant infringements” on Oregon’s sovereignty in the state’s history and argued the Trump administration is dramatically misrepresenting the situation and risking inflaming tensions.\n \n\n   \n  “The government cannot create the very emergency they propose to resolve,” Oregon attorney Scott Kennedy said.\n \n\n   \n  Troops have so far been barred from deploying due to two temporary restraining orders from Immergut: one blocking  troops from Oregon  and another blocking  troops from any state . The former order is temporarily on hold after  being appealed  to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n \n\n   \n  Plaintiffs are seeking a ban on deploying National Guard troops to Oregon. The judge, whom  Trump appointed  during his first term, is expected to file a decision by Sunday when the previous order expires. The decision is expected to draw a quick appeal from the losing side.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what you need to know.\n \n\n   \n    DOJ admits soldiers were at ICE facility even after judge’s order\n \n\n   \n  Trump announced abruptly in a social media post last month that he would order Oregon National Guard troops to Portland, hurling his administration into a legal showdown with the state.\n \n\n   \n  As the case played out, Immergut issued an initial restraining order on October 4 blocking the deployment. But government attorneys admitted this week that Guard soldiers were already at the facility – and remained there for hours after her order.\n \n\n   \n  Though Immergut filed her restraining order at 3:40 p.m. PT on October 4, Justice Department attorney Eric Hamilton told her as many as 10 soldiers were at the facility until midnight. Earlier, his colleague Jean Lin had said the troops were there until 2 a.m.\n \n\n   \n  The judge briefly pressed the Trump administration on whether the soldiers’ presence might have been in contempt of her order, questioning why the government would deploy those Guard members while knowing her ruling on the restraining order was imminent.\n \n\n   \n  “The government deployed that very night that I told you I would issue an opinion,” Immergut said. “Does that not seem in bad faith?”\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think so,” Justice Department attorney Eric Hamilton replied, adding that the Guard members were needed at the ICE building prior to the judge’s ruling.\n \n\n   \n  Immergut questioned why the Oregon National Guard members didn’t vacate the ICE facility for hours after her restraining order was issued, yet California troops were able to arrive in Oregon by the next day.\n \n\n   \n  “Doesn’t that seem odd?” she asked.\n \n\n   \n  Hamilton told her the direction to comply with her order “went high up in the chain of command,” and a four-star general was involved. He argued it took time to implement the order. “There are steps that it has to go through.”\n \n\n   \n  “My clients were working to end the mission,” Hamilton said.\n \n\n   \n  The issue was tabled after Immergut suggested there could be a separate hearing on the potential order violation.\n \n\n   \n    ICE facility official was surprised by Guard deployment\n \n\n   \n  Top officials charged with the safety of the Portland ICE facility were not consulted before Trump ordered National Guard troops to Portland in September, one of those officials testified.\n \n\n   \n  A deputy regional director for the Federal Protective Service, identified in court by the initials R.C., said he and his boss, the FPS regional director, found out about the order on the news.\n \n\n   \n  “I was surprised,” R.C. said.\n \n\n   \n  “Your first thought was ‘What would I do with 200 National Guard men?’” asked Oregon Senior Assistant Attorney General Brian Simmonds Marshall.\n \n\n   \n  “Yes, sir,” R.C. said, admitting he already had a large number of FPS and supporting agents staffing the ICE facility. Asked about  Trump’s claim  that Portland is “burning down,” the official said, “I do not agree with the statement that Portland is burning down.”\n \n\n   \n  A high-ranking official in the National Guard Bureau also testified that he had never been to Portland’s ICE facility – or been formally briefed on the conditions there – before he authorized the Guard deployment.\n \n\n   \n  Acting Major General Timothy Rieger said the only direct information he had regarding conditions on the ground in Portland were from the media and other anecdotal accounts.\n \n\n   \n  “You don’t know if that (media) footage is from this year or prior years?” asked California attorney Barbara Horne-Petersdorf.\n \n\n   \n  “I do not know the veracity of that footage,” Rieger replied.\n \n\n   \n  Rieger said he was acting on the direction of an internal memo from the Secretary of Defense’s office that was corroborated by a Truth Social post from Trump.\n \n\n   \n    Is the facility ‘under siege’ or under control?\n \n\n   \n  Underpinning the arguments was a fundamental disagreement over how extreme the demonstrations have been – and whether local law enforcement is capable of handling criminal activity or violence when it occurs.\n \n\n   \n  Portland “is not war-ravaged, there is no rebellion, and the laws continue to be enforced every day,” Caroline Turco, an attorney for the city of Portland, said during opening statements.\n \n\n   \n  Instead, a simmering protest scene only ramped up after Trump ordered Guard troops to enter Portland in late September, state and city attorneys said.\n \n\n   \n  While admitting there have been “sporadic and inexcusable crimes” along with peaceful protests, Oregon’s attorney Scott Kennedy called them “precisely the kinds of challenges” that existing law enforcement can and have handled.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration focused on a particularly chaotic night in June as they argued local law enforcement is unable to fully protect the facility.\n \n\n   \n  The tense June 14 protest resulted in a  riot declaration by Portland police , and drew a crowd that was “very active, high-energy and engaged in active criminal conduct,” said DOJ attorney Tiberius Davis, quoting a report from Oregon State Police Captain Cameron Bailey.\n \n\n   \n  During cross examination on Wednesday, Bailey admitted troopers—who were scheduled to provide mutual aid to Portland police—were not on scene before the protest began.\n \n\n   \n  There was “no immediate law enforcement intervention available at that time?” Davis asked. Bailey agreed, saying troopers were scheduled to start later in the evening.\n \n\n   \n  R.C, the high-ranking official with the Federal Protective Service, said demonstrators that night threw broken glass, rocks and debris at federal agents. There was also an attempt to “breach the facility,” the official said.\n \n\n   \n  Officers that night considered using deadly force if protesters entered the building, saying they may have to “go lethal,” according to R.C.\n \n\n   \n  “Protesters were putting chains on the door,” R.C. said. “It shows an attempt to lock the officers in and create a hazard for the team that was there.”\n \n\n   \n  He added that two FPS officers were injured from fireworks thrown at the building and an ICE employee required medical attention after being hit with an object.\n \n\n   \n  Davis also sought to establish that federal officers were getting little help from Portland police by outlining several incidents in which rocks were thrown at the ICE facility without any arrests. One report logged people “using slingshots to shoot cameras” at the ICE facility, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Attorneys for Oregon and Portland maintain Trump’s lawyers are seizing on a small sample size of dates that ended in violence, instead of a vast majority of nights that remained peaceful.\n \n\n   \n  Portland Police Commander Franz Schoening testified that managing these demonstrations can become complicated because the city’s sanctuary laws limit how officers are able to interact with crowds outside the immigration facility.\n \n\n   \n  “We will not engage in immigration-related enforcement or participate in activities” that could be related to it, Schoening said. That includes clearing crowds in front of the ICE driveway, so the task was left to federal agents, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Officers are also restricted from assisting federal agents if they have begun to deploy munitions like pepper balls and tear gas, Schoening said, citing a law passed in 2020 that limits Portland’s participation with agencies using such munitions.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Unpredictable’ use of force can create safety risks, police commander says\n \n\n   \n  The Portland police commander highlighted starkly different approaches between federal and local law enforcement in handling the protests, saying federal tactics sometimes contribute to the chaos.\n \n\n   \n  Portland police often have different interpretations of the level of threat outside the ICE facility, Schoening said, including on October 18, when federal agents used munitions on the crowd.\n \n\n   \n  “We simply didn’t see that (as necessary),” Schoening said.\n \n\n   \n  That night, police witnessed a federal officer launching tear gas canisters that “skipped off of their driveway and went onto the roof of the ICE facility where other officers were standing.”\n \n\n   \n  That prompted those federal officers to deploy more munitions, he said. “Our officers were impacted by those munitions.”\n \n\n   \n  The commander said he was “startled” to see the amount of force often employed by federal agents, noting it was “disproportionate to the level of criminal conduct we are seeing down there.”\n \n\n   \n  The use of force against demonstrators has at times threatened the safety of nearby Portland officers, Schoening added. When federal agents use “indiscriminate force,” he said, including the “unpredictable” use of chemical crowd dispersal agents, local police do not get a warning.\n \n\n   \n  “Officers face safety risks themselves,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration, however, argues federal agents face systematic disruption and assault from protesters that justifies a more forceful  response.\n \n\n   \n  “It is a frequent occurrence for agitators to carry bats, improvised weapons and shields,” Hamilton told the court.\n \n\n   \n  Hamilton said the protesters have displayed “disturbingly intrusive behavior” and organized violence. “The agitators coordinate their activity, including their information-gathering techniques.”\n \n\n   \n  The government also dismissed the state’s claim that National Guard presence escalates the tensions on the ground, saying there is no substantive evidence that has occurred.\n \n\n   \n  “It is totally speculative that there will be inflamed tensions and that inflamed tensions would impact plaintiffs in any way,” Hamilton said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/letitia-james-challenges-appointment-us-attorney","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"18:57:00-04:00","title":"New York AG Letitia James challenges appointment of US attorney in Albany","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"New York Attorney General Letitia James has filed a motion to challenge the appointment of John Sarcone as US Attorney for the Northern District of New York, alleging that the appointment is illegal and retaliatory, and that the Justice Department’s subpoena seeking information about her investigations into Donald Trump and the National Rifle Association violates First Amendment rights and New York’s state sovereignty.

     \n  Analysis by Hanako Montgomery, Betsy Klein, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:58 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  During their closely watched  first meeting  in Tokyo, Donald Trump and Sanae Takaichi looked more like old friends than world leaders.\n \n\n   \n  There were smiles, back slaps, hugs and even a joke about running late because they’d been watching the LA Dodgers – led by Japanese megastar Shohei Ohtani – play in the World Series.\n \n\n   \n  The US president received a Nobel Peace Prize nomination (the second of his Asia trip), and a golf putter previously owned by the late former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who famously bonded with Trump on the green.\n \n\n   \n  Their easy camaraderie continued at the Yokosuka naval base, where Trump invited  Takaichi  on stage aboard the USS George Washington and praised her leadership. The new Japanese PM responded with a triumphant fist pump and a twirl, a moment that quickly went viral in her country.\n \n\n   \n  The message was unmistakable: the  Abe-era chemistry between Washington and Tokyo  is back.\n \n\n   \n  “She is a delight,” Trump told business leaders at the conclusion of the day’s activities. “I got to know her pretty well in a short period of time.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s not often Trump shows this level of warmth toward a foreign leader, particularly one from a country that’s weathered his tariff wars. It’s just as rare to see a Japanese prime minister display such open affection on the world stage.\n \n\n   \n  It certainly helps that the two see eye to eye on several political issues. Both are right-wing conservatives who support military buildup and a tougher stance on China. Their shared connection to Abe also helps explain their rapport. Abe was one of Trump’s “best friends” in global politics, as well as being Takaichi’s political mentor.\n \n\n   \n  But beneath the photo ops and nostalgia also lies a strategic alliance born of mutual need. Especially as both leaders eye the same adversary in Beijing.\n \n\n   \n  For Trump, having a staunch ally in the Asia-Pacific region willing to take a hard line against China is an undeniable win. Takaichi, a longtime China hawk, has criticized Beijing’s military expansion and economic coercion for years. Her hardline stance dovetails neatly with Trump’s “America First” worldview.\n \n\n   \n  The two also unveiled a new framework on rare earths, aimed at reducing dependence on China’s near-monopoly over critical resources. Details were vague, but the message of cooperation was clear. Japan still remembers the 2010 “rare earths shock,” when Beijing cut off exports after a territorial dispute. Takaichi has since made securing stable supply chains a key part of her economic agenda.\n \n\n   \n  Trade and investment also featured prominently at the summit. Japan pledged roughly $490 billion in US-bound investments, led by companies in AI, semiconductors, defense and advanced manufacturing, part of a broader trade deal already agreed upon by the allies in September.\n \n\n   \n  For Trump, who prizes loyalty and has a long memory for slights, an allegiance to Japan solidified early in his first term. Abe took great care to develop the US-Japan relationship, at a time when the president did not have a lot of support on the world stage.\n \n\n   \n  Foreign dignitaries and leaders  openly laughed  at the president during a 2018 United Nations General Assembly address. In 2019, a group of NATO leaders were  captured  on camera gossiping about him.\n \n\n   \n  But Abe cultivated his American counterpart with thoughtful gestures that played directly to Trump’s interests: multiple golf outings, the pomp and circumstance of a state banquet, and a trip to a sumo wrestling tournament where Trump bestowed the winner with a “President’s Cup.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump remained close to his counterpart until Abe’s assassination in 2022, and hosted his widow at Mar-a-Lago last year.\n \n\n   \n  That goodwill paved the way for Takaichi’s success on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  “He really likes her,” said a senior Trump administration official who observed their interactions behind closed doors.\n \n\n   \n  She also benefited from timing: Takaichi took office after Trump’s reciprocal tariffs rocked markets and reimagined US alliances – shielding her from tangling with the Trump administration to negotiate a trade deal.\n \n\n   \n  For Takaichi, standing shoulder to shoulder with Trump strengthens her hand at home. Her approval ratings soared after taking office, but her ruling party still lacks a parliamentary majority after recent election losses. Public frustration over past scandals also lingers. Projecting Japan’s influence abroad, and reaffirming its bond with Washington, helps her rebuild political capital.\n \n\n   \n  For Trump, the optics are just as valuable. Hardening a close alliance with Tokyo gives him diplomatic momentum ahead of a more contentious meeting with China’s Xi Jinping. It’s also a reminder to Beijing that he’s not short on powerful friends in the region.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/china/china-sends-youngest-astronaut-to-space-station-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"20:03:00-04:00","title":"China sends its youngest astronaut and four black mice to ‘Heavenly Palace’ space station","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"China successfully launched the Shenzhou-21 mission, carrying the youngest astronauts in its history — Zhang Hongzhang and Wu Fei — to the permanently inhabited Tiangong space station, marking a shift toward younger astronaut participation.

Nebraska she’s called home for decades \n       \n  By Nayeli Jaramillo-Plata, Amanda Musa, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:00 AM EDT, Sat November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Alejandra doesn’t leave her home unless she really needs to. She skips doctor’s appointments and church to remain undetected. And if she is detained by immigration enforcement officials, her 13-year-old son is prepared with a list of people to call and his social security number memorized.\n \n\n   \n  “I cannot be separated from my kids,” said the 30-year-old undocumented mother of four children who were born in the United States. “I just can’t risk it.” CNN agreed to only use Alejandra’s first name to protect her identity out of respect for her safety concerns due to her immigration status.\n \n\n   \n  The idea that her family might be ripped apart only crossed her mind recently, she said, when President Donald Trump’s nationwide  immigration crackdown  penetrated the humble, quiet Nebraska community she calls home.\n \n\n   \n  In June, a  meatpacking plant in Omaha  was raided by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in what the agency described as the  largest worksite operation  in the state since the start of the Trump administration. Alejandra says several family friends and church acquaintances were among the dozens of people detained.\n \n\n   \n  As that event continues to generate aftershocks, a new ICE detention center, dubbed the  “Cornhusker Clink,”  is opening in western Nebraska soon and is expected to hold up to 300 adults, a spokesperson for Nebraska’s Republican Gov. Jim Pillen told CNN Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  The facility will join other new ICE detention centers in Republican-led states, including “ Alligator Alcatraz ” in Florida, “Louisiana Lockup” or  “Camp 57”  in Louisiana, and “Speedway Slammer” in Indiana.\n \n\n   \n  These new ICE facilities “are significantly expanding detention space to house the worst of the worst illegal aliens,” a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson told CNN Wednesday. “We look forward to the opening of this new partnership with Nebraska very soon.”\n \n\n   \n  Pillen’s office has estimated the contract with DHS will bring around $14 million annually to the state. Laura Strimple, a spokesperson for the governor’s office described it as “the latest action undertaken by Gov. Pillen to stand with President Trump and protect Americans from criminal illegal aliens. The facility will not only serve Nebraska, but also other states in the region.”\n \n\n   \n  Sitting hundreds of miles away from the border, the opening of “Cornhusker Clink” may solidify Nebraska’s place in the national immigration debate. Unlike many states at the center of immigration enforcement operations, Nebraska is under full Republican control and its governor hasn’t shied away from the conversation.\n \n\n   \n  Pillen signed a  January executive order  expressing his support for federal immigration policy, ordered Nebraska National Guard deployments to Texas, and facilitated the  troops’ activation  ahead of recent ICE protests in his state. He also touted the alleged  arrest of a MS-13 “kingpin”  in Omaha this summer.\n \n\n   \n  Yet, immigration advocates, some state lawmakers and business leaders said it’s a contrast from the previously welcoming atmosphere they have worked to build in the state, especially to strengthen its economy.\n \n\n   \n    Nebraska’s immigrant workforce under threat\n \n\n   \n  Unlike other states, Nebraska is not often seen of as a haven for immigrants, but parts of the state are an enclave for Latinos, who have lived and worked in the Cornhusker state for many years in part due to the meat packing industry, immigration advocates and business leaders in the state say.\n \n\n   \n  Today, much of Nebraska’s Latino population is second, third, or even fourth generation. In rural towns like Schuyler, Lexington and Madison, which some call “Latino Pueblos,” some business owners and community leaders were initially drawn by jobs at meat-packing plants and stayed for decades.\n \n\n   \n  Now, immigration operations are threatening the stability of these small communities and industry operations in Nebraska, said John Hansen, president of the  Nebraska Farmers Union .\n \n\n   \n  “There’s an awful lot of folks that are just afraid to show up to work, afraid to be seen in public,” said Hansen, noting many farms and meatpacking plants are struggling to stay staffed.\n \n\n   \n  Nebraska’s meatpacking industry, which includes major processing facilities for JBS, Tyson Foods, Cargill and Smithfield, depends on immigrant labor. Immigrants, many of whom are undocumented, represent about 53% of the state’s workforce, according to the  Migration Policy Institute .\n \n\n   \n  Immigration raids, rising deportation fears and political shifts have created “an atmosphere of fear and intimidation,” among workers, Hansen said, and some union members have privately expressed regret about voting for Trump, who won a majority of the state’s vote in the 2024 election, citing mass deportation and tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  The state is experiencing a severe labor shortage, with only 70 available workers for every 100 open jobs as of August, according to data from the  US Chamber of Commerce .\n \n\n   \n  On the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly claimed  immigrants were taking jobs from Americans.  But in actuality, immigrants were  filling critical labor gaps,  economists say.\n \n\n   \n  While meat packing jobs initially built stable, middle-class lives, Hansen said, injuries like carpal tunnel surged as assembly lines became faster and more repetitive by the 1960s and 1970s, leading to an exodus of American workers. Then, immigrants filled the gap, shaping Nebraska’s farms, factories and towns for decades, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Immigrants, like Alejandra’s family who first migrated from Mexico to Iowa, as well as Latinos born in the US, have spent decades inside those plants, cutting, trimming, packing and processing meat that ends up on dinner tables across America.\n \n\n   \n  Ness Sandoval, a professor at Saint Louis University who studies inequality and Latino and immigrant demography, recalls growing up in Nebraska and his dad’s grueling job at a meatpacking plant.\n \n\n   \n  “He had no time or energy to go to any of my events or sports. He would make an effort when it was something meaningful, but he had to be in bed like at 8 o’clock,” Sandoval said. “It’s a very physical job on the body.”\n \n\n   \n  Injuries were once so routine Sandoval’s father was given an award for going a year without getting hurt. As the years passed, the repetitive work led him to suffer from shoulder injuries, arthritis and a later, he retired after breaking his shoulder in a fall, Sandoval said.\n \n\n   \n  Although his father took pride in his work, he never wanted his son to follow the same path “because he understood how difficult that job was on the body,” Sandoval said.\n \n\n   \n    Remote state prison transformed to hold immigrants\n \n\n   \n  The terracotta-colored building in McCook, Nebraska, soon to be referred as “Cornhusker Clink” was previously a state prison known as the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services’ Work Ethic Camp.\n \n\n   \n  With a focus on reintegrating low-risk offenders back into the community, the camp housed more than 180 inmates who often worked on-site at the facility’s kitchen or warehouse, according to a 2024  report.  Others filled road-crew jobs with the Nebraska Department of Transportation.\n \n\n   \n  The facility, opened since 2001, aimed to ease prison overcrowding “and make prison bed space available for violent offenders.” Decades later, the Nebraska prison system is still struggling to manage its current population, which is exceeding 140% of its design capacity, according to a  2024 report  by the state’s inspector general of the correctional system.\n \n\n   \n  Repurposing the facility in McCook is expected to further destabilize the prison system, said Mindy Chipman, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Nebraska.\n \n\n   \n  “Transitioning a minimum-security facility that provides reentry services — services the Department of Corrections says are more needed than ever — into an immigration detention center removes support from Nebraskans and confines people, most of whom have no criminal record,” Chipman told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Current prisoners will be discharged, placed on parole or transferred to other correctional facilities “by the time the facility is ready to house ICE detainees,” the governor’s office said in a  September news release .\n \n\n   \n  When the converted ICE detention center opens, state officials said, people with minor criminal records and nonviolent felonies will be eligible to be placed there but not those with felony convictions linked to acts of violence.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the governor’s office, the department of corrections and the Department of Homeland Security for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Pillen’s motive is not safety, according to Chipman, but rather to signal support for Trump’s anti-immigrant agenda. The “Cornhusker Clink” is one of several new detention projects backed by the Trump administration’s $45 billion “ One Big Beautiful Bill ,” which would add 80,000 ICE beds nationwide.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to the overcrowding, legal advocates in Nebraska said they worry the facility’s remote location could increase the likelihood of detainees experiencing civil rights violations, with many being far from family and attorneys.\n \n\n   \n  McCook is one of several small communities in southwestern Nebraska and sits somewhat close to Interstate 80, a major highway that travels east to Omaha – about four hours away – and west toward Denver – three hours away.\n \n\n   \n  There is no public bus from Omaha, the most populous city in the state, to McCook as well as to North Platte, a rural town about an hour north of it where most of the immigrants detained following the raid at the meatpacking plant in June were taken. All travel must be done by car, which could become tricky during the harsh Nebraska winters.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s easier to get to North Platte because it’s on I-80. McCook, you have to go further, and you are more in the middle of nowhere,” said Lina Traslaviña Stover, executive director of the Omaha-based nonprofit Heartland Workers Group, whose work involves advocating for migrants who are detained at immigration detention facilities in the state.\n \n\n   \n  “Isolation is part of the strategy,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  Anne Wruth, an attorney with the Center for Immigrant and Refugee Advancement, who traveled west to meet with a detained client in North Platte, called the process a “logistical nightmare.”\n \n\n   \n  For lawmakers and advocates, who said they were surprised when plans for the ICE facility were announced, there are other pressing needs such as property taxes, labor shortage and affordable housing in the state.\n \n\n   \n  “This was not something that went through us,” Nebraska State Sen. Dunixi Guereca, a Democrat in the officially nonpartisan Legislature whose district includes part of Omaha, said about state lawmakers and plans for the facility, noting the timeline was “extremely truncated.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘And if anything happens, you go’\n \n\n   \n  Alejandra is realizing the state she and her parents have called home and instantly made them feel welcome – where many still say “please” and “thank you” – has started to turn against them, or at least some people.\n \n\n   \n  When the family first arrived in Nebraska, Alejandra excelled in school where she was surrounded by classmates from Thailand, Haiti, and El Salvador – a diversity fueled in part by the state’s refugee resettlement program, which welcomes the most refugees per capita compared to other US states despite Nebraska’s relatively small population of just over 2 million people, according to a  data analysis  from the Immigration Research Initiative, a non-profit, non-partisan think tank tracking immigrant data.\n \n\n   \n  “It was awesome. I saw so many different races and nationalities — I wasn’t the only one,” Alejandra said. “Compared to Iowa, I wasn’t highlighted as ‘she is not from here.’”\n \n\n   \n  Her parents, who are also undocumented, own a home and pay taxes. They’ve seen their children and grandchildren grow up and enjoyed taking them to the park or baseball games.\n \n\n   \n  With animosity toward immigrants on the rise in the US and Nebraska, Alejandra says her parents will soon leave the country as they plan to self-deport to Mexico in six months. They are afraid to be detained and worry the conditions at ICE facilities could jeopardize her mother’s fragile health.\n \n\n   \n  “They do not like living in fear,” Alejandra said.\n \n\n   \n  She’s not immune to that fear, and neither are her children. In recent weeks, Alejandra gave her 13-year-old son instructions on what to do if anything were to happen to her as they drove to the grocery store.\n \n\n   \n  “’Mom, you stay in the car and I’ll go inside. I’ll get everything that we need. And if anything happens, you go, but you drive away,’” Alejandra recalled her son telling her. “I know who to call.”\n \n\n   \n  As she looks towards the future, Alejandra wonders what kind of future awaits her young sons, especially if the Nebraska she knows continues to transform and align with Trump’s anti-immigration rhetoric. Like her parents, Alejandra says she may be forced to leave the state, and everything she knows, in exchange for a stable and happy life.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/health/fluoride-supplement-restrictions-fda","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"17:14:00Z","title":"FDA Moves to Restrict Fluoride Supplements as Part of MAHA Agenda","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has restricted the use of prescription fluoride supplements for children under age 3 and older children at low or moderate risk of tooth decay, following a directive from the Make American Healthy Again (MAHA) Commission.

But experts broadly emphasize the safety and benefits of fluoride.\n \n\n   \n  Fluoride is a mineral that can be found naturally in some foods and groundwater. It can help prevent tooth decay by strengthening the protective outer layer of enamel that can be worn away by acids formed by bacteria, plaque and sugars in the mouth.\n \n\n   \n  The practice of adding fluoride to public water systems started in the United States in 1945 to help improve oral health in a cost-effective and equitable way. The CDC named fluoridation of drinking water  one of the 10 greatest health interventions in America  in the 20th century alongside vaccination, family planning and safer workplaces.\n \n\n   \n  Most US residents live in a community where fluoride is added to public drinking water, according to  federal data  from 2022. In places where fluoride is not in the water, fluoride tablets or drops may be prescribed for babies and children to reduce the risk of tooth decay — and reliance on fluoride supplements could become more common, as Utah and Florida became the first states to  ban the practice  of adding fluoride to drinking water and similar legislation has been introduced in several other states.\n \n\n   \n  In April, the US Department of Health and Human Services and the US Environmental Protection Agency Administration  announced  that they would study the science to make a new recommendation on fluoride. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has also said he will tell the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to stop recommending fluoridation for drinking water in communities.\n \n\n   \n  The FDA launched a ”safety review and public comment period” on the issue in ​May,   ﻿and a  strategy report  from the MAHA Commission – with an agenda spearheaded by Kennedy – specifically named fluoride supplements as an issue to investigate, along with vaccine injuries and exposures to pesticides and microplastics.\n \n\n   \n  In the resulting  scientific evaluation , published Friday, the agency concluded that fluoride supplements “should not be used in children under age 3 or by older children who are not at high risk of tooth decay.”\n \n\n   \n  “For the same reason fluoride may work to kill bacteria on teeth, it may also alter the gut microbiome, which may have broader health implications,” the agency said in a news release.\n \n\n   \n  “There are better ways to protect children’s teeth than taking unapproved ingestible fluoride, which is now recognized to alter the gut microbiome. The microbiome is increasingly recognized to be central to a child’s health and development,” FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary said in the release.\n \n\n   \n  The FDA on Friday also referenced “preliminary but potentially concerning” data about the risks that fluoride can have for children’s intellectual development. A  meta-analysis published earlier this year , which would become the basis for further federal investigation, concluded that IQ drops as fluoride levels rise. But some experts have raised concerns about biases in the analysis and emphasized that it focused on levels of fluoride that are far higher than most people are exposed to.\n \n\n   \n  As water fluoridation starts to roll back in some communities, experts say that protecting the option to use prescription supplements is key. In fact, the legislation in Utah that banned the addition of fluoride to the public drinking water included provisions to expand access to prescription fluoride — and  prescriptions spiked  after the change.\n \n\n   \n  For some oral health advocates, the latest action from the FDA is a win simply because it is not an outright ban.\n \n\n   \n  “We are actually quite pleased about this decision, because fluoride supplements remain available and will continue to be a benefit to oral health,” said Dr. James Bekker, a pediatric dentist from Utah who spoke at public meeting to discuss the risks and benefits of the prescription fluoride supplements in July.\n \n\n   \n  “We feel that the decision of the FDA to continue making fluoride supplements available is an indication that all of the input generated from health professionals was heard and considered in their decision,” Bekker said in an email to CNN on Friday. “Providers can prescribe according to their consultation with parents and patients at recommended levels. We still recommend starting fluoride supplements at age 6 months in non-fluoridated water communities and will rely on knowledgeable health professionals to follow the documented science as they consider appropriate ages and dosages.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/pentagon-strikes-pacific-drug-trafficking","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"10:35:00-10:35","title":"Pentagon Shifts to Pacific Strikes Seeking Stronger Link Between Targets and US Drug Trafficking","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Pentagon has shifted its military strike operations from the Caribbean Sea to the eastern Pacific Ocean to better target drug trafficking routes linked to Colombia and Mexico, where intelligence suggests stronger ties to U.S. cocaine markets.

Pentagon shifts to Pacific strikes seeking stronger link between targets and US drug trafficking \n       \n  By Natasha Bertrand, Zachary Cohen, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:35 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Pentagon has deliberately shifted its strategy in recent weeks to striking suspected narcotraffickers in the eastern Pacific Ocean, rather than the Caribbean Sea, because administration officials believe they have stronger evidence linking cocaine transport to the US from those western routes, according to people familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  The intelligence suggests that cocaine is far more likely to be trafficked from Colombia or Mexico, rather than Venezuela, the sources said, raising more questions about the true purpose of the US military buildup in the Caribbean Sea.\n \n\n   \n  The last four US military strikes targeting suspected drug smugglers were carried out in the eastern Pacific, according to Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, and sources said that future attacks are likely to be concentrated in that area because of the stronger link to US markets.\n \n\n   \n  By contrast, there have been questions about whether every boat struck by the US in the Caribbean was actually heading toward, or sending drugs to, the US. After the first boat strike in September, for example, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the vessel had likely been headed toward Trinidad and Tobago.\n \n\n   \n  Venezuela is also not known to be a major source of cocaine for the US market, but the Trump administration has been aggressively trying to link Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro to the drug trade while accumulating a huge military presence near Caracas.\n \n\n   \n  “At the direction of the President, the Department of War is taking the fight to the cartels and defending our Homeland from Designated Terrorist Organization’s illicit activities before their violence and poison reaches our shores – this includes all of our nation’s borders,” a Pentagon official told CNN. “The Department’s newly established counter-narcotics Joint Task Force is expanding efforts on both the East and West Coasts to counter illicit drug trafficking by narco-terrorists using maritime routes.”\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has not provided Congress with evidence to back up its claims that the 15 vessels the military has struck since September in both the Caribbean and the Pacific, killing at least 61 people, were ferrying drugs and carrying known drug traffickers.\n \n\n   \n  During a classified briefing on Capitol Hill this week, Pentagon officials also told lawmakers they do not know how to gauge success in the ongoing military campaign, according to a source familiar with the closed-door session.\n \n\n   \n  “They don’t know whether there’s any data or metrics that would show (the strikes are) impeding the flow of drugs, whether there has been an increase in the price due to higher demand or lower supply, like there’s just no information,” the source said. “None of the briefers could say what they’re going to do when the traffickers change their tactics. None of them could say how they’re addressing air and land routes.”\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Rep. Sara Jacobs said following the briefing on Thursday that administration officials confirmed that they do not necessarily know the individual identities of each person on board a vessel before they attack it.\n \n\n   \n  “They said that they do not need to positively identify individuals on the vessel to do the strikes,” Jacobs said, adding that the administration did not want to detain or try survivors in court, “because they could not satisfy the evidentiary burden.” The US military briefly held and then repatriated two survivors of one of its strikes earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  Military officials also told lawmakers on Thursday that the strikes were targeting cocaine, not fentanyl.\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump told a collection of senior military brass assembled during an  unusual event in Virginia last month  that the strikes were primarily targeting fentanyl transporting ships.\n \n\n   \n  “These boats, they’re stacked up with bags of white powder, that’s mostly fentanyl and other drugs too,” he said. “Every boat kills 25,000.”\n \n\n   \n  Fentanyl killed more than double the number of Americans than cocaine did in 2023, according to  US government data . By Trump’s math, the campaign against alleged drug boats thus far should prevent roughly 375,000 deaths, or slightly more than the total population of Cleveland.\n \n\n   \n  Jacobs said the briefers insisted that cocaine is a “facilitating drug of fentanyl but it was not a satisfactory answer for most of us.”\n \n\n   \n  “None of them could say what they’re doing for fentanyl,” said the source familiar with the briefing. “Fentanyl is the real problem here, and they’re actually not addressing fentanyl in any of these operations.”\n \n\n   \n  Democrats and Republicans also want a better explanation of the legal justification for the strikes, but military lawyers have been conspicuously absent from recent congressional briefings. The legal counsel to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was supposed to brief lawmakers on Thursday but pulled out after it became clear that lawyers from the defense secretary’s office were given a “pass” at attending, sources told CNN. Without the lawyers there, Democrats said the briefers could not fully answer their questions about the legality of the strikes.\n \n\n   \n  “They didn’t even show up with the lawyers,” Democratic Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts said after the briefing. “They canceled at the last minute.”\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth told reporters on Friday while traveling in Asia that he had engaged with Congress on a bipartisan basis about the strikes. But also on Friday, the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Republican Sen. Roger Wicker and Democratic Sen. Jack Reed, publicly released two letters they’d written to Hegseth over the last month seeking clarity on the operations, both of which have gone unanswered, the lawmakers said.\n \n\n   \n  The letters requested the execute orders for the US military strikes on the boats, and the Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel opinion that CNN has reported the administration is leaning on to legally justify the strikes. Some Republican senators were shown the OLC memo by administration officials during a briefing on Wednesday, infuriating Democrats who were not invited to the briefing and have still not seen document.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner called the move “a partisan stunt” that “is a slap in the face to Congress’ war powers responsibilities and to the men and women who serve this country.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/poll-numbers-trump-fact-check","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"17:05:00Z","title":"Fact check: Trump’s false claims about his poll numbers","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump made false claims about having the highest ever poll numbers and the best numbers for any president in many years, despite multiple polling averages showing a significant decline in his national approval since the start of his second term.

But Trump also said two things about his popularity that are not even close to true.\n \n\n   \n  He said, “I have my highest poll numbers that I’ve ever had.” And he said, “I have the best numbers for any president in many years – any president.”\n \n\n   \n    Trump’s approval is down markedly from his second-term peak\n \n\n   \n  In reality, polls show that Americans’ approval of Trump has declined significantly since the beginning of his second term in late January. Multiple polling averages confirm that Trump’s poll numbers are nowhere in the ballpark of their highest-ever levels.\n \n\n   \n   A New York Times average  put Trump’s net approval at negative-11 points as of Tuesday: 43% approval and 54% disapproval. That is down a  net 20 points  from the first week of the term, when Trump was at positive-9 points – 52% approval and 43% disapproval.  CNN’s Poll of Polls  average, updated Wednesday, has Trump’s net approval at negative-15 points (41% approval and 56% disapproval), down a net 14 points from our first average of the term in early February.\n \n\n   \n  Other polling averages also show large drops in Trump’s standing since the beginning of the term.\n \n\n   \n  An  average produced by G. Elliott Morris , co-founder of the polling data website  FiftyPlusOne.news , put Trump’s net approval at roughly negative-14 points as of Tuesday, down about a net 26 points from the first days of the term. An  average produced by data journalist Nate Silver  put Trump’s net approval at roughly negative-10 points as of Tuesday, down about a net 22 points from the first days of the term.\n \n\n   \n  The White House didn’t respond to a CNN request for comment for this article.\n \n\n   \n  It’s worth noting that Trump does continue to have  extremely high   approval   among Republicans , often in the vicinity of 90%. But he never said Tuesday that he was talking about his popularity with his own party rather than the country as a whole, and he is not at a personal record high even among Republicans in particular.\n \n\n   \n    Many other presidents had far better numbers\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s current poll numbers are nowhere close to “the best numbers for any president in many years,” even if you ignore the fact that they’re not even his own best numbers in many years.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s current low standing – a negative net approval, with approval specifically in the low-40s – clearly does not approach the  approval  peaks   of recent predecessors. President Barack Obama hit 69% approval in the early days of his first term, according to tracking by polling firm Gallup, while President George W. Bush hit 90% approval in the wake of the terror attacks of September 11, 2001. Even President Joe Biden, who struggled with weak poll numbers for much of his term, was up at 57% approval in both January 2021 and April 2021.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s claim is also wrong even if he was referring specifically to other presidents’ poll numbers on the same date of a term.\n \n\n   \n  Biden had low net approval on the equivalent day of his term, but it was still better than Trump’s in both  Morris’s average  and  Silver’s average . And Trump’s boast about beating “any president in many years” clearly suggested he was comparing himself to other presidents in addition to Biden; the data shows that  every other person elected president after World War II  had better poll numbers than Trump on the equivalent date in their ​first term, in both net approval and approval alone.\n \n\n   \n  Silver’s  historical tracking  shows that, on the date Trump made this claim while having a roughly negative-10 net approval, Obama had about a positive-9 net approval in his first term, George W. Bush about positive-76, President Bill Clinton positive-2, President George H.W. Bush about positive-38, President Ronald Reagan about positive-20, President Jimmy Carter about positive-24, President Richard Nixon about positive-27, President John F. Kennedy about positive-65, President Dwight D. Eisenhower about positive-45, and President Harry Truman about positive-41.\n \n\n   \n  It would be fair to point out that Trump is serving a (non-consecutive) second term rather than a first term. But that added context doesn’t make Trump’s assertion correct. Gallup, which  assessed presidential approval on a quarter-by-quarter basis , found that, other than Nixon, Trump had a lower average approval in his 19th quarter as president – the third quarter of the second term, running from July 20 through October 19 – than any president elected to two terms from at least Eisenhower in the 1950s onward.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Ariel Edwards-Levy contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/health/state-medicaid-undocumented-immigrants-kff-health-news","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"17:22:00-04:00","title":"Trump’s HHS Orders State Medicaid Programs to Help Find Undocumented Immigrants","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration has ordered state Medicaid programs to verify the immigration status of enrolled individuals, resulting in over 170,000 names being shared across five states and Washington, D.C.

But the administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Mehmet Oz, said in a post on the social platform X on Oct. 31 that more than $1 billion “of federal taxpayer dollars were being spent on funding Medicaid for illegal immigrants” in five states and Washington, D.C.\n \n\n   \n  Medicaid’s overall spending topped $900 billion in fiscal year 2024.\n \n\n   \n  It wasn’t clear from Oz’s statement or an accompanying video over what period the spending happened, and CMS spokespeople did not immediately respond to questions, either for an earlier version of this article or after Oz’s statement was posted.\n \n\n   \n  Only U.S. citizens and some lawfully present immigrants are eligible for Medicaid, which covers low-income and disabled people, and the closely related Children’s Health Insurance Program. Those without legal status are ineligible for federally funded health coverage, including Medicaid, Medicare, and plans through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces.\n \n\n   \n  At least one state said it disagreed with Oz’s comments.\n \n\n   \n  “Our payments for coverage of undocumented individuals are in accordance with state and federal laws,” said Marc Williams, a spokesperson for Colorado’s Department of Health Care Policy & Financing, which administers the state’s Medicaid program. “The $1.5 million number referenced by federal leaders today is based on an incorrect preliminary finding, and has been refuted with supporting data by our Department experts.”\n \n\n   \n  He added: “It is disappointing that the administration is announcing this number as final when it is clearly overstated and the conversations are very much in the education and discussion phase.”\n \n\n   \n  In August, CMS began sending states the names of people enrolled in Medicaid that the agency suspected might not be eligible, demanding state Medicaid agencies check their immigration status.\n \n\n   \n  KFF Health News in October reached out to Medicaid agencies in 10 states. Five provided the approximate number of names they had received from the Trump administration, with expectations of more to come: Colorado had been given about 45,000 names, Ohio 61,000, Pennsylvania 34,000, Texas 28,000, and Utah 8,000. More than 70 million people are enrolled in Medicaid.\n \n\n   \n  Most of those states declined to comment further. Medicaid agencies in California, Florida, Georgia, New York, and South Carolina refused to say how many names they were ordered to review or did not respond.\n \n\n   \n  Oz said in his X post that California had misspent $1.3 billion on care for people not eligible for Medicaid, while Illinois spent $30 million, Oregon $5.4 million, Washington state $2.4 million, Washington, D.C., $2.1 million, and Colorado $1.5 million.\n \n\n   \n  “We notified the states, and many have begun refunding the money,” he said. “But what if we had never asked?”\n \n\n   \n  Washington, D.C.’s Medicaid director, Melisa Byrd, said CMS had identified administrative expenses for the district program that covers people regardless of immigration status that should not have been billed to the federal government and her agency has already fixed some of those areas. “We run a big program that is very complex and when mistakes or errors happen, we fix them,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The program plans to pay $654,014 back to CMS by mid-November.\n \n\n   \n  All five states, plus Washington, D.C., are led by Democrats, and President Donald Trump didn’t win any of them in the 2024 election.\n \n\n   \n  In recent days, Deputy Health and Human Services Secretary Jim O’Neill  began posting pictures  on X of people he said are convicted criminals living in the U.S. without authorization who had received Medicaid benefits.\n \n\n   \n  O’Neill could not be reached for comment.\n \n\n   \n  “We are very concerned because this seems, frankly, to be a waste of state resources and furthers the administration’s anti-immigrant agenda,” said Ben D’Avanzo, senior health advocacy strategist with the National Immigration Law Center, an advocacy group. “This duplicates what states already do,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  As part of the administration’s crackdown on people in the U.S. without authorization, President Donald Trump in February directed federal agencies to take action to ensure they are not obtaining benefits in violation of federal law.\n \n\n   \n  In June, advisers to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ordered CMS to share information about Medicaid enrollees with the Department of Homeland Security, drawing a lawsuit by some states alarmed that the administration would use the information for its deportation campaign against unauthorized residents.\n \n\n   \n  In August, a federal judge ordered HHS to  stop sharing the information  with immigration authorities.\n \n\n   \n  State Medicaid agencies use databases maintained by the Social Security Administration and Department of Homeland Security to verify enrollees’ immigration status.\n \n\n   \n  If states need to go back to individuals to reverify their citizenship or immigration status, it could lead some to fall off the rolls unnecessarily — for example, if they don’t see a letter requesting paperwork or fail to meet a deadline to respond.\n \n\n   \n  “I am not sure that evidence suggests there really is a need for this” extra verification, said Marian Jarlenski, a health policy professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Public Health.\n \n\n   \n  Oz made clear that the Trump administration disagrees.\n \n\n   \n  “Whether willful or not, the states’ conduct highlights a terrifying reality: American taxpayers have been footing the bill for illegal immigrants’ Medicaid coverage, despite many Democrats and the media insisting otherwise,” Oz said in his X post.\n \n\n   \n  In an August press release, CMS said it would ask states to verify eligibility for enrollees whose immigration status could not be confirmed via federal databases. “We expect states to take quick action and will monitor progress on a monthly basis,” the agency said.\n \n\n   \n  Leonardo Cuello, a research professor at Georgetown University’s Center for Children and Families, called the CMS order to states “unprecedented” in the Medicaid program’s 60-year history.\n \n\n   \n  He said the federal government may have been unable to verify certain individuals’ immigration status because names were misspelled or outdated, such as when a beneficiary is identified by their maiden instead of married name. The names may also include people helped by Emergency Medicaid, a program that covers the cost of hospital emergency services, including labor and delivery, for people regardless of immigration status.\n \n\n   \n  “CMS is conducting pointless immigration status reviews for people whose hospital bills were paid by Emergency Medicaid,” Cuello said.\n \n\n   \n  Oz noted in his post that federal law “does permit states to use Medicaid dollars for emergency treatment, regardless of patients’ citizenship or immigration status,” and that states can “legally build Medicaid programs for illegal immigrants using their own state tax dollars, so long as no federal tax dollars are used.”\n \n\n   \n  The states Oz mentioned all  run their own  such programs.\n \n\n   \n  The verification checks create an added burden for state Medicaid agencies that are already busy preparing to implement the tax and policy law Trump signed in July. The measure, which Republicans call the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, makes many changes to Medicaid, including adding a work requirement in most states starting by 2027. The law also requires most states to more frequently check the eligibility of many adult Medicaid enrollees — at least twice a year.\n \n\n   \n  “I fear states may do unnecessary checks that create a burden for some enrollees who will lose health coverage who should not,” Cuello said. “It’s going to be a whole lot of work for CMS and states for very little pay dirt.”\n \n\n   \n  Cuello said the effort may have “greater political value than actual value.”\n \n\n   \n  Brandon Cwalina, a spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services, which runs Medicaid in the state, said the state already requires every Medicaid applicant to verify their citizenship or, where applicable, their eligible immigration status.\n \n\n   \n  However, he said, the directive issued by CMS “constitutes a new process, and DHS is carefully reviewing the list in order to take appropriate actions.”\n \n\n   \n  Oz did not name Pennsylvania, which Trump won in 2024, in his post.\n \n\n   \n  If a lawful resident does not have a Social Security number, the state confirms their legal status by checking a database from Homeland Security, as well as verifying specific immigration documents, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Other state Medicaid agencies said they also needed to regroup before reaching out to enrollees.\n \n\n   \n  “Our teams just received this notice and are working through a process by which we will perform these reviews,” Jennifer Strohecker, then Utah’s Medicaid director, told a state advisory board in August.\n \n\n   \n   Renuka Rayasam and Rae Ellen Bichell contributed reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/government-shutdown-billions-federal-aid-dries-up","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"16:59:00Z","title":"‘I feel guilty eating a meal’: Low-income families prepare to lose access to billions in federal aid","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the U.S. government shutdown enters its first month, low-income families across the country are facing severe hardship due to the suspension of critical federal aid programs.

By Isabelle Khurshudyan, Tami Luhby, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:59 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Annemarie King is eating only once a day, and her husband, Randall, is picking up extra shifts at the drywall factory where he works. They are among the nearly 42 million Americans preparing for their food stamp benefits to run dry in November because of the ongoing  government shutdown .\n \n\n   \n  The Kings, who live in Cincinnati and have eight young children, depend on the roughly $1,000 in food stamps that they receive at the start of every month to stock their refrigerator with fresh fruits, vegetables and meat.\n \n\n   \n  But since the US Department of Agriculture  announced in mid-October  that it doesn’t have the funding to provide next month’s benefits during the government shutdown, Annemarie, a stay-at-home mother, has been buying more canned and boxed items and preparing less for dinner.\n \n\n   \n  She’s also going without food herself. Her 11-year-old son has noticed, she said, but she tells him not to worry and that she ate while he was at school.\n \n\n   \n  “I feel guilty eating a meal,” Annemarie said. “I don’t want to take food away from them.”\n \n\n   \n  As the shutdown nears the one-month mark, it’s not just furloughed federal workers feeling the financial strain. Low-income households across the country will lose access to  key social safety net programs  in the coming days as billions of dollars in federal funding dries up.\n \n\n   \n  Beginning November 1, more than 65,000 children and families could lose access to Head Start programs, which provide early education and child development resources, according to the National Head Start Association. For some parents, that means they might have to quit their jobs because they won’t have child care anymore.\n \n\n   \n  Others are worried they might not get heat subsidies from the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program before the winter months. On top of that, roughly 24 million Americans who receive health insurance through the Affordable Care Act are preparing for what is likely to be a  significant increase  in premiums next year.\n \n\n   \n  In interviews with people in cities across the country, the early implications of the stop in federal funding for low-income families are starting to come into focus. Food banks and other charities are expecting higher demand, as millions face increasingly desperate situations without the programs they rely on.\n \n\n   \n  At the Kings’ household, the loss of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, means that instead of serving chicken, a fresh vegetable and either mashed potatoes or macaroni and cheese, Annemarie has been cooking chicken and canned green beans. Chilis, pastas and roasts are on the menu more often since they can last for a few days.\n \n\n   \n  “Our family is suffering because neither side will compromise,” Annemarie said of the stalemate on Capitol Hill.  “It’s no longer a Democrat thing, it’s no longer a Republican thing. It’s our lives.”\n \n\n   \n  The status of SNAP funding for November is currently uncertain, however. A federal judge in Boston indicated Thursday that she will intervene in a high-stakes fight between Democratic-led states and the Trump administration over its US Department of Agriculture’s decision to not tap into billions of dollars in emergency funds to provide benefits next month.\n \n\n   \n  However the judge rules, millions of Americans will not receive their food stamp benefits on time. An estimated 3 million people will be affected on November 1 alone, according to estimates from Code for America, which works with all levels of government to improve access to food assistance and other safety net programs.\n \n\n   \n   Food pantries  around the country are preparing for a surge in demand next week if people don’t receive their SNAP stipends. But food bank directors have warned that they can provide only a fraction of the meals that are supplied by federal assistance.\n \n\n   \n  And for some households, the loss of more than one of these programs has a compounding effect.\n \n\n   \n  In Hillsboro, Ohio – about an hour outside Cincinnati – the closure of the local Head Start program means Lauren Lowe, 42, will likely have to quit her job as a restaurant server. She and her husband were able to both work full time while their 4-year-old son, Carter, attended Head Start on weekdays.\n \n\n   \n  He and 176 other kids got meals and health care there. And he loved his friends and teachers, Lowe said. Since she’s had to tell him that this will be his last week in the program, Carter is “broken-hearted right now. He’s crying every single morning because he wants to be in school with his friends,” Lowe said.\n \n\n   \n  Lowe is feeling uneasy, too. Quitting her job means less income for the household – in addition to missing their food stamp benefits. \n \n\n   \n  “It’s really scary because, how do we make ends meet?” Lowe said. “I either stay home and school my child or figure out how we’re going to pay the bills to keep a roof over our heads and food on the table.”\n \n\n   \n  Lowe will also have to replace the two meals Carter was getting every day he was at Head Start.\n \n\n   \n  “On Monday mornings, kids do come in hungrier than usual, so we know they’re really dependent on that breakfast, lunch and snack we give them,” said Julia Wise, the executive director of the Highland County Community Action Organization, which runs the Hillsboro Head Start program. \n \n\n   \n  Wise said 45 Head Start staff will be furloughed on Monday. Other Head Start programs — particularly those run by larger entities, such as nonprofits, school districts and local governments — can limp along by drawing on community support or taking out lines of credit.\n \n\n   \n  In the Kansas City area, 17 programs with grants expiring on November 1 decided to take a “financial risk” by staying open, said Kasey Lawson, the Head Start director for the Mid-America Regional Council. The providers do not know if they will be reimbursed later when the new grant year is funded.\n \n\n   \n  In Hillsboro, teachers prepared homework packets that will take the kids through the end of November, so they can keep studying even when the program is closed. Some of that staff will likely   get other jobs before the government shutdown ends, meaning whenever Head Start does get funding again, it might not have enough educators to reopen all its classrooms, Wise said.\n \n\n   \n  For those who can’t find other work, “they’re going on furlough, they’re not going to have money coming in, so they could apply for SNAP benefits, but now SNAP is not going to be available either,” Wise said.\n \n\n   \n  “This is impacting us across the board,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  In rural Oregon, where the temperatures are already dipping below the freezing mark, the suspension of funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, is putting lives at risk, said Sheri Gutierrez, energy program manager at Community Action Program of East Central Oregon, a nonprofit that provides a range of services for residents in need.\n \n\n   \n  The $4 billion program, which helps nearly 6 million people pay their utility bills, is not in as immediate danger as SNAP and Head Start; the aid is typically distributed to utility companies between mid-November and early December.\n \n\n   \n  But barely a month into the season, Community Action in Oregon already has more than $200,000 in grant payments that are on hold until the government reopens. Many of its clients heat their homes with propane, wood and heating oil, and they don’t enjoy the same continuous service and shutoff protections available to many people who use electricity and natural gas to stay warm.\n \n\n   \n  The delay has worried local residents, some of whom are using old space heaters or their ovens, which Gutierrez says aren’t safe.\n \n\n   \n  “We hear the desperation when speaking to these clients on a daily basis. People want reassurance that they will get assistance,” she said. “LIHEAP is lifesaving. Without heat, they won’t survive.”\n \n\n   \n  In Lakeville, Minnesota, Ronda Beck is also waiting for help from LIHEAP to cover the electric bill. After speaking with her utility company “at great length,” Beck was told she could pay whatever she can until her grant is funded and she won’t be disconnected. But she’s not sure how she’ll scrape together a couple of bucks since she’s not working.\n \n\n   \n  “Where do I get $5 from?” She said. “It’s a tough situation.”\n \n\n   \n  Beck figured she could survive on groceries she picks up from her local food pantries if she and her adult son stop receiving food stamps next month – that is until she found out on Tuesday that one of the groups is only providing two or three days of food, instead two weeks’ worth. Now, she’s terrified.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t want to go hungry,” said Beck, who along with her son is looking for jobs in Lakeville, Minnesota, where they live. “I don’t want to walk into [a food pantry] and have them say, ‘We’re at our limit’.”\n \n\n   \n  Just outside Washington DC, Willissa Bullock worries about her food bank running out, as it’s dealing with a surge in demand from furloughed federal workers in the area. When the Landover, Maryland, resident heard that the USDA would not issue benefits next month, Bullock says she cried – nervous about how she would provide for her kids, who are in college.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this week, Bullock left a local food pantry run by No Limits Outreach Ministries with only enough items – including lettuce, apple juice, and canned goods – to last two or three days. Until recently, her shopping cart would be overflowing.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m telling the kids to look for jobs,” said Bullock, who is unemployed and applying for disability after having back surgery. “It’s the only way we’ll be able to eat.”\n \n\n   \n  The food pantry has been receiving fewer shipments from Capital Area Food Bank after two  Covid 19-era relief programs  were canceled earlier this year. The pantry used to be able to offer meat, fish, eggs and milk to its clients, but now it mostly has beans, rice and canned foods, said Oliver Carter, pastor of No Limits Outreach Ministries.\n \n\n   \n  “Our storage used to be full and now it’s almost empty,” Carter said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/jeffrey-epstein-financial-records-unsealed-jp-morgan","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"17:00:00Z","title":"Newly Unsealed Epstein Records Shed Light on Years of His Financial Transactions with Wall Street Figures","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Newly unsealed court records reveal that JPMorgan Chase filed over $1 billion in suspicious activity reports (SARs) between 2002 and 2019 regarding Jeffrey Epstein’s financial transactions, including links to Russian banks Alfa Bank and Sberbank, and high-profile individuals such as Leon Black and Jes Staley.

\nUpdated: \n        5:16 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  One month after  Jeffrey Epstein  died in a jail cell while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges, JPMorgan Chase   reported to   US authorities of more than one billion dollars in transactions it viewed as suspicious, according to newly unsealed court records.\n \n\n   \n  The notification was made on September 26, 2019, in a suspicious activity report, which is a kind of confidential report financial institutions file with the Treasury Department to flag potentially nefarious activity.\n \n\n   \n  JPMorgan’s report highlights over $1 billion in transactions Epstein engaged in from October 2003 until July 2019 with numerous related companies, Wall Street titans, his former lawyer and others. Two accounts included in the report were linked to Russian banks Alfa Bank and Sberbank.\n \n\n   \n  The bank wrote in the SAR it was flagging the transactions because of negative media about Epstein’s alleged sex trafficking of minors, media reports of allegations Epstein misappropriating money as an investment adviser, his use of multiple accounts, the Russian banks, and his relationships with two US presidents.\n \n\n   \n  Epstein was arrested in July 2019 and charged with sex trafficking underaged girls. He died weeks later by suicide in the Metropolitan Correctional Center while awaiting trial.\n \n\n   \n  Judge Jed Rakoff ordered the unsealing of the records, which were part of a lawsuit between the US Virgin Islands and JPMorgan Chase, following requests by The New York Times and Wall Street Journal. In 2023, JPMorgan Chase agreed to pay $290 million to settle a class action lawsuit from survivors of Epstein and an additional $75 million to settle with USVI, where Epstein owned an island. There was no admission of wrongdoing in these settlements.\n \n\n   \n  The documents are the latest in a slow release of materials tied to Epstein as public demand for accountability and transparency about Epstein has gone global. Thursday, Britain’s King Charles took the extraordinary step of stripping his brother Andrew of his prince title. The Justice Department remains under pressure to release more information about its investigation into Epstein, and House lawmakers are taking depositions for their investigation.\n \n\n   \n  Included in the hundreds of pages of unsealed documents are emails between Epstein and Jes Staley, a former top official at JPMorgan bank, who in 2021 resigned as head of Barclays bank following media scrutiny over his long relationship with Epstein. This year, Staley  said  he didn’t know about Epstein’s involvement with underaged girls but admitted in court that he had sex with one of Epstein’s assistants.\n \n\n   \n  Among the pages are emails between Epstein and Staley, with Epstein suggesting he could set up meetings for Staley to recruit new clients including the co-founders of Google and heads of nations.  None of the individuals were accused of any wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  Prior to Epstein’s death in 2019, JPMorgan filed a number of SARs involving the disgraced financier’s accounts, and the documents show banking officials shared news articles about Epstein’s alleged activities. JPMorgan closed its accounts with Epstein in 2013, five years after Epstein pleaded guilty to state prostitution charges and reached a non-prosecution agreement with the US attorney’s office in the Southern District of Florida.\n \n\n   \n  The newly unsealed records include the SARs, including one dating as far back as 2002, as well as the last one filed in September 2019.\n \n\n   \n  “Generally, the only new material here is the SARs themselves. Those basically summarize financial information produced in litigation, much of which has been public for years. The SARs do confirm what’s been inferred all along: the bank filed SARs about Epstein early on, and specifically when it exited Epstein from the bank in 2013 – and repeatedly between 2013 and 2019, as required,” said Patricia Wexler, a spokesperson for JPMorgan Chase.   “It does not appear that anyone in the government or law enforcement acted on those SARs for years.”\n \n\n   \n  In the batch of documents, there’s a letter from the US attorney’s office for the Southern District of Florida which in 2007 sought records from Bear Stearns, one of Epstein’s banks that was later acquired by JPMorgan, as part of its then investigation into Epstein that resulted in the non-prosecution agreement.\n \n\n   \n  One of the biggest Wall Street names mentioned on the list of transactions on the 2019 SAR is Leon Black, a long-time associate of Epstein, who has maintained that Epstein gave him financial advice.\n \n\n   \n  “After an exhaustive investigation more than four years ago, the Dechert law firm concluded that Mr. Black paid Epstein only for tax and estate planning advice that saved him and his family billions of dollars. To imply that Epstein somehow had influence over Mr. Black is false and patently absurd,” Susan Estrich, an attorney for Black, said in a statement. “Indeed, it was Mr. Black who fired Epstein because he was disruptive and believed the fees for his services were excessive. The Dechert Report also found that Mr. Black had no knowledge of Epstein’s criminal activities.”\n \n\n   \n  The unsealed records include emails between Staley and Epstein about meeting in 2010 with then Prince Andrew. The then-Prince emailed Staley, “Wishing you a very happy Christmas and New Year.”\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat, has asked JPMorgan for banking records and suggested officials turned a blind eye to Epstein’s conduct to make millions of dollars in fees from his accounts.\n \n\n   \n  In a recent response, the bank denied knowledge of Epstein’s activities, writing, “with the exception of former JPMC executive Jes Staley, the bank’s executives (current and former) are respected professionals who acted with integrity and would never have allowed Epstein to remain a client if they knew of his ongoing crimes.”\n \n\n   \n  “The Firm deeply regrets having had Epstein as a client and would never have continued doing business with him if it believed he engaged in ongoing criminal conduct,” the bank also said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/us/callout-snap-benefits-government-shutdown","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"15:05:00Z","title":"SNAP Benefits at Risk During Government Shutdown","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During a government shutdown, the US Department of Agriculture has announced it cannot pay $8 billion in SNAP benefits for November, putting millions of Americans—especially those with children, disabilities, or elderly family members—at risk of hunger and financial distress.

So, if he asked me to come meet with him, I’d be in London tomorrow,” Sky Roberts told CNN in an interview on Friday.\n \n\n   \n  His comments come after the King took the extraordinary decision to cast out his brother Andrew from the monarchy this week amid renewed public fury over his ties to the late convicted sex offender Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re actually getting some acknowledgement from the King and saying he stands with survivors,” Roberts said, adding that the King’s response had been more positive than that of US authorities. “I think we should take a moment of appreciation for that but also call to action – to take it that next step further into an investigation, and to expedite that.”\n \n\n   \n  Buckingham Palace declined to comment when asked about the idea of a meeting with Giuffre’s family.\n \n\n   \n  The statement released by Buckingham Palace on Thursday, which announced that Andrew would be  stripped of his titles  and honors, also said: “Their Majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN understands that the palace acted because while it acknowledges that Andrew continues to deny all allegations made against him, it had concluded that he made serious lapses of judgement.\n \n\n   \n  Giuffre, who died by suicide earlier this year, accused  the King’s brother Andrew  of sexually assaulting her while she was a teenager.

That needs to be released fully,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Asked if he would be willing to meet with Andrew as well as King Charles, Roberts said: “I don’t think there’s anything Andrew can say except for A) an extreme apology to my sister, and B) if he’s ready to come forward and actually give some sort of light to what has transpired in that inner circle” with Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.\n \n\n   \n  An expedited process of justice against Andrew would also involve “getting him out of his house,” Roberts said, addressing reports that the former prince will remain at the Royal Lodge in Windsor until after the holidays. “I think it shouldn’t be until Christmas.

after images on social media as he continues to put his touch on the  White House .\n \n\n   \n  “I renovated the Lincoln Bathroom in the White House. It was renovated in the 1940s in an art deco green tile style, which was totally inappropriate for the Lincoln Era,” Trump said on Truth Social. “I did it in black and white polished Statuary marble. This was very appropriate for the time of Abraham Lincoln and, in fact, could be the marble that was originally there!”\n \n\n   \n  The president posted about the renovations aboard Air Force One en route to Florida, where he will spend the weekend. The post comes as the government remains shutdown, and the Trump administration says it will not tap into emergency funds to fund SNAP food assistance benefits through the month of November.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after, Trump posted more images of the bathroom, showing gold detailing on the faucet and shower handle, as well as other fixtures. A plush white robe with presidential seal also hangs on a golden hook.\n \n\n   \n  The president discussed the changes he was making to the bathroom earlier this month during a dinner at the White House, saying in part that the old style of the bathroom “was not exactly Abe Lincoln.”\n \n\n   \n  “We have little things like at the Lincoln Bedroom. The bathroom was done by the Truman family and you know, long time ago. And it’s done in a green tile, and it’s done in a style that was not exactly Abe Lincoln,” the president said.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s actually Art Deco. And Art Deco doesn’t go with, you know, 1850 and Civil Wars…But what does do is statuary marble. So I ripped it apart and we built a bathroom. It’s absolutely gorgeous and totally in keeping with that time because the Lincoln bedroom is, uh, so incredible, for those of you that have seen it,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Trump on Friday also gave a status update on a separate construction project he’s overseeing at the Kennedy Center, which he said he “just inspected.”\n \n\n   \n  “The exterior columns, which were in serious danger of corrosion if something weren’t done, are completed, and look magnificent in White Enamel — Like a different place! Marble is being done, stages are being renovated, new seats, new chairs, and new fabrics will soon be installed, and magnificent high end carpeting throughout the building. It is happening faster than anticipated, one of my trademarks,” Trump said.\n \n\n   \n  “We are bringing this building back to life. It was dead as a doornail, but it will soon be beautiful again!” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The moves are part of Trump’s effort to put his stamp on the White House – which has seen a slew of changes since he took office – and the greater DC area.\n \n\n   \n   So far, the renovations include paving over the grass in the historic Rose Garden, demolishing the East Wing to make way for a new ballroom and adorning the Oval Office with gold.\n \n\n   \n  Trump often says the White House needed a new ballroom to host world leaders, to avoid situations where they are outside and a temporary tent has to be used when it rains. And he frequently remarked that the Rose Garden paving was necessary, because women in high heels would sink into the grass during events. It now has a touch of Mar-a-Lago with the same white and yellow umbrellas at tables on the patio.\n \n\n   \n  His  redecoration  of the Oval Office to his liking, as presidents do when they take office, has tripled the number of paintings on the walls with gold just about everywhere. Trump also installed portraits of every president framed in gold on the West Colonnade – except for former President Joe Biden who is instead represented by his autopen signature – and large floor-to-ceiling mirrors, which press can see when they are escorted into the Oval Office.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to those changes, Trump plans to build a  new arch monument  in DC in honor of the country’s 250th anniversary.\n \n\n   \n  As he pushes forward with his plans to leave his mark on the White House and the nation’s capital, Trump this week  fired the members  of the Commission of Fine Arts. The independent federal agency is charged with advising the president, Congress and the city of Washington, DC, on “matters of design and aesthetics.” The president has also installed allies on the National Capital Planning Commission, which will be tasked with approving plans for the new ballroom on White House grounds.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/middleeast/turkey-ski-resort-fire-sentence-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"16:26:00Z","title":"Turkish court sentences hotel owner and 10 others to life for deadly fire that killed 78","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Turkish court sentenced hotel owner Halit Ergul and 10 others to life in prison for severe negligence leading to a deadly fire at the Grand Kartal Hotel in Kartalkaya ski resort, Bolu, on January 21, 2025.

  3:11 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: Associated Press\n \n   \n  The UN human rights chief said Friday that US  military strikes  against boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean allegedly carrying illegal drugs from South America are “unacceptable” and must stop.\n \n\n   \n  The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights,  Volker Türk , called for an investigation into the strikes, in what appeared to mark the first such condemnation of its kind from a United Nations organization.\n \n\n   \n  Ravina Shamdasani, a spokeswoman for Türk’s office, relayed his message Friday at a regular UN briefing: “These attacks and their mounting human cost are unacceptable.

Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:52 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  A Republican-dominated Ohio panel adopted new US House districts on Friday that could boost the GOP’s chances of winning two additional seats in next year’s elections and aid President Donald Trump’s efforts to hold on to a slim congressional majority.\n \n\n   \n  The action by the Ohio Redistricting Commission came as  Virginia’s  Democratic-led General Assembly advanced a proposed constitutional amendment that could pave the way for redistricting in the state ahead of congressional midterm elections next year. The Senate on Friday passed a resolution that would allow lawmakers to temporarily bypass a bipartisan redistricting commission and gerrymander their maps. The House had advanced it Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has been urging Republican-led states to reshape their US House districts in an attempt to win more seats. But unlike in other states, Ohio’s redistricting was required by the state constitution because the current districts were adopted after the 2020 census without bipartisan support.\n \n\n   \n  Ohio joins Texas, Missouri and North Carolina, where Republican lawmakers already have revised their congressional districts.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats have been pushing back. California voters are deciding Tuesday on a redistricting plan passed by the Democratic-led legislature.\n \n\n   \n  The political parties are in an intense battle. Democrats need to gain just three seats in next year’s election to win control of the House and gain the power to impede Trump’s agenda.\n \n\n   \n  In Ohio, Republicans already hold 10 of 15 congressional seats. The new map could boost Republican chances in already competitive districts currently held by Democratic Reps. Greg Landsman in Cincinnati and Marcy Kaptur near Toledo. Kaptur won a 22nd term last year by about 2,400 votes, or less than 1 percentage point, in a district carried by Trump. Landsman was reelected with more than 54% of the vote.\n \n\n   \n    Ohio residents criticize new map\n \n\n   \n  Ohio’s commission had faced a Friday deadline to adopt a new map, or else the task would have fallen to the GOP-led legislature, which could have crafted districts even more favorable to Republicans. But any redistricting bill passed by the legislature could have been subject to an initiative petition campaign from opponents seeking to force a public referendum on the new map.\n \n\n   \n  The uncertainty of that legislative process provided commissioners of both parties with some incentive for compromise. All seven commissioners — five Republicans and two Democrats — voted for the new map.\n \n\n   \n  But Ohio residents who testified to commissioners Friday denounced the new districts. Julia Cattaneo, who wore a shirt saying “gerrymandering is cheating,” said the new map is gerrymandered more for Republicans than the one it is replacing and is not the sort of compromise needed.\n \n\n   \n  “Yes, you are compromising — your integrity, honor, duty and to represent Ohioans,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Added resident Scott Sibley: “This map is an affront to democracy, and you should all — every one of you — be ashamed.”\n \n\n   \n  Republican state Auditor Keith Farber, a member of the commission, defended the map during a testy exchange with one opponent. Because many Democrats live in cities and many Republicans in rural areas, he said there was no way to draw a map creating eight Republican and seven Democratic districts — as some had urged — without splitting cities, counties and townships.\n \n\n   \n    Virginia Democrats point at Trump to defend redistricting\n \n\n   \n  Virginia is represented in the US House by six Democrats and five Republicans. Democratic lawmakers haven’t unveiled their planned new map, nor how many seats they are trying to gain, but said their moves are necessary to respond to the Trump-inspired gerrymandering in Republican-led states.\n \n\n   \n  “Our voters are asking to have that voice. They’re asking that we protect democracy, that we not allow gerrymandering to happen throughout the country, and we sit back,” said Democratic Sen. Barbara Favola.\n \n\n   \n  The proposed constitutional amendment would let lawmakers temporarily bypass a bipartisan commission and redraw congressional districts to their advantage. The measure would still need to pass the General Assembly again next year, then go before voters in a statewide referendum.\n \n\n   \n  The developments come as Virginia holds statewide elections Tuesday, where all 100 seats in the House of Delegates are on the ballot. Democrats would need to keep their slim majority in the lower chamber to advance the constitutional amendment next year.\n \n\n   \n  Republican Sen. Mark Obenshain said Democrats were ignoring the will of voters who had overwhelmingly approved a bipartisan redistricting commission.\n \n\n   \n  “Heaven forbid that we actually link arms and work together on something,” Obenshain said. “What the voters of Virginia said is, ‘We expect redistricting to be an issue that we work across the aisle on, that we link arms on.’”\n \n\n   \n  But Democratic Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, who has long championed the state’s bipartisan redistricting commission, noted the panel still would be in charge of redistricting after the 2030 census.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re not trying to end the practice of fair maps,” he said. “We are asking the voters if, in this one limited case, they want to ensure that a constitutional-norm-busting president can’t break the entire national election by twisting the arms of a few state legislatures.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/media/gayle-king-cbs-news-bari-weiss-ellison","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"13:54:00-20:00","title":"CBS News Roiled by Rumors, With Gayle King’s Future the Latest Flashpoint","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"CBS News is in the midst of a significant internal crisis driven by speculation about leadership changes, including rumors that Gayle King may leave 'CBS Mornings' and that Bari Weiss, the newly appointed editor-in-chief, may reshape the news division.

But each story adds to the uncertainty and unease in the air. The latest one is about Gayle King, with Variety  reporting  that she is “expected to depart” her longtime TV home, “CBS Mornings,” next year.\n \n\n   \n  If that’s the case, it would be news to King, whose contract doesn’t expire for another six months. She  told TMZ on Friday  morning: “All I’ve been told by everybody in this building is that they want me here, they like the job I’ve been doing… What I’m hearing in the building is not what I’m reading in the press.”\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the CBS News management team is in whack-a-mole mode, trying to tamp down the speculation — and probably trying to avoid any potential blowback from viewers.\n \n\n   \n  All the instability stems from David Ellison’s recent takeover of Paramount and  his decision to appoint  Bari Weiss as the editor-in-chief of CBS News.\n \n\n   \n  Weiss, the entrepreneurial and opinionated co-founder of The Free Press website, is an irresistible story to the media chattering classes. People both inside and outside CBS are desperate to know what she’s going to change at the storied news division.\n \n\n   \n  Weiss, who has been on the job for just a few weeks, has been frustrated about the leaks relating to her arrival, according to a recent  New York Times report .\n \n\n   \n  She certainly deserves time and space to get to know CBS News and think through potential changes. But just this week, there have been stories about who Weiss may or may not want to keep at “60 Minutes;” who she may or may not want to hire for the “CBS Evening News;” and now, what might happen to the morning show.\n \n\n   \n  “You know the old adage: Nobody knows anything,” a CBS source remarked, pointing out that all the speculation is destabilizing in the meantime.\n \n\n   \n  The news division also  laid off about one hundred people  earlier this week, though the cuts were foreshadowed months ago, well before Weiss was hired.\n \n\n   \n    The morning show intrigue\n \n\n   \n  The CBS weekday morning show has undergone multiple permutations over the past decade, and King has been the central player throughout, helming the show while other co-hosts have come and gone.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday night, Variety reporters Matt Donnelly and Brian Steinberg wrote that King is “expected to depart” the show and “may shift to a different role at the news division,” potentially with “a deal to produce her own programming for the network.”\n \n\n   \n  The pair also wrote that “negotiations are about to ensue,” which left some CBS staffers wondering: Is someone prematurely leaking that King is departing, and if so, why? Or is King privately telling people that she wants out, no matter what CBS offers?\n \n\n   \n  All the broadcast networks have been trying to lower salary costs in recent years, so there is little doubt that CBS would want King to accept a pay cut to stay at the network in any capacity.\n \n\n   \n  CBS responded forcefully to the Variety article, saying, “There have been no discussions with Gayle about her contract that runs through May 2026.” (And King told TMZ on Friday, “I am not going to negotiate in the media.”)\n \n\n   \n  It is highly unusual for a network to say when a star’s contract is up, but it showed that the typical window for negotiations hasn’t even opened yet.\n \n\n   \n  As Variety noted, “Moving King is a risky maneuver, especially because morning-TV is built on the relationships viewers build with the hosts.”\n \n\n   \n  That’s likely why CBS said in its statement that King is “a truly valued part of CBS and we look forward to engaging with her about the future.”\n \n\n   \n  Her co-host on the morning show, Nate Burleson, also commented personally on Instagram, reflecting how the uncertainty is weighing on staffers at the network.\n \n\n   \n  “I hope this rumor doesn’t hold up,” he wrote, calling King “a fixture, a force, and a part of the fabric of ‘CBS Mornings.’”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/us/jetblue-flight-emergency-landing-florida","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"14:02:00Z","title":"At least 15 people sent to hospital after JetBlue flight drops altitude, forcing emergency landing in Florida, officials say","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A JetBlue flight (Flight 1230) en route from Cancun, Mexico, to Newark, New Jersey, experienced a sudden drop in altitude of about 100 feet in seven seconds around 1:48 p.m. ET, prompting an emergency landing at Tampa International Airport.

It was not immediately clear if weather was a factor in the flight’s altitude drop.\n \n\n   \n    A ‘flight control issue’\n \n\n   \n  While it’s unclear why the plane dropped in altitude, pilots told air traffic control the plane had experienced “a flight control issue,” audio from  LiveATC.net  indicates.\n \n\n   \n  Flight control failure is not without precedent for the Airbus A320, which has what’s called fly-by-wire controls: Control inputs from the pilot run through computers to trigger movements of the plane’s control surfaces.\n \n\n   \n  While the system is quite redundant, a failure about 30 years ago of the computer controlling an Airbus A320’s elevator – which controls its pitch: the up and down movement of the nose and tail – caused a Northwest Airlines plane to dive a hundred feet without any command from the pilots. The NTSB investigated that incident.\n \n\n   \n  As air traffic controllers on Thursday guided the JetBlue flight into Tampa, pilots reported injuries, including a possible “laceration in the head,” the audio indicates.\n \n\n   \n  Some 15 to 20 people aboard the plane were evaluated and taken to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, Tampa Fire Rescue spokesperson Vivian Shedd said.\n \n\n   \n  Two children and 12 adults were taken to Tampa’s St. Joseph’s Hospital with minor injuries, and all have been discharged, a hospital spokesperson said. No further details about injuries were available.\n \n\n   \n  “Our team has taken the aircraft out of service for inspection, and we will conduct a full investigation to determine the cause,” JetBlue said in its statement. “The safety of our customers and crewmembers is always our first priority, and we will work to support those involved.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Martin Goillandeau contributed to this reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/sport/tennis-joao-fonseca-profile-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"14:34:00Z","title":"Teenage tennis star and 'generational talent' João Fonseca tempering power with patience as he ascends the sport","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"João Fonseca, a 19-year-old Brazilian tennis star, has risen rapidly through the ATP rankings, winning two titles in 2025 including a major ATP 500 title in Basel, where he showcased a record-breaking 81 mph forehand.

sport \n       \n  By George Ramsay, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:34 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Ever since he first picked up a  tennis  racket,  João Fonseca  has shown a penchant for power – even if it came with mixed results.\n \n\n   \n  “I was the kind of kid that destroyed the ball,” says Fonseca. “Sometimes, it would go into the fence; sometimes, it would go straight to the floor; and then, sometimes, we’re doing a winner.”\n \n\n   \n  That approach – fearless, furious and unrestrained – has stayed with the Brazilian into his professional career, and today, his ripping forehand is one of the most breathtaking sights in men’s tennis.\n \n\n   \n  Few players can match the 19-year-old Fonseca when it comes to  raw power , particularly on the forehand wing. This not-so-subtle, not-so-secret weapon has guided him to two ATP Tour titles this year, including in the Swiss city of Basel last week.\n \n\n   \n  There, Fonseca thumped 29 winners to see off Spain’s Alejandro Davidovich Fokina in the final, while his average forehand speed was clocked at 81 miles per hour. For comparison, top players  usually average  around 75.\n \n\n   \n  “I think my coach was really the first one that said: ‘Keep with this aggression,’” Fonseca tells  CNN Sports  about his all-out approach. “‘Keep doing this, but at the same time, let’s work with being more solid.’\n \n\n   \n  “During these last years, I understood that you can’t hit the ball hard every time … Sometimes, it’s a stupid idea, of course, but sometimes, it’s good to be aggressive, to be courageous and have confidence in your shots.”\n \n\n   \n  Lifting the title in Basel saw Fonseca become the third-youngest ATP 500 winner since the format was introduced in 2009, as well as the tournament’s youngest winner since Jim Courier in 1989.\n \n\n   \n  Still a teenager, Fonseca’s potential is huge, his freakish power likely to become more of a threat as he develops and refines his game. To some, he is destined to join  Carlos Alcaraz  and  Jannik Sinner  – by far and away the standout players in men’s tennis this year – at the very top of the game.\n \n\n   \n  “The Brazilian Blaster (Fonseca) is a generational talent as I said 2 years ago and will be right there someday with the Italian Flamethrower (Sinner) and Spanish Magician (Alcaraz),” Rick Macci, the former coach to Serena Williams,  wrote  on X recently.\n \n\n   \n  Those players, Macci added, will “create a new big three” to replace Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic.\n \n\n   \n  Davidovich Fokina spoke along the same lines during his runner-up speech in Basel, telling Fonseca that he is “for sure going to be the next Nole (Djokovic) to beat Carlos and Jannik.”\n \n\n   \n  After winning last year’s Next Gen ATP Finals title – a tournament featuring the world’s best players under 20 – Fonseca turned heads at the Australian Open in January with a straight-sets victory over ninth seed Andrey Rublev.\n \n\n   \n  He followed that up by winning the Argentina Open a month later, becoming the second-youngest South American to win an ATP title in the Open Era.\n \n\n   \n  But Fonseca’s progress hasn’t been exponential. He failed to progress past the third round of a grand slam this year, perhaps a surprise after the enormous promise he showed at the start of the season.\n \n\n   \n  The victory in Basel, however, reaffirmed his status as one of the most explosive talents in the game, with Fonseca climbing 18 spots up the rankings to No. 28. That puts him well on track to fulfill his self-ascribed objectives for next year.\n \n\n   \n  “I think one of my goals is to be a seed, top 32 (at a grand slam),” says Fonseca. “It’s my personal goal. I’m working a lot to do it … let’s see how it goes.”\n \n\n   \n  To get to this level, Fonseca had to spend his formative years building a bond with tennis. As a young player, the game would make him feel restless, and he often found himself chasing big, haymaking shots on the court. He was even more impatient off it, unable to watch a full match without losing interest.\n \n\n   \n  That changed around 2019, when Fonseca sat absorbed as Novak Djokovic defeated Roger Federer in a  Wimbledon  final lasting four hours and 57 minutes – the longest final in the tournament’s history.\n \n\n   \n  A self-proclaimed Federer superfan, that match hurt Fonseca. As he started to enjoy tennis as a spectator, he would often watch the “Big 3” play out match after memorable match on the sport’s biggest stages, but it was the Swiss star who captivated him the most.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s my idol,” Fonseca confesses. Which goes some way to explaining why he suddenly found himself a sweaty, nervous wreck before meeting Federer for the first time in September.\n \n\n   \n  “We had a nice chat, about 10 minutes, and we talked a little bit about life, tour, how it is to live in Brazil and be far from home,” says Fonseca, adding: “He’s a super nice guy. You see these amazing players, these legends, as untouchable (and think): this guy is different. But no, he’s just a human being like us, super cool.\n \n\n   \n  “It was a very important moment; it’s going to be in my mind for my whole life.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s likely that the two might cross paths again, particularly given that Fonseca is sponsored by On – the sportswear company in which Federer has invested and helped with product development. The Brazilian was only 16 when he was signed by On and earmarked as a star in the making, joining a roster that includes six-time grand slam winner  Iga Świątek  and world No. 7  Ben Shelton .\n \n\n   \n  Several years earlier, Fonseca had made the decision to focus his sporting endeavors solely on tennis, not long after a  soccer  injury had left him sidelined for months.\n \n\n   \n  Like most kids growing up in Rio de Janeiro, soccer was, and still is, one of his great loves, even though his playing days have long since passed.\n \n\n   \n  “I was a good level,” says Fonseca. “I’m a lefty leg, I had some skills, but nothing serious. I wouldn’t be professional or whatever. Fortunately, I stayed with tennis.”\n \n\n   \n  After reaching the quarterfinals of last year’s Rio Open aged 17, Fonseca decided to forego his college eligibility – he was holding a place at the University of Virginia – and turn professional.\n \n\n   \n  Since then, his march up the world rankings has been steady, quickly earning him an army of dedicated fans. Fonseca’s matches are some of the loudest on tour, and regardless of whether he’s playing in Brazil or further afield, yellow-and-green-clad spectators are guaranteed whenever he’s on a tennis court.\n \n\n   \n  It’s taken time, Fonseca admits, to grow accustomed to playing in front of such raucous crowds.\n \n\n   \n  “At the beginning, I was super nervous,” he says. “I needed to win, and there are people watching me, there are people cheering for me. The culture of Brazil is super loud, a lot of people supporting, I’ll say a little bit because of football.\n \n\n   \n  “I got used a lot to the crowd. Nowadays, I love playing with the crowd. I love them supporting me. I love that sometimes I’m in a bad situation in the match and they’re still supporting me, still cheering and motivating me.\n \n\n   \n  “I was more like a shy guy,” he adds, “and now I’m loving it.”\n \n\n   \n  Playing in loud matches at big tournaments is likely to be a mainstay of Fonseca’s career. He is slowly accumulating more experience against the world’s best players but hasn’t yet faced Djokovic – he’s hopeful of doing so before the Serb, now 38, retires – nor has he played either Alcaraz or Sinner.\n \n\n   \n  Those kinds of matches might become a regular occurrence should Fonseca, armed with that ferocious forehand, continue his march up the rankings. For now, he is watching closely as two players just a few years his senior rule over men’s tennis, sharing the past eight grand slams equally between them.\n \n\n   \n  One day, Fonseca might be in a position to challenge their duopoly.\n \n\n   \n  “What they’re doing is amazing,” he says of Alcaraz and Sinner. “They’re winning every tournament that they play.\n \n\n   \n  “They motivate all the other players to put more work in day by day, and try to be with them, try to win more tournaments, try to win matches, be more consistent. Hopefully, in the future, I will be with them, playing and competing in finals. But one step at a time, and let’s put in the work.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/senate-filibuster-trump-republicans","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"12:59:00-04:00","title":"Republican Leaders Reject Ending the Senate Filibuster Despite Trump’s Call to Nuke It","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the midst of a 31-day government shutdown, President Donald Trump urged the Senate to end the filibuster, but top Republican leaders including Senate Majority Leader John Thune and House Speaker Mike Johnson have firmly rejected the move.

Republican leaders reject ending the Senate filibuster despite Trump’s call to nuke it \n       \n  By Annie Grayer, Sarah Ferris, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:59 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The top two Republicans in Congress are showing no interest in taking the unprecedented step of ending the legislative filibuster, just hours after President Donald Trump  made a fresh demand  for the Senate to do so to end the government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  In perhaps the clearest possible signal to the White House that Senate Majority Leader John Thune would not change Senate rules to end the already 31-day stalemate, a spokesman said the Republican leader remained unmoved.\n \n\n   \n  “Leader Thune’s position on the importance of the legislative filibuster is unchanged,” Thune spokesperson Ryan Wrasse told CNN, reiterating the long-time view of Thune and many others in Senate leadership.\n \n\n   \n  Even House Speaker Mike Johnson — who rarely breaks with Trump in public — offered a cautious warning about keeping the filibuster intact.\n \n\n   \n  “The filibuster has traditionally been used as a very important safeguard,” Johnson said, noting that his own opinion is “not relevant” given it is a Senate-only issue. But the GOP speaker warned that Democrats would use the move to pass extreme measures the next time they control the upper chamber.\n \n\n   \n  “They would pack the Supreme Court, they would make Puerto Rico and DC states. They would ban firearms. They would do all sorts of things that would be very harmful to the country,” Johnson said, stressing that Trump’s late-night Truth Social post on the filibuster was an “expression of the president’s anger at this situation.”\n \n\n   \n  The rare split between congressional Republicans and the White House comes as the Washington stalemate and the pains of the shutdown around the country have deepened in recent days. But the GOP leaders’ swift move to quash Trump’s suggestion on the filibuster is a reflection of a clear political reality on Capitol Hill: There is little support for such a move within the Senate GOP conference.\n \n\n   \n  The filibuster rule is unique to the Senate, and it gives the minority the power to block a bill from coming up for a vote as long as at least 41 senators oppose it. Since one party rarely wins more than 60 seats, proponents have argued that the filibuster encourages compromise and makes it more difficult to enact massive partisan reforms.\n \n\n   \n  Taking the so-called nuclear option would require near-unanimity, since Thune and Senate GOP leaders could only lose three votes from their own party to do so if all Democrats oppose the move. And the number of GOP senators currently opposed stands far higher than that, with at least a dozen Republicans on the record against it.\n \n\n   \n  Still, deploying the “nuclear option” would not entirely end the Senate’s filibuster. Instead, it would eliminate the 60-vote threshold to end debate, instead requiring 51 votes.\n \n\n   \n  One of those lawmakers, freshman Sen. John Curtis of Utah, made clear Friday morning that he remained opposed despite Trump’s urging.\n \n\n   \n  “The filibuster forces us to find common ground in the Senate. Power changes hands, but principles shouldn’t. I’m a firm no on eliminating it,” Curtis wrote on X.\n \n\n   \n  ﻿Several GOP senators have echoed that sentiment in a sign that Trump could face a steep battle with his own party to push through any rules change.\n \n\n   \n  GOP Sen. Roger Marshall called the idea a “non-starter” earlier this month, saying that “a republic protects the rights of the minority. Otherwise you just take a poll and you switch the direction the ship is going. So that filibuster helps protect the minority, and I think it’s served our country well.”\n \n\n   \n  Also earlier in the month, Thune himself ruled out changing the Senate rules to end the shutdown, calling the filibuster “something that’s been a bulwark against a lot of really bad things happening with the country.” At the time, Thune said he’d gotten no pressure from the White House to end it.\n \n\n   \n  His team’s Friday statement reaffirming the leader’s opposition had some Senate Republicans breathing a sigh of relief, according to one GOP senate staffer.\n \n\n   \n  “Definitely gives us cover,” the GOP aide told CNN. “No one in the conference seriously wants to nuke the filibuster except maybe two.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/pentagon-tomahawks-trump-ukraine","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"13:00:00-04:00","title":"Pentagon Cleared Giving Ukraine Long-Range Tomahawk Missiles, Leaving Final Decision to Trump","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Pentagon has cleared the White House to provide Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk missiles, as it assessed no negative impact on US stockpiles, but the final decision remains with President Donald Trump.

Zachary Cohen, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:00 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Pentagon has given the White House the green light to provide Ukraine with  long-range Tomahawk missiles  after assessing that it would not negatively impact US stockpiles, leaving the final political decision in President  Donald Trump’s  hands, according to three US and European officials familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said earlier this month during a working lunch with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House that he would rather not provide the missiles to Ukraine because “we don’t want to be giving away things that we need to protect our country.”\n \n\n   \n  The Joint Staff informed the White House of its assessment earlier this month, just before Trump met with Zelensky   who has been pushing for the missiles to more effectively target oil and energy facilities deep inside Russia. Tomahawks have a range of around 1,000 miles.\n \n\n   \n  The assessment buoyed the US’ European allies, who believ e  that the US now ha s  fewer excuses not to provide the missiles, two European officials said. Trump also said just days before meeting Zelensky that the US has “a lot of Tomahawks” that it could potentially give to Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  US and European officials were surprised, therefore, when Trump dramatically changed his tune days later, saying during opening remarks at a White House working lunch with Zelensky that the US “needs” the Tomahawks.   He then told Zelensky behind closed doors that the US would not be providing them — at least not yet.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s decision came one day after he spoke by phone to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who told Trump that Tomahawks could hit major Russian cities like Moscow and St. Petersburg – would have no significant impact on the battlefield but would damage the US-Russia relationship, CNN has reported.\n \n\n   \n  The White House and Pentagon did not return requests for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has not taken the missiles off the table altogether, sources previously told CNN, and the administration has drawn up plans to provide them to Ukraine quickly should Trump give the order. Trump has also grown so frustrated in recent weeks with Putin’s unwillingness to seriously consider peace talks that he approved new US sanctions on Russian oil firms last week and scrapped — for now — a planned meeting with Putin in Budapest to discuss Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  While the Pentagon doesn’t have concerns about stockpiles, US defense officials are still grappling with how Ukraine would train on and deploy the missiles, officials said. There are still several operational issues that would need to be resolved for Ukraine to be able to use the missiles effectively, the sources added.\n \n\n   \n  One outstanding question is how Ukraine would fire the missiles if the US provided them. Tomahawks are most commonly launched from surface ships or submarines, but Ukraine’s Navy is severely depleted ,  so the missiles would likely need to be launched on land. The Marine Corps and Army have developed ground-based launchers that could be provided to Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  But even if the US did not want to provide the launchers, European officials believe Ukraine could figure out a workaround. One official pointed out that Ukrainian engineers were able to develop a workaround to use the UK-provided Storm Shadow missiles, which were originally designed to be used by modern NATO aircraft and had to be integrated into Ukraine’s aging, Soviet-era fighter jet fleet.\n \n\n   \n  In a post on X earlier this week, Zelenksy said Ukraine hopes to expand its long-range capabilities by the end of this year so the war can end “on fair terms” for the country.\n \n\n   \n  “Global sanctions and our pinpoint precision are practically syncing up to end this war on terms fair for Ukraine,” he wrote. “All deep-strike goals must be fully locked in by year’s end, including expansion of our long-range footprint.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/donald-trump-end-shutdown-filibuster","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"12:00:00-20:00","title":"Trump just kneecapped the GOP’s shutdown strategy","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump, in a late-night post on Truth Social, urged Republican leaders to invoke the 'nuclear option' — eliminating the Senate filibuster — to end a prolonged government shutdown.

This would allow Republicans to pass things on party-line votes in the GOP-controlled Senate.\n \n\n   \n  “BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THE DEMOCRATS HAVE GONE STONE COLD ‘CRAZY,’ THE CHOICE IS CLEAR — INITIATE THE ‘NUCLEAR OPTION,’ GET RID OF THE FILIBUSTER AND, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  That Trump would call for this is not terribly surprising; he has spent years occasionally urging Republican leaders to scrap the filibuster. Nor is it particularly likely to provide an actual offramp in the shutdown; those same GOP leaders have steadfastly declined Trump’s entreaties before and rejected this idea repeatedly in recent weeks. It’s not even clear whether enough senators would vote for such a change if GOP leaders went along with it.\n \n\n   \n  So practically speaking, it’s a pointless interjection from the president.\n \n\n   \n  But it does matter in one way: It’s Trump yet again inserting himself into these kinds of talks in ways that are thoroughly unhelpful to his party. And this has become a trend.\n \n\n   \n  The reason it’s unhelpful in this case is that it legitimizes Democrats’ talking point that Republicans could end this shutdown any time they want to. And that could make it harder for Republicans to shake the blame they’ve been saddled with.\n \n\n   \n  It’s been pretty remarkable how much Americans have  continued to blame Republicans  more than Democrats for the shutdown, despite it being Democrats who are seeking the concession (i.e. an extension of the enhanced Obamacare subsidies). A  Washington Post-ABC News poll  released Thursday showed 45% of Americans mainly blamed Trump and the GOP, versus 33% who held Democrats responsible.\n \n\n   \n  To be clear, the idea that Republicans could end the shutdown anytime they want is a vastly oversimplified talking point. Yes, all they need is a majority of the Senate to nuke the filibuster. But there are myriad reasons to avoid invoking that nuclear option. And Republican leaders have pointed to them for weeks — specifically invoking what they fear Democrats could do without that 60-vote threshold if they regain control of the chamber.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Majority Leader John Thune earlier this month called the filibuster “a bulwark against a lot of really bad things happening to the country.” (His spokesperson on Friday said the leader’s position is “unchanged.”) Fellow Senate GOP leader John Barrasso of Wyoming argued that nixing the filibuster would ultimately allow Democrats to make Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia into states, with two senators apiece, and to pack the Supreme Court. House Speaker Mike Johnson has said it would mean there would be “no stumbling blocks or hurdles at all in the way of turning us into a communist country.”\n \n\n   \n  But Trump is now legitimizing blaming his own party for the shutdown because they won’t have done the thing he told them to do.\n \n\n   \n  And if you’re a Republican in Congress, you’ve probably got déjà vu about now. That’s because Trump does stuff like this a lot – especially during shutdown debates.\n \n\n   \n  In early 2018, Trump  contradicted his own spokeswoman’s statement  of support for a short-term continuing resolution, making a late demand to scrap an extension of the Children’s Health Insurance Program.\n \n\n   \n  Trump then pulled another  11th-hour shift a few weeks later , demanding immigration concessions that hadn’t previously been a focal point of leaders’ efforts.\n \n\n   \n  Before he was sworn in to his second term in January, Trump and Elon Musk combined in December to play the role of legislative arsonists again. GOP leaders had negotiated a bipartisan deal to avert a shutdown. But then Musk started waging war against it on X. Trump then joined him and  threw another wrench in the cogs , suddenly demanding a debt ceiling increase that hadn’t really been a part of discussions.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has regularly given congressional Republicans fits in these situations – so much so that they’ll occasionally acknowledge their frustrations publicly.\n \n\n   \n  Then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in early 2018  practically pleaded with Trump  to engage in the process and provide some direction. “As soon as we figure out what he is for, then I would be convinced that we were not just spinning our wheels,” the Kentucky Republican said at the time.\n \n\n   \n  After Trump threw a late grenade in the process in December, Sen. Kevin Cramer said he was “very frustrated.”\n \n\n   \n  When CNN’s Manu Raju asked the North Dakota Republican if he wished Trump had signaled his demands earlier, Cramer  responded dryly : “Yeah, I mean, maybe he hadn’t thought about it until just today. But yeah, that would have been very helpful.”\n \n\n   \n  None of this means Trump’s late entry into this shutdown debate is a game-changer. Perhaps GOP leaders will get through to Trump that this strategy isn’t particularly helpful – as they appear to have with other Republicans who occasionally suggested this route – and he’ll drop it.\n \n\n   \n  But his late-night social media demand has at the very least put Republicans in the uncomfortable position of explaining why they don’t attempt to do the thing that is technically in their power to end the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  And we’re already seeing Republicans try and massage this issue away.\n \n\n   \n  “What you’re seeing is an expression of the president’s anger at the situation,” Johnson said Friday.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps, but most presidents don’t lash out and kneecap their side’s negotiating power just because they get frustrated.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/uk/prince-andrew-scandal-analysis-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"12:30:00-04:00","title":"King Charles Banishes Brother Andrew from Royal Life After Epstein Allegations","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"King Charles has made a historic and unprecedented move to strip his brother Prince Andrew of his royal titles and status, reducing him to a commoner, in response to persistent public outrage over his alleged connections to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

Is it too little too late? \n       \n  Analysis by Lauren Said-Moorhouse, Max Foster, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:30 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  King Charles’  decision  to cast out his brother Andrew from the monarchy as well as the  30-room mansion  where he’s lived for more than 20 years was as sudden as it was dramatic.\n \n\n   \n  It is the ultimate humiliation for the 65-year-old now-former prince,  known to enjoy the trappings and privilege of royal life. He will move out of Royal Lodge, his sprawling mansion in the heart of the Windsor estate just outside of London, and be exiled to the countryside to live in obscurity.\n \n\n   \n  The monarchy had been under intense pressure to resolve the Andrew issue amid renewed public fury over his ties to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, which was further inflamed by the release of his sexual abuse accuser  Virginia Giuffre’s posthumous memoir.  Andrew has repeatedly denied the allegations against him.\n \n\n   \n  Two weeks ago, Andrew  gave up the use  of his titles and honors, more than five years after  stepping back as a frontline royal . He said he was putting “duty to my family and country first,” but it did little to stop the snowballing scandal.\n \n\n   \n  Then on Thursday evening, a brusque bombshell announcement from Buckingham Palace: Andrew is to lose his princely status, and effective immediately he is plain old Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, a commoner.\n \n\n   \n  The palace statement was clear – the decision was the king’s and Andrew had no choice in the matter (although he is understood not to have objected to his brother’s actions). Notable in the statement too, an expression of solidarity with victims of abuse.\n \n\n   \n  The significance of Charles’ moves on Thursday cannot be overstated. ﻿Not since the abdication crisis of 1936 has there been such a public casting aside of a senior British royal.\n \n\n   \n  The decision would doubtless have been difficult – and, given the personal family dynamics at play, deeply personal. But the monarch had no choice – Andrew’s controversies have been dogging the family for years and the publication of his accuser’s posthumous memoir was the final straw. The negotiations to get to this stage will have been challenging but the monarch had no option but to engage damage control mode.\n \n\n   \n  It was not just the public that had expressed outrage and frustration; there had also been increasing calls for Andrew to appear before a parliamentary committee. Perhaps this move will head off that particular indignity.\n \n\n   \n  Royal historian Kate Williams said the King’s decision was “unprecedented.”\n \n\n   \n  “This is a huge move from the royal family. Just recently, the King announced that Andrew was stepping back from the title Duke of York just a few days before Ms. Giuffre’s memoir was published. But that simply wasn’t enough for public opinion,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “We have had people in the past losing the title of prince or princess. Henry VIII (reigned 1509-1547) said his daughters were no longer legitimate after he annulled the marriages with their mothers, Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn – but he changed his mind later.”\n \n\n   \n  She also pointed out Prince Charles Edward – one of Queen Victoria’s grandsons – whose title of the Duke of Albany was removed by parliament in 1917 after he fought for Germany in World War I. But Andrew’s situation, Williams said, was different as he was censured because of his serious errors of judgment.\n \n\n   \n  The King’s moves were welcomed by many British politicians. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said that “the King has clearly felt that this is the right decision for the royal family” but added that it “must have been a very difficult thing” to act against his own sibling.\n \n\n   \n  The leader of the centrist Liberal Democrats said Andrew’s situation “had become totally untenable, having disgraced his office and embarrassed the country.”\n \n\n   \n  He added: “This is an important step towards rebuilding trust in our institutions and drawing a line under this whole sorry saga.”\n \n\n   \n  For several weeks, it has felt like some sort of announcement was coming down the pike and was simply a case of when, rather than if.\n \n\n   \n  Royal sources told CNN that the King was trying to act swiftly following recent developments but had needed some time to consult legal and constitutional experts.\n \n\n   \n  It is also understood that the King took action in light of his sibling’s serious lapses of judgment and has the support of the wider family, including Prince William.\n \n\n   \n  The statement, when it came, was uncompromising. “These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him,” it said.\n \n\n   \n  For many people in the country, and certainly critics of the royal family, these moves might not be enough to rehabilitate the monarchy’s tarnished reputation. For some, the removal of Andrew’s status as prince only goes so far. Other critics say the family has shielded Andrew over the years, and pressure for some sort of accountability needs to continue.\n \n\n   \n  “Losing silly titles is not an answer to very serious accusations of sexual offenses and corruption in public office,” Graham Smith, chief executive of the anti-monarchy campaign group Republic, said following the palace’s announcement.\n \n\n   \n  “This isn’t about William and Charles taking a tough line. It’s about William and Charles protecting their position by putting as much distance between them and Andrew as they can,” Smith added. “We need to see Andrew face justice, because we need to know that the royals are not above the law.”\n \n\n   \n  Despite being stripped of his prince title, Andrew remains eighth in line to the throne. Royal sources have told CNN that he will be given a house on the King’s private estate in Sandringham, and will receive an income from Charles as well.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew is not expected to move from his Windsor mansion to Sandringham in Norfolk until after the Christmas holidays, according to a royal source. The move will happen as soon as possible and practical, but the process of giving notice, surrendering the lease and other practicalities of the relocation can be a drawn-out process.\n \n\n   \n  Moving in the new year might also avoid potential awkwardness over the holidays as Sandringham is traditionally where the royal family gathers for the festive season. It was previously announced that Andrew would be excluded from Christmas celebrations with the rest of the Windsor clan.\n \n\n   \n  His ex-wife Sarah Ferguson, who has been living with Andrew at Royal Lodge for the last two decades, is moving out as well and is understood to be making her own arrangements.\n \n\n   \n  Their two daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, will retain their titles as daughters of the son of a sovereign, in line with a directive issued by King George V in 1917.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not yet clear if the King’s actions will be enough to give a public perception that the situation has been handled, but Charles seems to be doing as much as he feels he can within his own royal prerogative.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/trump-senate-filibuster-nuclear-option-government-shutdown","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"10:53:00-04:00","title":"Trump calls for end of Senate filibuster to break funding stalemate","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has urged Republican lawmakers to eliminate the Senate filibuster as a unilateral solution to end a week-long government shutdown, calling it a necessary 'Nuclear Option' to restore government functionality.

And it immediately ratcheted up the pressure on Republican leaders, who have adamantly opposed eliminating the  60-vote threshold for passing legislation  as a way to end the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Top GOP lawmakers have long argued for keeping that threshold in place, asserting that the filibuster benefits Republicans — and will serve as a key safeguard against Democrats passing transformative legislation the next time they’re in power.\n \n\n   \n  The filibuster rule is unique to the Senate, and it gives the minority the power to block a bill from coming up for a vote as long as at least 41 senators oppose it. Since one party rarely wins more than 60 seats, proponents have argued that the filibuster encourages compromise and makes it more difficult to enact massive partisan reforms.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Majority Leader John Thune earlier this month ruled out changing the Senate rules to end the shutdown, calling the filibuster “something that’s been a bulwark against a lot of really bad things happening with the country.” At the time, Thune said he’d gotten no pressure from the White House to end the filibuster.\n \n\n   \n  Thune spokesman Ryan Wrasse said in a statement to CNN Friday, “Leader Thune’s position on the importance of the legislative filibuster is unchanged.” The statement had some in his party breathing a sigh of relief.\n \n\n   \n  “Definitely gives us cover,” a GOP aide told CNN. “No one in the conference seriously wants to nuke the filibuster except maybe two.”\n \n\n   \n  Several GOP senators have echoed Thune’s sentiment in recent days in a sign that Trump could face a steep battle with his own party to push through the rules change. Killing the filibuster would take a majority vote in the Senate, meaning Republicans could only lose three lawmakers assuming all Democrats oppose the move.\n \n\n   \n  On Friday morning, Sen. John Curtis of Utah  posted on X  that he remained a “firm no” on eliminating the filibuster, writing that “the filibuster forces us to find common ground in the Senate. Power changes hands, but principles shouldn’t.”\n \n\n   \n  But Trump on Thursday appeared to dismiss those concerns, arguing that Republicans should take advantage of their Senate majority to end the filibuster and reopen the government. The president made a similar case during his first term, though Senate Republicans never acted on it at the time.\n \n\n   \n  “Now WE are in power, and if we did what we should be doing, it would IMMEDIATELY end this ridiculous, Country destroying ‘SHUT DOWN,’” he wrote. “If the Republicans are not using the Great Strength and Policies made available to us by ending the Filibuster, the Democrats will exercise their rights, and it will be done in the first day they take office, regardless of whether or not we do it.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s new push followed a week on Capitol Hill where lawmakers on both sides signaled potential signs of progress toward ending the impasse, even as they conceded that a deal remained well out of reach despite widening fallout across the country.\n \n\n   \n  The Senate is not slated to return to Washington until Monday evening, putting lawmakers just days away from breaking the 35-day mark for the  longest-ever government shutdown .\n \n\n   \n   Critical food aid  for tens of millions of Americans is slated to end over the weekend. The White House on Thursday also sought to highlight the stress that the shutdown is putting on air traffic controllers by convening a roundtable of airline industry representatives and union leaders.\n \n\n   \n   This story  has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/travel/the-worlds-best-hotels-for-2025-revealed","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"11:46:00.000-04:00","title":"The world’s best hotel for 2025 is a waterfront skyscraper","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Rosewood Hong Kong, a 65-storey luxury waterfront hotel in Hong Kong designed by Taiwanese designer Tony Chi, has been named the world’s best hotel in 2025 by the global hospitality brand 50 Best.

distinguished feature of Hong Kong’s iconic skyline, as well as a force to be reckoned with in the luxury hotel scene.\n \n\n   \n  And after landing in the top three of the World’s 50 Best Hotels list twice, the 65-storey property came in  first place  this year.\n \n\n   \n  Designed by Taiwanese designer Tony Chi, the contemporary 413-room hotel beat out last year’s winner, Capella Bangkok, in the highly anticipated list from the global hospitality brand 50 Best, announced at an awards ceremony in London last night.\n \n\n   \n  Angus Pitkethley, complex director of sales and marketing

The 18th-century villa took fourth place this year, making it the highest ranked European hotel, and was also named the Best Boutique Hotel.\n \n\n   \n  Historic hotel Raffles Singapore, the birthplace of the Singapore Sling cocktail, rounded out the top five.\n \n\n   \n  Other hotels in the Asian region featured on the list included Mandarin Oriental Bangkok (No.7), Upper House Hong Kong (No.10), Bulgari Tokyo (No.15), Aman Tokyo (No.25), Janu Tokyo (No.37), Mandarin Oriental Hong Kong (No.41), and The Tokyo Edition Toranomon (No.45).\n \n\n   \n    Very best properties\n \n\n   \n  The highest ranked hotel in North America was Chablé Yucatán (No. 8), one of four Mexican hotels featured.

and evicts him from royal mansion \n       \n  By Lauren Said-Moorhouse, Max Foster, Lauren Kent, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:27 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Britain’s King Charles took  the extraordinary step  of starting the process to strip his brother Andrew of his royal titles and evict him from the royal estate in Windsor, in the most dramatic attempt yet to quell the scandal over the disgraced prince’s links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  The move, described in stark terms by Buckingham Palace as “necessary censures,” cements the deepest split in the British royal family in decades. The question now: whether King Charles and the British establishment have done enough to prevent Andrew’s association with  Epstein  from engulfing the monarchy.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew, 65, had faced 15 years of on-and-off controversy over his friendship with Epstein that had reached a new intensity after the release of a posthumous memoir by Virginia Giuffre, who alleged that Andrew had sexually assaulted her as a teenager.\n \n\n   \n  Giuffre – who the prince claims never to have met – died by suicide in April at the age of 41. Andrew has repeatedly denied all allegations against him.\n \n\n   \n  Giuffre’s family said in a statement on Thursday: “Today, an ordinary American girl, from an ordinary American family, brought down a British prince with her truth and extraordinary courage.”\n \n\n   \n  Sky Roberts, Giuffre’s brother, told CNN that it had been a “joyous and happy and sad day.”\n \n\n   \n  In the statement, Buckingham Palace noted that Andrew would be forced out of his residence and take the family name. “Prince Andrew will now be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor. His  lease on Royal Lodge  has, to date, provided him with legal protection to continue in residence. Formal notice has now been served to surrender the lease and he will move to alternative private accommodation,” the statement continued.\n \n\n   \n  “These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him.”\n \n\n   \n  Andrew will move to a property on the Sandringham estate, about 100 miles north of London, which is privately owned by the British monarch. Royal Lodge sits within Windsor Great Park, part of the Crown Estate, which manages the royal family’s land and property holdings on behalf of the British state. Andrew’s new accommodation will be privately funded by King Charles.\n \n\n   \n  It’s understood the palace acted because while it acknowledges that Andrew continues to deny all allegations made against him, it had concluded that he made serious lapses of judgement.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew is not expected to move to Sandringham until after the Christmas holidays, according to a royal source.\n \n\n   \n  Moving in the new year might also avoid potential awkwardness over the holidays as Sandringham is traditionally where the royal family gathers for the festive season. It was previously announced that Andrew would be excluded from Christmas celebrations.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew had sought to end the renewed scrutiny of his conduct by relinquishing  use of his titles  earlier this month. But his moves did little to stem the flow of negative headlines and sparked fresh questions about how he was able to pay Giuffre a reportedly multimillion-dollar settlement in a civil case in 2022 and fund his lifestyle despite having not been a working royal since 2019.\n \n\n   \n  Public anger has also grown after it emerged last week that he paid $1 million for Royal Lodge, in the heart of Windsor Great Park near Windsor Castle, in 2003, and only a peppercorn rent “if demanded” each year since then, according to his lease agreement.\n \n\n   \n  Despite Thursday’s announcement, Andrew remains eighth in line to the British throne. That status  could be removed  by legislation, but it would require the consent of Commonwealth nations around the world, which would take time. The last time this protocol was used was when Edward VIII abdicated in 1936.\n \n\n   \n  CNN understands that rather than formally remove Andrew’s title as Duke of York via an act of parliament, King Charles will send royal warrants to remove Andrew’s peerages.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew was also known as the Earl of Inverness and Baron Killyleagh, a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order and as a Royal Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter. The stripping of his titles takes immediate effect.\n \n\n   \n  “Their Majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse,” Buckingham Palace added in the statement.\n \n\n   \n  In his interview with CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, Sky Roberts said King Charles’ decision vindicated the years of campaigning by his sister. “She should be here. She should be having this interview with you,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “She had been fighting for this for a long time. She always said… only one of us is telling the truth and I know that’s me,” Roberts said. “We’re really proud of her. We’re so proud of what she was able to achieve.”\n \n\n   \n  Calling it a “huge moment” for his sister and other survivors, Roberts said: “It’s an acknowledgement to say, we believe you. We see you. And for me, I love you. We love you… This is a very vindicating moment for us. And I just wish she was here to to share this with us.”\n \n\n   \n  Giuffre’s family said in their statement they would fight to ensure other associates of Epstein would face similar judgement. “Our sister, a child when she was sexually assaulted by Andrew, never stopped fighting for accountability for what had happened to her and to countless other survivors like her. Today, she declares victory,” the statement said, adding they will “not rest until the same accountability applies to all of the abusers and abettors connected to Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.”\n \n\n   \n    Calls for Andrew to face justice continue\n \n\n   \n  The anti-monarchy group Republic said Thursday that it had instructed lawyers to launch a private prosecution against Andrew “over accusations of sexual offenses and misconduct in public office.”\n \n\n   \n  The group said its lawyers would be actively investigating the case against Andrew and aim to begin proceedings in the coming weeks. Republic has previously called for the police to investigate Andrew.\n \n\n   \n  “Let’s be very clear, Prince Andrew – now Andrew Mountbatton Windsor – is not facing justice. He’s not being held to account. Losing silly titles is not an answer to very serious accusations of sexual offenses and corruption in public office,” Graham Smith, chief executive of Republic, said Thursday following the palace’s announcement.\n \n\n   \n  “This isn’t about William and Charles taking a tough line. It’s about William and Charles protecting their position by putting as much distance between them and Andrew as they can,” Smith added. “We need to see Andrew face justice, because we need to know that the royals are not above the law.”\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, the British monarch was  heckled by a protester  who could be heard shouting “How long have you known about Andrew and Epstein?” as he carried out a cathedral visit in northwest England.\n \n\n   \n    Andrew’s daughters to retain princess titles\n \n\n   \n  Andrew’s daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, will retain their titles as they are the daughters of the son of a sovereign – in line with rules set out by King George V in 1917.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew’s ex-wife Sarah Ferguson, who has lived with him for the past 20 years at Royal Lodge, will also move out and is understood to be making her own arrangements.\n \n\n   \n  Ferguson, 66, is the mother of Andrew’s two children. They wed in 1986 and divorced a decade later. She previously held the title of Duchess of York, but reverted to her maiden name when Andrew relinquished his titles earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  CNN also understands that the British government was consulted on the King’s decisions, and the government has made it clear that it supports the moves.\n \n\n   \n  The last time a prince had his title removed is understood to be more than 100 years ago, when Prince Charles Edward – one of Queen Victoria’s grandsons – had the title of Duke of Albany stripped from him by the British parliament under the Titles Deprivation Act 1917. The action was taken after he fought in World War I for Germany, where he was Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s MiSeon Lee contributed to this report.

NOAA’s Hurricane Hunters flew into it without pay \n       \n  By Andrew Freedman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:54 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Tossed and battered by violent wind and severe turbulence, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Hurricane Hunters have spent the past week diving into the eye of  Melissa  —  a storm of historic ferocity  — to gather life-saving data. They have done it around the clock, 24/7, because their mission is considered essential to public safety.\n \n\n   \n  But this time, with the government shut down, they have done it all without pay.\n \n\n   \n  The Hurricane Hunters are a standard feature of US storm response. Information gathered by the planes’ specialized equipment, which includes a tail-mounted doppler radar that takes a virtual CT scan of the storm, are crucial for issuing accurate forecasts and gauging storm strength in real-time.\n \n\n   \n  The data, including the radar information, is fed straight into the computer models that forecasters use to predict a hurricane’s path and intensity.\n \n\n   \n  But as long-lived Hurricane Melissa rumbled on through the week, the people operating the flights have been under increasing financial stress.\n \n\n   \n  The crews of the agency’s decades-old WP-3D aircraft have now missed two paychecks due to the shutdown, according to a NOAA employee with knowledge of the hurricane hunter operations, who spoke with CNN on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.\n \n\n   \n  Crews are asked “To be fully mentally present, especially in this environment, and it’s hard to do that when you know you can’t potentially make ends meet,” the NOAA staff member said. “You’re dipping into savings to pay off your mortgage, you know, week to week or month to month.”\n \n\n   \n  The flights through the once Category 5 storm have been particularly hairy, with one of the NOAA aircraft having to return to its base for a safety inspection after exceeding its g-force limits from the turbulence.\n \n\n   \n  Videos during that flight show equipment falling from the ceiling of the plane, with roughly 20 crew members cursing and laughing as they are thrown against their safety harnesses.\n \n\n   \n  Following an inspection by ground crews, who are also working without pay, that same aircraft flew out later the same day on another mission into the storm, the NOAA staff member said.\n \n\n   \n  The NOAA crews have met all the requests that the National Hurricane Center has made of them ,  the employee said. The Center assigns them to specific flight routes and schedules where scientists think in-situ data would improve the forecasts as much as possible.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it’s just a notable thing that we have these crews going around the clock supporting the important mission that it is,” despite enduring increasing financial hardship, they said.\n \n\n   \n  They said the NOAA flights have been fully staffed with about 20 crew members per flight.\n \n\n   \n  The NOAA flights continued as the  storm plowed into Jamaica , doing immense damage to the island nation and killing at least 19 people.\n \n\n   \n  They have kept flying to support America’s international partners, with flights on Thursday aimed at making sure Bermuda residents get accurate warnings of the storm’s intensity and path.\n \n\n   \n  NOAA spokesperson Kim Doster acknowledged the crews’ hard work and their financial stress. “NOAA looks forward to a swift end to the crippling federal government shutdown which is forcing essential workers and service members like our brave Hurricane Hunter pilots to go unpaid as they perform their mission-critical duties that protect the lives of Americans every day,” she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The Air Force Reserve also flies into hurricanes and has flown numerous missions into Melissa, but those planes are not bristling with the same specialized equipment that the older NOAA aircraft are. They fly a more straightforward reconnaissance mission, keeping tabs of the storm’s intensity and movement, whereas the NOAA flights are aimed more at hurricane research and enabling forecasting improvements.\n \n\n   \n  Remarkably, one of the Air Force flights also had to turn around after getting beaten up by severe turbulence flying through Melissa. CNN reached out to the Air Force’s Hurricane Hunter squadron to inquire about their pay status but has not heard back.\n \n\n   \n  It’s unusual for two flights to have to turn back within the same storm and indicates the hurricane’s power during its approach to southwestern Jamaica. Melissa crossed the Jamaican coast tied for the strongest-ever landfalling Atlantic hurricane, with maximum sustained winds of 185 mph.\n \n\n   \n  Andy Hazelton, a hurricane researcher who works with NOAA’s hurricane research division at the University of Miami, told CNN earlier this week that the NOAA flight that had to turn around due to turbulence was the roughest ride in a hurricane that he has had since he began such work seven years ago.\n \n\n   \n  “You hit a big enough updraft and downdraft you have to make sure the plane is ok,” Hazelton, who is being paid during the shutdown via the university, said. “These crews are doing this all while not getting paid, so they deserve all the credit.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/uk/andrew-mountbatten-windsor-what-next-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"12:26:00.000-04:00","title":"Prince no longer: What next for Andrew Mountbatten Windsor?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In October 2025, Prince Andrew, Duke of York, was formally stripped of all royal titles and honors by King Charles III following sustained public and political pressure tied to his alleged connections with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and sexual misconduct allegations.

By the next morning, Andrew’s name had already been removed from the official role of the peerage – a crucial step in the formal scrapping of his titles.\n \n\n   \n  While the royal family hopes this move can draw a line under this years-long scandal,  questions  are swirling about where Andrew, 65, will live, whether he could yet face more legal troubles and whether his banishment will appease the British public. Here, we answer some of those.\n \n\n   \n    Where will Andrew sleep tonight?\n \n\n   \n  Most likely in  Royal Lodge , the grand 30-room mansion in Windsor Great Park, west of London, which has been Andrew’s home since 2003. The late Queen Elizabeth II granted Andrew, the third of her four children, the right to live in the lodge, and his 75-year lease was due to expire in 2078.\n \n\n   \n  But in its Thursday night statement, Buckingham Palace said Andrew had been served formal notice to surrender his lease and that he would “move to alternative private accommodation.” It is understood that he will move as soon as is practicable.\n \n\n   \n    Where will he live in the future?\n \n\n   \n  Royal sources have told CNN that Andrew will be given a house on the King’s private estate in Sandringham, Norfolk. That vast estate on England’s eastern coast is home to some 150 properties.\n \n\n   \n  It is also where the royal family spends Christmas. Before the Thursday night announcement, Andrew had already been told he would not be welcome at the country retreat over the holidays, a royal source had said.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew might not move to Sandringham until after the Christmas holidays, another source said, because giving notice, surrendering the lease and orchestrating the move is expected to take some time.\n \n\n   \n    Will he receive an income?\n \n\n   \n  Yes, but we don’t know how much. After he stepped back from public duties following his disastrous 2019 interview with BBC Newsnight, Andrew was thought to receive an annual allowance of about £1 million ($1.3 million) from the late Queen, according to British media reports.\n \n\n   \n  Those payments initially continued under Charles, the reports said, but it is understood that the King had stopped providing the allowance.\n \n\n   \n  Despite now being stripped of his prince title, CNN understands that Andrew will still receive an income from Charles.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew’s finances have always been something of a mystery. His only source of income that has been declared is the pension he receives from his time in the navy between 1979 and 2001, said to amount to £20,000 ($26,000) a year.\n \n\n   \n    Is he still in the line of succession?\n \n\n   \n  Andrew may have lost his titles, status and honors but he is still eighth in line to the British throne.\n \n\n   \n  There is a process to formally remove him from the line of succession by legislation, but it would take time as it requires the consent of Commonwealth nations around the world.\n \n\n   \n  The last time this protocol was invoked was in 1936 with the abdication of Edward VIII.\n \n\n   \n    What will happen to his family?\n \n\n   \n  Andrew and Sarah Ferguson divorced in 1996 but have lived together at Royal Lodge in Windsor since 2008. His ex-wife reverted to her maiden name earlier this month when Andrew relinquished the use of his royal titles, including Duke of York. She is also moving out of Royal Lodge and make her own living arrangements. It is understood that she will not be joining Andrew when he moves to Sandringham.\n \n\n   \n  Their daughters, Princess Beatrice, 37, and Princess Eugenie, 35, are non-working royals and will retain their titles as daughters of the son of a sovereign, in line with a directive issued by King George V in 1917.\n \n\n   \n  Beatrice lives with her husband in the Cotswolds, about 100 miles from London, but has an apartment at St. James’s Palace in the capital. Eugenie and her husband have a cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace but spend a lot of time abroad. Their living situations will not be affected by their father’s exile.\n \n\n   \n    Could he be hauled in front of parliament?\n \n\n   \n  The Liberal Democrats, an opposition party, have lately called for Andrew to give evidence to a parliamentary committee about his finances and potential rent paid to live in Royal Lodge.\n \n\n   \n  So far, the government of Prime Minister Keir Starmer has refused to give members of parliament time to debate Andrew’s finances, despite public outcry for proper scrutiny.\n \n\n   \n  This week, Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, a Conservative lawmaker and chair of the Public Accounts Committee, wrote to the Crown Estate Commissioners seeking more information on Andrew’s lease arrangements for Royal Lodge.\n \n\n   \n  That committee is responsible for “upholding best value for taxpayers’ money,” Clifton-Brown wrote, and as such “we feel it is reasonable to seek further information on the status of, and rationale for, the lease of Royal Lodge.”\n \n\n   \n    Might he face further legal challenges?\n \n\n   \n  Potentially. Republic, an activist group seeking to abolish the monarchy, says it is pursuing a private prosecution of Andrew “because if the government and police won’t hold him to account, we will.”\n \n\n   \n  The group says it has instructed lawyers to investigate and, if appropriate, begin a private prosecution over allegations of sexual offenses and misconduct in public office.\n \n\n   \n   Virginia Giuffre , a prominent accuser of Epstein and his circle, alleged that Andrew had sex with her three times when she was a teenager. In her recent memoir, published posthumously, Giuffre wrote that Andrew “believed that having sex with me was his birthright.”\n \n\n   \n  Despite claiming never to have met her, Andrew reportedly paid millions of dollars to Giuffre in 2022 to settle a civil case she brought against him. He has repeatedly denied all allegations against him.\n \n\n   \n  Giuffre died by suicide in April. On Thursday, Sky and Amanda Roberts, Giuffre’s brother and sister-in-law, told CNN that Giuffre would have been “joyous” to know that Andrew had been stripped of the title that helped shield him from accountability.\n \n\n   \n  “I think she would be proud, and I think she would turn to her children and say, ‘I did it. I got the bad guy,’” said Amanda Roberts.\n \n\n   \n    Will this be enough for the British public?\n \n\n   \n  It’s hard to say. Andrew is deeply unpopular with the British public. In a poll published Thursday by YouGov, 91% of Britons had a negative opinion of Andrew. Just 4% had a positive one. By contrast, Britons generally like Prince William (76%) and Charles (62%), and overall have a positive view of the monarchy as an institution (56%).\n \n\n   \n  If Andrew’s fall from grace began in earnest after his 2019 BBC Newsnight interview, the royal family have repeatedly tried to draw a line under the scandal – first by Andrew’s withdrawing from public life, then by removing his military titles and patronages, later cutting him off financially, then by his relinquishing some of his titles – and now by the King casting him out of the palace for good as a pariah.\n \n\n   \n  None of the measures have quelled the public outcry. It remains to be seen whether this time will be different.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps the Andrew scandal has roiled on for so long because, for the public, his “punishments” do not seem proportionate to the allegations that he faces. While the loss of his titles and favored residence may be a personal tragedy for Andrew, it elicits little sympathy from a public demanding proper accountability.\n \n\n   \n  “It doesn’t matter if he’s Prince Andrew or Andrew Mountbatten Windsor – we’re still pursuing a private prosecution of him,” said Republic, the activist group.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/health/blood-pressure-medicine-recall-cancer","dateOfPublication":"1004-10-31","timeOfPublication":"10:04:00-04:00","title":"FDA Recalls Prazosin Blood Pressure Medicine Over Cancer-Causing Chemical Concerns","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has ordered a nationwide recall of over 580,000 bottles of prazosin hydrochloride, a blood pressure and PTSD-related sleep disorder medication, due to the presence of potentially cancer-causing N-nitrosamine impurities.

\n  Protests are spreading in  Tanzania  as electoral authorities count the votes in a disputed presidential election that rights groups, opposition figures and others say was clouded by a climate of fear in the months leading to election day.\n \n\n   \n  The military has been deployed alongside the police to quell riots in major cities since Wednesday’s election. The sight of soldiers patrolling the streets, sporadic gunfire and closed stores is rare in the usually peaceful country that many foreigners visit for its pristine coastal beaches and safari tourism.\n \n\n   \n  That’s partly because Tanzania’s first female leader, who has served as president since 2021, has sparked widespread anger for  running virtually unopposed  after her two main opponents were blocked or prevented from contesting.\n \n\n   \n  President Samia Suluhu Hassan, who seeks five more years as president, ran against 16 candidates from smaller parties. Critics say that’s a coronation, not a contest. Hassan is now the subject of a range of uncharitable cartoons, posted on social media, derided as a dictator and lampooned as being afraid of competition.\n \n\n   \n  Tundu Lissu, leader of the Chadema opposition group, has been jailed for months, charged with treason after he called for electoral reforms that he said were a prerequisite for free and fair elections. Another opposition figure, Luhaga Mpina of the ACT-Wazalendo group, was barred from standing.\n \n\n   \n    Political maneuvering\n \n\n   \n  At stake for the ruling Chama cha Mapinduzi party, or CCM, is its decades-long grip on power amid the rise of charismatic opposition figures who hope to lead the country toward political change.\n \n\n   \n  The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data, or ACLED, a nonprofit tracking violence and protest movements around the world, describes CCM as the “last of the hegemonic liberation parties,” trying to cling to power by blocking the opposition “through administrative, legal, and extra-legal means.”\n \n\n   \n  The pattern includes enforced disappearances, arbitrary arrests and extrajudicial killings, according to Amnesty International. In June, a United Nations panel of human rights experts cited  more than 200 cases of enforced disappearance since 2019 , saying they were “alarmed by reports of a pattern of repression” ahead of elections.\n \n\n   \n  Internet access has been on and off since Wednesday as the nation awaits official results.\n \n\n   \n  Tanzania’s president has “overseen an unprecedented crackdown on political opponents,” the International Crisis Group said in its most recent analysis. “The government has curbed freedom of expression, ranging from a ban on X and restrictions on the Tanzanian digital platform JamiiForums to silencing critical voices through intimidation or arrest.”\n \n\n   \n  Local police even appeared to be “conducting so-called online patrols,” it said.\n \n\n   \n  The political maneuvering by Tanzanian authorities is unprecedented even in a country where single-party rule has been the norm since the advent of multi-party politics in 1992.\n \n\n   \n  Government critics point out that previous leaders tolerated opposition while maintaining a firm grip on power, whereas Hassan is accused of leading with an authoritarian style that defies youth-led democracy movements elsewhere in the region.\n \n\n   \n  In Uganda, the opposition leader Bobi Wine, whose real name is Kyagulanyi Ssentamu, is the leader of what began as the “People Power” movement, which aims for a break with nearly four decades of the same leader. President Yoweri Museveni took his lowest-ever share of the vote in the 2021 election, marking the 43-year-old Wine as a formidable national leader.\n \n\n   \n  In Kenya, young people have been trying to hold President William Ruto accountable over official corruption and his alleged failure to keep campaign promises. Last year and earlier this year, they held demonstrations in the capital Nairobi that were so large and persistent that Ruto deployed the military to restore order.\n \n\n   \n  In  Mozambique  a year ago, violence erupted in the streets after the opposition figure Venâncio Mondlane brought his supporters to the streets of the capital Maputo following a disputed election.\n \n\n   \n  In  Madagascar  earlier in October, protests by mostly young people helped overthrow the government of President Andry Rajoelina, who fled the country after an elite group of the military joined crowds protesting water and electricity cuts.\n \n\n   \n    Tanzania is an outlier\n \n\n   \n  But Tanzania is different, an outlier in the region.\n \n\n   \n  A version of the governing CCM party, which maintains ties with the Communist Party of China, has ruled Tanzania since independence from Britain in 1961, a remarkable streak that Hassan is trying to extend as opposition leaders try to break CCM’s grip on the country.\n \n\n   \n  CCM is fused with the state, effectively in charge of the security apparatus and structured in such a way that new leaders emerge every five or ten years. Hassan herself was able to rise to the presidency as vice president without incident when her predecessor, John Pombe Magufuli, died suddenly after the start of his second term.\n \n\n   \n  The orderly transition sustained Tanzania’s reputation as an oasis of political stability and relative peace, a major reason for CCM’s considerable support, especially among rural voters.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/shutdown-snap-food-stamps-trump-congress-analysis","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"10:51:00-10:51","title":"Bitter Washington blame game rages as pain grips needy Americans","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A prolonged federal government shutdown has reached its 30th day, causing severe hardship for millions of Americans.

grips needy Americans \n       \n  Analysis by Stephen Collinson, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:51 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The air is turning blue over the Capitol Dome. And the government is more shut than ever.\n \n\n   \n  Washington woke Thursday to a whiff of rare hope that  behind-the-scenes efforts  were accelerating in the Senate to end a federal shutdown now imposing severe pain on millions of Americans.\n \n\n   \n  But the day ended with senators skipping town for the weekend — to join members of the House not seen inside the Beltway for so long it’s hard to remember what they look like.\n \n\n   \n  Trump made his first intervention in the shutdown drama since returning from a trip to Asia,  calling on Senate Republicans to end the filibuster  — the device that requires 60 votes to pass most major legislation and currently represents the only brake on his power that Democrats have in Washington.\n \n\n   \n  “It is now time for the Republicans to play their ‘TRUMP CARD,’ and go for what is called the Nuclear Option,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  Such a move would allow Republicans to open the government while bypassing Democratic demands. But it would open the possibility that Democrats could pass into law sweeping progressive reforms and roll back swaths of the conservative agenda if they control both chambers of Congress at some point in the future. Trump may not care what happens when he’s no longer president, but eliminating the filibuster would represent a fundamental political shift.\n \n\n   \n  This new wrinkle in Trump’s strategy will no doubt pile more pressure on Senate Majority Leader John Thune. And while Trump can shift his position from one moment to the next, his new gambit may indicate he’s more interested in crushing Democrats than seeking a way out of the increasingly damaging shutdown. Republican leaders in both parties have stated they don’t support ending the filibuster because of the implications for any future Democratic majority.\n \n\n   \n  What’s so galling in the current shutdown   is that both Republicans and Democrats insist they are keeping faith with their duties — taking care of the American people — but that the other side is willing to drive ordinary citizens to the brink of hunger or sickness.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Democrats triggered the shutdown, refusing to extend federal funding until Republicans agree to extend expiring  enhanced Obamacare subsidies , without which millions of citizens will see  the cost of health care rocket .\n \n\n   \n  Republicans are willing to talk — but only when the government is opened again. Their assurances aren’t being taken at face value since their president routinely ignores the terms of deals and Congress’ constitutionally sound decisions on how to spend taxpayer money.\n \n\n   \n  The result:  Vital SNAP benefits  that help feed more than 40 million people are within hours of running out. Federal workers deemed essential have slogged through demoralizing weeks without pay. And it’s no vacation for their furloughed colleagues either: Financial obligations aren’t shut down just because the government is.\n \n\n   \n  Little is evident on the horizon that could prevent the monthlong shutdown from becoming the longest on record next week.\n \n\n   \n  In the absence of meaningful progress, dismayed lawmakers spent the day venting and trading insults.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats accused Republicans of starving kids. Vice President JD Vance accused Democrats of putting extreme pressure  on air traffic controllers , implying they were risking the nation’s “extra safe” skies.\n \n\n   \n  Wyoming Republican Sen. Cynthia Lummis said that staying in town for another weekend waiting for Democrats to come to the table “is gonna be a waste of time.” Sen. Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat, told CNN’s Dana Bash he was shocked “at the level of cruelty” shown by his GOP colleagues.\n \n\n   \n  And renegade Pennsylvania Democratic Sen. John Fetterman has had it up to here with everyone. “It’s an absolute failure what occurred here for the last month,”  Fetterman told CNN . He also complained about his own party’s tactics. “We can’t even get our sh*t together and just open up our government,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    One judge says she won’t let people die\n \n\n   \n  Democrats might have some justification in arguing that Republicans and their health care policies and endless attempts to kill Obamacare set the stage for this crisis. But Republicans can also point to the great contradiction of the Democratic strategy: The shutdown has now become a test of which bloc of unfortunate Americans are hurting the most — those who risk losing health care or those who don’t have enough to eat.\n \n\n   \n  Shutdowns typically end when one party can’t bear the political price of the government staying closed. In many ways, these showdowns are Washington games that can define the course of presidencies and Congresses.\n \n\n   \n  But the fact that it’s now been a month and neither side is willing to blink is also a symptom of a broken political system and a Congress that can no longer do its basic constitutional task of funding the government. And any victory for either party at this point will be hollow, since it will be built on the suffering of citizens.\n \n\n   \n  One federal judge in Boston is doing what the judiciary often seems to do these days: stepping in where Congress has failed.  US District Judge Indira Talwani  signaled she will intervene in the dispute over the Trump administration’s refusal to use billions of dollars in emergency funds to fund food stamps under SNAP.\n \n\n   \n  “Right now, Congress has put money in an emergency fund for an emergency, and it’s hard for me to understand how this isn’t an emergency when there’s no money and a lot of people are needing their SNAP benefits,” Talwani said in the kind of plain English that lawmakers seem to shed when they get to Washington.\n \n\n   \n  “The idea that we’re going to do the absolutely most drastic thing, which is that there’s not just less money but no money, seems the farthest thing from” what Congress intended, Talwani said. “We’re not going to make everyone drop dead” from hunger.\n \n\n   \n    Is there any hope for a breakthrough?\n \n\n   \n  Sometimes in Washington, the darkest hour is the one before dawn. So maybe there’s a chance the vicious rhetoric is a smokescreen allowing everyone to vent before they compromise.\n \n\n   \n  But there’s another characteristic of modern Washington that may be more apt right now — the way that disaster always has to nearly strike before two parties mired in their ideological extremes find a sliver of common ground.\n \n\n   \n  But at some point, this shutdown will end. It has to.\n \n\n   \n  If the denouement does not come from a president who discovers a moral or political imperative to live up to his 2016 convention vow, “I alone can fix it,” it may emerge from a creative fudge in the Senate in which Republicans give a handful of Democratic senators political cover to vote to break the filibuster and reopen the government.\n \n\n   \n  Thune — who ditched his suave self-control on Wednesday to  rage at Democrats  in a Senate rant — struck one hopeful note when he said there was an uptick in bipartisan conversations this week. “We got members on both sides who are continuing to dialogue,” he told reporters.\n \n\n   \n  But Thune doesn’t yet have the political space to offer Democrats the kind of tangible deliverables they would need. “When they’re willing to produce the votes to open up the government, we’re going to talk,” he said, restating the sticking point.\n \n\n   \n  One possible endgame scenario is that the Senate could blur the sequencing of when the government reopens and talks get serious on Obamacare subsidies. But knowing how something might eventually end is easier than getting there.\n \n\n   \n  Therefore, in the absence of progress, everyone had to fill the space.\n \n\n   \n  “We are now beginning Day 30 of the Democrat shutdown,” said House Speaker Mike Johnson, of Louisiana. “There are millions of Americans … that are bracing themselves for further pain and hardship.”\n \n\n   \n  House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York accused the administration of enacting “policy violence” by refusing to extend Obamacare subsidies while offering a  $20 billion bailout  to Trump’s MAGA pal President Javier Milei in Argentina.\n \n\n   \n  Republican Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming said he wasn’t worried about his own air travel as air traffic control snarls, but did “worry about the flights of thousands and thousands of people.” Mixing transportation metaphors, he accused Democrats of being “way off the rails.”\n \n\n   \n  And Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York followed his warning on Wednesday that Trump “is a vindictive politician and a heartless politician and a heartless man” by accusing Republicans of bringing down “the specter of financial disaster” on Americans — including in red states — over health care.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not exactly promising.\n \n\n   \n  But Thune told reporters, “I’m always optimistic. Aren’t you?”\n \n\n   \n  That’s a tough one, senator.\n \n\n   \n   This article has been updated with new reporting as well as to correct Sen. Cynthia Lummis’ state, Wyoming. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/entertainment/billie-eilish-billionaires-donation","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"09:51:00-04:00","title":"Billie Eilish Urged Billionaires to Give Away Their Money After Announcing $11.5 Million Donation to Climate and Social Causes","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"At the Wall Street Journal Magazine Innovator Awards in New York City, Billie Eilish accepted the Music Innovator Award and publicly urged billionaires, including Mark Zuckerberg, to give away their wealth, emphasizing the current global crisis of inequality, environmental degradation, and social injustice.

It caught even some advisers by surprise. \n       \n  By Kevin Liptak, Kylie Atwood, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:12 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  When Chinese leader Xi Jinping inserted a reference to “twists and turns” in his relationship with  President Donald Trump  in the opening remarks of their summit this week, he could hardly have imagined the twist that came minutes before the talks began.\n \n\n   \n  Writing from Marine One, which was gliding toward the airport in South Korea where he was due to meet Xi, Trump  instructed the Pentagon  to resume nuclear testing after a 33-year pause, citing other nations’ — including China’s — own capabilities.\n \n\n   \n  “That process will begin immediately,” the president wrote on social media.\n \n\n   \n  The directive took even many of Trump’s advisers off guard, according to officials, leading to unanswered questions about when, or if, the testing would actually begin. Historically, it is the Department of Energy that maintains and tests the US nuclear stockpile, not the Department of Defense. And engineers have said accurate tests can be conducted through computer simulation, not blowing up an actual warhead underwater or in the Nevada desert.\n \n\n   \n  Hours after the president’s post, it did not appear as if the Pentagon was moving swiftly to test a nuclear weapon. Testifying on Capitol Hill, the senior military officer nominated to oversee the American nuclear arsenal said Thursday morning he was not “reading anything” into Trump’s Truth Social post — an indication, if one was needed, that the instructions hadn’t been previewed very widely ahead of time.\n \n\n   \n  The surprise message only underscored the volatile approach Trump is taking to foreign affairs nine months into his second administration. Even as he was about to sit down for a meeting intended to lend stability to the world’s most important bilateral relationship, Trump demonstrated his willingness to suddenly veer in an unexpected direction.\n \n\n   \n  Administration officials offered little clarity when questioned about the message on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the president’s Truth speaks for itself,” Vice President JD Vance said as he took questions from reporters at the White House. “We have a big arsenal. Obviously, the Russians have a large nuclear arsenal. The Chinese have a large nuclear arsenal. Sometimes you’ve got to test it to make sure that it’s functioning and working properly.”\n \n\n   \n  “To be clear, we know that it does work properly,” he added later, “but you got to keep on top of it over time, and the president just wants to make sure that we do that.”\n \n\n   \n  When asked by reporters in Malaysia on Friday about Trump’s post, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the Pentagon would move quickly and work with the Department of Energy. He argued that “resuming testing is a pretty responsible” way to keep a “credible nuclear deterrent.”\n \n\n   \n  Dating back to his first term, Trump has always maintained a somewhat complicated relationship to the nuclear weapons he can launch from a secure suitcase anywhere he goes.\n \n\n   \n  A product of the nuclear era, he recently voiced wariness at even mentioning the word itself: “We can’t let people throw around that word,” the president told generals last month. “I call it the n-word. There are two n-words, and you can’t use either of them.”\n \n\n   \n  He seemed less cautious in his  Truth Social message  this week.\n \n\n   \n  “The United States has more Nuclear Weapons than any other country,” he wrote. “This was accomplished, including a complete update and renovation of existing weapons, during my First Term in office. Because of the tremendous destructive power, I HATED to do it, but had no choice!”\n \n\n   \n  Afterwards, Trump was circumspect about what tests, precisely, he was asking for.\n \n\n   \n  “With others doing testing, I think it’s appropriate that we do also,” Trump said aboard Air Force One as he was returning to Washington.\n \n\n   \n  He said nuclear test sites would be determined later, and specified his message did not relate to China — even though he named the country specifically in his message. “It had to do with others,” he said vaguely.\n \n\n   \n  Some officials said Trump may have been prompted by Moscow’s test flights in recent days of nuclear-capable cruise missiles and torpedoes, though their existence was already known and the tests did not involve a nuclear detonation. There is also no US equivalent to those Russian systems that could be tested to demonstrate equivalence, because the US decided decades ago that developing those systems was unproductive, said a former Trump administration official who worked on nuclear issues.\n \n\n   \n  Neither China nor Russia have conducted a nuclear test in decades. While China has worked rapidly to expand its arsenal, it is not known to have conducted an explosive test since 1996.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing’s speedy buildup in nuclear weapons has nonetheless generated concern among administration officials, who regard the issue as yet another point of friction in an increasingly tense relationship. Xi presided over a flashy parade of China’s nuclear-capable missiles last month.\n \n\n   \n  “Russia has nearly completed their modernization of all of their nuclear forces, and China is modernizing, and they are growing their arsenal at a breathtaking speed,” Elbridge Colby, the US undersecretary of defense for policy, said during his confirmation hearing this year.\n \n\n   \n  Still, if Trump was ordering up the first test of a US nuclear explosive since 1992, it came as news to the military officer he nominated to oversee the nation’s vast arsenal of nuclear weapons.\n \n\n   \n  “I wouldn’t presume that the president’s words meant nuclear testing,” Vice Adm. Richard Correll, whom Trump tapped to head up US Strategic Command, said before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “I believe the quote was, ‘start testing our nuclear weapons on an equal basis,’” Correll went on. “Neither China or Russia has conducted a nuclear explosive test, so I’m not reading anything into it or reading anything out to it.”\n \n\n   \n  If confirmed to the position, Correll would be responsible for the more than 41,000 service members who look after components of the US nuclear weapons program, including submarines, ballistic missiles and Air Force bomber aircraft. He has served as the deputy commander of US Strategic Command since 2022 — so it’d be unusual if he didn’t know know about a change in the decadeslong moratorium on nuclear testing.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has not changed the nuclear modernization policy that was put into place during the final year of the Biden administration, with the aim of pivoting the strategic plan to deter China’s nuclear buildup. But carrying out a nuclear test could set back that modernization strategy because it would reorient the focus of the officials working on those ongoing efforts, according to former US officials who worked on nuclear issues.\n \n\n   \n  There are also concerns among those officials that Trump declaring the intent for US nuclear testing would actually benefit China — not the US.\n \n\n   \n  “The mere suggestion that the US may resume nuclear testing could give the green light to China to resume explosive testing, and the Chinese would benefit comparatively more than anyone else if testing resumed. There is no technical reason for the US to do this now. But for China, it could technically advance their capabilities,” a former senior US official said.\n \n\n   \n  Yet Trump has long approached nuclear weapons with a combination of morbid fascination and bombastic threats.\n \n\n   \n  In August, he announced he was ordering two nuclear submarines to be strategically positioned near Russia in response to what he said were aggressive remarks by Dmitry Medvedev, the country’s former president and current deputy chairman of its Security Council. He never clarified whether he was referring to subs with nuclear weapon capabilities, or merely nuclear-powered subs.\n \n\n   \n  In a particularly heated moment from his first term, Trump taunted North Korea’s Kim Jong Un — whose 2017 underground test is the last known example of explosive nuclear testing — for the relative size of his “nuclear button.”\n \n\n   \n  “I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!” Trump wrote on social media in 2018.\n \n\n   \n  He and Kim eventually improved relations and met in person three times — though Trump was never able to convince the despot to abandon his nuclear weapons.\n \n\n   \n  Now, Trump appears hopeful to begin tests quickly — though just how quickly may depend on his willingness to break international rules.\n \n\n   \n  “If the United States needed to conduct an immediate nuclear test to, say, verify that some of its weapons were working or for political purposes, it could violate a whole number of treaties that ban doing that in the atmosphere. And that could happen in a matter of weeks or maybe months,” said Jon Wolfsthal, a former senior director for arms control and nonproliferation at the National Security Council, who now is director of global risk at the Federation of American Scientists.\n \n\n   \n  “The United States has a test site just outside Nevada where we conducted these tests in the 1990s and before,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  “But it’s not poised to conduct testing anytime soon, and it takes years to scientifically instrument a test to make sure you’re getting the data out of it that you need. And I also assume that states like Nevada and others would sue to block the president’s ability to do this. So we’re several years away from being able to conduct explosive nuclear tests.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/tech/microsoft-amazon-meta-google-earnings-ai","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"10:05:00-04:00","title":"Big Tech Keeps Splurging on AI.

splurging on AI. The pressure is ramping up to show why \n       \n  By Lisa Eadicicco, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:05 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Silicon Valley’s mega AI spending spree isn’t slowing down anytime soon. But Wall Street’s patience to see a return might be wearing a little thin.\n \n\n   \n  That message rang clear when Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple and Google parent Alphabet all said this week that they’re forking over more   on capital expenditures, like   leases and equipment for data centers and infrastructure.\n \n\n   \n  Based on the way analysts grilled executives from companies like Meta, Alphabet and Google on earnings calls this week, they’re eager for signs that these massive investments will pay off in a big way.\n \n\n   \n    AI spending continues to soar\n \n\n   \n  Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta all grew their overall revenue year-over-year and surpassed Wall Street’s expectations. Microsoft and Google saw their cloud businesses expand by 40% and 34% respectively, while Amazon Web Services sales grew 20% year-over-year – a sign that companies are indeed relying on their services in the age of AI.\n \n\n   \n  And they’re continuing to pour tens of billions of dollars into AI infrastructure and data centers, an investment they call necessary for the internet’s next era.\n \n\n   \n  The dollar amounts involved are staggering.\n \n\n   \n  Google expects to   spend $91 to $93 billion in capital expenditures for 2025, up from the $85 billion it previously forecast. Microsoft sees that spending   up 74%, to $34.9 billion this year, largely lining up with the more than $30 billion it predicted for the quarter. Meta spent $19.37 billion, up from $9.2 billion a year ago and more than the $18.4 billion analysts expected.\n \n\n   \n  And Amazon estimates the 2025 bill will hit $125 billion – and   expects to increase that in 2026.\n \n\n   \n  Even Apple, which is not a major cloud provider, expects to increase its capital expenditure spending related to AI investments, Apple Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh said on the company’s Thursday earnings call.\n \n\n   \n  Existing data centers need to be upgraded to handle AI workloads, leading to the giant outlays, said Melissa Otto, head of research for investment research service S&P Global Visible Alpha.\n \n\n   \n  Tech giants justify that spending by saying demand is outstripping supply. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said that “as fast as we’re adding capacity right now, we’re monetizing it.”\n \n\n   \n    Wall Street wants big answers from Big Tech\n \n\n   \n  But Wall Street wants more than just promises of future returns. Meta shares fell as much as 13.5% on Thursday, while Microsoft’s were down more than 3%.\n \n\n   \n  Nearly every question on Meta’s earnings call focused on how the company views its AI investments translating into income, the timeline for new products and models coming out of its Superintelligence Lab and its general approach to AI.\n \n\n   \n  Zuckerberg called AI useful for powering virtual assistants and helping advertisers plan their campaigns. More than a billion people use Meta AI on a monthly basis, he said, adding that AI can lead to “all kinds of new products around different content formats.”\n \n\n   \n  “We expect to build novel models and novel products, and I’m excited to share more when we have it,” he said about the Superintelligence Lab’s efforts.\n \n\n   \n  On the Microsoft call, analysts wanted to know if clients will make good on promised purchasing commitments and whether the tech industry can really make money from global AI investments. Amy Hood, Microsoft’s chief financial officer, said its investments reflect business that’s already been booked, saying that demand is increasing.\n \n\n   \n  Google investors wanted to know how AI summaries and agents are changing how the company makes money from search. Google’s chief business officer said the company makes about the same money from ads   below and within the AI responses as with traditional search.\n \n\n   \n  The answers satisfied some analysts; UBS said it maintains its “conviction that AI-related stocks should drive further equity performance,” while CFRA Research said it came away from the quarter “more optimistic” about Google’s core business and that Meta “remains committed to becoming the leading AI lab.” Wedbush Securities’ Dan Ives said Microsoft is “hitting its next phase of monetization on the AI front.”\n \n\n   \n  But that’s as long as they keep growing the products that catapulted them to become the world’s largest tech companies in the first place. Investors are more likely to raise their eyebrows at all this spending if customers start shying away from Meta’s social media apps or Google’s search engine, according to Otto.\n \n\n   \n  “You’re seeing a pressure to accelerate innovation,” said SuRo Capital’s Evan Schlossman. “You have new space in AI that people believe will be extremely valuable, and so there is a rush to sort of fill that void.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/us/broadview-ice-facility-illinois-lawsuit","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"09:45:00-05:00","title":"Advocates allege ‘inhumane’ conditions at Chicago-area ICE facility in new lawsuit","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Advocacy groups, including the ACLU of Illinois and the MacArthur Justice Center, have filed a lawsuit alleging inhumane conditions and systemic violations of legal rights at the Broadview immigration detention facility in Chicago.

found a way to test  ancient human  remains for hormones linked with pregnancy, a breakthrough that may allow archaeologists to determine whether a woman was pregnant or had recently given birth at the time of her death.\n \n\n   \n  Researchers found key reproductive hormones estrogen, progesterone and testosterone in hard tissues, such as the bones and teeth, of skeletons dating back as far as 1,000 years, according to a study published October 2 in the  Journal of Archaeological Science .\n \n\n   \n  “We found a ‘hormone archive’ in skeletons and teeth,” said lead study author Aimée Barlow, an archaeologist at the University of Sheffield, northern England.\n \n\n   \n  “This is a first. Nobody has ever detected these specific hormones in teeth or dental calculus before,” Barlow told CNN. “It is also the first time progesterone has been successfully measured in human bone tissue.”\n \n\n   \n  Pregnancy is difficult to detect in ancient human remains, and scientists previously believed that the composition of hard tissues was so overwhelmingly inorganic that these proteins would not be preserved or detected, Barlow said.\n \n\n   \n  Nonetheless, she decided to test a number of samples from seven female and three male skeletons dating from the first to 19th centuries using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). ELISA is an existing technique used to detect and quantify peptide and protein molecules such as progesterone, a key biomarker for pregnancy, the levels of which increase significantly during the first trimester and are maintained throughout.\n \n\n   \n  Levels of estrogen and testosterone also rise, although not to the same extent, meaning that it was important to also consider the relationship between the three hormones, according to the study.\n \n\n   \n  The tests revealed that estrogen, progesterone and testosterone were measurable in bone, and dentin, enamel, calculus and root samples from teeth. “High progesterone levels in dental structures and calculus, the presence of oestrogen in bone, and a lack of testosterone in hard tissues was consistent with pregnancy at the time of death,” the study authors wrote.\n \n\n   \n  This demonstrates “the feasibility and significant potential of the ELISA method for the detection of sex hormones in human skeletal remains to examine the reproductive histories of past populations,” according to the study.\n \n\n   \n  Barlow said proving that the skeleton can preserve hormones would, with many years of further study, potentially allow researchers to determine the age at which a woman first became pregnant, whether she experienced pregnancy loss and how much time had passed between births if she had multiple children.\n \n\n   \n  “This will be especially useful for historical periods where no written records exist,” Barlow said.\n \n\n   \n  More work is needed to fully develop the technique for use on ancient remains, she said, including establishing a baseline of hormone levels in skeletal tissues by conducting a much larger study that also involves living individuals with detailed medical records.\n \n\n   \n  “Secondly, we need to understand the fundamental science. We need to learn how these hormones get incorporated into and stored within these different tissues,” Barlow said.\n \n\n   \n  “And we need to explore how these hormones are preserved and broken down (degraded) over time in different burial environments.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Groundbreaking’ findings\n \n\n   \n  Nikolas Lemos, professor of forensic medical sciences at Queen Mary University of London, who was not involved in the study, told CNN that “this is a pioneering study … which has achieved a world-first.”\n \n\n   \n  Lemos underlined that the sample size was “very small,” with only two of the 10 individuals pregnant at death, adding that the ELISA method requires “further testing and validation.”\n \n\n   \n  “In short, while the findings are groundbreaking, they should be viewed as proof of concept, not yet as a routine diagnostic tool,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “Although the work is still in its early stages, it represents a remarkable step toward understanding the intimate, hormonal dimensions of life and death in the distant past,” Lemos added.\n \n\n   \n  Alexander Comninos, a professor of endocrinology at Imperial College London, who was not involved in the study, said that the research was “fascinating.”\n \n\n   \n  “By understanding reproductive profiles of the past, this can provide insights into how these may have changed over time and perhaps glimpses of the future,” he told CNN in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  “In addition, the ability to identify these key hormones in bone can trigger further contemporary work in the bone field,” Comninos added.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/us/abby-zwerner-lawsuit-trial-shot","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"09:34:00-04:00","title":"Teacher shot by a 6-year-old student thought she was ‘on my way to heaven.’ What we learned from Abby Zwerner’s testimony","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Teacher Abby Zwerner was shot in the hand and chest by a 6-year-old student at Richneck Elementary School in Newport News, Virginia, on January 6, 2023.

CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:34 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Abby Zwerner instinctively raised her hand toward her heart when she saw the 6-year-old holding the gun.\n \n\n   \n  After the bullet hit her, “I thought I was on my way to heaven or in heaven,” Zwerner  testified  Thursday during her civil case against a former school official accused of neglecting warning signs the student   had brought a gun to school.\n \n\n   \n  “I thought I was dying. I thought I had died,” Zwerner said with a catch in her voice as she recounted the moment she was shot in the hand and chest on January 6, 2023, while sitting at a reading table in her classroom at Richneck Elementary School in Newport News.\n \n\n   \n  The boy’s   “blank look” as he aimed at her is a memory Zwerner said she can’t shake.\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner has filed a $40 million  lawsuit  against ex-assistant principal   Ebony Parker, saying Parker failed to act when several people approached her with concerns the boy had brought a gun to school.\n \n\n   \n  Parker also faces  eight counts  of felony child neglect in the criminal trial against her next month.\n \n\n   \n  The case offers a window into what to expect for the upcoming criminal trial against Parker. Both trials raise questions about who is responsible when children with access to guns carry out school shootings, a pervasive problem across the country.\n \n\n   \n  As of Monday, there have been  64 school shootings  in the United States this year, 27 of which took place on K-12 school grounds.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we learned from Zwerner’s moving and highly anticipated testimony.\n \n\n   \n    Effects of shooting linger\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner’s devastating hand injury has left her unable to do everyday things like open a bottle of   water.\n \n\n   \n  “I was trying to open the bag of chips on my own multiple times, different ways — trying to hold it different ways,” she testified about a recent lunch with her attorney. “And I eventually asked you to open it.”\n \n\n   \n  Even after six surgeries, Zwerner’s hand will never be normal, an orthopedic surgeon testified this week.\n \n\n   \n  Previous testimony from doctors on her care team revealed Zwerner’s injuries were life-threatening after a bullet narrowly missed her heart. And the impacts extended beyond the physical damage, she testified.\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner struggled to describe how she now feels around people, even loved ones, but indicated she feels a “distance” and “numbness.”\n \n\n   \n  Psychiatrist Dr. Clarence Watson testified Thursday Zwerner has suffered post-traumatic stress disorder after the shooting.\n \n\n   \n  “She has lost the sense of being safe, something that she had not experienced before, even when she was feeling depressed or anxious … She now doesn’t want to go anywhere,” Watson said. “She had become socially withdrawn and isolated, pulled away from friends, didn’t want to be in public as much, and felt fear in places that she didn’t feel fear before.”\n \n\n   \n  Even a planned outing to the movies to see “Hamilton,” which features a duel scene with guns, became an overwhelming task that left her in tears, Zwerner said.\n \n\n   \n  When her mother asked her what she wanted to do instead, she felt resigned.\n \n\n   \n  “I remember saying or telling them, ‘nowhere, like I can’t go anywhere. I just want to stay home,’” Zwerner said.\n \n\n   \n    Defense tries to undercut teacher’s testimony\n \n\n   \n  During cross-examination Thursday, an attorney for Parker worked to undermine Zwerner’s claims that the shooting has limited her willingness to go out in public.\n \n\n   \n  The attorney presented evidence Zwerner had been emotionally ready to attend concerts since the shooting, including the Taylor Swift Eras tour.\n \n\n   \n  The attorney also sought to undermine claims Zwerner is physically hindered by her wounds, asking Zwerner how she successfully attended and graduated from cosmetology school, worked and frequented a gym if she had physical limitations.\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner was proud of graduating but was often in pain, she said. She has yet to get a job in cosmetology and can’t work in the field until her hand heals from her latest surgery, she said.\n \n\n   \n  Additionally, her doctor had cleared her to do light workouts and she tried her best to do that with weights, Zwerner testified.\n \n\n   \n  The defense also pressed Zwerner on whether there was more she could have done after learning of the possible gun threat.\n \n\n   \n  Another school staffer told her about the boy potentially having a gun and she did not inform Parker because she knew the other staffer was going to, Zwerner testified.\n \n\n   \n  Parker’s attorneys are trying to paint a picture that Zwerner may have been “a little bit at fault” for not acting on information that she had, said Darryl K. Brown, a law professor at the University of Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  “That can be the basis for the defendant not being held negligent and having to pay damages, even if the defendant is more at fault, or mostly at fault,” Brown said .   \n \n\n   \n    What’s next\n \n\n   \n  The jury will reconvene Monday morning in the ongoing civil trial — which could be a roadmap for what’s to come with the criminal litigation against Parker.\n \n\n   \n  Holding civil cases before criminal ones is “really unusual,” Brown said. It may be because Parker waived her right to a speedy trial, and because the defense wants it that way, he added.\n \n\n   \n  “I suspect that defense would want the civil trial to go forward first, because they’re not going to be able to avoid it, and it gives them a lot of information about what would come in at the criminal trial,” Brown said.\n \n\n   \n  While Zwerner’s pain and suffering have taken center stage in this trial, the upcoming   criminal trial would be more likely to touch on what action Parker failed to take, given her duty to protect children, Brown said.\n \n\n   \n  “The more important evidence for the prosecution would be from other witnesses and sources that reveal what the defendant knew with respect to the threat the child posed, and whether he had a gun,” the professor said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/travel/halloween-decorations-st-jude-fundraiser","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"09:00:00-04:00","title":"This Veteran’s Halloween Spirit Gave Him a New Purpose.

We want to help sick children get out of the hospital so they can see all these neat Halloween decorations.’”\n \n\n   \n  So the family printed a simple sign on their front yard that said in part: If you like what you see, feel free to donate to St. Jude – a leading children’s hospital for kids with cancer and other diseases.\n \n\n   \n  Within days, Robertson said a car pulled up with an emotional couple and their young daughter in the backseat. The tearful father told Robertson that they’re a St. Jude family and wanted to thank him for raising money for pay for treatment for families like them.\n \n\n   \n  Robertson didn’t get their names and they never saw each other again. But that encounter changed everything for him.\n \n\n   \n  “I’d been looking for purpose after retiring from the service,” he said. “This little girl was going through such a tough time, but she saw these goofy plastic skeletons in my yard, it put her in an awesome place.”\n \n\n   \n  The family raised  over $8,000 in 2020  – and the next year, Robertson created a Facebook group called Skeletons for St. Jude to spread the idea nationwide.\n \n\n   \n  This spooky season, the group has more than 5,000 members, and over 1,000 partner homes across the country have joined the cause and raised funds. On October 21, they officially hit the $1 million mark.\n \n\n   \n  Robertson’s neighborhood in North Carolina looks forward to his epic display every year with scores of visitors stopping by every day all month long to soak in the skeleton spectacle.\n \n\n   \n  It takes Robertson a whole year to plan the theme and build new props. He’s accumulated 100 or so toy skeletons that he keeps in storage, and he adds onto the display every day until Halloween — so there’s always something new for visitors to see.\n \n\n   \n  This October, skeletons are sailing on a 25-foot phantom pirate ship that Robertson has positioned so it appears to have crashed through the first and second stories of his house.\n \n\n   \n  “The real focus isn’t on me,” Robertson said. “It’s on the thousands of people giving five or ten dollars here and there. That’s what made this a success.”\n \n\n   \n  Robertson is grateful knowing this money will help families focus on getting their kids better.

collects the results from all municipalities in the Netherlands.\n \n\n   \n  D66 is now expected to take the lead in a first round of talks to form a coalition  government , a process which usually

\nUpdated: \n        9:22 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The placard attached to the podium read “Protecting the most vulnerable,’’ but on this particular Wednesday Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry took aim at a very specific apex predator: Big-time football.\n \n\n   \n  The governor, who was supposed to be talking about  food stamps that are nearing a crisis point due to the government shutdown , instead launched a verbal grenade directed squarely at the Louisiana State University Athletics Administration Building – aimed more specifically at the desk of athletic director Scott Woodward.\n \n\n   \n  Calling out not just the lack of success under football head coach Brian Kelly but the $53 million bill LSU now has to foot to give the coach his walking papers, Landry publicly defrocked Woodward, making it clear that the man in charge of LSU athletics would not be making the biggest hire for LSU athletics.\n \n\n   \n  “My role is about the fiscal effect of firing a coach under a terrible contract,’’ Landry said after being asked about his role in Kelly’s dismissal after reports indicated discussions about the dismissal went all the way to the governor’s mansion.\n \n\n   \n  “I care about what the taxpayers are on the hook on, and I was not happy about raising ticket prices while we were having a losing season and we were paying a coach $100 million and not getting results.’’\n \n\n   \n  He wasn’t done there.  Landry told ABC  on Thursday that he plans to have the state’s attorney general review the next head coach’s contract “to understand what the extent under which the state is ultimately liable.”\n \n\n   \n  The remarks drew plenty of eye rolls. This is Louisiana, where Huey Long used his own gubernatorial position to influence LSU football nearly a 100 years ago. Pigskin and politics regularly mix.\n \n\n   \n  But in this case, Landry’s public tongue lashing resounded well beyond the reaches of the bayou, earning nods of approval in plenty of other far-flung circles of college athletics.\n \n\n   \n  “Finally, someone said it out loud,’’ said a board of trustees member at another institution. “This is so irresponsible.’’\n \n\n   \n    Buyout season\n \n\n   \n  LSU, after all, is not alone.  Since Oklahoma State fired Mike Gundy  on September 23 through Kelly’s dismissal one month later, 10 FBS schools have ousted their head coaches. Combined the coaches are owed $169 million, all coming at a time when college athletics is facing unprecedented costs.\n \n\n   \n  In June, U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken approved the $2.8 billion settlement coming from the so-called House settlement, requiring colleges to directly share revenue with their athletes. The estimated House payouts this year is $20.5 million. That will only go up annually.\n \n\n   \n  It has left plenty of university administrators equal parts dismayed and disgusted at what they believe is nothing shy of fiscal malfeasance, with schools hamstrung by deals presented as security blankets for the university but offering only protection for the coaches.\n \n\n   \n  “No one is flying the plane,’’ a board member at one of the schools affected said. “There’s not even a plane. It’s a hot air balloon. Whatever way the wind blows, that’s the way college sports go.’’\n \n\n   \n  That college football is spending at an unprecedented pace is not new news. Arguing a very expensive need to keep up with the Joneses (or maybe more accurately the Sabans and Meyers) to succeed, coaches long have asked for bigger, better and more.\n \n\n   \n  Facility one-upsmanship, all in the name of attracting better recruits, led to practice facilities with mini-golf courses (Clemson), marble showers in the locker room (Oregon) and sensory deprivation tanks (Georgia). Then came more staff – to run the analytics and sports performance and nutrition and, in some cases, the head coach. Texas has not one, not two but three special assistants to the head coach.\n \n\n   \n  Finally, when simply ballooning coaching contracts was no longer enough, the deals also had to be guaranteed, lest another school poach your leader.\n \n\n   \n  At the start of the season, nine head coaches were making more than $10 million annually, according to the USA Today head coaches database, and 12 had buyouts totaling more than $40 million, topped by Kirby Smart’s $105 million owed should Georgia decide to can him.\n \n\n   \n  Except now, as some of those bills come due at the same time revenue sharing comes into existence, the very real question is no longer an existential crisis. Just where is the money coming from?\n \n\n   \n  “I have no idea,’’ said another board member at an affected school. “The money does not exist.’’\n \n\n   \n  That startling and yet very real revelation flies in the face of what has long been the presiding sentiment about college football: That it is the big money meal ticket for an athletics department.\n \n\n   \n  For years it was not bottom-line accurate —rare was the department that ran in the black – but at least true in theory. Thanks to TV rights packages and tens of thousands of fannies in the seats on fall Saturdays, college football did draw the biggest paycheck.\n \n\n   \n  Except somewhere along the line the spending steamrolled ahead of the profits.\n \n\n   \n    ‘No one has the answer’\n \n\n   \n  Consider two of the schools on the hook for two of the biggest coaching buyouts: Penn State, which owes  James Franklin $49 million  and LSU, on the hook for $53 million for Kelly.\n \n\n   \n  According to the KnightNewhouse College Athletics Database, in the last 10 years Penn State’s football spending has jumped 113% but the entire department’s revenues have grown only 83%. At LSU, football spending jumped 44% and revenues just 40%.\n \n\n   \n  In the same decade, football coaching salaries (the entire staff) jumped 106% in State College and 90% in Baton Rouge while ticket sales only added an additional 33% and 37% respectively and donor contributions jumped 53% and 66%.\n \n\n   \n  The money owed can be mitigated. Most contracts include what are called best efforts clauses, which means the ex-coach can’t hole up in Cabo and get his entire paycheck. He has to look for a job, and should he land one, the salary owed will be less the salary gained.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s like being divorced and paying alimony,’’ one of the board members joked. “You’re rooting for them to get remarried.’’\n \n\n   \n  But it is not simply the head coaches that need to be paid out.  The Advertiser i n Louisiana reported that offensive coordinator Joe Sloan, fired along with Kelly, is due $530,000. Penn State defensive coordinator Jim Knowles reportedly is in the first year of a three-year deal worth $3.1 million annually and offensive coordinator Andy Kotelnicki is making $2.4 million. It will be up to the next coach – who, by the way, will not come at a bargain-basement price – to decide if they stay on.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile Penn State last year was on the hook for more than $900,000 in football coaching severance per the KnightNewhouse database, presumably due to Mike Yurcich, Kotelnicki’s predecessor who was fired in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  Penn State athletic director Pat Kraft, who through a spokesperson declined comment for this story, has insisted that Franklin’s buyout is “an athletics issue. This is not the institution’s issue. We in athletics are covering the costs.”\n \n\n   \n  But from where? “No one has the answer,’’ one of the board members said.\n \n\n   \n    No signs of stopping\n \n\n   \n  Still, the race to the top of the money pile goes on.\n \n\n   \n  A pitch to turn to private equity for the Big Ten has at least temporarily stalled, in large part because of pushback from conference members USC and Michigan. Deep-pocketed donors are now being asked to foot the bill for coaching salaries, facilities improvements and – thanks to the House settlement – player contracts.\n \n\n   \n  Virginia Tech recently announced a planned $229 million investment in athletics over the next four years. Along with seeking donor support for $30 million of that annually, the university said there will be “limited increases in student fees.’’ In 2024, student fees generated $14.5 million for the athletic department.\n \n\n   \n  “That deal should terrify boards everywhere,’’ one of the trustees said.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the logic gleaned from the accounting books arguing to the contrary, spending is showing no signs of stopping.  Curt Cignetti has done wonders  at Indiana, elevating a program that ranked somewhere below historically dormant to No. 2 in the nation.\n \n\n   \n  He has coached 21 games at Indiana – 21 at the FBS level entirely. And last week the school inked him to an eight-year, $93 million deal. It’s all guaranteed.\n \n\n   \n  And less than 24 hours after the governor undercut Woodward at LSU, the athletic director was, to no one’s surprise, negotiating his exit strategy from the school. That leaves the school without a university president (William Tate left in May to take the same position at Rutgers), no football coach and no athletic director.\n \n\n   \n  According to Yahoo Sports, Woodward is owed somewhere in the neighborhood of $6.4 million. The school is expected to honor the terms – another buyout on the Bayou.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/media/disney-youtube-deal-biz-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"07:30:00-04:00","title":"Disney channels go dark on YouTube TV after media giants fail to resolve carriage dispute","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Disney has removed its channels, including ESPN, ABC, Disney Channel, FX, National Geographic, and Freeform, from YouTube TV following a failure to reach a new carriage agreement by the October 31, 2025 deadline.

nuclear testing. Here’s why experts are confused \n       \n  By Tom Foreman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A ghost of the Cold War is rising between the world’s superpowers, just in time for Halloween.\n \n\n   \n  In the wake of Russian President Vladimir Putin bragging about his country testing both a nuclear-powered torpedo and a new cruise missile, the president of the United States, Donald Trump, has fired back. In a lengthy post on his  Truth Social platform , Trump announced, “Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis. That process will begin immediately.”\n \n\n   \n  Now ,  nuclear watchdogs worldwide are wondering  what might come of Trump’s pronouncement  — and what he even means since the US hasn’t conducted a nuclear weapons test in decades.\n \n\n   \n  “First of all, every statement in that post is wrong,” said Matthew Bunn, a nuclear weapons expert at Harvard University. “It’s not true the United States has the world’s most nuclear weapons. It’s not true that other states are carrying out nuclear tests. (Trump) seems to think it’s the Department of Defense that carries out nuclear tests. It’s not. It’s the Department of Energy.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s own nominee to head the US Strategic Command seemed unclear of the president’s intent as he faced the Senate Armed Service Committee in a confirmation hearing Thursday. “Neither China nor Russia has conducted a nuclear explosive test,” Navy Vice Adm. Richard Correll said, “so I’m not reading anything into it or reading anything out.”\n \n\n   \n  The Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation defines nuclear tests as “generally controlled explosions of nuclear devise, such as bombs or warheads,” and Russia’s missile and torpedo tests do not meet that strict definition. \n \n\n   \n  What’s more, Jon Wolfsthal, who advised both Joe Biden and Barack Obama on nuclear matters, notes other nations are already conducting similar tests – along with the US. “Russia, the United States, China are all investing tens of billions of dollars on new nuclear delivery platforms – missiles, bombers, submarines,” Wolfsthal said. “We have returned to the arms race dynamics of the Cold War where each side believes nuclear weapons are important.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, if Trump truly wants to resume nuclear weapons testing, analysts say the complications are deep and wide. For starters, almost every nuclear-capable country in the world has voluntarily agreed to avoid such tests for decades. Russia ran its last test in 1990, the US in 1992 and China in 1996. North Korea is the only nation to conduct nuclear blasts this century, and that has contributed to Pyongyang’s status as an international pariah.\n \n\n   \n  Beyond the diplomatic risk of standing up a fresh set of tests in the US, there are technical challenges. Federal studies have shown staging such a test safely would likely require several years of preparation, and even then, it might yield little useful information. The US routinely tests nuclear weapons components so thoroughly that America is widely seen as holding a treasure trove of nuclear knowledge unmatched by any other country.\n \n\n   \n  Critics say if Trump ushers in a new era of testing, that will only open the door for any other nation with nuclear dreams to start catching up.\n \n\n   \n  “The country that would benefit the most would be China,” Bunn said.\n \n\n   \n  “It makes no sense from a strategic point of view for the United States,” said former Democratic congressman John Tierney, who now heads the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation.\n \n\n   \n  Nuclear weapons experts note that both Russia and China have stepped up their nuclear aspirations already. Some political analysts speculate that Trump is hoping to back them down with tough talk, a notion he seems to echo. “I’d like to see a denuclearization,” the president said. “We’re actually talking to Russia about that, and China would be added to that if we do something.”\n \n\n   \n  Neither the Defense Department nor the White House has offered a more complete explanation of the plan as of yet.\n \n\n   \n  But Tierney finds the president’s constantly shifting talk troublesome, to say the least. He fears in an already tense international environment, Trump is injecting more instability – which can prove explosive in its own way.\n \n\n   \n  “One day he wants everyone to get rid of their nukes,” Tierney says. “The next day he wants to start testing? It’s dangerous.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/style/maurizio-cattelan-america-gold-toilet-sothebys","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"06:33:00-04:00","title":"How much would you pay for an infamous gold toilet?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the controversial gold toilet sculpture titled 'America' by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan, originally exhibited at the Guggenheim Museum in 2016 and later stolen from Blenheim Palace in 2019.

Though the perpetrators  were convicted earlier this year , the fully functional, opulent toilet, titled “America,” was never found, believed to be cut up or melted down for the value of the gold itself, worth millions.\n \n\n   \n  But that isn’t the end of the saga for the satirical sculpture, which was once offered to President Donald J. Trump during his first term, in lieu of a Van Gogh painting requested by his administration (the counteroffer was  reportedly ignored) .\n \n\n   \n  Cattelan has previously stated he had made more than one edition of “America,” and now a second edition is making an unexpected, flashy debut on the art market next month.\n \n\n   \n  Sotheby’s in New York will sell the work, which has been in private (and anonymous) hands since 2017, on November 18. That also means the sculpture will be back on public view for a limited time, when the auction house installs it in the fourth-floor bathroom of its brand-new headquarters for 10 days leading up to the sale. This time, however, visitors will not be able to use it, per Sotheby’s. Officially that’s for security reasons, though one can guess why else.\n \n\n   \n  “The door will remain open,” said David Galperin, Sotheby’s head of contemporary art, laughing.\n \n\n   \n  Auctions typically have a set starting bid, informed by a number of market factors, as well as low and high sales numbers, estimated ahead of time. But the sale for this “America” will be worth its weight in gold — quite literally — as the starting figure will be its inherent value, fluctuating with the gold market right up until bidding begins. That will be somewhere in the $10 million range, according to the current value (with the price of gold lately  setting record highs ), plus whatever collectors deem its ascribed value to be.\n \n\n   \n  “The starting bid in accordance with the price of gold was really a way to lean into the very essence of the conceptual basis behind the artwork, which is largely to draw attention to the difference between a work’s artistic value, and a work’s inherent material value,” Galperin explained.\n \n\n   \n  It’s a “perfect foil” to Cattelan’s other equally infamous banana-on-a-wall, “Comedian,” which  sold for $6.24 million at Sotheby’s last fall , Galperin added. The duct-taped banana, worthless without Cattelan’s association, first debuted at Art Basel Miami on a bare white wall, originally priced at $120,000.  It has been eaten more than once .\n \n\n   \n  “If ‘Comedian’ was all about the intangibility of value and how we ascribe value to works of art, ‘America’ challenges that a step further by being in so many ways, intrinsically valuable, in a manner that so many works of art are not.”\n \n\n   \n  “America” is many things: a wry comment on the art world and the United States, as well as an object of torment for arts publicists and their lofty press statements. (The Guggenheim once described it as an opportunity for “unprecedented intimacy with a work of art.”) And this edition may actually be the only physical one in existence, according to Sotheby’s. Though the work is an edition of three, the auction house does not believe the third has been fabricated.\n \n\n   \n  Beyond the sculpture’s dramatic history, Galperin said “America” is an important 21st-century artwork, one with a direct lineage to landmark Modern art (see: Marcel Duchamp’s 1917 upside-down urinal “Fountain”), but with critical relevance to today.\n \n\n   \n  “Cattelan, for his entire career, has critiqued the system,” Galperin said, “whether it’s the viewers’ experience seeing art in a museum, the way that works of art move through the system, the way that they’re valued, the way that they change hands.\n \n\n   \n  “All of these concepts are things that artworks so rarely confront head on. His ability to do that and do it in such a legible way and impactful way is part of its success here.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/food/wendys-problems-third-quarter-earnings-preview","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00Z","title":"What’s wrong with Wendy’s?","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Wendy’s is facing a severe crisis in performance and investor confidence, with its stock down nearly 50% in 2025 and declining same-store sales.

about nowadays.\n \n\n   \n  The burger chain’s stock has lost nearly 50% of its value this year. Wendy’s executive suite has contended with several departures, and it’s currently operating without a permanent CEO after its previous leader abruptly left after just a year-and-a-half on the job. Plus, a confusing mix of promotions hurt sales last quarter.\n \n\n   \n  “We are not happy with our sales performance,” Ken Cook, Wendy’s CFO and interim CEO, bluntly admitted on its most recent earnings call in August.\n \n\n   \n  The fast food industry is in a slump, and Wendy’s isn’t immune. Chief rivals McDonald’s and Burger King also reported sluggish sales earlier this year as consumers cut back spending. However,  both rebounded  over the summer and fall thanks to an increased focus on marketing and targeted promotions.\n \n\n   \n  Not so much for Wendy’s.\n \n\n   \n  US sales at stores open at least a year in the third quarter are forecast to fall 5.8% when the company reports earnings next week, according to Jim Salera, a research analyst for Stephens. That’s even worse than the 3.6% decline in the previous quarter.\n \n\n   \n  “Investors are really focusing on when the company can get same-store sales trends moving back in the right direction and we had seen little progress of that,” Salera told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Wendy’s is being forced to take action, recently announcing an aggressive turnaround plan that aims to reignite sales. However, revitalizing a 55-year-old chain is not easy.\n \n\n   \n  McDonald’s, which has nearly triple the number of locations in the United States, found recent success with new deals and  menu items . McDonald’s recent growth has also eaten away at some of Wendy’s market share.\n \n\n   \n  Wendy’s sits in a “more of an elevated position where it’s not just focused on price,” Salera said, and is focused on quality. After all, the chain prides itself on its “fresh, never frozen” tagline for its patties, which has been  in use since its founding in 1969 .\n \n\n   \n  “But as consumers that are trading down or in some cases just trading out entirely and just skipping (fast food) occasions, McDonald’s is leading a lot more with price than an operator like Wendy’s,” he   added.\n \n\n   \n    Back to square one\n \n\n   \n  Wendy’s recently announced a  “comprehensive strategic plan”  called “Project Fresh,” under the guidance of former Taco Bell CEO Greg Creed.\n \n\n   \n  “Wendy’s board of directors and management team are dissatisfied with the current valuation of the company and have been working to put the company on the right path to create value for our franchisees, employees and shareholders,” said Art Winkleback, chairman of Wendy’s board, in an October 9 press release.\n \n\n   \n  Plans include refreshed marketing to remind customers of its “rich heritage of quality, innovation and unique voice.” The company also intends to help franchisees improve profits and increase investments in restaurant technology, like digital menus, to “enhance the customer experience.”\n \n\n   \n  BTIG analyst Peter Saleh, however, doesn’t think Wendy’s plan is “tackling the root of the problem” and that its “issues go far deeper than some marketing changes or some menu adjustments.”\n \n\n   \n  Rather, he said that Wendy’s problems stretches back more than a decade to   a  remodel initiative  of its US restaurants that was meant to modernize the chain. Instead, the final product was “watered down a lot” from its initial plan because of several leadership changes.\n \n\n   \n  “Wendy’s is now starting to talk about kind of a multi-year plan to install digital menu boards, which have been around for over a decade,” Saleh told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  For comparison, around the same time, McDonald’s  remodeled a vast majority  of its US restaurants, adding digital kiosks and refreshed interiors. The work was largely completed by 2020.\n \n\n   \n  “The biggest problem (Wendy’s) have is not their food … it’s (their restaurants) are old and tired,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Salera agreed that Wendy’s has a “solid offering” with its food. The chain recently relaunched its chicken tenders to  capitalize on the trend  for crispy chicken, and he complimented the  revamped Frosty  offerings to establish it as a “unique Wendy’s asset.”\n \n\n   \n  He said that the brand’s plan of “focusing and skimming down the number of promotions or limited-time offers is a positive (move),” especially after the variety of deals in the “100 Days of Summer” promotion proved to be  too complex  for customers to understand.\n \n\n   \n  Additional details of Wendy’s plan will be revealed during its November 7 earnings call.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/us/6-7-meme-slang-explained-cec","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"07:38:00Z","title":"The ‘6-7’ meme can be annoying.

But kids are shouting it for good reason \n       \n  By Scottie Andrew, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:38 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Not since 69 has a number caused this much disruption.\n \n\n   \n  “6-7,” pronounced “ six-seveeeeen ,” is haunting school halls across the country (including  South Park Elementary ), making it the Gen Alpha nonsense phrase of the moment. Kids are shouting it in classrooms when a teacher turns to page 67, when lunchtime is 6 to 7 minutes away or for no reason at all. It’s become  so  ubiquitous that Dictionary.com  named  it the word of the year.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s like a plague — a virus that has taken over these kids’ minds,” said Gabe Dannenbring, a seventh-grade science teacher in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. “You can’t say any iteration of the numbers 6 or 7 without having at least 15 kids yell, ‘6-7!’”\n \n\n   \n  It’s a joke without a punchline (or a setup, for that matter). 6-7 means nothing, but using it can make a student feel like a member of a bigger, cooler group of their peers.\n \n\n   \n  “It becomes a language game to them that, it would seem, only folks in their group know how to play,” said Gail Fairhurst, a University of Cincinnati professor who teaches leadership communication (and Gen Alpha speak).\n \n\n   \n   Skibidi toilets  and  rizzes  come and go. 6-7 is likely destined for the slang graveyard soon, now that adults are talking about it so much. But there’s something almost profound about its infinite interpretations, its refusal to be defined.\n \n\n   \n  “I think that’s part of what upsets people about it, and I think that’s part of what people like about it,” said Taylor Jones, a  linguist  and social scientist.\n \n\n   \n    An attempt at explaining 6-7 (but don’t worry, no one knows what it means)\n \n\n   \n  There may be no coherent explanation for 6-7, but here goes anyway: The number appears in the chorus of “Doot Doot (6 7),” a viral  song  by the Philadelphia rapper Skrilla. (In Skrilla’s case, according to Jones, 6-7 is likely a reference to the 10-67 police code, which is often used to report a death.)\n \n\n   \n  In December 2024, around the same time “Doot Doot” started taking off, high school basketball phenom Taylen Kinney appeared to create a gesture to accompany the phrase. In a  clip  shared by his Overtime Elite team, Kinney’s teammate asks him to rate a Starbucks drink out of 10.\n \n\n   \n  “Like a 6 … 6 … 6-7,” he says, adding an indecisive gesture, as though he were weighing two options in his palms.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly thereafter, Kinney started incorporating the song and gesture into his  TikToks , where he has over 1 million followers.\n \n\n   \n  The song started appearing in  sports highlight reels , including those for Charlotte Hornets point guard LaMelo Ball. (He stands at  6 feet, 7 inches , natch.) Ball  doesn’t seem annoyed  by the memes yet, but the NBA season hasn’t officially started, so there’s still time.\n \n\n   \n  A face of 6-7 emerged in March, when a  video  caught a young, overexcited spectator at an amateur basketball game shouting “6-7!” with the accompanying hand gesture. He became the embodiment of that annoying classmate who can’t stop spouting nonsense phrases. Somehow, the internet decided this stereotype’s name was Mason — and thus, Mason 67 has become another inside joke. (This “Mason” character has since become an icon of online analog horror,  per  Know Your Meme, but that’s another story.)\n \n\n   \n  So, if a kid uses any of the above explanations when you ask what the heck 6-7 is, they’re probably right. But most kids don’t even know where it came from, Dannenbring said.\n \n\n   \n  “Nobody knows what it means,” he said. “And that’s kind of the funny thing about it.”\n \n\n   \n  Its meaninglessness is partly due to what Jones calls “semantic bleaching,” where a phrase is divorced from its original context and comes to mean something entirely different (or, in this case, nothing).\n \n\n   \n  Using 6-7 comes down to a willingness to have fun, Jones said: “Do you have a little bit of whimsy? Or are you a party pooper?”\n \n\n   \n    Kids scream ‘6-7’ to belong (and that’s cool)\n \n\n   \n  Sure, it’s nonsense, but 6-7 serves a critical social function. It’s a shibboleth, or a phrase that signifies that one belongs to an “in” group, Jones said. People who don’t say it or get it are on the outs. And what kid doesn’t want to belong?\n \n\n   \n  “Language is a way for people to form community,” said Fairhurst. “Even if it’s a nonsense term, if they seem to know what it means, that can be a unifying force. And if somebody isn’t understanding the term, it can exclude people from that community, as well.”\n \n\n   \n  6-7 has also survived longer than other internet nonsense words — even that pesky “skibidi” — likely because “grown-ups are so angry about it,” Jones said.\n \n\n   \n  “The fact that you can get a big reaction from somebody for something just totally meaningless — that might give it longer longevity than it might otherwise have,” Jones said.\n \n\n   \n  Fed-up teachers are banning it from their classrooms or making exasperated TikToks about the number of times they’ve heard it in a single school day (for Dannenbring, the  record is 75 ). Shouting “6-7!” after it’s forbidden becomes a “way to show resistance,” said Fairhurst.\n \n\n   \n  Teachers are now playing defense by using 6-7 themselves. A Michigan middle school choir teacher successfully staved away cries of “6-7” by  incorporating  it into a warmup song that also includes “slay,” “Ohio” and “ rizz .”\n \n\n   \n  “Don’t scream at me … even though you get excited,” the teacher begs her class before they begin chanting “6-7, 6-7, 6-7, skibidi,” a chorus of little cringe cherubs.\n \n\n   \n  When instructing his students to open their textbooks to page 67, Dannenbring will suddenly adopt the timbre of his enthusiastic seventh graders, who immediately protest their teacher using a phrase that does not belong to him. (At 27, Dannenbring is an elder member of Gen Z. But a young teacher is still a teacher, and, therefore, too old to play.)\n \n\n   \n  “If you don’t play into it, yeah, it’s super disruptive,” Dannenbring said. “If you acknowledge it, then it gets over with in about 15 seconds.”\n \n\n   \n  And if  that  doesn’t shut down the conversation, he said he uses it incorrectly on purpose: “‘That’s so 6-7 of you.’”\n \n\n   \n  “The easiest way to kill it is for teachers to say that it’s cool,” Jones said.\n \n\n   \n  Comedian Josh Pray has started using it in front of his kids, working it into his  videos , desperate to reclaim a formerly innocuous number.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m trying to take our numbers back!” he said. “I’ll be 67 before they know it, and I don’t want to hear that specific tone all around me as a taunt to my age!”\n \n\n   \n    Maybe ‘6-7’ isn’t brainrot after all (you were a dumb kid, too)\n \n\n   \n  Fear not, parents — incessantly screaming “6-7!” is not enough to prove that your children are “ brainrotting .” Concerns about literacy falling and critical thinking skills diminishing are legitimate, but they’re being “projected onto normal, youthful behavior,” Jones said.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re rewriting our own history,” Jones said. “This is not anywhere near being a new phenomenon.”\n \n\n   \n  Every generation invents its own slang, and language evolves in ways most of us will never consciously perceive, Jones said. Kids will always come up with cool new phrases (like  “cool”! ), and adults will be left scratching their heads in confusion.\n \n\n   \n  Nonsense phrases like this aren’t inherently harmful, and 6-7 certainly isn’t going to bring about the end of the English language, Fairhurst said. But its popularity  could  be a benign symptom of our “post-truth” society, she said, where the meaning and specificity of communication matters less than people’s interpretation of it.\n \n\n   \n  “It seems like it’s sort of a relative of that kind of phenomenon, where we’re just using language to use language, and not because we see something particularly meaningful or particularly real about it,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps 6-7 is already on its way out — it’s survived for nearly a year, essentially a century in TikTok time. Some of Dannenbring’s students are starting to roll their eyes when they hear their classmates yelling it. Middle school teacher and comedian Philip Lindsay said he’s already hearing potential replacements in his classroom — “41,” for one, another similarly meaningless number that makes kids inexplicably giggle.\n \n\n   \n  “41 was started to try and dethrone 6-7,” Lindsay said. “6-7 just happened. 41 was pushed.”\n \n\n   \n  The way Dannenbring sees it, slang can get a lot worse than 6-7. Past trends have inspired students to stick pencils into their school-issued laptops to set them on fire or rip sinks straight off the walls of their school bathrooms.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve had those words before, like Skibidi toilet,” he said. “This one is  significantly  less annoying.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/middleeast/iran-rebuilding-ballistic-weapons-program-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"09:07:00-04:00","title":"Western intelligence says Iran is rearming despite UN sanctions, with China’s help","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Despite the reinstatement of UN sanctions under the snapback mechanism following a 12-day conflict with Israel, Iran is reportedly rearming its ballistic missile program through increased shipments of sodium perchlorate from China.

9:07 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Iran appears to be stepping up the rebuilding of its ballistic missile program, despite the reintroduction last month of  United Nations sanctions  that ban arms sales to the country and ballistic missile activity.\n \n\n   \n  European intelligence sources say several shipments of sodium perchlorate, the main precursor in the production of the solid propellant that powers Iran’s mid-range conventional missiles, have arrived from China to the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas since the so-called  “snapback” mechanism  was triggered at the end of September.\n \n\n   \n  Those sources say the shipments, which began arriving on September 29, contain 2,000 tons of sodium perchlorate bought by Iran from Chinese suppliers in the wake of its  12-day conflict with Israel in June . The purchases are believed to be part of a determined effort to rebuild the Islamic Republic’s depleted missile stocks. Several of the cargo ships and Chinese entities involved are under sanctions from the United States.\n \n\n   \n  The deliveries come after more-than-a-decade-old UN sanctions were restored by the snapback mechanism – a provision for Iranian breaches of the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) deal to monitor its nuclear program.\n \n\n   \n  Under the sanctions re-imposed on Tehran last month, Iran shall not undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. UN member states must also prevent the provision to Iran of materials that could contribute to the country’s development of a nuclear weapons delivery system, which experts say could include ballistic missiles.\n \n\n   \n  States are also required to prevent the provision to Iran of assistance in the manufacture of arms. China, along with Russia, opposed the reimposition of the sanctions, saying it undermines efforts for a “diplomatic settlement of the Iranian nuclear issue.”\n \n\n   \n  While the shipped substance – sodium perchlorate – is not specifically named in UN documents on materials banned for export to Iran, it is a direct precursor of ammonium perchlorate, a listed and prohibited oxidizer used in ballistic missiles. However, experts say that the sanctions’ failure to explicitly prohibit the chemical may leave China room to argue that it is not in violation of any UN ban.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has followed the journeys of several cargo ships identified by the intelligence sources as being involved in the latest deliveries of sodium perchlorate from Chinese ports to Iran, using ship tracking data and the social media of their crew. Many of those vessels appear to have gone back and forth several times between China and Iran since the end of April. The sources say their crew seem to be employed by the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines and their regular social media posts provide a trail of their stops on the China to Iran journey.\n \n\n   \n  Among them is the MV Basht, already sanctioned by the US, which left the Chinese port of Zhuhai on September 15, arrived in Bandar Abbas on September 29 and since returned to China.\n \n\n   \n  Planet Labs satellite images provided to CNN by the Middlebury Institute of International Studies confirm that the Barzin was being loaded with cargo at Gaolan Port, China, on October 1, before departing for Iran. The images then show the Barzin docked at Rajaei Port in Bandar Abbas, Iran, from October 16 to October 19, where it was being unloaded.\n \n\n   \n  The Elyana left the Chinese port of Changjiangkou on September 18 and arrived in Bandar Abbas on October 12. Finally, the MV Artavand left the Chinese port of Liuheng and arrived in Bandar Abbas on October 12, with its AIS tracking system turned off to deliberately obscure its movements, according to Western intelligence.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not clear if the Chinese government is aware of the shipments. In response to a question from CNN about the transactions, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that, while he was “not familiar with the specific situation,” China has “consistently implemented export controls on dual-use items in accordance with its international obligations and domestic laws and regulations.”\n \n\n   \n  “We want to emphasize that China is committed to peacefully resolving the Iranian nuclear issue through political and diplomatic means and opposes sanctions and pressure,” the spokesperson continued, adding that Beijing viewed the return of sanctions under the snapback mechanism as “unconstructive” and a “serious setback” in efforts to “resolve the Iranian nuclear issue.”\n \n\n   \n  Similar shipments had previously been reported, but their intensification since the 12-day war – when the Israeli military targeted at least a third of the surface-to-surface launchers that fire Iran’s medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs) – suggests a renewed eagerness on the part of the Islamic Republic to arm itself.\n \n\n   \n  “Iran needs much more sodium perchlorate now to replace the missiles expended in the war and to increase production. I would expect large shipments to Iran as it tries to rearm, just as I would expect Israel and the US to race to replace the interceptors and munitions that were expended,” said Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Project at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies.\n \n\n   \n  The best way to consider the current moment, he told CNN, is as a pause in hostilities, as each side seeks to rearm.\n \n\n   \n  “Two thousand tons of sodium perchlorate are only enough for about 500 missiles.  That’s a lot, but Iran was planning on producing something like 200 missiles a month before the war and now must replace all the missiles that either Israel destroyed or it used,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    Long-standing ties\n \n\n   \n  China has long been a  diplomatic and economic ally  for sanctions-hit Iran, decrying “unilateral” US sanctions against the country and buying up most of Iran’s oil exports, despite not reporting purchases of Iranian oil for several years.\n \n\n   \n  That energy trade relies on a network of vessels that filter Iranian oil to independent refineries in coastal China, often through intermediary countries, according to analysts, who note this practice keeps refinement separate from Chinese state-owned enterprises that would be vulnerable to US sanctions. These so-called teapot refineries are known to work with what’s often referred to as a dark fleet of tankers that use concealing tactics to smuggle sanctioned goods.\n \n\n   \n  European security sources believe a similarly opaque system, involving front companies that are little more than fake numbers and billing addresses, has been used to keep the sodium perchlorate flowing to Iran. As have more legitimate companies, including two already sanctioned by the US back in April for their part in a “network procuring ballistic missile propellant ingredients on behalf of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).” Most of the companies involved are based in the northeastern Chinese port city of Dalian, according to information from the intelligence sources.\n \n\n   \n    Earlier shipments\n \n\n   \n  In February, CNN  reported the shipment  of 1,000 tons of sodium perchlorate to Iran from China. By April, the US had slapped sanctions on several Iranian and Chinese entities, including vessels believed to play a role in “a network procuring ballistic missile propellant ingredients on behalf of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).”\n \n\n   \n  Yet the shipments continued, the intelligence sources say, with the IRGC’s Self Sufficiency Jihad Organization acquiring another 1,000 tons of sodium perchlorate which left Taicang in China aboard the Hamouna on May 22 and arrived in Bandar Abbas on June 14 or 15. It set sail for the Iranian port less than a month after a massive explosion there on April 27, believed to have been caused by sodium perchlorate, killed 70 and wounded hundreds.\n \n\n   \n  The latest shipments represent much bigger quantities in a short space of time. The first of the 10 to 12 shipments that European intelligence sources have been tracking arrived in Iran on September 29, two days after the snapback mechanism – triggered in August by Germany, France, and the United Kingdom, the European partners to the JCPOA – restored UN sanctions. The others all left China after the sanctions were in place.\n \n\n   \n  Tong Zhao, a senior fellow with the nuclear policy program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said that China’s position on the legal status of the reimposition of sanctions may be related to how its authorities would view such shipments.\n \n\n   \n  “First and foremost, China – along with Russia and Iran – has denounced the legality of the snapback in a joint letter to the UN issued on October 18, indicating that Beijing likely does not consider itself bound by the reimposed measures,” according to Zhao.\n \n\n   \n  Had the snapback not been triggered, October 18 would have marked the official end of the 10-year JCPOA, at which point the option to reimpose previous UN sanctions and restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program would expire and the Security Council would close Iran’s nuclear file.\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, China joined with Russia in September to push for a six-month extension of the JCPOA, arguing that more time was needed for diplomatic efforts and pointing to what Beijing saw as signs that Iran wanted to engage with the international community on regulating its nuclear program. The UN Security Council  voted down  the China-backed resolution in September, one day before the snapback came into force.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing was one of the six countries – along with France, Germany, Russia, the UK and the US – that signed the JCPOA with Iran in 2015. In a meeting between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian in September, Xi reiterated China’s stance that it “attaches importance to Iran’s repeated pledge that it does not seek to develop nuclear weapons” and “respects Iran’s right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy.”\n \n\n   \n  Zhao also pointed to the fact that the export of sodium perchlorate is not explicitly banned under the pre-JCPOA sanctions regime that is now back in force. What the reinstated UN resolutions do prohibit, he added, is the provision by member states to Tehran of “items, materials, equipment, goods, and technology” which could contribute to Iran’s development of a nuclear weapon delivery system.\n \n\n   \n  So, while sodium perchlorate is not named, it “should fall under the broader catch-all controls on materials used in solid-fuel missile production,” he said, but noted that the fact that it is not explicitly prohibited may leave China and other countries with greater room for interpretation.\n \n\n   \n  “Beijing may be aware that such exports indirectly support Iran’s missile program,” Zhao said, “yet it may also view this as a matter of principle – asserting China’s sovereign right to make independent export-control decisions on items not expressly banned by the UN.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Simone McCarthy contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/entertainment/antoni-porowski-sexual-health","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"06:00:00-04:00","title":"Antoni Porowski Says Conversations Around Sexual Health Don’t Have to Be Awkward","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Antoni Porowski, known for his role on 'Queer Eye,' promotes open and honest conversations about sexual health, especially around HIV prevention through PrEP, in a time when political and cultural forces are increasing stigma and cutting funding for LGBTQ+ health initiatives.

have to be awkward \n       \n  By Dan Heching, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:00 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Many years before he became the resident foodie and one fifth of the makeover dream team on “ Queer Eye ,” Antoni Porowski already had no problem having important and frank conversations.\n \n\n   \n  “I learned about STIs probably before I hit puberty,” he told CNN in a recent interview.\n \n\n   \n  When Porowski later called out his physician father   for broaching the subject of sexually transmitted infections when he was quite young, his dad’s response was, “Well you know what, you had to know and you were going to find out at some point anyway.”\n \n\n   \n  Porowski – whose mother, sister and grandfather also have medical backgrounds – grew up around science and having conversations about health, sexual and otherwise, and he says he feels privileged to have had that access to helpful information early on. It’s one of the reasons he’s partnering with pharmaceutical company Gilead to promote HIV prevention and having open discussions about sexual health.\n \n\n   \n  “The more you talk about it, anything that’s uncomfortable, the less precious it becomes. It loses its power,” Porowski said.\n \n\n   \n  Porowski’s involvement in the  campaign  comes at a time of  unprecedented  cutbacks on DEI programs, which among many other things contain efforts designed to help people realize and achieve sexual wellness through access to pre-exposure prophylaxis (or PrEP, drugs that prevents HIV infections, which are produced by companies including Gilead) and other information. Analysis of federal data by the  New York Times  in May found that Donald Trump’s administration had scrapped more than $800 million worth of research into the health of LGBTQ+ people.\n \n\n   \n  “With all of these unfortunate initiatives, I think it pushes us more towards stigmatization, because it helps fuel the taboo and negative understandings and perceptions of a lot of things,” Porowski said.\n \n\n   \n  “Often as we’re seeing in culture right now and in politics, the things that a lot of certain people are afraid of, they end up turning (it) into anger, and it then flips to taking away or minimizing rights because they just don’t get it,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  For Porwoski, the current political landscape and its challenges present an opportunity to “keep talking about this even more than we did.”\n \n\n   \n  “Because as much progress as we’ve made – progress isn’t linear, as I’m learning with a lot of things, especially politically,” he said. “The key for anything that is misunderstood or misperceived, I think it’s an opportunity to have a conversation about it.”\n \n\n   \n  Part of his understanding comes from his involvement on “ Queer Eye ,” which will soon premiere its tenth and final season. The show has long focused on the ongoing conversations between queer and non-queer people, and their efforts to understand one another.\n \n\n   \n  “People who we’ve met on the show who definitely leaned more on the conservative side knew us as concepts, before meeting us,” he said. “They have their ideas of what it’s like to be queer and that was it.”\n \n\n   \n  The way past that, he said, was to help them “realize that we’re someone’s kid.”\n \n\n   \n  To “get to know the person as an individual and not a concept” is “a good blanket statement for any type of intolerance or lack of embracing of diversity in our culture,” Porowski said.\n \n\n   \n  Making connections and having meaningful conversations is ultimately what Porowski comes back to, for both learning the value of tolerance and arming oneself with information for better health by having those meaningful conversations with a doctor.\n \n\n   \n  “Talk to a physician, ask the questions, that’s literally what they’re there for,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Porowski says that while he had the “great gift of being raised around science and trusting it,” he knows there are others who weren’t and don’t.\n \n\n   \n  He urges those people “who sit on the other end of the spectrum, of not trusting it” to “just shut up and put your curiosity hat on and ask questions.”\n \n\n   \n  “Ask things that you’re genuinely curious about, so that you can educate yourself,” he said. “I think we all have a responsibility to educate ourselves.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/americas/jamaica-hurricane-melissa-black-river-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"05:35:00-04:00","title":"‘Hell on Earth’: Ravaged by Hurricane Melissa, this once-vibrant Jamaican town is now in desperate need of help","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa struck Jamaica in October 2025, causing catastrophic damage to the coastal town of Black River.

been reduced to piles of rubble that litter the now-muddy ground.\n \n\n   \n  “We have nowhere to stay,” Britney Samms, a resident of Black River’s Vineyard District, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Black River was one of the worst-hit places in all of Jamaica. A storm surge of up to 16 feet flooded parts of the community as the hurricane barreled through. At least two people died here – their bodies discovered floating in the water after the storm had cleared, St. Elizabeth Police Superintendent Coleridge Minto said Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Across the Caribbean, at least 49 people are known to have died, Reuters reported, though the full toll of the catastrophic storm may take days or weeks to be determined.\n \n\n   \n  In Black river, hundreds of survivors are now walking through the streets in shock, trying to process the harrowing situation they face.\n \n\n   \n  Many have lost their homes and are wondering where they will go for shelter.\n \n\n   \n  “We live in a board house.

four TDs in dominant return from injury to lead Ravens to big win over Dolphins \n       \n  By Ben Morse, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:57 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Lamar Jackson made an emphatic return to  NFL  action on Thursday Night Football, throwing four touchdown passes to lead his Baltimore Ravens to a 28-6 win over the Miami Dolphins.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson had missed the past three Ravens games with a hamstring injury, with Baltimore struggling in his absence.\n \n\n   \n  But with the two-time NFL MVP back in the lineup, the Ravens looked much more like themselves, piling up 338 yards of offense, 229 coming in the second half.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson connected on touchdown passes to Rashod Bateman, Charlie Kolar and twice to Mark Andrews.\n \n\n   \n  And while he didn’t look as explosive when he chose to run the ball, the 28-year-old’s return seemed to open up the running game in general, with the team racking up 150 yards on the ground, including 119 for Derrick Henry on 19 carries.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s awesome,” Jackson afterwards. “It’s great to be back and get a dub.”\n \n\n   \n  It was the Dolphins, coming off a big win last week against the Atlanta Falcons, who took the lead in the first quarter with a field goal before Jackson capitalized on a fumble by Tahj Washington, connecting with Andrews for their first touchdown of the game.\n \n\n   \n  Baltimore extended its lead in the second quarter with Andrews’ second touchdown reception of the game, capping off an eight-play, 75-yard scoring drive.\n \n\n   \n  A Miami field goal just before halftime did reduce the deficit but the Dolphins failed to make any further inroads on offense after halftime, with Baltimore adding 14 points in the third quarter to ease to victory.\n \n\n   \n  “I just felt a little comfortable and our guys were ready to score,” Jackson – who finished with 204 yards on 18-of-23 passing – said. “Shoutout to the offensive line. They did great.\n \n\n   \n  “All phases, all skill positions, and our running backs, those guys were just locked in and wanted to put points on the board because we only scored twice in the first half.”\n \n\n   \n  In what was Jackson’s first action since September 28, he continued his excellent record against the Dolphins. The Florida native now has 1,405 passing yards, 18 passing touchdowns, one interception and a 142.9 passer rating in five starts against Miami, the highest by any single player (minimum 100 attempts) vs. a single opponent in history,  per NFL Research .\n \n\n   \n  His return to the field is timely for Baltimore which has now won two in a row to keep its season alive, improving to 3-5 on the year.\n \n\n   \n  The Ravens still face an uphill battle to make it to the postseason, but with Jackson back at the helm, that journey seems a little easier.\n \n\n   \n   According to the NFL , only four teams since the 1970 merger have made the playoffs after starting a season 1-5. But, since 1990, 21 teams have made the postseason with a 3-5 opening.\n \n\n   \n  For the Dolphins, it was another crushing defeat as they slip to 2-7 and the pressure ramps back up on head coach Mike McDaniel after their big win over Atlanta last time out.\n \n\n   \n  Like many of their games this season, the loss to the Ravens was punctuated by self-inflicted errors – Washington’s first-quarter fumble gave excellent field position to Baltimore, a false start by Larry Borom on fourth-and-1 ended a promising drive, Riley Patterson missed a close field goal and Malik Washington also fumbled in the fourth quarter.\n \n\n   \n  Miami produced its best performance of the season in Week 8 against the Falcons but Thursday’s outing will do nothing to quiet the talk around McDaniel’s future.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/world/sudan-massacres-rsf-rebels-darfur-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"06:00:00-04:00","title":"Rebels Accused of Massacring Hundreds in Sudanese City as Videos of Atrocities Emerge","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In October 2025, reports of mass atrocities emerged in El Fasher, Sudan, following the takeover of the city by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF).

and bodies in Sudanese city \n       \n  By Ivana Kottasová, Vasco Cotovio, Nada Bashir, Gianluca Mezzofiore, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:26 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  An elderly man sits on the floor, dozens of bodies lying around him, before a Sudanese rebel fighter approaches and shoots him.\n \n\n   \n  The apparent killing – captured on video shared online by the rebels themselves – took place at a university medical school in El Fasher in Sudan’s western Darfur region after the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF)  took over the city  on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has identified the location of the massacre as El Fasher University’s School of Medical Laboratory Science, just across the street from the Saudi Hospital where, according to reports cited by the World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday, more than 460 people were also killed.\n \n\n   \n  The Sudan Doctors Network, a professional organization, said the RSF “cold-bloodedly killed everyone they found inside the Saudi Hospital, including patients, their companions, and anyone else present in the wards.”\n \n\n   \n  Satellite images of the Saudi Hospital show signs of a massacre, with apparent clusters of bodies and blood-stained ground clearly visible.\n \n\n   \n  Reports of RSF fighters committing large-scale massacres began to emerge within hours of the Sudanese military’s  withdrawal from El Fasher  earlier this week.\n \n\n   \n  Those accounts have been corroborated by mounting evidence that includes videos and photos from the ground, survivor testimonies and satellite images.\n \n\n   \n  RSF chief Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, also known as Hemedti, acknowledged Wednesday that there had been “violations” in El Fasher, and said an investigative committee would be launched to investigate and “hold accountable any soldier or any officer who committed a crime.”\n \n\n   \n  In a separate statement, the RSF denied claims of killings at the hospital, describing them as “fabricated narratives with no connection to reality,” despite mounting evidence of atrocities.\n \n\n   \n  The grisly events in El Fasher come over two and a half years into a brutal civil war that has claimed the lives of more than 150,000 people.\n \n\n   \n  On one side is Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the country’s military ruler and the head of the Sudanese armed forces (SAF); on the other is Hemedti, the RSF chief and onetime al-Burhan deputy. The two men launched a coup together in 2021 before a power struggle between them descended into all-out war in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  The United Nations and the United States have both said the RSF and the SAF have committed war crimes and have faced western sanctions.\n \n\n   \n  The UN told CNN it believes about 120,000 people, half of them children, were trapped in El Fasher, which was the Sudanese army’s last stronghold in Darfur and had been under siege by the RSF for 18 months.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, then US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, during the Biden administration,  accused the RSF of committing genocide  against non-Arab ethnic groups in Darfur, saying there was evidence the group systematically murdered “men and boys – even infants – on an ethnic basis” and that it “deliberately targeted women and girls from certain ethnic groups for rape and other forms of brutal sexual violence.”\n \n\n   \n  Few eyewitness testimonies have emerged from El Fasher since its fall to the RSF. But humanitarian workers who’ve spoken to survivors fleeing the city related stories of summary executions and rapes, streets strewn with bodies and men and boys being prevented from leaving.\n \n\n   \n  Multiple videos shared online over the past three days show RSF fighters rounding up and killing large numbers of unarmed people. CNN was able to match the insignia worn by the fighters in several of the videos to the one used by the RSF.\n \n\n   \n  Most of the videos appear to have been filmed and shared by the rebels themselves.\n \n\n   \n  One video shows an unarmed man in civilian clothes on the ground, pleading for his life before a man addressed as commander.\n \n\n   \n  The fighter is seen shooting him multiple times. Dozens more bodies are clearly visible in the video.\n \n\n   \n  Another video shows at least eight men dressed in civilian clothes sitting on the ground next to each other before being killed in a quick succession.\n \n\n   \n  Several videos show executions and RSF fighters celebrating next to bodies by a berm, a raised bank of earth that was built around El Fasher during the siege to trap people inside the city.\n \n\n   \n  Other videos show armed RSF fighters driving through large swaths of land, apparently hunting civilians who are attempting to flee. In one video, the rebels are heard saying “catch the girls.”\n \n\n   \n  Conflict-related sexual violence has been reported by human rights groups as a major problem in Sudan and multiple humanitarian workers have told CNN that women and girls who have managed to escape El Fasher in recent days were victims of sexual violence and rape.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has geolocated several of the videos showing jubilant RSF forces inside El Fasher. Satellite images analyzed by the Humanitarian Research Lab at Yale School of Public Health and verified by CNN show clear evidence of the atrocities in El Fasher.\n \n\n   \n  Groups of bodies appear to be visible in satellite images of areas where RSF killings have been reported in recent days.\n \n\n   \n  The Yale researchers also say they have identified reddish patches on the ground consistent with blood in several locations, including outside the Saudi Hospital and near the berm around the city.\n \n\n   \n  The bodies and the reddish stains are only visible in the satellite images taken on Monday and Tuesday, after the RSF takeover.\n \n\n   \n  “The Rapid Support Forces have surrounded this city in an earth wall called a berm that’s as high as nine feet,” said Nathaniel Raymond, executive director of the Research Lab.\n \n\n   \n  “So the context here is these people are inside what we call a Kill Box. They have been walled in to be killed systematically, and right now the Rapid Support Forces are doing that,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Survivors fleeing the violence have told aid groups of summary executions and mass killings.\n \n\n   \n  Adam Rojal, the spokesperson for the General Coordination for Displaced Persons and Refugees in Darfur, told CNN he left the besieged city two weeks ago. He said that civilians are currently not allowed to leave and that the situation is “appalling.”\n \n\n   \n  “(People who fled) tell horrific stories about the suffering and abuses they have subjected to. The property of citizens has been confiscated, there are floggings, and attacks. I have seen the execution videos,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Manal bint Abi Suleiman, who fled El Fasher after the RSF takeover, said the attack on the area where she was sheltering started on Saturday. “The Rapid Support Forces entered and destroyed everything in front of them,” she said in a video testimony filmed by a volunteer helping refugees.\n \n\n   \n  “On the way, they harassed the people and beat some of them. They separated the young men from the women, and I don’t know where they took the men. God knows where they are now,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  In videos shared online, several other survivors have also referenced killings of both men and women and bodies lying in the streets.\n \n\n   \n  Save the Children’s deputy country director for Sudan, Francesco Lanino, told CNN that survivors who reached a refugee camp in Tawila in southern Darfur described the extreme danger they faced as they fled.\n \n\n   \n  “All the areas surrounding El Fasher are controlled by different militias, or different armed groups that are related to RSF or somehow part of RSF,” Lanino said.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not only RSF who are looking for civilians, looking for people to (rob), to abuse or kill,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The RSF has been supported by Arab groups and militias from across the Sahel region as well as the  Russian paramilitary group Wagner .\n \n\n   \n  The Sudanese government has also accused the United Arab Emirates of arming the group. The UAE has repeatedly denied the accusation, despite an expert panel appointed by the UN Security Council finding in a January 2024 report that the allegations were “credible.”\n \n\n   \n    Fears for the missing men\n \n\n   \n  The UN’s humanitarian team in Sudan said on Tuesday it has received “credible reports of widespread violations, including summary executions, attacks on civilians along escape routes, house-to-house raids and obstacles preventing civilians from reaching safety,” adding that “sexual violence, particularly against women and girls, continues to be reported.”\n \n\n   \n  Arjan Hehenkamp, the Darfur crisis lead for the International Rescue Committee, told CNN that many of the people fleeing El Fasher are in a “deplorable state.”\n \n\n   \n  “Many of them are sick and wounded… there’s many women, many elderly, but a big gap in terms of young men and adult men,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Hehenkamp spent several weeks at Tawila, providing help to people fleeing.\n \n\n   \n  “The big concern that we have right now is, where is the rest of the population of El Fasher? We haven’t seen the big numbers that we were expecting so far. So that is very disturbing,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Lanino told CNN that some 5,000 people managed to reach his team in Tawila in recent days.\n \n\n   \n  “The majority of these people coming from El Fasher are women and children. And according to their stories, the men are kidnapped or were killed on the way coming to Tawila because of their ethnic group, because they were men, and they were somehow stopped and targeted,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Sheldon Yett, UNICEF’s lead in Sudan, told CNN that violence has soared in the days following the RSF’s takeover.\n \n\n   \n  He said he’d spoken to women who fled El Fasher who said their male relatives were all either killed or detained by RSF.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking to CNN from the eastern city of Port Sudan after returning from an area near Darfur where people are seeking safety, Yett said the stories shared by survivors were “blood-curdling.” There were groups of women arriving alone, saying their male relatives have been killed or detained, he added.\n \n\n   \n  “(Fighters are) going house to house, raids, people being dragged out, just the most horrific stories. People are being held (to) ransom. They’re being told, basically, you pay or you die, call your relatives, get the money together,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The Sudan Doctors Network said that six medical staff, including four doctors, a pharmacist and a nurse, have been kidnapped by RSF fighters who are now demanding 100 million Sudanese pounds ($166,000) for each of them.\n \n\n   \n  The group has appealed to international organizations, including WHO, to intervene and “exert maximum pressure on RSF to release” the abductees.\n \n\n   \n  As more reports of alleged atrocities pour in, multiple international organizations, world leaders and human rights groups have called for an immediate ceasefire and quick independent investigations into the killings.\n \n\n   \n  Yett said that the fact that the fighters are filming themselves killing civilians and posting these videos online shows “a feeling of lack of accountability.”\n \n\n   \n  “We need to ensure there’s clear accountabilities here. I mean all violations of international law need to be investigated. We need to hold people accountable,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/poll-closing-times-election-results","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"06:10:00Z","title":"When polls close in Tuesday’s elections and when to expect results","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"This article outlines the timing and key races in the major U.S. state elections on Tuesday, October 31, 2025, during the early phase of President Donald Trump’s second term.

appoints first-ever botanical curator, backed by Chanel Culture Fund \n       \n  By Fiona Sinclair Scott, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:26 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Fondation Beyeler, home to one of western Europe’s leading modern and contemporary art collections, is turning its gaze toward a novel type of gallery — its own gardens.\n \n\n   \n  Located near Basel, Switzerland, the museum has long been a popular cultural attraction for its art as well as its scenic setting. Designed by Pritzker Prize–winning architect  Renzo Piano , the flat-roofed, single-story gallery in Riehen is gently nestled among centuries-old trees and mossy lily ponds, surrounded by green fields and vineyards, at the edge of Germany’s Black Forest.\n \n\n   \n  Since opening nearly 30 years ago, the Fondation Beyeler has hosted many site-specific artworks that engaged directly with its natural environment. In 1998, the late artist  Christo  wrapped 178 trees on the property in fabric, and, more recently,  Olafur Eliasson  removed part of the building’s facade to effectively bring one of the outdoor ponds into the gallery itself. The Icelandic artist used a non-toxic dye to give the water a neon glow, describing the work as a “model for a future landscape where human and non-humans can live together” more harmoniously.\n \n\n   \n  This week, the institution is announcing a groundbreaking new role. In what is believed to be the first of its kind at a major art museum, the Fondation Beyeler has appointed Swiss academic Rahel Kesselring as its inaugural botanical curator. Her role will focus on the preservation of the site’s flora and fauna and on developing public programming within its gardens.\n \n\n   \n  The position — officially, the Chanel botanical curator — is supported by the Chanel Culture Fund, a philanthropic arm of the French luxury house that backs innovative cultural projects and initiatives around the world.\n \n\n   \n  Kesselring explained that her mission is to strengthen the dialogue between art and nature. “Plants are enormously important for our culture,” she said in a video interview. “They sustain us…we live in a world that has been fully built by plants. We have a deep connection to them, physically, culturally and historically.”\n \n\n   \n  Museum director Sam Keller called the appointment a reflection of the institution’s ethos. “Nature is not a backdrop to our work, but a living part of it,” he said in a statement. “This role affirms our commitment to caring for the whole ecology of this place with the same depth, imagination and responsibility we bring to everything we do.”\n \n\n   \n  Kesselring’s appointment  presents a new model for arts institutions — expanding the idea of curatorial expertise beyond the white walls of a gallery and into the living landscape.\n \n\n   \n  With the symptoms of climate crisis increasingly felt by people and businesses, including those within the art world, the Fondation Beyeler is making a statement by putting ecological stewardship on par with artistic curation. Kesselring hopes it will inspire broader change or, at least, more public engagement. “We need to rewrite our understanding of our relationship with nature,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Yana Peel, the president of arts, culture and heritage at Chanel, said during a video call that with no brick-and-mortar cultural institutions of its own (as is common for many luxury brands), the company has focused on contributing to others — seeking out ways to create impact on a project-by-project basis.\n \n\n   \n  “We have specifically not been sponsoring galas or parties or short-term projects,” she said, explaining that they want to focus on “transformational” work that is entirely non-transactional and not aimed at selling Chanel products. The initiative is about “wanting to have a positive impact on the world,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Chanel did not confirm how long it would be funding Kesselring’s role at the foundation but it’s understood to be a multi-year partnership, in keeping with the fund’s wider mission to focus on longer-term projects.\n \n\n   \n  Established five years ago, the Chanel Culture Fund has invested in 50 projects across 15 countries. Chanel is working with the Power Station of Art in Shanghai to support a significant renovation of the institution’s third-floor gallery, including the addition of the first contemporary art library in China, with the capacity to house 50,000 books. In Brazil, the fund partnered with the Pinacoteca de São Paulo on a new annual residency program to support women artists. And in the US, the organization is funding the Chanel Center for Artists and Technology at CalArts in Southern California.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/economy/us-government-shutdown-economy-snowball","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"05:30:00-04:00","title":"As the shutdown drags on, here’s how it can drag down the economy","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A prolonged federal government shutdown, now the longest on record, is threatening to severely damage the U.S. economy.

 By Alicia Wallace, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:30 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The  federal government shutdown  has lasted all month and is on pace to become the longest on record.\n \n\n   \n  While history has shown that the economy typically rebounds from a shutdown within a couple of months, each day it drags on brings   a greater risk that the economy  won’t just bend but will start to break — and rupture livelihoods in the process, economists say.\n \n\n   \n  “The economy is fragile and, therefore, something like a government shutdown could become a bigger problem a lot faster than people might think,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics.\n \n\n   \n  Congressional Budget Office estimates released Wednesday projected that the shutdown has permanently sapped at least $7 billion in output from the economy.\n \n\n   \n  The negative effects start to build on themselves very rapidly and the collateral damage becomes more widespread, said Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s kind of like a snowball rolling down a hill, gathering momentum and mass,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Predicting something that has becoming increasingly unpredictable is an impossible task, but here’s a look at how the shutdown could ripple through critical avenues of everyday life.\n \n\n   \n    Jobs\n \n\n   \n  Prior to the shutdown, the US job market  was already on its back .\n \n\n   \n  It’s been a  low-hire, low-fire, low-churn environment . Employers, frozen by high economic and policy uncertainty, have held off making investments and adding workers. Some businesses have used this period to test the waters on  artificial intelligence  and other technologies – in turn putting to the test that “low-fire” descriptor by announcing mass layoffs in recent weeks.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re not creating any jobs of consequence, really,” Zandi said.\n \n\n   \n  Considering that backdrop, the tepid job gains can potentially turn into deeper job losses if safety nets become frayed, more paychecks are missed by federal workers and contractors, and spending pullbacks reverberate through the private sector, causing businesses to lay off workers or shut down, he said.\n \n\n   \n  A US Chamber of Commerce analysis released this week estimated that 65,500 small business contractors have billions of dollars in payments at risk because of the shutdown — $12 billion in payments for the month alone.\n \n\n   \n  Rate cuts and some greater clarity around trade deals and tariffs were supposed to fuel a rebound in hiring heading into 2026, noted Nicole Bachaud, labor economist at employment site ZipRecruiter.\n \n\n   \n  “However, tariffs are projected to dampen consumer spending before year’s end, and a prolonged shutdown could further erode consumer confidence,” she wrote in a note earlier this month. “This would delay hiring plans that might otherwise materialize, keeping the labor market stuck in place.”\n \n\n   \n  US consumer confidence during October dipped to its lowest level since April, when President Donald Trump announced a massive suite of steep tariffs on imported goods, according to The Conference Board’s latest index released this week.\n \n\n   \n    Health care and the care economy\n \n\n   \n  The expiration of the enhanced premium subsidies for Affordable Care Act coverage is at the  crux of the Congressional stalemate  to fund the federal government and end the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats are demanding that a short-term funding package include an extension of the enhanced assistance, while  Republicans say they won’t negotiate  until the government reopens.\n \n\n   \n  Open enrollment starts on November 1, and the more than 22 million Americans who use the federal health insurance marketplace are  expected to see their monthly premium leap  by 26% on average, according to a KFF analysis.\n \n\n   \n  Also on November 1, more than 65,000 children and families in 41 states and Puerto Rico are at risk of  losing access to Head Start programs , which provide early education and child development resources to low-income households.\n \n\n   \n  Any center closures could quickly increase financial hardship for lower-earnings families. Child care disruptions have been shown to  negatively impact labor force participation  (particularly  for women ), productivity growth and overall economic growth.\n \n\n   \n    Spending\n \n\n   \n  The lengthier the shutdown, the higher the probability for a greater drag on overall economic activity, said Joe Brusuelas, RSM US chief economist.\n \n\n   \n  “And this isn’t economic activity that is just deferred or delayed, you’re now creating a condition of economic activity that just simply doesn’t happen,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  There’s the job that doesn’t get filled, the trip that doesn’t get taken and the holiday spending that doesn’t occur.\n \n\n   \n  “At some point, things start to break because they’re just not getting done,” added Zandi, of Moody’s Analytics. “When this thing really metastasizes and takes out the broader economy is when it starts to affect confidence – consumer, business, investor confidence – the stock market takes notice and instead of going straight up, it starts to wobble and starts going down.”\n \n\n   \n  If the shutdown continues past Thanksgiving, “there’s no coming back from that quickly,” he said, adding that once it passes that “point of no return,” it will cause “damage that’s longer-lasting.”\n \n\n   \n  Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of US economic activity. It has remained  largely resilient , despite massive uncertainty and persistently high inflation.\n \n\n   \n  However, it’s likely done so because of an increasingly bifurcated, or  “K-shaped” economy . Wealthy consumers, buoyed in part by strong market gains, are driving more of the spending while lower- and middle-income households are facing increased strain.\n \n\n   \n    Prices and interest rates\n \n\n   \n  A drawn-out shutdown could inject further “crosscurrents” into an already  choppy price environment , Zandi said.\n \n\n   \n  On one hand, disruptions to government services and funding could affect trade and supply chains, driving up prices. On the other hand, a weakened economy would mean it’s harder for companies to raise prices, which could help keep overall inflation in check.\n \n\n   \n  “The net of all that, I think, is hard to know,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Still, the shutdown and its economic fallout could give the Federal Reserve one more reason to  continue cutting interest rates , he added.\n \n\n   \n  “The Fed’s putting a higher weight at this point on the weak job market than they are on inflation or financial conditions,” he said. “This [shutdown] would weaken the already fragile job market more.”\n \n\n   \n    The human impact\n \n\n   \n  The shutdown could very well exacerbate those struggles for many Americans, especially people on the margins.\n \n\n   \n  Most Americans are “not taking any solace from the fact that AI stocks are going stratospheric; they’re focused on having to make their credit card payment or the student loan monthly payment,” Zandi said. “The economy is fragile and, therefore, something like a government shutdown could become a bigger problem a lot faster than people might think so.”\n \n\n   \n  A lack of funding for safety net programs,  particularly the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program , could not only exacerbate hunger and hardship for tens of millions of Americans, but also threatens to destabilize local economies, especially in rural areas.\n \n\n   \n  “It just adds insult to injury on an economy that was already showing some cracks,” KPMG economist Swonk said. “Low- and middle-income households are really struggling, and inequality tends to stoke political divisions as well as political backlash. So, this is just feeding in to already a not very comfortable situation that we are in.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s hard when you see the struggles we’re already facing, but this is a man-made problem,” she added.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/china/xi-trump-us-china-deal-analysis-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"04:50:00-04:50","title":"After Trump Trade Meeting, It’s Advantage Xi","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following a brief meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and former U.S. President Donald Trump at Gimhae International Airport in South Korea, China secured key trade advantages, including a 10% reduction in U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods, a pause on a U.S. rule that would have expanded the blacklist of Chinese tech buyers, and a commitment to purchase 25 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans annually. The agreement reflects China’s strategic leverage, particularly through its control of rare earth minerals, and confirms the success of its hardball negotiation tactics.

trade meeting, it’s advantage Xi \n       \n  Analysis by Simone McCarthy, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:50 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As the dust begins to clear around a  less-than-two hour meeting  between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and President Donald Trump at an airbase in South Korea on Thursday, it’s clear that China’s leaders have stacked up another win for their hardball strategy with the United States.\n \n\n   \n  The meeting did not secure a broad trade deal, but rather a return to an uneasy truce built on a handful of agreements meant to keep the relationship steady as the two sides move toward one.\n \n\n   \n  Xi walked away with a 10% reduction in 30% tariffs newly imposed by Trump on Chinese goods this year – in exchange for   ramping up efforts to control its role in the US fentanyl crisis. He also secured US agreement to put on hold a new rule that would have vastly expanded the number of Chinese companies blacklisted from buying sensitive American tech.\n \n\n   \n  Trump averted Beijing imposing an expanded set of restrictions that could have hamstrung global industries reliant on China’s rare earths minerals. China will also ramp up purchases of US soybeans and other agricultural products, US officials said. Both sides also paused port fees targeting each other’s shipping sectors and will extend a truce on more elevated tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  On paper, it looks like a reasonable exchange – and one that delivers, at least for now, what both leaders (and the wider global economy) wanted: stability after a tumultuous year of sparring between the world’s economic heavyweights.\n \n\n   \n  But for Beijing, the agreements – which came with a side of effusive praise from Trump for Xi – are also a clear confirmation of the success of its strategy in how to handle Trump 2.0.\n \n\n   \n  That’s because Beijing has been able to win valuable concessions on tariffs and export controls, while primarily conceding measures they only put out as retaliation against those from the US in the first place.\n \n\n   \n  Take soybeans, a key American export that saw Chinese purchases plunge this year over trade frictions.\n \n\n   \n  China agreed to purchase a minimum of 25 million metric tons of American soybeans annually for the next three years, US agricultural secretary Brooke Rollins  said  after the talks.\n \n\n   \n  But that baseline is still 1.8 million metric tons less than China’s soybean purchases last year, before the tensions, according to  US data .\n \n\n   \n  China’s highly nationalistic and censor-curated internet clocked all this on Friday, when social media commenters praised how “China really nailed this tariff war,” and observed that “Trump finally dealt with the mess Trump created.”\n \n\n   \n    China’s game plan\n \n\n   \n  The outlook is not all rosy for China.\n \n\n   \n  Even as tariffs from this year’s US trade spat have been whittled down to 20%, Chinese exporters still face what on average amounts to nearly 50% duties on their goods, with pre-existing duties factored in. That rate remains among the highest imposed on any country by the US. Washington meanwhile has seen  real progress  on its goal to narrow their trade deficit.\n \n\n   \n  And, while the deal has yet to be inked, Beijing may have made some true concessions on the fate of the social media app TikTok, after changing its tune on staunch opposition to a US law requiring the app’s Chinese owner ByteDance to sell its US business.\n \n\n   \n  China also remains blocked from accessing the highest-end US chips, a key weapon in the high-stakes AI race playing out between the two countries.\n \n\n   \n  But on the tech front, Beijing’s ability to push back by at least a year the new US rule which would have vastly expanded the number of Chinese companies blacklisted from buying sensitive American technologies, is a major boon for Chinese firms.\n \n\n   \n  The now-suspended US effort to close loopholes could have ensnared some 20,000 more companies than are already on the list, according to  an analysis  by business intelligence firm WireScreen.\n \n\n   \n  That’s another win for Beijing’s strategy of using its near-total grip on the global rare earths supply chain as leverage against the US – a tactic it also deployed during a tariff escalation earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  And on China’s side, agreeing to defer for at least a year its expanded export control regime on rare earth minerals, which it announced as retaliation for the US blacklist expansion, is unlikely to be seen as a major setback in Beijing.\n \n\n   \n  As one Chinese scholar, foreign policy analyst Shen Dingli, told CNN earlier this month, those measures were a “nuclear” option that Beijing knew wasn’t symmetrical – “but if China doesn’t use this weapon, China has little left to bargain with.”\n \n\n   \n  Whether Xi and Trump can manage to keep the detente as they work toward a broader deal and expected visits to each other’s countries in 2026 is the next big question.\n \n\n   \n  Canada, after all, knows first-hand that a trade truce struck with Trump  can quickly collapse. \n \n\n   \n  A range of pitfalls, both foreseeable and unexpected, in the US and China’s expansive rivalry could derail the newly-reached stabilty – and whatever deal is ultimately reached is  unlikely to address the deep-seated, structural issues between the two. \n \n\n   \n  But as Trump took off from South Korea’s Gimhae International Airport on Thursday, to return to a US stuck in the quagmire of a frozen government,   Xi stayed on  to join an international summit and tout China as a beacon for globalization, it’s clear the balance of power between them has shifted.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/top-election-campaign-ads","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"The Top 10 Fall Campaign Ads of the 2025 Elections","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During the final weeks of the 2025 off-year election season, voters in key states such as California, Virginia, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania were flooded with campaign ads focused on redistricting, energy costs, abortion rights, and political extremism.

David Wright, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Voters in Virginia, New Jersey, California and Pennsylvania have been inundated with campaign ads this year, with each state hosting critical off-year elections that offer a preview of the issues and arguments both parties are grappling with ahead of next year’s midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  Here are the ads getting the most spending during the critical final weeks of the off-year campaigns.\n \n\n   \n   (Note: Ads are ranked by committee spending between September 1 and October 27. CNN limited the list below to one advertisement per committee.) \n \n\n   \n    1. ‘Threatens,’ from opponents of California Democrats’ redistricting\n \n\n   \n  The top ad of the fall campaign season comes from the leading group opposing California Democrats’ redistricting push, “No on Prop 50: Stop Sacramento’s Power Grab.” Funded largely by Charles Munger Jr.,  a longtime supporter  of nonpartisan redistricting and heir of legendary investor Charles Munger, the group’s ad urges Californians to “protect your vote and democracy” and “vote No on Prop 50.” About $5 million has been spent on the ad so far, according to media tracking firm AdImpact. Opponents of the redistricting push have been splintered and  many are increasingly pessimistic  about Tuesday’s election.\n \n\n   \n    2. ‘Texts’ from Jason Miyares, Virginia’s Republican attorney general\n \n\n   \n   Violent text messages  sent by Jay Jones, the Democratic nominee for attorney general in Virginia, emerged as a lightning rod in Virginia’s off- campaigns, as Republicans have leaned into sharp criticism of Jones and linked him to other Democrats. “Can you trust Jay Jones to protect your children?” asks one ad from incumbent Attorney General Jason Miyares, Jones’ Republican opponent.\n \n\n   \n    3. ‘Obama,’ from Gavin Newsom’s allied group for California redistricting\n \n\n   \n  Newsom, who has  staked significant political capital  on his state’s redistricting fight,  called in the 44th president  to help. “California, the whole nation is counting on you,” Barack Obama says in the ad.\n \n\n   \n    4. ‘Stick it to Trump,’ from Tom Steyer, backing California Democrats\n \n\n   \n  Financier Tom Steyer, a liberal mega-donor  who ran for president in 2020  and is eyeing California’s 2026 governor race,  waded into his state’s redistricting fight  earlier this month with a $12 million ad buy.  “You want to stick it to Trump? Vote yes on Prop 50,” one of his ads says. Steyer gave a boost to Democrats’ messaging campaign while also raising his profile ahead of a potential statewide run next year.\n \n\n   \n    5. ‘Predators,’ from supporters of Mikie Sherrill, Democrat running for New Jersey governor\n \n\n   \n  Sherrill’s allies are running a spot accusing GOP nominee Jack Ciattarelli of “voting against legislation that would protect children and young adults in cases of domestic and sexual violence,” according to a review of his record while serving in the state assembly compiled by  the New Jersey Independent . The ad warns, “Jack Ciattarelli should never be governor of New Jersey.” Ciattarelli’s campaign did not respond to requests for comment on the ad.\n \n\n   \n    6. ‘Day One,’ from Sherrill’s gubernatorial campaign\n \n\n   \n  One of Sherrill’s top campaign ads highlights her pledge to declare a state of emergency on utility costs on day one. Energy bills have  been a top issue  for New Jersey voters this year, with spiking utility rates and soaring demand on an aging grid. In New Jersey, residential rates have climbed by up to 20%, and the tri-state Regional Plan Association  found  that “increased demand from data centers is attributed to about two-thirds of the increased prices.”\n \n\n   \n    7. ‘Same But Worse,’ from Sherrill opponents\n \n\n   \n  Republicans, too, have honed in on energy bills as a key issue in the New Jersey’s gubernatorial race. Ciattarelli has argued Sherrill would continue policies from the outgoing administration of Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy that he says contribute to the crunch. “More of the same, but worse,” Ciattarelli’s ad argues.\n \n\n   \n    8. ‘Protect Your Rights,’ from Democrats in Pennsylvania’s state supreme court vote\n \n\n   \n  It’s been 20 years since a Pennsylvania Supreme Court justice lost a retention election. This fall,  three of the state’s liberal justices  are on the ballot. and Republicans are pressing for the chance to potentially flip the ideological balance of the battleground state high court. An ad from a Democratic group supporting the justices links the retention elections to abortion, saying the state Supreme Court is “our last line of defense.”\n \n\n   \n    9. ‘Speaking,’ from Abigail Spanberger, Democrat running for Virginia governor\n \n\n   \n  Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic nominee for governor of Virginia, has plastered voters’ screens with versions of an attack ad seizing on an unflattering moment from her rival, GOP nominee Winsome Earle-Sears. The ad splices clips of Earle-Sears declaring to a booing crowd, “I am speaking,” with criticism of Republican policies. “Winsome Earle-Sears is so far right, she’s wrong for Virginia,” the ad closes, echoing a Spanberger campaign refrain. (Earle-Sears  recently aired an ad  nodding to the “I am speaking” moment in which she says to the camera, “They pick your worst day.”)\n \n\n   \n    10. ‘Extreme Silence,’ from Spanberger opponents\n \n\n   \n  Earle-Sears and her Republican allies in the Virginia governor race have made transgender policies a focal point of their attack ads, criticizing Spanberger over her support for the Equality Act and pressing her for answers on youth sports and school bathrooms. An ad from one of the groups, Restoration of America PAC, claims Spanberger “is as extreme as it gets.” Spanberger has argued local school districts should decide their own youth participation policies.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/style/oakland-california-museum-theft","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"11:45:00.000-04:00","title":"Over 1,000 Items Stolen from California Museum’s Collection in Early Morning Heist","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Over 1,000 items, including Native American baskets, campaign pins, athletic trophies, and jewelry by artist Florence Resnikoff, were stolen from the Oakland Museum of California during a burglary at an off-site storage facility on October 15, 2025.

He expects detectives are looking at resale platforms such as Craigslist and Ebay, and networks that specialize in historic or collectible antiques.\n \n\n   \n  “These people are interested in fast cash, not the full appraisal value,” he told the Times. “They need to get rid of it quickly.”\n \n\n   \n  In January 2013, an Oakland man broke into the museum itself and got away with a California Gold Rush-era jewelry box. Fogarty said the the item was traced to a pawn shop with help from the public, and she hopes the community can help again.\n \n\n   \n  The Oakland Police Department declined to provide further details, but said in its news release that police are working with a unit of the Federal Bureau of Investigation that specializes in art crime, including theft, forgery or antiquities and cultural property trafficking.\n \n\n   \n  The theft occurred four days before thieves made off with  priceless Napoleonic jewels  from the world’s most-visited museum, the Louvre, in broad daylight. Authorities have  made arrests  but the jewels have not been recovered.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/sport/wnba-players-union-cba-extension","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"10:17:00-20:00","title":"WNBA and Players Union Agree to 30-Day Extension for CBA Negotiations, AP Source Says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The WNBA and players' union have agreed to a 30-day extension of negotiations for a new collective bargaining agreement, pushing the deadline from the original expiration date to November 30, 2025.

He was kidnapped by Hamas on October 7, 2023. His family was notified in June 2024 that he was killed in captivity.

Baruch’s brother and grandmother were killed in the attack. Two months later, Baruch was killed in Gaza during a failed rescue attempt. “In this difficult and painful moment, we hope the family can find a measure of comfort in the closing of a horrific circle of 755 days and nights,” the kibbutz said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Thursday’s transfer leaves the bodies of 11 deceased hostages remaining in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  “The effort to bring back our hostages continues uninterrupted and will not cease until the return of the last hostage,” the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  The transfer of the remains comes just two days after Israel carried out punishing strikes in Gaza in response to the Hamas killing of an Israeli soldier in Rafah on Tuesday afternoon.

He threatened to “take out Hamas very easily.”\n \n\n   \n  The latest transfer appeared to proceed without the issues that have plagued recent attempts to return the remaining deceased hostages to Gaza. Hamas announced on Tuesday it was set to hand over one set of remains before saying under Israeli bombardment hours later that it would not transfer the remains.\n \n\n   \n  On Monday evening, Hamas handed over remains of deceased hostage Ofir Tzarfati, whose body had been recovered by Israel in Gaza two years earlier. Tzarfati was not among the remaining deceased hostages to be returned under the ceasefire, prompting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to accuse Hamas of a “clear violation” of the deal.\n \n\n   \n  The IDF then released video it said showed Hamas staging the discovery of the remains in Gaza City and turning over the remains to the Red Cross.

He would acknowledge he needed to embrace social media and address voter concerns about affordability.\n \n\n   \n  Over the four months that followed, Cuomo zigzagged between optimism about his candidacy and despair about the  possible mayoralty of Zohran Mamdani . He has described his run as the last chance New Yorkers will have to save the city from Mamdani’s  democratic socialism , once referring in a debate to the 34-year-old Mamdani as a “kid” and warning that his ideas were radical and unrealistic.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo’s final general election ad leans on his executive experience and also questions whether Mamdani has enough.\n \n\n   \n  “Life in New York is tough right now,” he says in the ad. “Candidates who need on-the-job training can’t fix it.”\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of Tuesday’s election, early voting numbers were up dramatically ahead of the same point in 2021, reflecting the interest New Yorkers have in a mayoral race unlike any in recent memory. The latest Quinnipiac University poll had 43% of likely voters backing Mamdani versus 33% for Cuomo and 14% for Republican Curtis Sliwa.\n \n\n   \n  And in a  new Marist Poll of likely New York City voters  released Thursday, Mamdani had 48% support over Cuomo’s 32% and Sliwa’s 16%. Indeed, every major poll on the race has found Mamdani with a double-digit lead over Cuomo, though the vast majority have found Mamdani below 50% support, according to Jennifer Agiesta, CNN Director of Polling and Analytics.\n \n\n   \n  With the exception of Fox’s survey earlier this month, every high-quality poll on the contest conducted since the Democratic primary has found Mamdani’s support landing between 43 and 48 percent. While Cuomo has made up some ground over that time, with his support rising from the mid-20s in early polls to consistent low-30s support, he continues to lag well behind the frontrunner.\n \n\n   \n  Yet in the past week, aides to Cuomo have pointed to the early voting surge as evidence that his standing in the polls is not as bad as it seems.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo suggested on Wednesday that New Yorkers were just tuning into the race.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve been focusing on it, but people have been living their lives. You now get down to the last week, they’re starting to focus,” Cuomo said. “You’re talking about a general election where many normal New Yorkers are going to vote and I think there’s gonna be a big turnout because (Mamdani) frightens New Yorkers.”\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani’s backers remain far more enthusiastic about their choice than are Cuomo’s supporters, according to the Quinnipiac poll.\n \n\n   \n  The survey also found a rise in how many New Yorkers have an unfavorable view of Mamdani (45% favorable to 41% unfavorable versus earlier in October when those figures stood at 43% favorable to 35% unfavorable).\n \n\n   \n  Still, 54% of New Yorkers had unfavorable views of Cuomo versus just 34% favorable.\n \n\n   \n  In the final stretch of the campaign, Democrats who previously supported Cuomo, political observers and even former aides of the governor were astounded after he  laughed with a radio host  who suggested Mamdani would “cheer” another 9/11. Cuomo  later said  he believed the host’s comments were offensive as Mamdani accused him of playing to Islamophobia.\n \n\n   \n  Days later, during an appearance on Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show,” host Jon Stewart joked with Mamdani about their back-and-forth.\n \n\n   \n  “You are clearly in the front-runner position right now – I can tell because they have gone 9/11 on you,” Stewart said eliciting laughter from the crowd.\n \n\n   \n  “The closing argument,” Mamdani responded.\n \n\n   \n    Cuomo reframes his legacy\n \n\n   \n  With every post and campaign stop, Cuomo tried a new media strategy while leaning into the legacy items of his 11 years as governor, including  legalizing same-sex marriage  and  raising the minimum wage . In doing so, Cuomo argued that he is the mayoral race’s original progressive.\n \n\n   \n  “I was a crazy liberal,” Cuomo said during an appearance on SiriusXM’s “Andy Cohen Live” show. “Now, the party’s moved so far left, they call me a moderate.”\n \n\n   \n   Cuomo resigned  in 2021 amid an investigation into sexual harassment allegations that he has denied and questions about how he handled Covid-19 in nursing homes.\n \n\n   \n  He won an endorsement Wednesday from US Rep. Tom Suozzi, a Long Island Democrat whose district includes parts of Queens.\n \n\n   \n  “I cannot back a declared socialist with a thin resume to run the most complex city in America,” Suozzi  wrote on X . “We need leaders who will fight crime, not undermine the police. Who will create jobs, not harm the economy. Who will keep taxes down, not make it more expensive for middle class families to live here.”\n \n\n   \n    Embracing his inner influencer\n \n\n   \n  As his campaign apparatus tried to catch up on social media, Cuomo was dismissing its significance in public.\n \n\n   \n  Standing on the debate stage, Cuomo poked fun of Mamdani’s social media fluency, holding his hands up in the air, rocking side to side while moving his hands in a talking motion.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a TikTok dance,” Cuomo said.\n \n\n   \n  Even as he mocked the videos that helped propel his opponent, Cuomo admitted they were effective. He has started posting videos of him meeting with New Yorkers that some Mamdani allies think are copying the Democratic nominee’s style.\n \n\n   \n  “He was very effective on it. His mother’s a film director, filmmaker. He’s an actor slash rapper. They did highly produced videos that were very effective. And that’s his sweet spot,” Cuomo said on Cohen’s show.\n \n\n   \n  He appeared recently at a “Cool Girls for Capitalism” event held in a swanky Tribeca members-only club known as Maxwell Social, where hosts doled out pink T-shirts and stickers emblazoned with the group name.\n \n\n   \n  At a “Young Professionals For Cuomo” fundraiser hosted by the independent candidate’s daughters, attendants got a chance to secure T-shirts showing a cartoon Cuomo surrounded by friendly iconography – a Statue of Liberty, the Star of David, a cross, a pretzel and a smiling apple.\n \n\n   \n    Experience, experience, experience\n \n\n   \n  Much like he did in the primary, Cuomo continued to lean on his experience, trying to draw a contrast between himself and Mamdani, who has served three terms in the State Assembly.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo focused on public safety, appealing to fears that  Mamdani’s police reform agenda  would lead to an increase in crime and demoralize police officers.\n \n\n   \n  The former governor has proposed hiring more officers and argued homeless people should be moved off the streets. A former housing secretary under President Bill Clinton, Cuomo said the city had suffered through years of inept governments who could not get projects off the ground.\n \n\n   \n  On the day of Hurricane Sandy’s anniversary in New York City, Cuomo was once again on the trail reminding voters of his experience and what he believed is at stake.\n \n\n   \n  “You need experience. You need the ability. You need the wisdom to know what to do because literally lives depend on you,” Cuomo said.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, Cuomo got the endorsement of former Mayor Michael Bloomberg who was in office on the day Hurricane Sandy devastated the city.\n \n\n   \n  Bloomberg, who also endorsed Cuomo in the primary and donated millions to a Cuomo Super PAC, reiterated his support for the governor and highlighted his experience.\n \n\n   \n  “Being Mayor of New York City is the second toughest job in America, and the next mayor will face immense challenges,” Bloomberg wrote in a post on X. “Andrew Cuomo has the experience and toughness to stand up for New Yorkers and get things done.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s David Wright contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/polls-election-major-races","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00Z","title":"What the Polls Say About Key Races in 2025 Off-Year Elections","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article analyzes recent polling data from key 2025 off-year elections in Virginia, New Jersey, New York City, and California.

October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  We’re just days away from 2025’s off-year elections. Beyond how the races themselves turn out, the contests will be a valuable source of data to analyze – and perhaps overanalyze – ahead of next year’s midterms.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s an overview of what the polls suggest about the four big races we’re watching this year.\n \n\n   \n  A note: Polls are a valuable tool for understanding the electorate, but they’re most useful when they’re treated as estimates rather than attempts to predict the future with pinpoint precision. Often, what they tell us about the broader political environment is more valuable than the exact margin that any specific survey finds for a race.\n \n\n   \n    Virginia statewide races\n \n\n   \n   Virginia’s election for governor  takes place in the shadow of an unpopular GOP administration in Washington, DC.  A Washington Post-Schar School poll  asked voters to describe the most important issue in the race. The share who responded with negative comments about President Donald Trump or Republicans came second only to concerns about economic issues and the cost of living.\n \n\n   \n  The Post-Schar poll, which found Democrat Abigail Spanberger with a 12-point lead over Republican Winsome Earle-Sears among likely voters, joins  other recent   surveys  in the state that show Spanberger with a stable advantage in the race. There’s much more uncertainty in the other statewide races, particularly the campaign for attorney general, where polls show support for Democrat Jay Jones facing some erosion after  the publication of text messages  in which he fantasized about killing a legislative colleague.\n \n\n   \n    New Jersey governor\n \n\n   \n   New Jersey’s gubernatorial race  is a tale of two incumbents: Trump is unpopular there as well, but the state’s outgoing Democratic governor, Phil Murphy, also draws closely divided ratings for his time in office. Many recent surveys of the race, including polls from  Quinnipiac University ,  F ox News,   Fairleigh Dickinson University  and the  Rutgers-Eagleton Poll , have found Democrat Mikie Sherrill with an edge among likely voters, hovering around the 50% mark, while her opponent, Republican Jack Ciattarelli, stands closer to 45%.\n \n\n   \n  Quinnipiac’s latest poll, like several others, found that Ciattarelli’s supporters were more likely than Sherrill’s to express strong enthusiasm about their chosen candidate, although Sherrill’s favorability ratings remained higher overall.\n \n\n   \n    New York City mayor\n \n\n   \n   New York City’s multi-candidate mayoral race  poses a unique challenge for pollsters. Surveys of likely voters, however, have been largely consistent in showing Democrat Zohran Mamdani with a double-digit lead over his nearest rival, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, with Republican Curtis Sliwa in third. They differ on the precise scope of Mamdani’s advantage, although most have found him shy of clearing a majority of support in the race.\n \n\n   \n  In polls released Thursday by  Marist College  and  Fox News , Mamdani was buoyed by positive favorability ratings and broad support among younger voters, while older voters broke for Cuomo.\n \n\n   \n    California redistricting\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps nowhere is the role of national politics as clear as in California, where  voters are weighing Proposition 50 , a ballot measure to temporarily enact a new congressional map drawn by Democrats in response to Republican-driven redistricting in other states.\n \n\n   \n  A mid-October poll from  CBS/YouGov  found 62% of likely voters in support of Proposition 50, while  an October Public Policy Institute of California poll  put that support at 56%. It’s worth noting that  past research has found  that polling sometimes overshoots support for initiatives that implement new changes – whether liberal or conservative – because some voters default to preferring the status quo.\n \n\n   \n  Half of likely voters said in the CBS/YouGov poll that their decision had more to do with national issues and politics than with state or local issues. Broad majorities of likely voters supporting Proposition 50 said their choice was driven by the desire to oppose Trump, to oppose national Republicans and to support national Democrats.\n \n\n   \n    A note on the state of polling\n \n\n   \n  How have polls been performing lately? A  new postmortem report on 2024 election polling , released Wednesday by the American Association for Public Opinion Research, found that polling in last year’s election was significantly more accurate than it was in 2020 or 2016 even as it continued to underestimate Republican vote shares for the third straight presidential cycle. (Polls in the 2022 and 2018 midterms both saw smaller directional errors.)\n \n\n   \n  As the report also noted, polls last year weren’t always able to estimate the ways that turnout changed between 2020 and 2024. That bears mentioning because all of these surveys reflect pollsters’ best estimations about who’s likely to end up voting in an off-year election – and how much that might differ from four years ago, at the start of former President Joe Biden’s administration.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/business/k-shaped-economy","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"This burrito is everything you need to know about America’s economy","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the emerging 'K-shaped' economy in the United States, where wealthier consumers continue to spend freely while lower-income Americans face financial strain due to stagnant wages, inflation, and rising living costs.

Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   Fact 1:  America’s  economy  and  stock market  keep growing, buoyed by  robust consumer spending  and  AI mega-growth .\n \n\n   \n   Fact 2:  Hiring is at a  standstill ,  inflation  is rising,  loan defaults  are abundant and Americans give this economy a  near-record-low rating .\n \n\n   \n  Confused? To understand how both of those things can be true, consider the burrito.\n \n\n   \n  Chipotle on Wednesday reported miserable earnings and cut its sales-growth forecast for the third-straight quarter. The culprit: Young and lower-income consumers (Chipotle’s core customers) are cutting back on their spending, and they’re starting to skip the guac.\n \n\n   \n  Chipotle CEO Scott Boatwright on the company’s earnings call: “We’re not losing them to the competition; we’re losing them to grocery and food at home. And so, that consumer is under pressure. It is one of our core consumer cohorts. And so, they feel the pinch and we feel the pullback from them as well.”\n \n\n   \n  Boatwright said the company’s customer surveys showed many believed Chipotle was no longer affordable. People in households that bring in less than $100,000 a year drive about 40% of Chipotle’s sales.\n \n\n   \n  Another problem: 25- to 34-year-olds, who make up 25% of Chipotle’s sales, “pulled back meaningfully.”\n \n\n   \n  “I think there’s a component of a more discerning consumer, and I think most of it – the majority of it – is this massive pullback,” Boatwright said. “That household under $100,000 a year is pulling back.”\n \n\n   \n  At the same time, some consumers are spending like they’re from a completely different universe.\n \n\n   \n  Crocs CEO Andrew Rees noted that bifurcation on a call with analysts Thursday: “There is a portion of our North American consumers that are highly affluent. They’re buying Crocs, they’re buying other high-end brands and they are in great financial shape,” Rees said. “But there is a large portion of consumers who are nervous, they are in less-good financial shape and are being super cautious about their spending and certainly spending closer to need.”\n \n\n   \n  Or take Coke (to wash down your burrito). Coca-Cola’s Chief Operating Officer Henrique Braun on a call last week with analysts said Coke’s earnings were boosted by strong demand for the company’s premium brands: Topo Chico, Smartwater and Fairlife.\n \n\n   \n  But Braun highlighted a successful two-pronged corporate strategy, noting the tough environment for lower-income consumers hasn’t changed – despite the growth in its high-end brands. That’s why Coke is also cutting sizes (and prices) on the lower end to drive sales – to “really tackle not only affordability but premiumization as well,” Braun said.\n \n\n   \n  “When we look from a consumer point of view, we continue to see divergency in spending between the income groups,” Braun said. “The pressure on middle- and low-end income consumers is still there.”\n \n\n   \n    The ‘K-shaped’ economy\n \n\n   \n  Economists call that phenomenon a “ K-shaped ” economy: Wealthier people are spending like nothing’s wrong. Lower-income people are making significant changes to preserve their finances.\n \n\n   \n  Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell  addressed that concept  Wednesday in a media briefing.\n \n\n   \n  “On the K-shaped economy … if you listen to the earnings calls or the reports of big public consumer-facing companies, many, many of them are saying there is a bifurcated economy there and that consumers at the lower end are struggling and buying less and shifting to lower-cost products,” Powell said. “But at the top, people are spending, at the higher income and wealth.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s not all anecdotal: Last month, Moody’s Analytics reported that the country’s top earners  are accounting for a growing share of overall spending .\n \n\n   \n  What’s causing that divide?\n \n\n   \n  Wealthier Americans are generally invested in the surging stock market, which has gained 17% this year. They have more job security than lower-income workers. And they own homes, which  keep appreciating  in the tight-supply market.\n \n\n   \n  By contrast, less-affluent Americans are living paycheck to paycheck, and their wages aren’t keeping up with inflation. If they lose their jobs, the cruddy labor market is preventing them from finding a new one – the number of Americans on unemployment insurance for multiple weeks recently surged to a  four-year high . And rents, until recently, had jumped as demand for rentals explodes – because so few homes have been on the market.\n \n\n   \n    What happens next?\n \n\n   \n  A K-shaped economy can be difficult to repair. America’s economy has been increasingly bifurcated for quite some time – with the exception of a few years following the pandemic.\n \n\n   \n  During those post-pandemic years, government support for workers gave lower-income Americans a leg up. For the first time in a generation, the wealth gap narrowed.  Wages outpaced inflation , especially for lower-income workers. Interest rates were low, and homeowners refinanced like crazy to lock in historically low mortgage costs.\n \n\n   \n  But it was short-lived. The sugar rush of government stimulus checks wore off, and the economy resumed its previous trajectory. Mortgage rates rose to multi-decade highs. And, concerning for people who are getting left behind, the US government began pushing safety-net programs in the opposite direction, reducing benefits and increasing hurdles to access support.\n \n\n   \n  Those actions could widen that “K” in the future. Wider than you have to open your mouth to eat a Chipotle burrito.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/zohran-mamdani-nypd-idf-video","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"08:42:00-04:00","title":"Mamdani explains to CNN’s Anderson Cooper why he said the IDF had laced the NYPD’s boots","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Zohran Mamdani, a Democratic mayoral nominee in New York City, has faced renewed scrutiny over a 2023 statement suggesting that the NYPD’s boots were laced by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).

weren’t. There’s now a movement to change that \n       \n  By James Frater, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:01 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  While the women accused in the infamous  Salem witch  trials in colonial America have long since been pardoned, the convictions of hundreds of British women executed under similar laws officially still stand. Now, one local authority in southern England is campaigning to change that.\n \n\n   \n  Decades before Salem, hysteria over witchcraft was already sweeping through England – and perhaps nowhere more fervently than in the southeast, such as in the neighboring counties of Kent and Essex, which border London.\n \n\n   \n  Between 1560 and 1700, more than 500 women were tried for witchcraft in the southeast region, according to UK Parliament estimates. Of those, 112 were executed.\n \n\n   \n  But one trial in Maidstone, Kent, in 1652 stands out for its scale and public fascination.\n \n\n   \n  On July 30 that year, a court convened near where Maidstone Town Hall stands today. Thirty-two people faced charges ranging from theft and murder to witchcraft, Claire Kehily, councillor for Maidstone Borough Council, told CNN. Six women, accused of bewitching to death a 10-day-old infant, her mother, and a 3-year-old child, became the focus of the town’s attention, she said.\n \n\n   \n  In the summer of 1652, the town was “abuzz with excitement,” Kehily explained.  “People came down from London to witness what was going on. It was the biggest thing we’d had here for a long time.”\n \n\n   \n  The accused were held in a small, dark jail that once stood on the ground floor of the courthouse, now tucked away in the attic of the rebuilt Town Hall.\n \n\n   \n  The trial’s notoriety was such that a special pamphlet was published shortly after, titled “A Prodigious and Tragic History of the Arraignment, Trial, Confession, and Condemnation of Six Witches,” of which Maidstone Council has a rare replica.\n \n\n   \n  The document describes bizarre and unverified claims – including one woman swelling “into a monstrous and vast bigness” before the court and another allegedly bearing “a visible teat under her tongue.”\n \n\n   \n  Three women were convicted after failing a crude test: a pin thrust into their arms. The court account said the women “did not feel it, neither did it draw blood.”\n \n\n   \n  Two others confessed to being impregnated “not by any man, but by the devil,” according to the document.\n \n\n   \n  All six were convicted of “the execrable and diabolical crime of witchcraft” and sentenced to death.\n \n\n   \n    Spectacle of execution\n \n\n   \n  Their execution took place at Penenden Heath, now a tranquil park with soccer fields and woodland.\n \n\n   \n  “They were dragged on hurdles – basically carts – to the heath,” Tony Harwood, a councillor for Maidstone Borough Council, told CNN. “Thousands came to watch. Public executions were entertainment, but also a tool of control.”\n \n\n   \n  “These were women of all ages,” Harwood continued. “Very vulnerable individuals who had no idea what was going on or why they had been put into this situation. You just have to understand the absolute terror of these events – and that is partly what’s behind it. The powers that be wanted to instil terror.”\n \n\n   \n  Harwood described the horror and spectacle of the scene. “Public executions – they were public participation events. Thousands of people would attend. There were crime waves around them: pickpocketing, thefts, lots of complaints. That’s why the execution spot at Penenden Heath was moved several times – because of the impact from the many thousands of sightseers who came to watch,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “There would have been people who were just there for the show. There would have been people who were appalled by what was going on. There would have been people who were excited by it.”\n \n\n   \n  After the executions, the bodies were discarded without ceremony. “When roads were widened or housing built, human remains have often been found,” Harwood added.\n \n\n   \n  A small stone plaque on the edge of Penenden Heath that commemorates these women – alongside the plaques for the many other people executed at this site – is the only mark of the atrocities that took place.\n \n\n   \n    Seeking justice, centuries later\n \n\n   \n  Though the frenzy surrounding witchcraft in England faded in the decades following the Maidstone trial, and all laws criminalizing witchcraft have long since been repealed, the convictions of those women – and hundreds like them – still stand.\n \n\n   \n  Now, nearly 400 years later, Maidstone Borough Council is calling for change.\n \n\n   \n  Stuart Jeffery, leader of the council, has written to Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood, urging the British government to introduce legislation that would grant a general pardon to those executed under the Witchcraft Act of 1562, including the women hanged at Penenden Heath in 1652.\n \n\n   \n  “Justice is timeless,” said Harwood. “These terrible wrongs carried out between 1542 and the mid-18th century echo through the ages. They cannot just be painted over.”\n \n\n   \n  “We need to set the record straight. These were innocent, vulnerable individuals who were brutally judicially murdered – often for political or personal gain. That injustice will echo down the ages.”\n \n\n   \n  Kehily said that the trials were “a very early form of violence against women and girls. It still happens. They were scapegoats.”\n \n\n   \n  “By highlighting it, we remind people that this has happened – and we need to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  “To address a wrong that has been made,” Kehily said, “is to try and get it right, to learn from history, and to bring it to the fore. This hasn’t gone away.”\n \n\n   \n    Precedents for pardon\n \n\n   \n  Maidstone’s campaign follows similar efforts elsewhere in the United Kingdom to confront historical injustices.\n \n\n   \n  In Scotland, then-First Minister Nicola Sturgeon issued a formal apology in 2022 to the thousands of people – mostly women – who were accused and executed under the country’s Witchcraft Act between the 16th and 18th centuries. The apology came after a sustained campaign by historians and activists who argued that the victims were persecuted for being poor, vulnerable, or simply different.\n \n\n   \n  There is also precedent for legislative pardons.\n \n\n   \n  In 2013, Queen Elizabeth II posthumously pardoned Alan Turing, the World War II codebreaker convicted under laws criminalizing homosexuality, and in 2017 the UK government extended the pardon to thousands of other gay and bisexual men convicted under similar statutes. Known as the “Turing Law,” it marked a significant step in acknowledging the injustice of discriminatory legislation.\n \n\n   \n  Councillors in Maidstone hope that a similar approach can be taken to address the legacy of the Witchcraft Act.\n \n\n   \n  “This is about justice,” Harwood said. “We’ve seen the government take steps to right past wrongs. Now it’s time to do the same for the women who were judicially murdered under the guise of witchcraft.”\n \n\n   \n  A Home Office spokesperson told CNN the government would respond to the council’s letter “in due course.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/health/autism-covid-pregnancy","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"19:06:00Z","title":"Autism diagnosis rates higher among children born to mothers who had Covid-19 during pregnancy, study suggests","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A new study from Massachusetts General Hospital analyzed over 18,000 births between March 2020 and May 2021, finding that children born to mothers with a confirmed Covid-19 infection during pregnancy were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with neurodevelopmental disorders—particularly autism—than those born to mothers without infection. The risk was higher in boys and during the third trimester, a critical period for brain development.

Previous studies have suggested that male fetal brains are more susceptible to maternal immune responses, according to the authors of the new study, and the third trimester is a “critical window for brain development.”\n \n\n   \n  The most common diagnoses included disorders in speech and motor function development and autism. About 2.7% of children born to mothers who had Covid-19 while pregnant were diagnosed with autism, compared with about 1.1% of others, according to the study, published Thursday in the journal Obstetrics and Gynecology.\n \n\n   \n  The new findings are “particularly notable in light of their biological plausibility,” the researchers wrote. They build on previous research that identified potential pathways for a maternal Covid-19 infection to affect the developing fetal brain even without direct transmission.\n \n\n   \n  “Parental awareness of the potential for adverse child neurodevelopmental outcomes after COVID-19 in pregnancy is key. By understanding the risks, parents can appropriately advocate for their children to have proper evaluation and support,” Dr. Lydia Shook, maternal-fetal medicine specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital and lead author of the study, said in  a news release .\n \n\n   \n  About 1 in 31 children in the US was diagnosed with autism by age 8 in 2022, according to a  report  published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that was published in April. The increase — up from 1 in 36 children in 2020 — continues a long-term trend that experts have largely attributed to better understanding of and screening for the condition.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, the US Department of Health and Human Services launched a “massive testing and research effort” to determine “what has  caused the autism epidemic .”\n \n\n   \n  In a news conference in September on the “ cause of autism ,” President Donald Trump — flanked by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other federal health leaders – said that use of  Tylenol during pregnancy  can be associated with a “very increased risk of autism,” despite decades of evidence that it is safe.\n \n\n   \n  Kennedy also has a history of comments linking autism and vaccines, despite strong evidence that the two are not connected.\n \n\n   \n  The timeframe of the new study – early in the pandemic, before vaccines were widely available – meant that ​the researchers were able to “isolate the association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and offspring neurodevelopment in an unvaccinated population.” About 93% of the mothers included in the assessment had not received any doses of Covid-19 vaccine. Strong infection-control policies at that time also helped reduce the potential for unreported or undetected Covid-19 cases, the researchers said.\n \n\n   \n  “These findings highlight that COVID-19, like many other infections in pregnancy, may pose risks not only to the mother, but to fetal brain development,” Dr. Andrea Edlow, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at Mass General Brigham and senior author of the new study, said in a news release. “They also support the importance of trying to prevent COVID-19 infection in pregnancy and are particularly relevant when public trust in vaccines – including the COVID-19 vaccine – is being eroded.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/tech/amazon-layoffs-andy-jassy-ai-culture","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"19:33:00-04:00","title":"Amazon says it didn’t cut 14,000 people because of money.

Lisa Murkowski said this week, berating her colleagues in both parties for failing to act. “We’re pretending that people are not being impacted by this shutdown.”\n \n\n   \n  Senate Democrats triggered the showdown, withholding support for a temporary government funding bill last month in an attempt to force Republicans to guarantee extensions for  expanded subsidies  for millions of  Affordable Care Act health plans .\n \n\n   \n  “They are completely and totally uninterested in solving or addressing, decisively, the Republican health care crisis that they’ve created,” House Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on “The Source” Wednesday night.\n \n\n   \n  “On November 1, when open enrollment begins, it’s going to be crystal clear to tens of millions of Americans, across the country, that their premiums, copays and deductibles are about to dramatically increase,” Jeffries said.\n \n\n   \n  But Republican leaders are standing firm. They’re offering to discuss extending the credits, but only when Democrats agree to open the government.\n \n\n   \n  A pitiful lack of trust between the parties, the unwillingness of either side to accept the political cost of a climbdown and Trump’s stunning indifference to his own shuttered government led to this stalemate.\n \n\n   \n  And the ramifications of the shutdown are getting quickly worse as the political duel becomes a test of which unfortunate Americans can bear the most pain.\n \n\n   \n  In one of the most critical developments, tens of millions of Americans, including children, elderly citizens and those with a disability are set to lose vital food assistance under the  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). \n \n\n   \n  The blow of soaring health care premiums is also being laid bare. Millions are getting notices showing Obamacare costs shooting up by an average of 26% and in some cases much higher, in the absence of the expiring enhanced subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  “Which pain point is the worst?” Collins asked Jeffries, referring to Americans hit by rising Obamacare premiums and those facing the potential loss of SNAP benefits. “None of this pain that Republicans have inflicted on the American people is acceptable,” Jeffries replied.\n \n\n   \n  The pressure on government workers — those forced to work without pay and colleagues who are locked out of their jobs — is also worsening.\n \n\n   \n  Flight disruptions are mounting as staff shortages emerge among air traffic controllers, who already operate  under acute stress . The controllers’ mental and emotional challenges are rising since they are  working without pay  — but still face housing, transport and childcare costs.\n \n\n   \n  A new crisis speed bump looms over paying military personnel. Trump accepted a  $130 million donation  from a fellow billionaire to fill the gap left by drained federal funds after reallocating Pentagon funds to meet a first wave of salary payments. But the gift won’t come close to paying wages for 1.3 million military members.\n \n\n   \n  Federal employees, who are spread throughout the 50 states, are getting increasingly desperate. Their financial obligations don’t just go on hold because the government can’t pay them.\n \n\n   \n    Will the misery being inflicted on Americans change political calculations?\n \n\n   \n  Conditions are therefore dropping into place for the spiking of pain that normally translates into political pressure that causes one party to flinch.\n \n\n   \n  The food stamps expiration could be a catalyst. Democrats accuse the administration of refusing to divert available funding to meet the shortfall. But the Agriculture Department insists it can’t tap a $6 billion contingency fund to pay the benefits.\n \n\n   \n  The disagreement set up a callous scenario as lawmakers squabble over what is more important — feeding the nation’s neediest people or ensuring that millions of families can continue to get health care. It’s a shameful spectacle that epitomizes a political system rendered inoperable by years of polarization and cynicism in both parties and a government that fails in its basic function to help citizens.\n \n\n   \n  As misery multiplies, the question becomes which party changes its calculus first.\n \n\n   \n  ► Will Democrats, who have stayed remarkably united during the drama, begin to see cracks, especially among moderate lawmakers, those who have competitive reelection races, or others who are retiring and can buck their party’s activists?\n \n\n   \n  ► Can Republican leaders keep their lawmakers, especially the often-fractious House GOP conference, in line? Will they risk political fallout from all this misery inflicted on voters already hit by rising inflation and grocery prices, given they have a monopoly on power in Washington?\n \n\n   \n  ► And will Trump, who has managed to defray some of the traditional pressure points during a shutdown, finally discover a political or moral imperative to end it?\n \n\n   \n    A hint of hope as senators talk\n \n\n   \n  A glimmer of hope shone late on Wednesday when details emerged of a  dual-track negotiation between frustrated Democratic and Republican senators . One goal would be to resolve the health-care impasse and reopen the government for a few weeks. The group also hopes to reach a separate long-term agreement to fund certain key departments — including the Department of Agriculture, which funds food stamps — through next year.\n \n\n   \n  Disagreements in Congress often end with creative fudges and concurrent steps that allow both sides to argue they didn’t fold. But there is no guarantee this approach will work. Senate Majority Leader John Thune’s office told CNN he remains unwilling to discuss Obamacare policy changes until the government is open.\n \n\n   \n  A few weeks ago, the closure of the federal government lacked the sweeping impact that helped earlier shutdowns seize the nation’s attention. But that’s beginning to change. The normally unruffled Thune erupted on the Senate floor Wednesday at Democratic Sen. Ben Ray Luján, who complained about SNAP benefits potentially expiring. “This isn’t a political game,” Thune snapped. “These are real people’s lives that we’re talking about. And you all just figured out, 29 days in, that, oh, there might be some consequences.”\n \n\n   \n  Democratic rhetoric is just as harsh.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer tried Wednesday to exact a political price from Trump. “Every single president was not so cruel and heartless to hold those hungry children, hungry elderly, and hungry veterans as hostages,” Schumer said. “Donald Trump is picking politics over the lives of hungry kids. He is weaponizing hunger.”\n \n\n   \n  The vitriol may offer an opening for the president because the shutdown — now just a week out from a new record — won’t end until he gets involved. He could turn his absence for most of the last week to his advantage by inserting himself into the bitterness between Democrats and Republicans to broker a resolution. After all, Trump is often more tempted more by the chance to make a deal and declare victory than by any rigid ideology. And he’s already signaled willingness to talk about expiring health-care subsidies. He could pose as the president who fed the hungry, paid the troops and made the skies safe again. This, however, would mean breaking with some of the harder-line elements in his own administration and offering Democrats a face-saving off-ramp.\n \n\n   \n  The conundrum for Democrats is how they engineer a way out of the crisis that they can present as a victory to base voters desperate to hit back at Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Early in the shutdown, the party succeeded in making Obamacare subsidies a national issue. And after nearly a year of internal mourning over the disastrous 2024 congressional and presidential elections, they found surprising unity in the shutdown. Sometimes, just picking a fight can give a party definition.\n \n\n   \n  But as the pain for millions of Americans mounted, the political clarity over health care blurred. And competing claims emerged. Everett Kelley, the president of the  American Federation of Government Employees  union that represents a wide swath of federal workers, who always opposed a shutdown, warned that it was time for the government to reopen. “I think that it’s vitally important to have health care for everyone … However, I don’t think that this should be built on the backs of federal employees,” he told CNN’s Jake Tapper.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats are also increasingly wrestling with the possibility that blame for the shutdown could blow back against them. After all, when they held the power in government, they faulted Republicans for using federal funding as a political lever. CNN’s Kasie Hunt pointed out the inconsistency to Democratic Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona on Tuesday. “That’s an easy answer. It’s Donald Trump. You’re talking about norms in the time of Donald Trump. It’s also normal not to tear down the East Wing,” Gallego said. He added: “It’s all out the window. When you’re dealing time with Donald Trump, this is the man that is extorting people. … We’re not going to go back and play by the norms when we know what’s on the line.”\n \n\n   \n  Republicans face their own risks.\n \n\n   \n  House Speaker Mike Johnson’s refusal to bring the House back to Washington looks like weakness. And he hasn’t been able to silence dissent in his conference, including from  Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene , who keeps accusing her party of negligence over the health care issue. The political equation could shift for Republicans next week if Trump is rebuked in  bellwether elections in Virginia and New Jersey .\n \n\n   \n  And leaving kids hungry could be a disaster. That’s one reason  Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley introduced a bill to fund SNAP benefits  until the end of the shutdown. Schumer said his party would vote for it. But Republican leaders will be loath to make a move that could alleviate pressure on Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  If millions of Americans going hungry doesn’t break open the deadlock, the shutdown could drag on even longer. The next potential off-ramp may come in the weeks leading up to Thanksgiving with the horrible prospect of an air travel nightmare at the busiest time of the year.\n \n\n   \n   This article has been updated with new reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5551126","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Could smaller families 'rewild' the planet — and make humans happier?","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the growing global trend of smaller families, driven by women delaying or choosing not to have children, and its wide-ranging implications.

NPR's series  Population Shift: How Smaller Families Are Changing the World  explores the causes and implications of this trend. On a late autumn day, John Davis hiked through what looks like wild forest in New York's Champlain Valley, surrounded by flaming red maple trees and yellow birch. A bird flushed noisily through the undergrowth. \"Look there, a ruffed grouse,\" he said, his delight obvious.     This place is an example of what Davis calls \"rewilding,\" which means the footprint of human activity has begun to fade.   \"It simply means stepping back and letting nature unfold as it will,\" he said. \"Some of this was farmed as recently as the 1990s. Probably used for sheep pasture and certainly for logging. You're seeing old stone walls.\" Populations in many countries are beginning to age rapidly and gradually decline, in large part due to individuals choosing to have fewer children.   It's a trend that alarms many experts, and politicians, who say the fabric of whole communities could unravel, but many activists, researchers and economists also see big upsides. This part of New York state, Essex County, has  lost about 6% of its population  since 2010 due to out-migration and the declining birthrate.     Davis, who works for an organization called the Rewilding Institute, says the pivot toward fewer people is allowing landscapes like this one to heal. \"I have a perhaps unpopular view on human population, I believe we are too many and we consume too much,\" he said. \"We need to encourage a small family ethic, especially among affluent people.\" Upsides: More choice and a huge decline in teen pregnancy The global population has doubled to more than 8 billion since the 1970s. Davis thinks that growth turbocharged consumerism and accelerated climate change and the loss of wildlife habitat.  \"I love kids, we all love kids,\" Davis said. \"But if we could encourage small families, we'd have a better chance addressing not just the extinction [of species] and climate crisis, but also problems of poverty and inequity.\"  That hope is being tested, as the \"small family ethic\" championed by Davis and other activists arrives in much of the world.   Since the 1970s, researchers say family size dropped by more than half, from about five children per woman on average to roughly two,  according to the latest United Nations data .   Actual population decline has already begun in about half the G7 industrialized countries that make up much of the world's economic activity.   Every one of those countries, including the U.S. has  fallen below the so-called \"replacement rate\"  of births needed to maintain a stable population over the long term.   Without  large-scale immigration, the U.S.  will join the list of countries losing population in the coming decades. Experts say the trend is driven in large part by women choosing to delay having children, having fewer kids, and in many cases, deciding not become mothers at all. \"I just really wanted to do other things with my life,\" said Marian Starkey, who told NPR she and her husband opted not to have children.   \"Most of my friends here don't have children.  People have made the decision they also want to do other things with their lives than raise children.\"  Starkey works with a group called Population Connection that advocates in favor of policies that support this shift toward smaller families and gradual depopulation.   According to Starkey, fewer people will mean a healthier environment, but she also thinks the trend is good news for humans.   \"The smaller families are, the more time and wealth there is to invest in each child, making sure all of your kids get an education, which does not happen in all parts of the world, especially for girls,\" she said. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Many experts are voicing deep concerns about this population shift. They say it's not clear how economies and family structures that have relied for decades on steady growth will function as communities age and begin to decline.   \"I think this has huge implications for which we're not prepared as a society,\" said Martina Yopo-Díaz, a sociologist at the Catholic University in Santiago, Chile, who studies population loss,  in a July interview with NPR . \"Key social systems, from the economy to the labor market to pensions, are based on the principle that there will be new generations to replace the old ones. But now we see that that principle is no longer something that we can, you know, take as given.\" But NPR also found experts who who view this as a hopeful moment, part of a decades-long trend with benefits for the environment, families and women. Claudia Goldin, an economist at Harvard University, said fears about declining population are overblown. She says there's evidence people are happier when free to decide for themselves if and when to have kids.   \"To have the number of children they want to have, and to have them at the right time in their lives, is certainly a benefit to couples,\" she said.   None of the advocates for lower population interviewed by NPR favor efforts that force people to have fewer kids, like China's infamous \"One Child\" policy, which ended in 2016. Instead they support access to reproductive freedom, family planning information, and contraception. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Goldin and other experts said the biggest single upside to the trend toward smaller families may be improvements in the lives of women and girls.  Research shows delaying motherhood  and having fewer children  often leads to more education, more financial security  and better health.  \"The ability of women to decide how many children to have and when to have them, it's something that is a very positive development in the history of mankind,\" said Vladimíra Kantorová, the lead population scientist at the United Nations.   Kantorová points to the fact that much of the falling birthrate in the U.S. and around the world reflects a plunge in teen and child pregnancy. \"Adolescent child bearing has declined everywhere, so this is something that is really a success story,\" she said. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Those who see advantages in this population shift generally agree that smaller families and declining birthrates will bring serious policy challenges. Finding workers, maintaining a strong economy and weaving a sense of community could be more difficult in many areas.  One question is how to fund the social safety net and healthcare for rising numbers of elderly, when there are fewer young people. John Davis says he doesn't have answers to all those challenges but he's hopeful people will find ways to navigate this transition.   \"If the smartest young minds in the world were dedicated to figuring how a declining population could support its elders, we would achieve that goal,\" he said. \"I think we'd have a happier world, for people and wildlife.\"  \n         \n         Transcript \n         SCOTT SIMON, HOST:   The first time in modern history, the world's human population is expected to level off and then begin to shrink later this century. It is a trend that will pose a huge challenge as communities begin to age. But as part of our series Population Shift: How Smaller Families Are Changing The World, we look today at what might be some of the benefits. NPR's Brian Mann has been speaking to thinkers and activists who welcome a planet with fewer people. (SOUNDBITE OF LEAVES CRUNCHING) BRIAN MANN, BYLINE: On a late autumn day, John Davis treks through what looks like wild forest in New York's Champlain Valley - flaming red maple trees, yellow birch. Not so long ago, Davis says there were people here working this land. (SOUNDBITE OF LEAVES CRUNCHING) JOHN DAVIS: Some of this was farmed as recently as, I believe, the 1990s. We're seeing old stone walls. It was probably used for sheep pasture some and certainly for logging. MANN: This place is an example of what Davis calls rewilding. DAVIS: Simply means stepping back and letting nature unfold as it will. MANN: This part of New York state, Essex County, has lost about 6% of its population since 2010 because of migration and the low birth rate. It's a trend happening in a growing number of regions in more and more countries. This kind of slow depopulation worries many economists and business leaders. But Davis, an environmental activist who works for an organization called the Rewilding Institute, thinks it's overdue. (SOUNDBITE OF LEAVES CRUNCHING) DAVIS: I have a perhaps unpopular view on human population. I believe that we are too many and that we consume too much. We need to encourage a small family ethic, especially among affluent people. MANN: The global population has doubled to more than 8 billion since the 1970s. Davis thinks that growth turbocharged everything from climate change to the loss of wildlife. Here's the fascinating thing. That small family ethic he mentioned, it's already here. Over roughly that same period, beginning in the 1960s, researchers say family size worldwide dropped by more than half, from about five children per woman, on average, to roughly two. In most countries, outside sub-Saharan Africa, population growth has slowed almost to zero, and in many areas, population decline is a reality. Marian Starkey's family is helping shape that trend. MARIAN STARKEY: I just really wanted to do other things with my life. MANN: Starkey says she and her husband decided not to have kids. She works with a group called Population Connection that advocates in favor of this shift towards smaller families and gradual depopulation. Fewer people means a healthier environment, Starkey says. But she also thinks it's good for humans. STARKEY: The smaller families are, the more time and wealth there is to invest in each child, so making sure that all of your kids get an education, which does not happen in a lot of parts of the world, especially for girls. MANN: Now, again, NPR has spoken to a lot of experts deeply concerned about this population shift. They say it's not clear how economies and family structures that have long relied on growth will function as communities age and begin to decline. But we also wanted to hear from people convinced this is a hopeful moment. Claudia Goldin is an economist at Harvard who thinks fears about declining population are overblown. She says there's evidence people are happier making their own choices - when and if to have kids. CLAUDIA GOLDIN: To have the number of children that they would like to have and to have them at the right time in their lives is certainly a benefit to couples. MANN: It's important to say none of the advocates for lower population interviewed by NPR want policies that force people to have fewer kids. Instead, they support access to reproductive freedom and contraception. Goldin and other experts say the biggest single upside to this trend towards smaller families may be improvements in the lives of women and girls. Research shows delaying motherhood and having fewer children can lead to more education, more financial security and better health. Vladimira Kantorova is the lead population scientist at the United Nations. VLADIMIRA KANTOROVA: It's something which is a very positive development in the history of mankind. MANN: Kantorova says much of the falling birth rate in the U.S. and around the world reflects one more positive, a plunge in teen and child pregnancy. KANTOROVA: So this is something which is really a success story. MANN: Even those who see big upsides in this population shift agree smaller families and declining birth rates will mean turbulence and policy challenges. Finding workers, maintaining a strong economy and weaving a sense of community could be more difficult. One big question is how to fund the social safety net and health care for rising numbers of elderly when there are fewer young people. (SOUNDBITE OF LEAVES CRUNCHING) MANN: John Davis says he doesn't have answers to all those challenges, but he's hopeful people will find ways to navigate this transition. DAVIS: If the smartest young minds in the world were dedicated toward figuring out how a declining population can support its elders, we would achieve that goal. I think we'd have a happier world for people and wildlife. MANN: Most experts agree smaller families are here to stay. People who cheerlead lower population say it's time to lean into that change, planning and working to make sure the benefits outweigh the costs. Brian Mann, NPR News.

\n   \n  Hurricane Melissa brought devastation and death to the Caribbean as it tore through the region as one of the most powerful Atlantic storms in more than 150 years.\n \n\n   \n  Torrential downpours and forceful winds unleashed widespread destruction along the storm’s path in Jamaica, Cuba and the Bahamas. At least 30 people have died, though the full toll of the catastrophic storm may take days or weeks to be determined.\n \n\n   \n  As the hurricane headed toward Bermuda early Thursday, emergency officials in countries along Melissa’s path have begun to pick up the pieces – clearing roads to reach isolated communities in need of relief.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew Holness, the prime minister of Jamaica, traveled to some of the hardest-hit areas of the island nation Wednesday to survey the significant damage caused by punishing winds and widespread flooding.\n \n\n   \n  “Despite the difficulties, the Jamaican spirit shines through as a strong reminder that we are a resilient nation with the capacity to triumph over adversity,” he wrote  on social media .\n \n\n   \n    Path of destruction\n \n\n   \n  In the Caribbean, hotter-than-average waters paired with minimally disruptive winds higher in the atmosphere to create the perfect fuel and prime conditions for Melissa to strengthen.\n \n\n   \n  Melissa rapidly  intensified , jumping from a 70 mph tropical storm on Saturday morning to a 140 mph Category 4 hurricane Sunday morning.\n \n\n   \n  By Tuesday, Melissa had morphed into a high-end Category 5 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 185 mph, tying it with  four other hurricanes  as the second-strongest storm recorded in the Atlantic since records began in 1851.\n \n\n   \n  As it headed toward Jamaica, where it slammed into the coast as a Category 5 storm on Tuesday, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) warned it expected the situation to be “catastrophic.”\n \n\n   \n  “For Jamaica, it will be the storm of the century for sure,” WMO tropical cyclone specialist Anne-Claire Fontan said.\n \n\n   \n  Overnight Tuesday into Wednesday, it crossed into eastern Cuba, still a formidable Category 3 hurricane by the time it made landfall in the province of Santiago de Cuba.\n \n\n   \n  By the time it reached the Bahamas on Wednesday, Hurricane Melissa had been downgraded to a Category 1, but its broad wind field continued to drive torrential flooding rain, damaging winds and dangerous storm surge at the coast.\n \n\n   \n  More than 735,000 people were  evacuated in Cuba  as Melissa approached, according to President Miguel Díaz-Canel, while in the Bahamas, preliminary estimates show 1,485 residents were evacuated before all flights were suspended ahead of the approaching storm.\n \n\n   \n  Evacuation orders were also issued for six islands in the Bahamas.\n \n\n   \n  Other countries, including the Dominican Republic and Haiti, also felt the cataclysmic impacts of Melissa.\n \n\n   \n    Devastation left behind\n \n\n   \n  Across the Caribbean, officials painted a consistent picture of the destruction Melissa left behind.\n \n\n   \n  “The conditions here are devastating. ‘Catastrophic’ is a mild term based on what we are observing here,” Richard Solomon, the mayor of the southwest Jamaican city of Black River, where Hurricane Melissa made landfall, said in a  video  posted by the Jamaica Constabulary Force.\n \n\n   \n  Around 140,000 people were cut off as the storm pummeled the island, the government has said.\n \n\n   \n  A CNN crew observed residents and military personnel push more than a dozen ambulances past storm debris in the town of Santa Cruz as the medical convoy headed to a coastal area in western Jamaica, which was hit hard.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities in Jamaica have recovered at least four bodies in the badly hit St. Elizabeth Parish in the aftermath of Hurricane Melissa, a source in the government told CNN on Wednesday. The Jamaica Constabulary Force confirmed eight more deaths on Thursday in Westmoreland, Hanover and St. James.\n \n\n   \n  Three people also died during storm preparations.\n \n\n   \n  Holness  declared  the country a disaster area   Tuesday, as he sought to deter price gouging.\n \n\n   \n  “We must… continue to proactively maintain stability, protect consumers, and prevent any exploitation at a time when citizens are securing food, water, and supplies,” Holness said.\n \n\n   \n  Around 77% of the country was  left  without electricity after Melissa crossed, a spokesperson said. The country’s infrastructure has taken a battering, leaving it “severely compromised,” according to Desmond McKenzie, Jamaica’s minister of local government and community development.\n \n\n   \n  Around 25,000 tourists remained in Jamaica as the country emerged from the storm, Dana Morris Dixon, minister of education, skills, youth and information, said in a  statement .\n \n\n   \n  In the already  beleaguered  country of Haiti, 23 people have died and 13 are missing, the country’s Civil Protection Agency said Wednesday. Twenty of the deaths, including 10 children, happened when a flooded river in Petit-Goâve burst its banks, the agency said, revising an earlier death toll of 25 reported by the mayor.\n \n\n   \n  Steven Guadard, who lives in Petit-Goâve, told the  Associated Press  the storm killed his entire family.\n \n\n   \n  “I had four children at home: a 1-month-old baby, a 7-year-old, an 8-year-old and another who was about to turn 4,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel said Hurricane Melissa had wrought “significant” damage on the island.\n \n\n   \n  “It has been a highly complex night, with significant damage reported,” Díaz-Canel wrote on X. “I urge our people to remain vigilant, to uphold discipline, and to continue taking all necessary precautions.”\n \n\n   \n    Recovery efforts\n \n\n   \n  Several international efforts have already been launched to aid in the recovery efforts.\n \n\n   \n  The United Kingdom said on Wednesday it was  deploying  £2.5 million ($3.3 million) in emergency humanitarian funding.\n \n\n   \n  China’s ambassador to Cuba shared a video on  social media  showing hundreds of boxes labeled as “family kit” being transported from a warehouse.\n \n\n   \n  US President Donald Trump on Wednesday authorized “an immediate US response” to mobilize support for affected communities in the Caribbean, according to a  statement  released by the State Department.\n \n\n   \n  Within hours, Secretary of State Marco Rubio “deployed a regional Disaster Assistance Response Team, including urban search-and-rescue teams, to assess needs and provide search and recovery assistance,” the statement read.\n \n\n   \n  “The State Department is collaborating with UN agencies, NGOs, and host governments to deliver food, water, medical supplies, hygiene kits, temporary shelter, and search and rescue support.”\n \n\n   \n  The Jamaican government launched an  official website  for relief and recovery efforts, where users can access updates on flooding locations or blocked roads and locate shelters.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5591497","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"14:43:00Z","title":"As SNAP benefits run dry, 'grocery buddies' are footing their neighbors' food bills","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As federal SNAP benefits face a critical pause due to a government shutdown, millions of Americans are at risk of going hungry.

'grocery buddies' are footing their neighbors' food bills \n         By Juliana Kim \n        \n           Updated Saturday, November 1, 2025 • 2:43 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         For Alicia Spradley, it all started with a quick prayer. Spradley from Chicago had seen the news that federal food aid was pausing at the start of November due to the government shutdown. With local food banks  already stretched thin , she worried that her neighbors might soon go hungry. So, on Monday night, she closed her eyes and asked, \"What can I do to help?\" A few hours later, she came across a post on a Facebook community group about becoming a \"grocery buddy\" — someone who buys groceries for a stranger or anyone at risk of losing their food benefits. Without hesitation, Spradley wrote her own callout, offering support. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) said funding has run dry for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — better known as SNAP or food stamps — past October. For nearly 42 million Americans who rely on the assistance, that means their debit-like EBT cards are at risk of not being refilled this month. Some states have committed funding to help fill the gap, but it's unclear how long the support can last. On Friday,  a federal judge ruled  that the USDA must use emergency funds to keep SNAP going and ordered an update by Monday. It remains unclear how the Trump administration will respond. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In response to the limbo, there has been a wave of people nationwide on social media participating in an informal grocery buddy system until benefits are restored. Some \"buddies\" are sending gift cards, while others are shopping and dropping off groceries. In her neighborhood of Rogers Park, Spradley said more than two dozen people replied to her offer — some asking for help themselves, others pointing to friends or neighbors who need the support. \"I did not think that in just a short period of time that we would get that much interest,\" said Spradley, who also runs Plate & Pathways, a small nonprofit that works to combat food insecurity. SNAP is the largest anti-hunger program in the country. Most of its recipients are seniors, people with disabilities and families with children. Similarly, Spradley said many of the people who asked for her help were elderly or working families who struggled to find the time to visit a local food pantry. \"I'm glad that people have the courage to reach out and ask for help,\" she said. Hannah Coburn, a night-shift nurse in Spokane, Wash., felt the same way when she posted a callout on her private Facebook account. At first, most of the replies were from friends cheering on the idea. Then, a message popped up in her inbox: It was from an acquaintance she had met a few times at roller derby events. \"She said that it was really hard for her to reach out,\" Coburn said. \"It didn't even occur to me that she would be someone who would lose that.\" According to Coburn, the acquaintance said she had some money set aside for groceries but ended up using the funds for unexpected car repairs. Coburn's takeaway is that anyone could be relying on SNAP benefits and sometimes, the only way to find out who needs help is to offer it first. \" I hope that more people see that and get an idea of like, 'Oh, I could do something and maybe it could be helping somebody that I actually know,' \" she said. Others say they were motivated to step in because they had experienced financial hardship firsthand. Karie Fugett, an author from Dothan, Ala., said she grew up on food stamps and, later in life, faced periods of living in her car and not knowing where her next meal would come from. \"I am lucky right now to be able to afford groceries, afford my rent, all of that, but I haven't forgotten that in the past that wasn't the case and that people helped me,\" she said. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Fugett is currently supporting two families on SNAP, totaling over $1,000. To do so, she said she plans to tap into funds that she saved to build her future house. \"I'll just figure out how to get that money back later,\" she said. \"I don't need it in this moment and other people need things in this moment, so that's a priority to me.\" Fugett also expressed frustration that families are at risk of going hungry as a result of lawmakers unable to reach an agreement to end the government shutdown. \"It's especially upsetting that it's because the people that we voted into office are not doing their job,\" she said. While grocery buddies offer immediate help, SNAP changes could cause long-term woes In North Carolina's Outer Banks, Micah Iverson, a project manager and musician, said he recently dropped off groceries for a single mother of four children in his community. The experience gave him a new perspective. \"I've never bought baby diapers before,\" he said. \"They're very expensive, in case you didn't know.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Iverson paid for the woman's groceries using a $300 gift card that he won at a trivia game. The night that he went to unload the bags into the woman's car, Iverson said they both were holding back tears. \" She kind of stopped me at the end and was like, 'I really didn't know what I was gonna do, so thank you,'\" he said. Although his gift card only lasted for one grocery trip, Iverson said he plans to check in and help out with groceries in a few weeks if SNAP remains stalled. \" We'll do this just until something changes,\" he said. The lapse in federal food and nutrition assistance isn't necessarily short-lived. Since the  One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed in July , SNAP has faced budget cuts and stricter eligibility rules. Starting this month, states must comply with new work requirements to qualify for the aid — a change that could leave  2.4 million people without benefits . Spradley in Chicago has been grappling with how to be a grocery buddy long-term. \" We're trying to figure this out as a community to make sure that we are not leaving anybody out and we are just coming up with things as we go,\" she said. Earlier this week, Spradley said she met with a mother who was panicking over how to feed her seven children this month. She handed the woman some cash — pooled from her wallet and donations — and what happened next surprised her. \" She's like, 'Anything that you know I can do to help you guys, let me know,'\" she said. \"And it just moves me because here is this person in need and they are still trying to be of service to the community.\" \n         \n         Correction \n         Nov. 1st, 2025 \n         A previous version of this story misidentified Micah Iverson's job title. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5590944","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"06:02:00-04:00","title":"How a great-grandmother helped researchers unravel a dinosaur mummy mystery","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Paleontologist Paul Sereno, working at the University of Chicago, traced a historic dinosaur mummy discovery from 1908 in eastern Wyoming by using a unique clue: a rancher's great-grandmother, who served as the postmaster of the fictional town Warren, Wyoming.

How a great-grandmother helped researchers unravel a dinosaur mummy mystery \n         By Bill Chappell \n        \n           Saturday, November 1, 2025 • 6:02 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         You might not think a paleontologist looking for 66-million-year-old fossils would need to ask a rancher about his great-grandmother's job in the Wyoming badlands. But that's what Paul Sereno, a paleontologist at the University of Chicago, did when he was trying to track down a historic site where a famous dinosaur mummy was found in 1908. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Sereno's work, published in the journal   Science , brings new clarity about the appearance of the duck-billed  Edmontosaurus annectens , a massive herbivore from the Cretaceous period. Sereno and his team's painstaking work reveals the dinosaur's hooves and spiky tail in exquisite detail. They studied how a fragile clay template can create dinosaur \"mummies.\" But first they had to find them. \"It involved sleuthing archives and finding photographs from these original excavations that no one knew of, and then also talking to ranchers,\" Sereno says of the research. \n       \n       Youtube Video \n       Looking for a post office  Sereno was hunting for the spot where the famed collector Charles Sternberg discovered a dinosaur mummy in the rough terrain of eastern Wyoming. He managed to find historical photos and a note from Sternberg recounting his path to the site, back in the era of horse-drawn carriages. There were references to Warren, Wyo., — a town that, Sereno says, \"doesn't exist on any map.\" So, he asked around at nearby ranches. \"One of the ranchers had a great-grandmother that was the postmaster of Warren, Wyoming,\" Sereno says. In those days, the post office was on a ranch, he adds. \"And from that, I can calculate a distance to one of the mummies that were found in 1908,\" Sereno says. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The area has come to be known as \"the mummy zone,\" where a very thick layer of river sand captured dinosaurs' bodies and preserved valuable information about them. As technicians removed grains of sand from the  Edmontosaurus  specimens, Sereno was fascinated by what they found. \"A mummy is actually a mask of the body, very thin, like the clay you'd put on your face to clean out your pores,\" he says of their specimens. \"And that's what's trapped in the sediment, and not a replacement of the actual skin.\" Vital details about the large dinosaur were captured in fragile clay templates, just one-hundredth of an inch thick. \"For once, we know what a large dinosaur looks like from head to toe,\" Sereno says. \"We've got the bill at the front end, the hooves ... and samples of everything in between, including the crest on the back, the spikes on the tail. We know it, and you could depict it, and it's accurate.\" \"With one exception,\" he adds. \"We don't know the color.\" The two specimens include an adult nicknamed \"Ed Sr.\" and a late juvenile dubbed \"Ed Jr.\" — \"the only juvenile dinosaur mummy ever discovered,\"  according to the university . \"The feet are beautiful\" Sereno's study quickly caught the eye of other experts on the duckbill dinosaur, including Clint Boyd, the paleontology program manager for the North Dakota Geological Survey. His agency has its own  Edmontosaurus  specimen (\"Dakota the Dinosaur Mummy\"), so I asked Boyd what he thinks of Sereno's study. \"The feet are beautiful,\" Boyd says, adding that the new study jibes with much of his agency's work. Both Boyd and Sereno say that some of the terminology in their field could confuse a layperson. They stress that these mummies are nothing like Egyptian mummies, for instance. And when they say  Edmontosaurus  had hooves, they warn not to think of   a horse hoof. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"What they're talking about is a hoof like what you see on like a rhino, which absolutely that's what it looks like,\" Boyd says, describing a prominent nail in the front of fleshy pads. Boyd says that while Sereno's specimens are different from what he and his colleagues are working on, the new paper resolves important questions and will help drive new research. \"It's a very thorough study, which is great,\" Boyd says. \"We needed a very good baseline for understanding at least one set of dinosaur mummies in order to then have a reference point to start comparing back to other specimens. So this has been a very long-needed addition to the science.\" Kindling an interest in paleontology This isn't Sereno's first dinosaur rodeo. He's  made big discoveries before . His email address doesn't even use his name; instead, it just says, \"dinosaur.\" The mummy study closes a meaningful loop in Sereno's own life. He notes that the prize specimen that sparked his search, unearthed back in 1908, sits in the  American Museum of Natural History  in New York — and it was a visit to that spot, decades ago, that made a huge impact on a Sereno. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"That's when I decided to be a paleontologist,\" he says of standing next to that exhibit. \"Little did I know my career would end up taking me back to where that mummy was discovered by Charles Sternberg more than a century ago.\" Sereno has a message for young fans of dinosaurs and paleontology: \"If you're an enthused kid, thinking, maybe we found everything. No, we have not.\" Plenty of work remains to make new discoveries and solve more mysteries about how dinosaurs lived, he says. \"For the next two generations, we're going to be finding more things about the deep past and about dinosaurs and other creatures than ever,\" Sereno says. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5593453","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"5 Questions About What the Results Might Mean on Election Day, November 4, 2025","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article analyzes key political questions surrounding the off-year elections on November 4, 2025, including public sentiment toward President Trump, the potential impact of Proposition 50 in California on redistricting, shifting Latino voter support, and the effectiveness of different Democratic campaign styles.

Election Day is Tuesday. Here are 5 questions about what the results might mean \n         By Domenico Montanaro \n        \n           Saturday, November 1, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Off-year elections are often a referendum on the president and his party. And this year, of course, that means President Trump and Republicans. Trump is unpopular, particularly with independents, who will be key in swing districts in next year's midterm elections. So the narratives and the margins coming out of the Nov. 4 elections will matter — and offer some clues as to how the landscape for 2026 begins to take shape. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Here are five questions to consider when thinking about Tuesday's elections: 1. How much of a drag is Trump? Republicans lost 40 House seats during Trump's first midterm in 2018. Just before that election, Trump's approval rating, according to Gallup, was  40 %. Now, it's an almost identical  41 %. Democrats have certainly been trying to use Trump a lot in the 2025 elections, mentioning him often in ads, and trying to tie their Republican opponents to him. Republican candidates in these elections have largely steered clear of the president. Partially, that's because the most closely watched elections Tuesday are taking place in states that lean left — governors' races in Virginia and New Jersey, the New York mayor's race and the fight over a ballot initiative in California. But these elections have a history of moving in the direction of the party opposite of the president's. That's because they're among the first chances for voters aligned with the party out of power to register their frustration. It's why, for example, the governor's race in Virginia has gone to the opposition party in 11 of the last 12, dating back to 1977. (The exception was Democrat Terry McAuliffe during Obama's presidency.) It's a necessary, perennial caveat that too much shouldn't be made out of off-year elections and what they mean for midterms, but Tuesday's elections will be the first major electoral sign of the political mood in the county — and what voters think of the president. 2. Will Democrats have a chance at counterbalancing Republican redistricting efforts?  Maybe the most important election Tuesday is one in California when  voters decide on Proposition 50. The state is currently mandated to redraw congressional districts by an independent commission. But voting in favor of Prop 50 Tuesday would temporarily overturn that requirement and give Democrats the chance to try and offset gains Trump is trying to make in redrawing  in red states like Texas . This will also be an early test of Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a likely 2028 presidential candidate. The \"No\" campaign has run ads urging people to stop Newsom's \"power grab.\" Newsom himself has run ads for the \"Yes\" campaign and opponents have pulled back the millions they had been promising to spend. A sign of the direction this is headed Tuesday? 3. Are Latinos shifting away from Republicans? Trump made inroads with Latinos in the 2024 presidential election. In fact, he did better with Latinos than any Republican in history, according to exit polls. But there have been signs in polling during this second Trump term that they are slipping from the president and the GOP. That's come amid Trump's mass deportations that have rounded up far more than the hardened criminals Trump's administration promised — and Trump's lack of focus on getting prices down, a key reason many switched sides to vote for Trump. One place to watch as an indicator is New Jersey. Though Trump lost the state in 2024, he made significant improvements, particularly in counties with heavy Latino populations. For those playing at home, the counties to watch here include Passaic (45% Latino, per the Census), Hudson (41%), Cumberland (36%) and Union (35%). Trump improved in all of them from his 2020 national loss to 2024 win. He was the first Republican to win Passaic since 1992. He won it by about 3 points after losing it by 16 points four years earlier and 22 points in 2016. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       4. What messaging lessons do Democrats take out of Tuesday?  There are very different candidates running in these elections. And they are likely to serve as different examples over the next year of how to run — or not — as a Democrat. For New York mayor, for example,  Zohran Mamdani has captured  the imaginations of progressives with his focus on affordability. But he's also become a lightning rod on the right for his criticisms of Israel and past tweets calling for defunding the police. He has since disavowed the idea of defunding the police and says safety is a top priority. How he does Tuesday — and, more importantly, how he governs, if he wins — could indicate whether Democrats nationally run with his message and style, or if they prefer the more reserved approach of their gubernatorial candidates in Virginia and New Jersey. Abigail  Spanberger in Virginia  is running on \"tradition\" and \"service,\" and Mikie  Sherrill in New Jersey  stresses her military credentials. But the truth is Democrats are in the wilderness, and there's no perfect way to run. First of all, candidates have to be authentic, true to themselves. Few will be able to replicate Mamdani's knack for using social media. And Mamdani can't invent being a CIA officer (Spanberger) or Navy helicopter pilot (Sherrill). What his campaign has exposed most is that a focus on affordability with a clear message and a lack of condescension toward a younger generation has been key for winning over younger progressives. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Of course, not everywhere is New York and progressives aren't a majority of voters. That's something Democrats, in particular, have to balance as the party has traditionally had a wider range of views and identities. 5. What will the elections mean for the shutdown?  The country is careening toward the longest government shutdown in American history. There is no real end in sight, but Tuesday's results may have an impact. Health care has been a major reason for this shutdown. Democrats want to extend subsidies before they expire at the end of the year so tens of millions of people don't see their premiums go way up. Republicans are refusing to negotiate until the government is reopened, but Democrats are skeptical they would negotiate in good faith at all. During the  longest shutdown in history in 2019 , polling clearly showed a majority blaming Trump for the shutdown. That put pressure on Trump to come to the table. But this time around, even though Republicans are getting  more of the blame , it's not as overwhelming as six years ago. And that has the two sides in a stalemate. Tuesday could shake that up, especially if there are definitive results in one direction or the other. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5594194","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"19:21:00-04:00","title":"Two More Suspects Charged in the Louvre Jewel Heist","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Two more suspects were charged in connection with a brazen $100 million jewel heist at the Louvre museum in Paris, which occurred two weeks ago and was carried out in broad daylight by a team of four individuals who used a ladder, reflective vests, and a circular saw to break into the Apollon wing.

          Saturday, November 1, 2025 • 7:21 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         PARIS — Two more suspects were charged on Saturday in the Louvre jewel heist case, three days after their arrests. A total of four people are now being held and charged with stealing $100 million worth of royal jewels from the Paris museum two weeks ago. The jewels are still missing. The prosecutor said in a statement on Saturday that two of the five people who were arrested on Wednesday have been charged. One, a 37-year-old alleged to be part of the four-man team that police believe carried out the heist, has been charged with organized theft and criminal conspiracy. Prosecutor Laure Beccuau said he was already known to judicial authorities. The other, a 38-year-old woman, has been charged with complicity in preparing the crime. Two other men, also alleged to be a part of the foursome, were arrested a week ago. They have also been charged with organized theft and criminal conspiracy. The man and woman charged on Saturday were found through DNA and cell phone records, the prosecutor said. The other three who were arrested but not charged this week have since been released from custody. The two new suspects deny any involvement in the crime. Adrien Sorrentino, a lawyer for the 38-year-old woman, told reporters \"she is devastated\" by the accusations and is contesting the charges. Of the  other two suspects charged , one was picked up at Charles de Gaulle Airport where he prepared to leave the country with a one-way ticket to Algeria. The other was arrested at his home in the Paris suburb of Aubervilliers. The first two male suspects, who had criminal records for theft, immediately came under police surveillance when their DNA was found on objects left at the crime scene. The prosecutor said police were forced to arrest them prematurely because one was about to leave the country. Those two suspects have \"partially admitted\" to the theft, according to Beccuau. The brazen jewel heist, which took place in broad daylight, has shocked France. The thieves pulled a moving truck with an extendable ladder up to a wing of the museum. Wearing reflective vests to look like maintenance workers, they climbed the ladder to the balcony of the Apollon wing, broke the window and entered. They used a circular saw to cut into glass cases holding the jewels. A Louvre guard filmed them during the theft. The men climbed back down the ladder and sped away on two motor bikes driven by the two other accomplices. The whole operation took less than 10 minutes. In their chaotic haste to leave the scene of the crime the thieves left behind many items: a motorcycle helmet, a circular saw, a glove, a gas can, a walkie talkie and a reflective vest. Since their arrest, less than a week after the crime, a portrait of bunglers instead of sophisticated thieves has emerged. The incident has sparked a debate about security at the Louvre, the most-visited museum in the world. Louvre Director Laurence Des Cars, who testified in front of a parliamentary commission, admitted that only a third of the museum's wings are under video surveillance, and that the camera on the balcony where the thieves broke in was not pointed towards the balcony. On Friday, Culture Minister Rachida Dati unveiled the initial findings of an investigation by inspectors of cultural affairs. It was highly critical, reporting what it called a \"chronic, structural underestimation of the risk of intrusion and theft at the Louvre for the last 20 years.\" Making up for the lax security is fast police work. Many French people have been impressed by their speedy apprehensions — among them, bookseller Karim Antille, whose Seine river book stand is right across the street from that fateful balcony. \"Our police are very strong,\" he said. \"It's not good to steal, but don't touch our cultural heritage.\" Many feel it's a race against time to find the jewels before they can be dismantled or taken out of the country, or both. In a press conference on Wednesday, prosecutor Beccuau said she still held hope that the jewels would be returned to the Louvre and the nation. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-96140","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"13:19:00Z","title":"Dodgers Force World Series to Decisive Game 7 by Holding Off Blue Jays 3-1","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Toronto Blue Jays 3-1 in Game 6 of the 2025 World Series, forcing a decisive Game 7.

3-1 \n         By The Associated Press \n        \n           Updated Saturday, November 1, 2025 • 1:19 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         TORONTO — Yoshinobu Yamamoto beat Toronto for the second time in a week, slumping Mookie Betts hit a two-run single in a three-run third inning and the defending champion Los Angeles Dodgers held off the Blue Jays 3-1 on Friday night to force the World Series to a decisive Game 7. Yamamoto was not quite as sharp as in his Game 2 four-hitter, the first World Series complete game in a decade. He lasted six innings and allowed an RBI single in the third by George Springer, who returned after missing two games with an injury to his right side. Rookie relievers Justin Wrobleski and Roki Sasaki combined for six outs before starter Tyler Glasnow came out of the bullpen to escape a ninth-inning jam and rescue the Dodgers. Glasnow needed only three pitches to do it. With runners on second and third and nobody out, he got Ernie Clement to pop up his first delivery on the infield for an easy out. Andrés Giménez then hit a line drive to left field that Kiké Hernández turned into a game-ending double play. Hernández caught the ball on the run in shallow left-center and fired to second base, where Miguel Rojas made a tough pick of a one-hop throw to double off Addison Barger. \"I was playing a little more shallow than the card wanted me to. But given the situation, really fast guy at second base, I was like, you know what? I'm going to play really, really shallow. If he hits it over my head, kudos to him. I feel like his pop is more to the pull side,\" Hernández said. \"Somehow I was able to hear that the bat broke even with that crowd. The crazy thing is I had no idea where the ball was because it was in the lights the whole time. But given the situation in the game, the World Series on the line and how good I was hitting tonight, I was like, it's going to hit me in the face — but I'm not stopping. I'm not pulling up. And at the very end, the ball came out of the lights and went into my glove.\" It was the first 7-4 game-ending double play in postseason history, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. \"I gave him a really hard throw to catch. I think it was a better pick than it was a play on my end,\" Hernández said. Sasaki plunked Alejandro Kirk with an 0-2 pitch to begin the inning, and Barger hit a ground-rule double to left-center that got wedged at the bottom of the wall. That's when Dodgers manager Dave Roberts summoned Glasnow. \"I just felt right there, Roki wasn't as sharp and I felt right there, Glas is a guy who has swing-and-miss stuff and I just wanted to bet on him,\" Roberts said. \"He's been chomping at the bit to make an impact.\" Max Scherzer will start Game 7 on Saturday night for the Blue Jays. The three-time Cy Young Award winner also started the last World Series Game 7, getting a no-decision when Washington won the 2019 title over Houston. \"These guys are really good at kind of just turning the page,\" Toronto manager John Schneider said. \"That will take a while to kind of unpack. That's a wild ending. I love the way we played.\" Glasnow had been lined up to potentially start for the Dodgers, seeking to become the first team to win consecutive titles since the New York Yankees won three straight from 1998-2000. Two-way star Shohei Ohtani also could be used as an opener. \"I think right now, there's no wrong answer,\" Roberts said. \"He's certainly going to be a part of the pitching plan, and with Shohei, it could be two innings, but it could be four innings. So I'm not sure where we're going to slot him. We're going to have to talk to him first on where he feels most comfortable.\" Los Angeles kept alive its bid for a third title in six seasons and its hopes to be recognized as a dynasty. \"Man, we live for Game 7, so here we go,\" Roberts said. Yamamoto, a 27-year-old right-hander in his second season with the Dodgers after winning three MVP awards in Japan, was coming off the first consecutive postseason complete games since 2001. He allowed one run and five hits with six strikeouts and a walk, stranding two runners in the sixth when he struck out Daulton Varsho with a splitter on his 96th and final pitch. Yamamoto is 4-1 with a 1.56 ERA in five postseason starts and has a 1.20 ERA in his two Series outings. Kevin Gausman lost to Yamamoto for the second time despite matching a Series record by striking out eight in the first three innings behind a dominant splitter. Tommy Edman doubled with one out in the third for the Dodgers' first hit. Ohtani was intentionally walked for the fifth time in the Series and Will Smith hit an RBI double off the left-field wall on a high splitter. Freddie Freeman walked, bringing up Betts. The three-time World Series champion entered just 3 for 23 in the Series and had been dropped from second to third in the lineup for Game 5. He was moved down another slot to cleanup Friday, his lowest in the batting order since 2017. Behind 1-2 in the count, Betts fouled off two pitches and laced Gausman's third straight fastball between shortstop and third for a 3-0 lead. That ended an 0-for-13 stretch with the bases loaded for the Dodgers that dated to the Division Series. \"Honestly, man, I know it hasn't been great for me,\" Betts said. \"But this year really hasn't been great. I just want to be there to help the boys. I came up in a big spot. ... I just was able to find a way to lock in.\" Seeking their first World Series title since 1993, the Blue Jays wore powder blue uniforms at home for the first time since September after getting wins with them in Games 4 and 5 in LA. Toronto scored when Barger doubled to start the third and came around on Springer's two-out single. Gausman gave up three runs and six hits in six innings, getting 15 swings and misses with his splitter. Sasaki, a starter turned reliever as the Dodgers tried to shore up their bullpen, escaped a two-on, one-out jam in the eighth by retiring Bo Bichette on a foulout and Varsho on a groundout. Up next Scherzer and Glasnow started Game 3, won by the Dodgers 6-5 in 18 innings. A 41-year-old right-hander, Scherzer will become the fourth pitcher to start multiple World Series winner-take-all Game 7s after Bob Gibson (1964, '67, '68), Lew Burdette and Don Larsen (both 1957 and '58). Scherzer allowed two runs over five innings for Washington against Houston in 2019, and the Nationals rallied for a 6-2 win. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5589849","dateOfPublication":"2023-04-15","timeOfPublication":"14:30:00Z","title":"New 4K Restoration of 'The Great Gatsby' Enhances Classic Cinema Experience","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A newly released 4K restoration of the film 'The Great Gatsby' has been praised for its enhanced visual and auditory quality, thanks to a collaborative effort involving original studio personnel and film historians.

Here's what that means across the country \n         By The NPR Network \n        \n           Updated Friday, October 31, 2025 • 7:34 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         The federal government shutdown has dragged into another week, and Republicans and Democrats appear no closer to ending it. Many  federal workers have missed paychecks , including  air traffic controllers , who are working unpaid.  Meanwhile,  uncertainty remains  for  tens of millions of people  who rely on  federal food and nutrition benefits  like Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, previously known as food stamps. The benefits had been set to expire on Saturday due to the government shutdown. Two federal judges on Friday ordered the Trump administration to use emergency funding to provide the benefits. But it was unclear after the rulings how much assistance may be provided or when it might come. Read the latest about the pair of SNAP rulings   and also, learn  how some food banks are bracing for SNAP funding to lapse The  Agriculture Department says  it will reopen about 2,100 county offices despite the government shutdown to  help farmers get access to $3 billion of aid . At the same time  many American farmers  say the Trump administration's trade policies have them on the brink. As the shutdown continues, here's the latest on what we know. Jump to state-specific impacts. Why did the federal government shut down? A  partisan argument  over if and when lawmakers need to act to extend subsidies for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces led to the current shutdown. Some  24 million people  — who don't have insurance through their jobs or a public program like Medicaid — use the system to buy health plans.  Prominent Republican lawmakers have claimed the Democrats are looking to provide tax dollars to help pay for the health care of undocumented immigrants. That is  not true . Democrats in the Senate  refused to vote  for the Republican short-term funding bill that passed the House but did not include an extension of the health care tax credits. Democrats are also hoping to repeal cuts to health care programs that were put in place as part of the GOP  spending and tax bill  that passed over the summer. NPR's Deirdre Walsh reports that some Democrats say Nov. 1 could be a  key date in talks to loosen the current gridlock . That date marks the beginning of open enrollment for people getting coverage through the ACA, when subscribers could  see big premium increases  unless the subsidies that have been helping people pay for coverage since 2021 are extended. Read more about more about the health care fight behind the shutdown here. Plus, why Democrats are casting the government shutdown as  a health care showdown . —  Selena Simmons-Duffin , NPR What about WIC and SNAP benefits ? There are no SNAP food benefits available for millions of people as of Nov. 1. It's the first time the country's largest anti-hunger program has been suspended since it began six decades ago.  On Friday,  two federal judges said this pause is likely unlawful , and the Trump administration must use emergency funds to keep the program going. But it's not clear exactly how or when that may happen. $5.5 billion in emergency funds also falls short of SNAP's November budget, which is $9 billion. That means even if the administration restarts funding, people may not get the full amount of food assistance they are eligible for. Cities and states across the country are tapping emergency funds and ramping up food donations to help the 42 million SNAP recipients. A separate nutrition program is also at risk. The Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) provides nutrition education, breastfeeding support, and other healthcare screenings for 7 million people. Last month the Trump administration shifted $300 million to keep WIC going a few more weeks. Some states are now using emergency funds to keep clinics open and benefits available, but the National WIC Association says those funds are  running out quickly . —  Jennifer Ludden , NPR Read more on the impact of this potential lapse across the country, here.  — and you can  read more here about how food banks are bracing for it   What about Head Start? Beginning Nov. 1,  more than 65,000 children will be at risk of losing access to Head Start , the federal early-learning program for low-income families. That's because federal funding for individual Head Start programs cannot be disbursed while the government is shut down. Among the states  hit hardest  by this Nov. 1 deadline: Florida, Georgia, Missouri and Ohio. Nationally, Head Start serves roughly 750,000 infants, toddlers and preschool-age children, providing not just childcare and early learning but also free meals, health screenings and family support. Local Head Start programs are funded annually, though at different times of the year. Some programs get their money on Oct. 1, others on Nov. 1 and so on. If the shutdown lasts until December, says Tommy Sheridan of the National Head Start Association, still more programs would see their funding run out. Without federal funding, Sheridan says, some programs will have to close immediately. Others have the resources to stay open at least another week, in hopes that politicians in Washington can resolve their differences. —  Cory Turner  and  Kadin Mills , NPR What the shutdown means for federal workers Altogether,  about 1.4 million civilian federal employees  across the country are going without pay,  according to the Bipartisan Policy Center , a think tank in Washington, D.C. Of those, roughly half are furloughed, which means they are not working and not getting paid, but expect to return to work once the federal shutdown is over. The other half have been deemed essential and so are continuing to work. By law federal workers are supposed to get back pay once the shutdown ends, but   the White House has tried to cast doubt on that. The Senate has  failed to advance a pair of competing measures  to pay at least some federal employees during the government shutdown.  The Trump administration has managed to move money around to ensure that some people get paid, including active duty military and law enforcement officers with the Department of Homeland Security. Many other federal workers are also still getting paid as usual during the shutdown. Salaries for some federal employees, including the vast majority of those at the Department of Veterans Affairs, do not come out of appropriations that Congress must approve every year. Are government workers being laid off during the shutdown? The Trump administration has been following through on threats to   further slash the size of government during the shutdown, seeking to layoff roughly 4,000 workers earlier this month. Some unions that represent workers are fighting back in court ;  the federal judge overseeing the case on Tuesday  indefinitely halted  the Trump administration's shutdown layoffs, noting human toll. The order applies to federal employees in programs or offices where the plaintiff unions have members or bargaining units. How is the shutdown impacting active duty military?  The White House has identified additional funding for the latest round of military paychecks despite the shutdown, according to a spokesperson for the Office of Management and Budget. The spokesperson says that the agency is using around $5 billion from a military housing fund, a military research and development fund and a Defense Department account used for building ships. NPR asked if part of the money is also coming from a $130 million donation made by a billionaire Trump ally, but the OMB did not respond. The Trump administration  earlier this month found unused research and development funds to pay many active military members  so they wouldn't miss a full paycheck earlier this month, according to a Pentagon official not authorized to speak publicly.  Military families are already seeking additional assistance from food banks and other groups to help with paying bills. USPS is 'open for business as usual' \"U.S. Postal Service operations will not be interrupted,\" according to a  statement by USPS . The postal service is primarily self-funded and doesn't depend on the appropriations process to continue running as usual. IRS furloughs nearly half its staff A  contingency plan  from the Treasury Department says that slightly more than half of the IRS' approximately 74,000 workers remain on the job and will continue to work for the foreseeable future. Some IRS employees  were issued  reduction in force, or RIF, notices  on Friday and posted screenshots of those notices informing them of their last day, Dec. 9. The contingency plan says nearly all of those employees who continue to work will be paid using sources other than annual appropriations, which are on hold during the shutdown. Tasks will include completing and testing systems to handle next year's tax-filing season, and maintaining computers to prevent the loss of data. —  Scott Horsley ,  Andrea Hsu  and  Stephen Fowler , NPR National Nuclear Security Administration furloughs 1,400 employees On Oct. 20, the National Nuclear Security Administration, which oversees the nation's nuclear weapons, said it is furloughing approximately 1,400 employees. The agency is responsible for overseeing thousands of warheads that are not currently deployed on missiles, bombers and submarines. According to an Energy Department spokesperson, the furloughs are due to the \"Democrat shutdown.\" Roughly 400 employees remain on the job providing security and safety oversight. And the office responsible for moving nuclear weapons around the country remains funded until next week. —  Geoff Brumfiel , NPR In addition, Nevada Public Radio is reporting  more than 1,000 nuclear contractors in Nevada  could receive notices by the end of the month, because their work relies on the federal government remaining open. Teachers and schools won't be directly impacted, but federal education functions might Eighty-seven percent of Department of Education employees  have been temporary furloughed , as detailed in agency shutdown contingency plans. At the same time, the administration is trying to use a new round of layoffs to gut multiple offices inside the department, including the Office for Civil Rights and the office responsible for overseeing special education, according to multiple sources within the department. This latest reduction-in-force (RIF) cut at least 121 staffers responsible for overseeing roughly  $15 billion  in special education funding and for making sure states provide special education services to the nation's more than 7.5 million children with disabilities. The courts  have halted  those layoffs. If they're ultimately allowed to go through, multiple sources told NPR the special education office would be left with just a handful of top executives and support staff. In addition, many Department of Education employees who were furloughed  were surprised to see  a message blaming Democrats for the government shutdown inserted into their out-of-office replies. A federal workers union is  suing the Trump administration  for inserting the language into employees' out-of-office email messages. —  Shannon Bond  and  Cory Turner , NPR The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) for 2026 went live as scheduled at the start of October. As WPR's  Corrinne Hess  reports, the U.S. Department of Education says that  student financial aid programs will continue , despite the shutdown. National Parks are a mixed bag Across the country, the National Park Service (NPS) have  brought their operations to a halt . That includes the National Zoo and other Smithsonian facilities. NPR's Alana Wise  reports that the Smithsonian assured the public  that animals would still be cared for during the zoo's closure.  Animal cams  are considered nonessential and will be turned off for the remainder of the shutdown. As  KQED's Sarah Wright and Carly Severn reported , a contingency plan for the NPS says that park roads, lookouts and trails \"will generally remain accessible to visitors\" for the duration of the shutdown, but other services such as regular road and trail condition updates would not be provided. Concerns have also been raised about the safety and responsibility of keeping parks open without having a robust number of employees available to conduct critical services. The Salem, Mass. visitor center will be open through Halloween thanks to community support WBUR's Andrea Shea reports  that local leaders in Salem, Mass., learned a National Park Service visitor center and its bathrooms would be closed during their busiest tourist season so they took action on a plan to keep them open. Shea reports that  NPS agreed to let Salem reopen the center if the community covered costs  through Halloween weekend. Annie Harris — CEO of the non-profit Essex Heritage that helps staff and run the facility — sent out a flurry of emails including to the mayor. Within 48 hours businesses and non-profits raised $18,000 — keeping the center open until Nov. 2. Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security benefits will continue Social Security,   VA  and other benefits will continue. But employees at Social Security field offices earlier this month said the  government shutdown  has left them  unable to carry out an important service for some recipients . As NPR's Ashley Lopez reports, workers say they are unable to provide benefit verification letters to people calling in to request them. These  official letters  act as a sort of income verification and are therefore key to obtaining aid like housing assistance, fuel assistance and help from nonprofits. In an Oct. 21 email to users answering commonly asked questions about how shutdown impacts, SSA noted the online portal can still be used to access benefit verification letters. Some furloughed employees at the Labor Department were brought back to work, in order to complete the September inflation report, which is a key ingredient used to calculate the cost of living adjustment that Social Security recipients will receive next year. Last week,  the SSA said the payments to recipients will increase by 2.8% next year , or an increase of about $56 per month starting in January. Read more on  how a fight over health policy led to the government shutdown  from NPR's Selena Simmons-Duffin. ICE will mostly continue uninterrupted Immigration cases and enforcement are proceeding as usual during the government shutdown, with a few small exceptions. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin confirmed that the employees in the Office of Detention Oversight, which inspects immigration detention centers, is currently not working. \"We hope Democrats will open up the government swiftly so that this office can resume its work,\" McLaughlin said. According to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, DHS law enforcement, including ICE agents, will be paid for work done during the shutdown. \"More than 70,000 sworn law enforcement officers across DHS including those serving in CBP, ICE, Secret Service, TSA and other critical mission areas will be paid for all hours worked during the shutdown period,\"  Noem posted on X  last week. \"By Wednesday, October 22, law enforcement officers will receive a \"super check\" — which covers the 4 days lost, their overtime, and their next pay period.\" The U.S. Coast Guard, which is housed within DHS, will continue to be paid,  according to Noem ; funds will be appropriated in the reconciliation bill earlier this year. —  Ximena Bustillo , NPR If you're flying soon … Air traffic controllers and most Transportation Security Administration employees are considered \"essential workers\" and have to stay on the job. This week they officially missed their first full paycheck since the shutdown began.  Travelers across the U.S. are beginning to feel the impacts of the government shutdown, as air traffic control staffing shortages  disrupt flights across the country . Air traffic controllers  helped to end the last government shutdown , and could help end this one as well. According to NPR's Joel Rose, the Transportation Department says  there has been an uptick in the number of controllers  who are calling in sick. The Transportation Department says that federal subsidies for rural air travel will continue through Nov. 18,  reports Alaska Public Media's Eric Stone . The department previously said it had enough funding to continue the program through Sunday. Read more on  what a shortage of air traffic controllers could do to bring an end to the shutdown, here   The impact of the shutdown looks different in different parts of the country Some states across the country are uniquely positioned to feel the impact of the government shutdown.

Colorado Public Radio wants to hear from you. Connecticut Connecticut will continue federally funded food assistance programs for state residents during the government shutdown, Gov. Ned Lamont  said on Wednesday . But he said the state's reserve money for SNAP, the food assistance program for low-income families, will run out by the end of the month. [ WSHU ] Connecticut has a $2.5 billion budget surplus this year — its second largest in history. Advocates are  asking Lamont to consider using it  to help offset the federal shortfall. Legislative leaders are considering appropriating the money during a special session next month. [ WSHU ] Georgia For federal workers living paycheck to paycheck, one option to get through being furloughed could be filing for unemployment insurance,  Georgia Labor Commissioner Barbara Rivera Holmes said.  The employees will have to pay the benefits back once the shutdown ends and they receive back pay, but the benefits can help them make ends meet while they are not being paid. [ GPB ] Georgia farmers could also face delays in  block grant funding and commodity data  they rely on during the time-sensitive season of planting and harvesting. [ NPR ] Hawaii University of Hawaiʻi is paying affected employees  out of pocket during shutdown . Over 830 University of Hawaiʻi employees are at least partially paid through federal dollars, with thousands more in positions that are fully federally funded. UH has been able to pay them with internal funds, but it costs more than $20 million a pay period — every two weeks — for the system to match their salaries.

[ KCUR ] During the last two shutdowns, the USDA did not publish its monthly crop reports. This comes at an inconvenient time as Midwest farmers are in harvest season. [ KCUR ] For more on the impact in Kansas City,  head to KCUR . Kentucky Funding for food assistance benefits next month isn't coming, Gov. Andy Beshear said, due to the federal government shutdown. Funding for the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program is also delayed. [ LPM ] Louisiana The National Flood Insurance Program, or NFIP, is managed by FEMA and provides flood insurance to those who don't have a private option. It has grown in size as most homeowner's insurance policies across the U.S. have dropped flood damage entirely.  It covers nearly half a million Louisianans.  Policyholders with expiring contracts could lose coverage and funds to pay claims have dropped $30 billion due to the shutdown. [ WWNO/WRKF ] For more on the impact in Louisiana,  head to WWNO/WRKF. Maine Nearly 170,000 Mainers, or over 12% of the state's total population, could lose food assistance if SNAP benefits are not funded for November. [ Maine Public ] Even though much of the staff of Acadia National Park in Maine has been furloughed, it has still been busy at the park. [ Maine Public ] Maryland Prince George's County is home to more than 60,000 federal workers. The Capital Area Food Bank has been distributing food to federal workers affected by the shutdown. But the timing is  a double burden : The Capital Area Food Bank has seen some of its own federal funding slashed even as demand skyrockets. [ WAMU ] Massachusetts While travelers across the U.S. are experiencing delays and cancellations as a result of the ongoing federal government shutdown,  it's mostly business as usual  at Boston's Logan International Airport. [ GBH ] Michigan In response to how the federal shutdown will affect rural flights in Michigan, airport officials said they are continuing with \"business as usual.\" At least, for now. Federal funding for the Essential Air Service (EAS) program is set to extend only through Nov. 2.  [ Michigan Public ] Minnesota Thousands of Minnesotans might not receive federal food aid benefits if the government shutdown continues into November, as federal officials have told states that funding for SNAP benefits is running out. [ MPR News ] Missouri Roughly 650,000 Missourians will not receive SNAP benefits for the month of November due to the ongoing government shutdown. [ St. Louis Public Radio ] The  Gateway Arch  and Old Courthouse in downtown St. Louis are temporarily closed, with National Park Service work largely on hold. [ St. Louis Public Radio ] New Hampshire SNAP serves more than  75,000 people in New Hampshire . And while state officials say they've received extra money to keep WIC running into November, it's unclear if SNAP will also be funded. [ NHPR ] On Oct. 7, Sen.

But as of Wednesday, immediate answers on how that might affect  Eastern Oregon's only commercial airport  are in short supply. The municipally operated Eastern Oregon Regional Airport in Pendleton holds the only Essential Air Service (EAS) contract in the state, a federal program that helps rural airports operate. [ OPB ] Pennsylvania Tens of thousands of Pennsylvania-based federal workers furloughed during the government shutdown  may be eligible for unemployment  compensation through the state Department of Labor & Industry. [ WITF ] Tennessee On Oct. 7, the FAA notified local officials in Nashville that flights in and out of Nashville International Airport (BNA) would be reduced Tuesday afternoon due to a shortage of air traffic controllers during the government shutdown. Nashville's airport was back to normal by Wednesday morning. [ WLPN ] Texas The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program provides food purchasing support to approximately  3.5 million Texans , including more than 1.7 million children. Those benefits amount to around $617 million per month.  [KUT ] U.S. Customs and Border Protection employees who inspect cargo at  the 32 other official ports of entry  are among the essential federal workers who must remain on the job unpaid. The longer the shutdown lasts, the greater the risk of cargo backups at these Texas ports due to unpaid employees calling in sick.

Birth control is one city's answer \n         By Ari Daniel \n        \n           Saturday, November 1, 2025 • 7:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         In Somerville, Massachusetts just outside of Boston, everyone has a horror story about the rats. Adeline Lining says they ruined Christmas for her last year.  She had received a delivery of Bartlett pears. \"They were on my porch for two hours,\" she says. \"And then my neighbor texted me a picture and was like, 'You probably don't want these anymore.' No, I don't want them anymore because there were rats inside the box feasting on my Christmas pears. They are directly responsible for ruining Christmas,\" she says. Then there's Donine Williams who says that a couple years back, rats got under her deck, chewed through the subfloor, and nested in the insulation. \"I could smell the urine and their poo,\" she says. \"I can still smell it.\" And Andrew Jefferies can't un-remember the noises he heard at his last apartment. \"All night in the summer, the rats would scream\" as they rifled through his trash, he says. He requested new trash cans but they chewed right through them. Matter-of-factly, he concludes \"rats are crazy.\"  Now, the city of Somerville is trying to control these rats (and perhaps save Christmas in the process) by introducing a safer form of rodent birth control. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"I have no illusion that we can  actually outsmart the rats ,\" says Williams. \"But if we could just reduce them, that would be good.\" City officials agree and they've launched a field trial to evaluate the new approach. A ratty world Rats aren't just nuisances. They cause real problems. \"Rats can carry diseases — mostly leptospirosis [and] hantavirus,\" says  Alicia Privett , Somerville's Environmental Health Coordinator — aka the  city's rat czar . \"They also are one of the leading causes of property damage.\" That's because they chew through wires, fencing, decks, and even cinderblock to keep their incisors trim. In addition, rats create extensive underground tunneling. According to  Sam Lipson , the Senior Director of Environmental Health in Cambridge, Mass., when the one-mile red line subway extension was built between Harvard and Porter Squares in the 1980s, the digging unearthed thousands of rat tunnels. \"You gotta admire their tenaciousness, their ability to adapt,\" allows Privett. Even so, she says, \"they're like my ultimate nemesis.\" Public servants Privett and Lipson have thrown all sorts of things at the problem, trying to keep rat numbers down and their vandalism contained. But homeowners and renters don't always follow best practices like improving sanitation and reducing the animals' shelter and food options. Plus, the whiskered bandits outwit traps. And they penetrate supposedly impenetrable containers. \"You can try as much as you can to get rid of them and sometimes they'll still find a way 'cause they're just so scrappy,\" says Privett. \"In my opinion, I don't think anything's rat proof.\" Even attempts at poisoning can backfire when pets or birds of prey eat the rats or the bait and get sick or die. Rat birth control For all these reasons, Somerville is trying something else — an anti-fertility chemical that targets the mature eggs in female rats. \"It basically stops the pregnancy before it starts,\" says Lipson, who's overseeing the field trial of the product at several sites in Cambridge and Somerville. He says the birth control doesn't lead to permanent infertility. Rather, it acts on the rats only while it's circulating in the bloodstream. \"You need to have a steady supply or diet of this in order to have an effect on the local population,\" says Lipson. The goal, however, is not total eradication. \"That is not going to happen,\" he says. The idea is if the overall population can be lowered, other efforts to minimize rat activity will be more successful. This is why Lipson and his colleagues are testing whether this chemical, when dispensed in bait boxes in a dense and variable urban environment, might lead to less overall rat activity. \"And if we find that it does, I think we'll make that part of our city strategy,\" he says. Fighting the rat-riarchy The field trial relies on community volunteers. Privett and  Dave Power  — Cambridge's rat czar — lead four residents on an orientation in south Somerville. \"We just appreciate the extra hands,\" he says. \"I'll show y'all how to check for rodent activity in the area and on the properties,\" says Privett, including cut throughs under fences, telltale trails in the grass, scattered food waste, and signs of burrowing. She walks through how to examine the bait boxes that are scattered across a handful of people's yards in this part of Somerville. \"You just push in and it'll pop up,\" she explains. Over the course of about a year, the city will gauge whether the approach helps. At the very least, the volunteers will help encourage their neighbors to comply with other measures that help reduce rat numbers. \"That education component is the thing that I'm looking forward to the most,\" says Privett. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"We really want to raise levels of knowledge and consciousness among residents and property owners,\" Lipson adds. \"When the level of discourse around rat control goes up, we expect there to be greater awareness of doing the right thing.\" \n         \n         Transcript \n         MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:   No one wants rats scurrying around their neighborhood, but they are a cunning and ever-evasive foe. Now a community near Boston is trying a different approach - rat birth control. Reporter Ari Daniel has more. ARI DANIEL, BYLINE: I'm outside a school in Somerville, Massachusetts, with a few locals. And it seems like everyone's got a horror story about the rats here - like Adeline Lining. ADELINE LINING: I get, like, the beautiful Bartlett pears every Christmas. And this year, they were on my porch for two hours. And then my neighbor texted me a picture and he was like, you probably don't want these anymore. No, I don't want them anymore because there were rats inside the box feasting on my Christmas pears. DANIEL: It was a delivery. LINING: Yeah, it was a delivery. DANIEL: And they ruined Christmas. LINING: They did. ANDREW JEFFERIES: Rats are crazy. DANIEL: Andrew Jefferies says he can't unremember (ph) the noises he heard at his last apartment. JEFFERIES: All night in the summer, the rats would, like, scream. DANIEL: As they, like, bathed in your trash? JEFFERIES: Yeah. We, like, requested new trash cans. They ate through, like, the bottom and the top. DANIEL: Besides being nuisances, the rodents cause real problems. Alicia Privett is Somerville's environmental health coordinator, aka the city's rat czar. ALICIA PRIVETT: Rats can carry diseases, mostly leptospirosis, hantavirus. And then they also are one of the leading causes of property damage. DANIEL: Due to the way they chew through wires, fencing, decks, even cinder block to keep their incisors trim, not to mention their extensive underground tunneling. One local health official told me when the subway was extended a mile in the '80s in neighboring Cambridge, the digging unearthed thousands of rat tunnels. PRIVETT: They're, like, my ultimate nemesis. You got to admire their tenaciousness, their ability to adapt. DANIEL: People like Privett have thrown all sorts of things at the problem, trying to keep rat numbers down and their vandalism contained. But residents don't always follow best practices. And the rats? They outwit our traps, penetrate so-called impenetrable containers. PRIVETT: In my opinion, I don't think anything's rat-proof 'cause they're just so scrappy. DANIEL: And even attempts at poisoning can backfire when pets or raptors eat the rats or the bait and get sick or die. So Somerville is trying something else - an antifertility chemical that targets female rats. SAM LIPSON: So it basically stops the pregnancy before it starts. DANIEL: Sam Lipson is the senior director of environmental health in Cambridge, and he's overseeing a field trial of the chemical in Cambridge and here in Somerville. Lipson says the birth control doesn't lead to permanent infertility, only while it's circulating in the rat's bloodstream. The goal, however, is not total eradication. LIPSON: That is not going to happen. The idea of bringing the sea level down is sort of the way I think about it because other types of bait and efforts to minimize rat activity are going to be way more successful if you can bring the overall population down. DANIEL: So Lipson and his colleagues are testing whether this chemical, when dispensed in bait boxes in a dense and variable urban environment, might lead to less overall rat activity. LIPSON: And if we find that it does, I think we'll make that part of our city strategy. PRIVETT: All right, let's go get this started. DANIEL: The field trial relies on community volunteers, and Alicia Privett's leading four of them on an orientation. PRIVETT: We're going to head over this way. DANIEL: She walks through how to look for rodent activity and check the bait boxes that are in a handful of people's yards in this part of Somerville. PRIVETT: You just push in, it'll pop up. (SOUNDBITE OF BAIT BOX OPENING) DANIEL: Over the course of a year or so, the city will gauge whether the approach helps. Donene Williams, a longtime resident of Somerville, is one of the volunteers. Her job will be to search out evidence of rats and fill the boxes with the antifertility bait. DONENE WILLIAMS: I have no illusion that we can actually outsmart the rats, but if we could just reduce them, that would be good. DANIEL: She calls her involvement a form of resistance.

Personal stories like Charlotte Freed's, who experienced mood and energy changes after removing her hormonal IUD, highlight the emotional and physical trade-offs women face. Medical professionals such as Dr. Jennifer Lincoln and Dr. Wanda Ronner criticize the current healthcare system for rushing appointments and failing to address patient concerns, leading to a vacuum filled by social media content.

Morning Edition \n        \n      \n\n         Charlotte Freed first got a hormonal IUD when she was a teenager. She wasn't sexually active at the time, but she wanted to be protected from pregnancy before she started college. This was also a time when she experienced anxiety, depression and fatigue. But it wasn't until a friend of hers quit her birth control, and recommended a book on the topic, that Freed started wondering if the two could be related. \"It was really upsetting and almost like a little disturbing that no doctor had ever brought it up,\" said Freed, now 27. At that point, Freed had had an IUD for about eight years. \"I kind of just [wanted] to, like, meet myself in a way that I hadn't since I was 16, 17,\" she said. \"And, you know, maybe I would experience some changes in my mental, emotional, physical well-being that I didn't even really know were a possibility.\" So Freed took out her IUD. Social media is full of stories from women like Freed quitting or questioning hormonal birth control — but not because they want to get pregnant. Some are concerned about effects on their mood and mental health. Others say doctors dismissed their complaints about weight gain, nausea and decreased sex drive. But doctors and researchers say  misleading and inaccurate claims  about birth control — which decades of  research  has  shown to be safe and effective  — abound on social platforms. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       They worry that some women may be making key decisions about family planning based on those dubious claims, which could lead to unintended pregnancies and create more confusion around the drugs. Dr. Jennifer Lincoln tries to combat that misinformation. She's an OBGYN based in Portland, Ore. who makes videos debunking common myths that circulate online. Myths like: \"'Birth control is bad for you. It gives you infertility, it causes cancer, it makes you not attracted to your partner. It causes abortions,' – you name it, somebody on social media has said it,\" Lincoln said. \"And what makes me really sad is that there's so many people who go to TikTok for like — that's their Google search now.\" A  2024 study  analyzed posts about birth control on TikTok, and found that nearly half of posts on the topic were discouraging women from taking it. Skepticism drives social media content Conservative podcast host Alex Clark urges her listeners to reconsider hormonal birth control, which she says is overprescribed, and calls it a band-aid that can mask more serious underlying issues, like endometriosis and polycystic ovary syndrome, which can affect fertility long term. \"I feel like women haven't been given true informed consent when it comes to the hormonal birth control pill,\" Clark said. \"I don't think that they're being told that hormonal birth control isn't going to actually cure or solve any hormonal issues or women's health issues. It helps suppress symptoms, but that doesn't mean that it's actually curing anything.\" Clark took the pill for nearly 10 years before stopping. Now she steers her listeners toward non-hormonal options like condoms and cycle tracking, which tend to have  higher failure rates. \"I think if women were told the truth about hormonal birth control in general, that they would choose other options,\" Clark said. \"I think just the more educated women become on it that they're just going to say, 'Yeah, nah, I'm good.' I think they're just going to choose something else.\" Dr. Jennifer Lincoln believes her colleagues should do more to explain the facts around birth control. She said social media is filling a vacuum that gets created when doctors rush their patients through appointments or brush off concerns about symptoms. \"The medical field owns so much of why people are going to these forums and Reddit and Tik-Tok for information and are really buying it because…we have failed them,\" Lincoln said. \"We have either brushed off their concerns – I mean, you could spend all day just talking about how so many women's issues do not get adequately funded or addressed – but we know that oftentimes they might be met with, 'that's not a real side effect.' We have a huge role in this.\" Freed said she doesn't feel like she had all the information needed to make an informed decision about her birth control as a teenager. Her high school health class, she said, spent one day on \"sex ed,\" and she was sick that day and missed the lesson. And her doctors had no answers to her questions about whether her IUD could be affecting her mood. \"When asking about side effects, it would just be that, 'You know, there's a possibility that your period goes away. And there's a possibility that you get ovarian cysts' — these types of things that are easier to track,\" she said. \"It's not malicious, but it's just connected to the fact that women are under-researched in the health field.\" Dr. Wanda Ronner is a professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine. She said the medical field has become more \"corporatized\" in a way that makes it harder for doctors to give patients the information they need. \"You get your 10 minutes and that's it,\" Ronner said. \"And, you know, the back end explanations are coming from maybe the physician's nurse – If you have a good nurse, that will spend time with the patient explaining things, calling them, or even doing it through the portal. I think it's a very frustrating landscape for young people because they have so much information [available to them on the internet]. And who do you listen to? You know, who do you go to?\" A \"lose-lose situation\" for women When Charlotte Freed took out her IUD, she did notice improvements in her mood — she had more energy, she felt more connected to her body, and she got reacquainted with her cycle — though she said she'll never really know if it was \"correlation or causation.\" She said stopping birth control gave her more information about her body at a \"baseline level\" But then, Freed was going abroad for graduate school, and she couldn't take the risk of getting pregnant in a foreign country. She considered getting a copper IUD — which does not contain hormones — but was worried about the physical side effects that method can cause. \"Thing that sucks about being a woman is like – either the trade off is, you know, the possibility of having a child when you don't want to, the possibility of like hormones kind of messing up your personality or, you know, giving increasing anxiety, depression, fatigue, whatever, or, having horrible cramps and bleeding for 12 days straight,\" she said. \"So it really is just like, it's a lose-lose situation.\" Ultimately, Freed got a new hormonal IUD put in. But she's considering taking another break. \n         \n         Transcript \n         LEILA FADEL, HOST:   As part of NPR's Population Shift series, we've been spending this week looking at how families make decisions about if and when to have children - decisions made possible in part because of hormonal birth control. Now there's a growing social media trend that shows women quitting their hormonal birth control, even though they're not ready to become parents. Doctors are worried that some women are making decisions based on inaccurate medical information they see online. Lexie Schapitl reports on how TikTok and Instagram have become the new WebMD for family planning. LEXIE SCHAPITL, BYLINE: Charlotte Freed (ph) first got a hormonal IUD as a teenager. She wasn't sexually active at the time, but she wanted to be protected from pregnancy before she started college. This was also a time when she experienced anxiety, depression and fatigue. But it wasn't until years later, when a friend of hers quit her birth control and recommended a book on the topic, that Freed started wondering if these things could be connected. CHARLOTTE FREED: It was really upsetting and almost, like, a little disturbing that no doctor had ever brought it up. And honestly, I was like, I kind of just want to, like, meet myself in a way that I hadn't since I was, you know, 16, 17. SCHAPITL: So Freed took out her IUD. Social media is full of stories about women like Freed quitting or questioning hormonal birth control, but not because they want to get pregnant. Some are concerned about effects on their mood and mental health. Others say doctors dismissed their complaints about weight gain, nausea and decreased sex drive. But doctors and researchers say misleading and inaccurate claims about birth control, which decades of research has shown to be safe and effective, abound on social platforms. And they worry those claims are turning some women off the medication and could lead to unintended pregnancies. FRANZISKA HAYDANEK: It's important to kind of look at the difference between disinformation and misinformation. SCHAPITL: Franziska Haydanek is an OB-GYN who uses social media to educate her followers about different birth control methods. HAYDANEK: I think it's totally appropriate that people share their negative experiences with any sort of surgery, medication, whatever. What's not OK is when it's, like, done purposely, and that's when we get into the disinformation. SCHAPITL: A 2024 study analyzed posts about birth control on TikTok and found that nearly half of the posts on the topic were discouraging women from using it. Stats like that motivated Jennifer Lincoln, an OB-GYN based in Portland, Oregon, to start debunking false claims on Instagram - claims like... JENNIFER LINCOLN: That birth control is bad for you. It gives you infertility. It causes cancer. It makes you not attracted to your partner. It causes abortions. You name it, somebody on social media has said it. SCHAPITL: And Lincoln worries that young people are using social media like a search engine for medical advice. LINCOLN: And it might be somebody who says that who has a blue check mark, who even has doctor in their name, but they might not be a medical doctor. And they're selling you something, or, you know, they're promising you something that has made up for the gap in the health care system. ALEX CLARK: I feel like women haven't been given true informed consent when it comes to the hormonal birth control pill. SCHAPITL: That's conservative podcast host Alex Clark. She argues birth control is overprescribed and used as a Band-Aid that can mask more serious underlying issues. Clark took the pill for nearly 10 years before stopping. Now she steers her listeners toward options like condoms and cycle tracking, which do not contain hormones and have much higher failure rates. CLARK: I think that if women were told the truth about hormonal birth control in general, that they would choose other options. I think just the more educated women become on it, that they're just going to say, yeah, nah, I'm good. I think they're just going to choose something else. SCHAPITL: Dr. Jennifer Lincoln believes her colleagues should do more to explain the facts around birth control. She says social media is filling a vacuum that gets created when doctors rush their patients through appointments or brush off concerns about symptoms. LINCOLN: The medical field owns so much of why people are going to these forums and Reddit and TikTok for information and are really buying it because they have been - we have failed them. SCHAPITL: When Charlotte Freed took out her IUD, she did notice improvements in her mood. She had more energy. She felt more connected to her body, and she got reacquainted with her cycle. Then she was going abroad for graduate school, and her calculation changed. FREED: Either the trade-off is, like, the possibility of having a child when you don't want to, the possibility of, like, hormones kind of messing up your personality or increasing anxiety, depression, fatigue, whatever. So it's a lose-lose situation. SCHAPITL: She decided she couldn't take the risk of getting pregnant in a foreign country. Ultimately, Freed got a new IUD for now.

But it was unclear hours after the rulings Friday afternoon how much assistance may be provided or when it might come. U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani in Boston ruled the Trump administration has until Monday to decide whether to pay at least partial SNAP food benefits. She declined to issue a temporary restraining order to force the administration to act before the funds run out tomorrow, finding that resuming payments at some point can still avoid irreparable harm to SNAP recipients. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In Rhode Island, U.S. District Chief Judge John J. McConnell Jr. granted a temporary restraining order while saying ending SNAP payments would harm not only people, but also local economies.

He also said it must submit a plan on how it would comply with his order, or \"at least an update,\" by noon on Monday,  Ocean State Media reported. It is not yet clear how the two court orders would impact the flow of benefits, which are set to run out Saturday. Hours after the rulings, President Trump posted on social media that he has directed government lawyers to find a way to pay SNAP benefits. \"If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding, just like I did with Military and Law Enforcement Pay,\" he wrote. However, it's not clear what sort of legal direction the administration was seeking.

She issued her decision in a case filed by two dozen Democratic-led states that sued over the administration's decision to suspend the nation's largest anti-hunger program for the first time in its history. The judge said the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers SNAP, must use emergency funds to keep SNAP going. She also said other money is legally available but left the decision of how much benefits to distribute up to the administration.

These state policies may have helped \n         By Kadin Mills \n        \n           Saturday, November 1, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         After nearly doubling during the pandemic, the rates of chronic absenteeism in K-12 schools are finally showing steady signs of improvement. A student is considered chronically absent when they miss at least 10% of a school year. In most states, that means missing about 18 days a year, regardless of whether the absences were excused. \"Thousands of students have returned to schools, which means that states are putting in the work,\" said Carl Felton, III, a policy analyst at EdTrust, a nonprofit that advocates for underrepresented students. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Felton is the author of a  new report  that looks at how policies in 22 states plus Washington, D.C., have helped improve student attendance. He said there are several things states are doing right, including collecting and publishing reliable data, and investing in early interventions and outreach programs instead of punitive practices. \"The things that we want to see happen are happening,\" he said. Multiple  data analyses  have shown the rates of chronic absenteeism  skyrocketed  during the pandemic, from 15% in 2019 to 28% in 2022 according to  one report  from the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington, D.C., think tank. Research  has linked  chronic absenteeism with lower academic achievement and a higher likelihood of dropping out of high school. Changing punitive practices and investing in more support  One of the areas Felton looked at was punitive practices. He said states need to ban corporal punishment entirely and ban harsh penalties like suspensions for minor infractions because they can harm the relationship between students and educators, and they can make students feel unsafe or unmotivated to come to class. Several states, including many in the South, still allow corporal punishment in schools, and according to  federal data , more than 69,000 K-12 public school students received corporal punishment during the 2017-18 school year. ( More recent federal data  reflects a time during which many K-12 students were learning remotely, during the pandemic, and shows a drop in corporal punishment.) \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"In order for a student to want to be in the school environment they need to know that they are cared for and that the adults in the building have their best interests at heart,\" Felton said. \"You can hold students accountable without harming them.\" He said research-backed services like after-school programs and mental health supports help to create a positive school climate: \"These are the practices that we know can reduce chronic absenteeism because they address root causes.\" Felton found some states, like Connecticut and Maryland, have invested millions of dollars in wrap-around services like mental health support and at-home visits. California has invested billions of dollars in that effort. \"Not until you reach people, are you really able to address problems,\" Felton said. \"We need to prioritize investments and policies that focus on engaging students and families, and making sure they get the support they need to show up daily.\" In many places, data collection also needs improvement  In his report, Felton highlights the importance of collecting high quality data on absenteeism – without it, he said, there's no way to direct funding and programs toward the populations that are most at risk, including students of color, students from low-income backgrounds, students with disabilities and English language learners. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"If the funding is not reaching the student groups that are most chronically absent, then states and [state education agencies] need to rethink their strategy and investment.\" The frequency of data collection also plays a role, Felton said. In many states, attendance data is published quarterly or even annually, making it hard for schools to respond in real time when students aren't coming to class. Connecticut publishes attendance data every month, and is among the states with the lowest rates of chronic absenteeism. Still, only about half of the states Felton examined require teachers to take daily attendance  and  have clearly defined standards for how long students must be in school before they're marked present. Felton said that needs to change. \"Students and families need to know what measurement they're being held accountable to so that they won't be chronically absent,\" he said. According to Felton, a clear metric would also help teachers and school administrators better support their students and families. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5538425","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"09:00:00-04:00","title":"A photographer captures life inside Chicago Public Schools","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Melissa Ann Pinney, a Chicago-based photographer, spent seven years documenting the lives of marginalized and underrepresented students in Chicago Public Schools through her 'Becoming Themselves' project.

     By Melissa Ann Pinney , NPR Staff \n        \n           Saturday, November 1, 2025 • 9:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Melissa Ann Pinney photographed the everyday moments of adolescence inside Chicago Public Schools during a seven-year artist residency. Her series  Becoming Themselves  portrays students, especially those marginalized and underrepresented, as they navigate identity, community and the many transformations of growing up. We interviewed Pinney about the making of her series and the stories behind some of her favorite images. The interview has been edited for clarity and length. What drew you to photograph inside Chicago Public Schools? I was invited by Artists in Public Schools, an organization that pairs artists for residencies in schools all over the city, to photograph Bell School and Ogden International Schools. It was an incredible opportunity to photograph and immerse myself in often overlooked communities of children and teens in Chicago. Since I was in my teens and photographing my own family, childhood and adolescence has been a focus of my work.  Girl Ascending , my 2010 monograph, explored the social lives and coming-of-age rituals of my daughter, Emma, her friends and teammates. The possibilities inherent in widening the scope of my work beyond these established personal connections was exciting. When you first started, what kinds of images or stories did you hope to capture? I'm interested in photography as a process, one of paying close attention to the richness and mystery already present in the everyday world. I capture what's happening in the moment, and the story reveals itself afterwards in contemplation of the work itself. This is an opportunity to make what I think of as real pictures — images that reward sustained and repeated viewings and eschew stereotype and cliché. I had no idea what to expect in the schools, but through trial and error, I found opportunities to make pictures as I became part of the school community. I never know what the students will do next — their beauty, their compassion and their conflicts are unrehearsed. The teens collaborate in the art-making by welcoming me into their world. My photographs are both documents of a time and place and works of art. References to contemporary culture, to history and to ideas of representation are all embedded in the pictures. When I began photographing students in three different Chicago public schools, I had no idea of what was to come — how the project would evolve and shift through an ongoing global pandemic, a renewed focus on systemic racial and gender inequities and rampant gun violence. Now it's a document of a historic time. How much time did you spend working on  Becoming Themselves ? This project is ongoing and still evolving since 2018, when I started photographing in Bell School.  In Their Own Light  was the first book of my early pictures from an elementary, middle and several high schools. In  Becoming Themselves,  I   focus solely on two high schools — Ogden International High School and Senn High School — between 2019 and 2025. What was the most challenging part of this project? It is very hard to witness the grief and ongoing trauma many students experience as part of their everyday lives, especially when we hear that a student in the community has been shot and killed. Tragically, eight students I photographed died that way. The trauma of gun violence reverberates everywhere. What's the story behind one of your favorite photographs? With her My Little Pony leggings and arms loaded with jewelry, Lizzie Williams clearly stood out in the hallway crowded with students at their lockers gathering their coats and bags. I introduced myself and asked if Lizzie wanted to make a portrait. We went to the old gym for its brilliant light and huge south-facing windows. In the midst of working out Lizzie's pose and position, the boys basketball team starting running laps around the gym, casting shadows onto the wall where Lizzie stood. At first I was annoyed by this unexpected disruption, but I soon realized that, far from an unwelcome distraction, the shadows suggest another level of mystery and complexity. I'm grateful for serendipity! The DePaul University Art Museum added this photograph and six others from the project to their permanent collection last spring. A class of Senn students, many of whom are represented in the photographs, took a field trip to the museum to see the works. Were there any moments that surprised you during the process? Many moments surprised me. One day early last fall, a student I hadn't met before asked me to take his picture. I was happy to do so and we found a place by the windows with some light. When I looked through my lens, I suddenly recognized Axle, a student I'd first met two years before, when he transferred to Senn. I had photographed him several other times. Axle had transformed himself radically with a new short hair cut and different style of dress. I am always surprised and moved when a student tells me that the project made a positive impact on their life. Travion Williams, at Ogden International High School, said he was shy, self-conscious and unsure of himself when we made his portrait in 2019. Travion's portrait was one of the 84 portraits installed on panels in the school's front lobby in the summer of 2020. Classes would be completely online that fall, but outdoor sports were still allowed. When the cross country team started practicing, Travion discovered that his friends and teammates recognized and admired him. It changed the way he saw himself. It's rewarding when I'm told by a student that my work is important to them. As my ties to the community have deepened — I've come to understand the meaning this project holds for me and for the students themselves, who tell me they feel truly \"seen\" by participating in the project. The students have profoundly affected the ways I understand the lives of others; my relationships now transcend school to include family events, parties and baby showers. I couldn't have predicted the strong connections I would develop with some of the students, who keep in touch even years after they've graduated. When I brought Sophiat Agboola a print of her portrait, she told me it was inspiring. Surprised, I asked in what way it was inspiring and to whom — I couldn't guess. Sophiat said she had occasionally been made fun of for wearing her natural hair; her portrait had given her the confidence to do so. Of course, the pandemic surprised me. And the fact that a project I expected to last one year could still be challenging and rewarding after seven was a complete surprise, too. Do you have any memorable anecdotes or encounters from your time in the schools ? I photographed Jakolbi Lard only once, at prom in 2019, drawn by the broken heart he had shaved in to his hair. In January 2022, I learned that Jakolbi had been shot and killed. Jakolbi's death and the passage of time bring a different perspective to the broken heart shaved into his scalp. Now I see the wings formed by the mirror frame behind Jakolbi's back. Jakolbi's mother, Patricia Lard, told me that rather than being heartbroken, he was the heart-breaker. She brought Jakolbi's daughter, Jamyah, to an exhibition that included Jakolbi's portrait in 2023. She believes that exhibiting Jakolbi's portrait honors his life. Ms. Lard thanked me for \"... seeing in her Sun (sic) what the world did not.\" Has working in schools changed how you think about education or childhood? The students have a lot more agency than kids in my generation or even my daughter's generation did. These students are free to define themselves through their chosen teams and clubs, their dress, sexual orientation, pronouns and sometimes taking on a new name. There's a freedom in the acceptance and allowance for difference I see and a closeness in the physical camaraderie between many of the students. I started reading the news more closely when I began this project. CPS (Chicago Public Schools) and the CTU (the Chicago Teachers Union) are frequently in the headlines. It's clear that Chicago's past is linked to its present by a history of events affecting the city in housing, education, racial and gender equity and immigration. All of these issues flow through the permeable wall between the city and the public schools. What do you hope viewers take away from seeing these images? I hope these pictures encourage a deeper consideration and appreciation of the radiant young people in our public schools that goes far beyond the stereotypes. I intend these portraits to honor and commemorate those who are vulnerable and often underrepresented. Melissa Ann Pinney is an artist based in Chicago.

1, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         More than 40 million Americans who rely on federal food assistance woke up to uncertainty on Saturday over whether their aid is secure or when it will resume in full. A federal judge in Rhode Island on Friday ordered the White House to use contingency funds to pay for those benefits. But it was unclear how that decision would correspond with  a separate decision  by a judge in Massachusetts telling the administration it had until \"no later than Monday\" to come up with a way to use emergency funds to pay for aid. The impasse over funding the government means that the nearly 1 in 8 U.S. residents who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, to buy groceries may be facing at least a temporary lapse in benefits. Following Friday's decisions, President Trump said he had directed government lawyers to find a way to pay for SNAP, and that he instructed them to seek further clarity on the rulings. He cautioned, however, that even with immediate guidance, benefits \"will unfortunately be delayed while States get the money out.\"  SNAP, formerly known as food stamps, is the  country's largest anti-hunger program . \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       A coalition of Democratic governors and attorneys general are suing the federal government to keep the payments flowing, arguing the benefits cannot legally be cut off. The Trump administration says it's not legal to extend the benefits using emergency funds — though the administration extended benefits during a shutdown in the first term. As congressional gridlock continues,  states are exploring what they can offer their residents  who've just lost their food aid. Eyes turning to food banks   Food bank administrators are warning that the loss of November SNAP benefits could lead to a public health crisis. Jason Riggs, the director of advocacy and public policy at Roadrunner Food Bank of New Mexico, likens it to the recession 17 years ago and the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"This is a huge increase in need, but that's where comparisons end,\" he said. \"When [those] happened, there was a robust SNAP program, with all its flaws, doing what it is designed to do. And that's the difference with what's happening right now — there will not be SNAP. There will just be the same kind of catastrophic need for food.\" More than 21% of New Mexico residents receive SNAP benefits, the highest rate in the nation. People are  turning to food banks to help fill in the assistance gap , but administrators caution they aren't designed to act as a safety net for a government program. \"It's very daunting,\" Riggs told NPR. \"SNAP can provide nine times the amount of meals as the entire nationwide food bank network.\" Central Texas Food Bank CEO Sari Vatske said shutdowns aren't like other food crises. \"In a situation during a natural disaster where we could rely on our sister food banks for support, with this government shutdown, we are all experiencing the same need,\" she said. Businesses that partner with grocery retailers and restaurants to take surplus or near-expired food and sell it at a heavy discount, like Too Good To Go and Flashfood, are trying to reach people affected. Flashfood CEO Jordan Schenck said the organization has seen a spike in downloads in the last few days. \"That started as [the SNAP cliff] really became more prevalent in the media. We've definitely seen more traffic,\" Schenck told NPR. The view from Capitol Hill   One month into the shutdown, there is no concrete off-ramp. The Senate left D.C. on Thursday for the weekend, ahead of two major pain points of the shutdown coming into sharper relief on Saturday: the SNAP cliff, and the start of open enrollment for health insurance plans sold on the exchanges as part of the Affordable Care Act. Health care has been at the center of Congressional Democrats' shutdown strategy. They have demanded that Republicans negotiate with them to  extend the enhanced subsidies , which were boosted during the pandemic. They are set to expire at the end of the year. If nothing changes, Americans who purchase healthcare via the exchange could see their  premiums skyrocket . At a Thursday town hall with Maryland Democrats, including Sen. Angela Alsobrooks, Democratic constituents urged the party to hold the line. \"I think they should hold out as long as possible,\" said Maryland voter Christina Thompson. \"It's clear whose shutdown this is. Republicans hold all the leverage and all the cards. And if we back out now, then we're just showing again the party has no backbone.\" Republicans have maintained throughout the month-long shutdown that Democrats must first vote alongside them to fund the government, before addressing the health care subsidies.

once avoided shutdown travel. This term, Trump has been a frequent flier \n         By Tamara Keith \n        \n           Updated Saturday, November 1, 2025 • 11:31 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         With the government shutdown dragging into its second month and growing more painful by the day, President Trump is spending the weekend in Florida. Saturday he's golfing. On Friday night, he hosted a glitzy gathering at his Mar-a-Lago resort, where guests dressed in sequins, fedoras, feathers and long pearl necklaces. The Great Gatsby-inspired theme for the event was \"A Little Party Never Killed Nobody.\" This isn't an isolated trip for the president. He has spent nearly two full weeks outside of Washington since the shutdown began. There are  missed paychecks  for federal workers,  travel disruptions  and SNAP food assistance is  at risk for millions  of Americans. The White House and Republicans in Congress blame Democrats in the Senate for refusing to support a short-term funding bill that would reopen the government. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"They've lost their minds,\" Trump said of Democrats from Air Force One on his way to Florida. \"All they have to do is say the government is open, and that's the end of it.\" Trump spent less than 24 hours in Washington, D.C. this week. Most of the week,  he was in Asia , on a three country trip that started in Malaysia. He was greeted there by a brass band and brightly clothed dancers. Trump got in on it too, doing his signature  Trump dance , swaying with clenched fists. This lengthy foreign trip, Trump's second time overseas during this shutdown, marked a significant break with how past presidents, including Trump himself, have approached government shutdowns. They have typically avoided the bad optics of skipping town during a crisis. In 1995, President Clinton canceled a planned trip to Japan during the government shutdown so he could stay at the White House for talks with Republicans who controlled both the House and Senate. \"We spent a number of days in the Oval Office basically negotiating … trying to see if we could find a way to resolve it,\" said Leon Panetta, who was Clinton's chief of staff at the time. \"Because the last thing we wanted to do was to have the government shut down. That, unfortunately, is no longer the case.\" During a lengthy shutdown in 2013, then-President Obama canceled a four-nation Asia trip. And in 2019, President Trump had a trip planned to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \"If the shutdown continues, I won't go,\" Trump said. The shutdown continued. And he didn't go. Back then, though, Trump was talking about negotiating. He was trying to get border wall funding added to a government funding bill. \"Look, this is really something that should be bipartisan,\" Trump said as that shutdown dragged on. \"And we'll see if it is. I hope it is.\" 2019 versus 2025 That shutdown lasted 35 days, the longest on record. An NPR analysis finds that during that period, Trump only left Washington for six days. He traveled to: Iraq to greet the troops around Christmas Dover Air Force Base in Delaware for the dignified transfer of Americans killed in an attack in Syria Camp David in Maryland for a day The U.S.-Mexico border to make the case for border wall funding New Orleans to speak to the American Farm Bureau There were no visits to Mar-a-Lago resort. This time is quite different. Since the start of the shutdown on October 1, Trump has seemingly made no adjustments to his travel plans and normal routines. His travels have included: Two trips to Florida Golfed twice at his course near Washington, D.C. Israel and Egypt to mark the signing of the Gaza ceasefire agreement Stops in Malaysia, Japan and South Korea during a six day trip Not counting his golf outings in Virginia, Trump spent all or part of 14 days outside of Washington during the first 31 days of the shutdown. Republicans say there is nothing to negotiate until the government reopens Just before Trump returned to the White House from Asia, Vice President JD Vance held a press conference to reassert the administration's position. \"We are not going to give in on policy demands under the threat of hostage taking,\" he said. There would be no negotiations until Democrats vote to reopen the government. \"We need five more reasonable Democrats to put the American people first and reopen the government. That's all that we're asking,\" Vance said. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       And it isn't just Trump. The GOP-controlled House of Representatives was away the entire month of October. The Senate has voted 13 times on the same funding bill, failing each time because of a lack of support from Democrats. Senators went home for the weekend on Thursday, with many of them encountering flight delays related to the shutdown. Democrats, who in the past have supported bills like the temporary funding measure Trump and Republicans are insisting on, say they want to negotiate. But, so far Republicans are sticking with their position that there is nothing to negotiate until the government is open. \"Trump can behave however he wants in this situation,\" said Doug Heye, who was deputy chief of staff to a top house Republican during the 2013 government shutdown. \"Whether he's going to events in foreign countries or just sort of living life, none of that interferes with what the core argument is, which is Republicans saying, 'we've done our job, Democrats step up and do yours.' To do anything different would actually cut against their own messaging.\" Also, he said, Trump clearly isn't all that concerned with political risk from looking like he isn't engaged in ending the shutdown. Even if Trump keeps teasing a 2028 run  for an unconstitutional third term , the president  is governing like he has nothing to lose, said Heye. \"He is YOLO [you only live once] and he is going to do what he wants, wherever he wants and he is going to push the boundaries as far as he can, because whatever he talks about, he's not going to be on the ballot again,\" said Heye. But Panetta, who served in congress and multiple Democratic administrations, sees it differently. He says what's happening now is an abdication of a basic responsibility to govern. \"We've elected these people and they're not there. They've left Washington. They're going on trips,\" said Panetta. \"They're basically walking away from the very responsibility that they should be exercising as elected officials. I mean, that's what's depressing about all of this.\" White House spokesperson Anna Kelly defended the president's travel as good for the country. \"While Democrats flail, President Trump won't stop delivering historic wins for our country while simultaneously finding creative ways to pay our troops and reduce the suffering as a result of Democrats' far-left priorities,\" Kelly said of Trump's Asia travels. NPR's Sam Gringlas, Saige Miller and Anusha Mathur contributed to this report.   \n         \n         Transcript \n         SCOTT DETROW, HOST:   President Trump is in Florida today. That wouldn't be particularly notable, except there is a government shutdown that is creating more and more real-world consequences, including that impending lapse in SNAP benefits. This is not an isolated trip for the president. NPR senior White House correspondent Tamara Keith reports Trump has spent nearly two weeks outside of Washington since the shutdown began October 1. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: When President Trump arrived in Malaysia earlier this week, he was greeted by a brass band and dancers. Trump got in on it, too, as described in this color commentary that went out on the White House video feed. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: In rare, lighthearted moment, President Donald Trump has joined the Malaysian dancers, moving to the cheerful rhythm of the ensemble. KEITH: It was the start of a weeklong trip to Asia that included stops in three countries, but it also marked a significant break with how past presidents, including Trump himself, have approached government shutdowns. They have typically avoided the bad optics of skipping town during a crisis. In 1995, President Clinton canceled a trip to Japan during a shutdown. Republicans controlled Congress at the time. Leon Panetta was Clinton's chief of staff. LEON PANETTA: We spent a number of days in the Oval Office basically negotiating with both Speaker Gingrich and majority leader Bob Dole because the last thing we wanted to do was to have the government shut down. KEITH: During the 2013 shutdown, then-President Obama canceled a four-nation Asia trip. And in 2019, President Trump had a trip planned to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: If the shutdown continues, I won't go. KEITH: The shutdown continued, and he didn't go. That shutdown lasted 35 days, the longest on record. An NPR analysis finds that during that period, Trump only left Washington for six days, and there were no visits to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. This time is quite different. During the monthlong shutdown, Trump has gone to Florida twice, golfed at his club in Virginia,and visited the Middle East and Asia - 13 days on the road so far with more to come. The White House position on negotiating is different now, too. Vice President Vance spoke to the press yesterday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JD VANCE: We're not going to give in on policy demands under the threat of hostage taking. KEITH: He said Republicans won't negotiate with Democrats until they vote to reopen the government. The GOP-controlled House of Representatives has been gone all month. The Senate voted 13 times on the same funding bill and failed each time without enough Democratic support. Democrats say they want to negotiate. Doug Heye was a House Republican aid during the 2013 government shutdown, and he doesn't fault the president for leaving now. DOUG HEYE: Whether he's going to events in foreign countries or just sort of living life, none of that interferes with what the core argument is, which is Republicans saying, we've done our job - Democrats, step up and do yours. To do anything different would actually cut against their own messaging. KEITH: But Leon Panetta, who served in Congress and multiple Democratic administrations, sees it differently. PANETTA: They're basically walking away from the very responsibility that they should be exercising as elected officials. I mean, that's what's depressing about all of this.

People here are concerned about suburban issues like traffic, rapid development and gas prices. It's a red area represented by a Republican in Congress. But an election Tuesday will determine  whether the state redraws congressional  lines and divides people here into districts likely to elect Democrats to the U.S. House. \"We want to keep our communities that are alike together, right? And so if we get sucked into Sacramento or, you know, somewhere, we don't share the same needs, right?\" says Amanda Cortez, a Republican who serves on the Loomis Town Council.

Missouri and North Carolina Republicans also redistricted and Trump is urging leaders in Indiana, Kansas and other states to follow. Democrats say the GOP is gerrymandering in ways that dilute the votes of Black and Latino communities. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       California's redistricting proposal, Proposition 50, would redraw the state's congressional map to help yield up to five new seats for Democrats. California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom set it in motion after Texas Republicans moved to get the edge in five seats in their state. Republicans in California could pay the price. Mike Murray, another Republican voter in the third Congressional district that Loomis is in, says the ballot proposal will dilute his community's voice by splitting the county into three separate districts. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"If we wanted to live in an urban community with the problems and the benefits of an urban community, we would. But we choose to live here. And when we choose to live here, we hope that somebody will represent us in our way of life,\" Murray said. Eric Schickler, co-director of the Institute of Governmental Studies at the University of California, Berkeley, says opponents of  California's redistricting plan are concerned it will sideline the state's independent citizens redistricting commission, which has helped give their communities a voice.  \"The basic argument made by opponents of Prop 50 is that the non-partisan process that was set up in 2008 for the legislature and 2010 for Congress has worked well for the state. It's giving rise to more competitive elections,\" Schickler said. Democrats see a chance to counter Trump's national agenda But for proponents, mainly Democrats, California's special election is all about Congress and the Trump administration. \"To the extent that voters care about having a check on President Trump, well, you need a Democratic House to do that, is the argument that Democrats are making,\" Schickler added. Cyan Samone lives in Truckee, California near Lake Tahoe, a blue dot in the same Republican congressional district as the town of Loomis. At a recent gathering of local Democrats organizing to support Prop 50, Samone said the redistricting is a chance to push back on the Trump administration's immigration crackdown. \"I have a lot of friends who are immigrants from different countries who have left authoritarian regimes,\" said Samone. \"You see the patterns and you just don't want to see that happen here and I don't want to have to see people who fled terrible situations having to run again.\" Samone's husband, Ben Woodard, says redistricting could mean Democrats here are able to elect a representative that'll pay more attention to what his community needs. \"The Democratic Party representative would do that,\" Woodard said. \"Look over our interests like, you know, the cuts to Medicare definitely impact rural health care.\" Supporters of California's redistricting measure appear to have the upper hand heading into election week.

Laura Fitzgerald  covers California state politics for CapRadio. \n         \n         Transcript \n         SCOTT SIMON, HOST:   In just over a week, voters in California face a question that could determine who controls Congress after the 2026 midterm elections. They're deciding if the state should redistrict, giving Democrats an edge to win five more seats in the narrowly divided U.S. House. Now, this vote comes in response to President Trump encouraging Texas to redraw lines to favor Republicans. CapRadio's Laura Fitzgerald reports from a part of California where Republicans could lose out. LAURA FITZGERALD, BYLINE: Loomis, California, is a suburban town of about 7,000 people outside of Sacramento. It's a red area, represented by a Republican in Congress. But under the redistricting map on the ballot in the November 4 election, voters there would be divided and drawn into districts likely to elect Democrats. Amanda Cortez is a Republican on the town council organizing opposition. AMANDA CORTEZ: We want to keep our communities that are like together, right? And so if we get sucked into Sacramento or, you know, somewhere, we don't share the same needs, right? CORTEZ: This area has lots of single-family homes on either side of a major freeway and faces suburban issues, like traffic getting in and out, rapid development and high gas prices. Mike Murray (ph) also lives in the area, and he's involved in his county's Republican club. He's voting no on the measure, called Prop 50, because he says his future votes for Congress will be swamped by the Democratic votes in nearby Sacramento. MIKE MURRAY: If we wanted to live in an urban community with the problems and the benefits of an urban community, we would. But we choose to live here. And when we choose to live here, we hope that somebody will represent us and our way of life. FITZGERALD: Usually, states redistrict at the start of the decade, when the census comes out, but California Republicans could end up paying the price for the redistricting battle that President Trump has set off around the country now. Murray says, for him, this isn't about national politics or redistricting in other states. MURRAY: My concern has always been on our community and our representation. When things are wrong in other places, doing things wrong here, it's not the way to go. Hey, this is something you teach your kids. Two wrongs don't make it right. FITZGERALD: But Trump did get Texas to write a new map that could flip five more seats to Republican candidates. So California's Democratic leaders say they drew their map to flip five seats for Democrats and counter Texas. Eric Schickler is a co-director at the Institute of Governmental Studies at the University of California Berkeley. He says opponents to California's redistricting are concerned it'll sideline the state's Independent Redistricting Commission that's helped give their communities a voice. ERIC SCHICKLER: The basic argument made by opponents of Prop 50 is that the nonpartisan process, you know, has worked well for the state. It's given rise to more competitive elections. FITZGERALD: But for proponents, mainly Democrats, it's about Congress and the Trump administration. SCHICKLER: To the extent that voters care about having a check on President Trump - well, you need a Democratic house to do that, is the argument that Democrats are making. FITZGERALD: In the town of Truckee, a blue dot in the same red congressional district as Loomis, Democrats were wrapping up a meeting to organize for Prop 50. Cyan Samone sees redistricting as a chance to counteract Trump's immigration crackdown. (CROSSTALK) CYAN SAMONE: I have a lot of friends who are immigrants from different countries who have left authoritarian regimes. And you see the patterns, and you just don't want to see that happen here. And I don't want to have to see people who fled terrible situations having to run again. FITZGERALD: Her husband, Ben Woodard (ph), says redistricting could mean Democrats are able to elect a representative that'll pay more attention to what his community needs. BEN WOODARD: I think that the Democratic Party representative would do that and would look over our interests, like, you know, the cuts to Medicare definitely impacted rural health care. FITZGERALD: The proponents appear to have the upper hand heading into the November 4 election. It's a state where most voters are Democrats, and they see this election as part of a national struggle.

It requires 60 votes in a full Senate to overcome a filibuster, giving Democrats a check on the 53-seat Republican majority that led to the start of the Oct. 1 shutdown when the new fiscal year began. Trump's call to terminate the filibuster could alter the ways the Senate and congressional dealmaking operate, with the president saying in his post that he gave a \"great deal\" of thought to the choice on his flight back from Asia on Thursday. Trump spent the past week with foreign leaders in Malaysia, Japan and South Korea, finishing his tour by meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. The president declared the trip a success because of a trade truce with China and foreign investment planned for American industries, but he said one question kept coming up during his time there about why did \"powerful Republicans allow\" the Democrats to shut down parts of the government. His call to end the filibuster came at a moment when certain senators and House Speaker Mike Johnson believed it was time for the government shutdown to come to an end. It's unclear if lawmakers will follow Trump's lead, rather than finding ways to negotiate with Democrats. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       From coast to coast, fallout from the dysfunction of a shuttered federal government is hitting home: Alaskans are stockpiling moose, caribou and fish for winter, even before SNAP food aid is scheduled to shut off. Mainers are filling up their home-heating oil tanks, but waiting on the federal subsidies that are nowhere in sight. Flights are being delayed with holiday travel around the corner. Workers are going without paychecks. And Americans are getting a first glimpse of the skyrocketing health care insurance costs that are at the center of the stalemate on Capitol Hill. \"People are stressing,\" said Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, as food options in her state grow scarce. \"We are well past time to have this behind us.\" While quiet talks are underway, particularly among bipartisan senators, the shutdown is not expected to end before Saturday's deadline when Americans' deep food insecurity — one in eight people depend on the government to have enough to eat — could become starkly apparent if federal SNAP funds run dry. Money for military, but not food aid The White House has moved money around to ensure the military is paid, but refuses to tap funds for food aid. In fact, Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" signed into law this summer, delivered the most substantial cut ever to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, projected to result in some 2.4 million people off the program. At the same time, many Americans who purchase their own health insurance through the federal and state marketplaces, with open enrollment also beginning Saturday, are experiencing sticker shock as premium prices jump. \"We are holding food over the heads of poor people so that we can take away their health care,\" said Rev. Ryan Stoess, during a prayer with religious leaders at the U.S. Capitol. \"God help us,\" he said, \"when the cruelty is the point.\" Deadlines shift to next week The House remains closed down under Johnson for the past month. Senators are preparing to depart Thursday for the long weekend. Trump returns late Thursday after a whirlwind tour of Asia. That means the shutdown, in its 30th day, appears likely to stretch into another week if the filibuster remains. If the shutdown continues, it could become the longest in history, surpassing the 35-day lapse that ended in 2019, during Trump's first term, over his demands to build the U.S.-Mexico border wall. The next inflection point comes after Tuesday's off-year elections — the New York City mayor's race, as well as elections in Virginia and New Jersey that will determine those states' governors. Many expect that once those winners and losers are declared, and the Democrats and Republicans assess their political standing with the voters, they might be ready to hunker down for a deal. \"I hope that it frees people up to move forward with opening the government,\" said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D. GOP cut SNAP in Trump's big bill The Republicans, who have majority control of Congress, find themselves in an unusual position, defending the furloughed federal workers and shuttered programs they have long sought to cut — including most recently with nearly $1 trillion in reductions in Trump's big tax breaks and spending bill. Medicaid, the health care program, and SNAP food aid, suffered sizable blows this summer, in part by imposing new work requirements. For SNAP recipients, many of whom were already required to work, the new requirements extend to older Americans up to age 64 and parents of older school-age children. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Republicans now \"have the nerve\" to suggest it's a political strategy to withhold food aid. \"We are trying to lift up the quality of life for the American people,\" Jeffries of New York said about his party. \"The American people understand that there's a Republican health care crisis,\" he said. \"The American people understand Republicans enacted the largest cut to nutritional assistance in American history when they cut $186 billion from their one, big, ugly bill.\" During the summer debate over Trump's big bill, Johnson and other Republicans railed against what they characterized as lazy Americans, riding what the House speaker calls the \"gravy train\" of government benefits. The speaker spoke about able-bodied young men playing video games while receiving Medicaid health care benefits and insisted the new work requirements for the aid programs would weed out what they called \"waste, fraud and abuse.\" \"What we're talking about, again, is able-bodied workers, many of whom are refusing to work because they're gaming the system,\" Johnson said in spring on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\" \"And when we make them work, it'll be better for everybody, a win-win-win for all,\" he said. What remains out of reach, for now, is any relief from the new health care prices, posted this week, that are expected to put insurance out of reach for many Americans when federal subsidies that help offset those costs are set to expire at the end of the year. Democrats have been holding out for negotiations with Trump and the Republicans to keep those subsidies in place. Republicans say they can address the issue later, once the government reopens. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5594080","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"09:00:00-04:00","title":"Tanzanian President Wins Disputed Election with More Than 97% of the Vote","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu Hassan won a disputed presidential election with over 97% of the vote, marking a rare landslide in East Africa.

        By The Associated Press \n        \n           Saturday, November 1, 2025 • 9:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         KAMPALA, Uganda — Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu Hassan won the country's disputed election with more than 97% of the vote, according to official results announced early Saturday, in a rare landslide victory in the region. Hassan appeared at an event in the administrative capital, Dodoma, to receive the winner's certificate from electoral authorities. In remarks afterward, she said the result showed Tanzanians voted overwhelmingly for a female leader. After the election, \"it's time to unite our country and not destroy what we've built over more than six decades,\" she said. \"We will take all actions and involve all security agencies to ensure the country is peaceful.\" Hassan took power in 2021. As vice president, she was automatically elevated when  her predecessor, John Pombe Magufuli, died  months after the start of his second term. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The result is likely to amplify the concerns of critics, opposition groups and others who said the election in Tanzania was not a contest but a coronation after Hassan's two main rivals were barred or prevented from running. She faced 16 candidates from smaller parties. The Oct. 29 election was marred by violence as demonstrators took to the streets of major cities to protest the poll and stop the counting of votes. The military was deployed to help police quell riots. Internet connectivity has been on and off in the East African nation, disrupting travel and other activities. The protests spread across Tanzania, and the government postponed the reopening of universities, which had been set for Nov. 3. There was a tense calm in the streets of Dar es Salaam, the commercial capital, on Saturday. Security forces manning roadblocks asked to see the identity cards of those who went out. Tanzanian authorities have not said how many people have been killed or injured in the violence. A spokesman for the U.N. human rights office, Seif Magango, on Friday told a U.N. briefing in Geneva by video from Kenya that credible reports of 10 deaths were reported in Dar es Salaam, alongside Shinyanga and Morogoro towns. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Friday he was concerned by the situation in Tanzania and urged all parties to \"prevent further escalation.\" The foreign ministers of the U.K., Canada and Norway in a joint statement cited \"credible reports of a large number of fatalities and significant injuries, as a result of the security response to protests.\" Tundu Lissu, leader of the Chadema opposition group, has been jailed for months,  charged with treason  after he called for electoral reforms that he said were a prerequisite for free and fair elections. Another opposition figure, Luhaga Mpina of the ACT-Wazalendo group, was barred from running. At stake for the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi, or CCM, party was its decades-long grip on power amid the rise of charismatic opposition figures who hoped to lead the country toward political change. Still, a landslide victory is unheard of in the region. Only President Paul Kagame, the authoritarian leader of Rwanda, regularly wins by a landslide. Rights groups including Amnesty International warned of a pattern of enforced disappearances, arbitrary arrests and extrajudicial killings in Tanzania ahead of the polls. In June, a United Nations panel of human rights experts cited more than 200 cases of enforced disappearance since 2019, saying they were \"alarmed by reports of a pattern of repression\" ahead of elections. Hassan oversaw \"an unprecedented crackdown on political opponents,\" the International Crisis Group said in its most recent analysis. \"The government has curbed freedom of expression, ranging from a ban on X and restrictions on the Tanzanian digital platform JamiiForums to silencing critical voices through intimidation or arrest.\" The political maneuvering by Tanzanian authorities is remarkable even in a country where single-party rule has been the norm since the advent of multi-party politics in 1992. Government critics point out that previous leaders tolerated opposition while maintaining a firm grip on power, whereas Hassan is accused of leading with an authoritarian style that defies youth-led democracy movements elsewhere in the region. A version of the governing CCM party, which maintains ties with the Communist Party of China, has ruled Tanzania since its independence from Britain in 1961, a streak that Hassan extends with her victory. CCM is fused with the state, effectively in charge of the security apparatus and structured in such a way that new leaders emerge every five or 10 years. The orderly transitions within CCM have long sustained Tanzania's reputation as an oasis of political stability and relative peace, a major reason for the party's considerable support across the country, especially among rural voters. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/trump-letitia-james-halligan-sarcone-subpoenas-3fded8db4424c388c4a6383c81536a7d","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"01:22:00+00:00","title":"New York AG Challenges Trump Administration’s Investigation of Her Cases","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"New York Attorney General Letitia James is challenging the legitimacy of acting U.S. Attorney John Sarcone, claiming he was improperly appointed by the Trump administration and that subpoenas issued by him targeting her lawsuits against President Donald Trump and the National Rifle Association are retaliatory.

investigation of cases she brought against the president and the National Rifle Association, according to court documents unsealed Friday. James in August filed a motion to block subpoenas issued by acting U.S. Attorney John Sarcone for records related to the legal actions, claiming the Justice Department’s probe of the cases was retaliatory. She also argued that Sarcone had been improperly appointed to his position and, as a result, lacked legitimate authority to authorize the subpoenas. The subpoenas seek records related to a major civil case the Democrat James filed against President Donald Trump over alleged fraud in his personal business dealings.

A phone message was not immediately returned late Friday. James has accused the Trump administration of using the justice system as a “tool of revenge” against adversaries. The attorney general has sued Trump and his Republican administration dozens of times over his policies as president and over how he conducted his private business empire. In October, James was indicted in a federal mortgage fraud case the president pressed the Justice Department to bring.

She argued Sarcone lacked authority to issue the subpoenas because he was improperly appointed by the Trump administration. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi appointed Sarcone to serve as the interim U.S. attorney for the Northern District of New York in March. With the expiration of the 120-day interim term, Bondi designated him as first assistant U.S. attorney for the district, essentially improperly extending his role as acting U.S. attorney, according to James. James’ lawyers in the mortgage fraud case have said they intend to challenge the appointment of the prosecutor, Lindsey Halligan, on similar grounds. The indictment in that case followed the resignation of Erik Siebert as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. Siebert was replaced with Halligan , a White House aide and former Trump lawyer who had never previously served as a federal prosecutor, and presented James’ case to the grand jury herself."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/ohtani-world-series-game-7-c38a0d22f01fd4d57f9dac815c363a55","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"17:38:29+00:00","title":"Shohei Ohtani Starts Game 7 as Dodgers and Blue Jays Battle for World Series Glory","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the decisive Game 7 of the 2025 World Series between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Toronto Blue Jays, manager Dave Roberts made the rare decision to start Shohei Ohtani — a two-way star — despite his recent poor pitching performance and lack of rest.

the Toronto Blue Jays. “Shohei, we don’t have long conversations,” the Dodgers manager said Saturday, 2 1/2 hours before the final game of the year. Max Scherzer was slated to be on the mound for Toronto, only the fourth pitcher to start multiple winner-take-all Game 7s. The Dodgers were trying to become the first repeat champion since the 1998-2000 New York Yankees and the Blue Jays were hoping for their first title since 1993. Ohtani is batting .318 in the World Series with three homers, five RBIs and eight walks. The unprecedented two-way star is 0-1 with a 6.00 ERA after striking out six and walking one in his Game 4 start, when he threw 93 pitches. His only prior outing on three days’ rest was on April 21, 2017, when he allowed two hits over seven innings and struck out 11 in a 2-0 win over Kansas City. His start at Boston on April 17 was cut short by a rain delay after two innings and 31 pitches. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Every other major league start by Ohtani has been with five or six or more days’ rest.

So I just kind of want to withhold kind of expectation and kind of read and react.” Starting Ohtani made more sense than using him in relief. Under a rule adopted for the 2022 season , pitchers who start games in the batting order can remain in the game as a designated hitter after leaving the mound. If Ohtani would start the game only as a DH and then would take the mound, the Dodgers would lose their DH and pitchers would have to bat in that slot if Ohtani was relieved. Roberts said the rule was a factor in having Ohtani start. “You don’t kind of pigeon hole him in his usage,” he said. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Roberts anticipated the other dozen pitchers on his roster would be available. That included Tyler Glasnow, who threw three pitches in getting the final three outs of the Dodgers’ 3-1 victory in Game 6, and Yoshinobu Yamamoto, who threw 96 pitches over six innings for the win. Scherzer was joining Bob Gibson (1964, ’67, ’68) and Lew Burdette and Don Larsen (both 1957 and ’58) in starting multiple winner-take-all Game 7s in the World Series. Scherzer also started the last World Series Game 7 in 2019, boosted by a cortisone injection for an irritated nerve near his neck. Mad Max didn’t have a clean inning and left after five trailing by two runs before his Washington Nationals rallied to win 6-2 in Houston. A 41-year-old right-hander and three time Cy Young Award winner, Scherzer allowed three runs and five hits over 4 1/3 innings in Game 3 on Monday, which the Dodgers won in 18 innings. Toronto manager John Schneider said 22-year-old rookie Trey Yesavage was likely to appear in relief on two days’ rest after throwing 104 pitches over seven innings in the Blue Jays’ Game 5 win. “We kind of have targeted spots in the lineup that we want him to face, and you got to kind of see when that is. It could be early, it could be late,” Schneider said. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Yesavage made three relief appearances this year in the minors, two for Triple-A Buffalo and one for Double-A New Hampshire. “I think it’s cool that he’s a little bit versed in it,” Schneider said. “Obviously, different stage tonight than it is pitching in Triple-A, but I think he’s shown he can handle it, so he’ll be ready to go.” Yesavage entered to start an inning in all three relief appearances. “I’m going to try to give him a clean inning. I’m not sure it’s going to happen, with anyone really tonight, but that would be ideal.” Schneider said. “I think whenever a guy is used to starting an inning, you kind of want to do that with him, but I think he understands that that may not happen tonight.” ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/food-aid-snap-health-care-government-shutdown-41f4bb2b838c738e0d56e620bf396c8f","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"12:21:41+00:00","title":"U.S. Government Shutdown Deepens as Millions Face Food and Health Crises","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. government is in the midst of its second-longest shutdown in history, with a critical impasse over funding leading to severe disruptions in essential services.

Delays and uncertainty around SNAP The Department of Agriculture planned to withhold $8 billion needed for payments to the food program starting on Saturday until two federal judges ordered the administration to make them. Trump said he would provide the money but wanted more legal direction from the court. On Saturday, U.S. District Judge John J. McConnell in Rhode Island ordered that the government needed to tell the court by Monday how it would fund SNAP accounts. McConnell, who was nominated by President Barack Obama, said the Trump administration needed to either make a full payment by Monday, or if it decides to only tap $3 billion in a contingency fund, figure out how to do that by Wednesday. “There is no question that the congressionally approved contingency funds must be used now because of the shutdown,” McConnell wrote in his order. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); But that still leaves uncertainty about whether the department will use additional money or only provide partial benefits for the month. The SNAP program serves about 1 in 8 Americans and costs about $8 billion per month. Benefits were already facing delays because it takes a week or more to load SNAP cards in many states. Some governors and mayors have stepped in, using what money they have available to fill the program that feeds about 42 million Americans. “People are just nervous, scared,” said Jill Corbin, the director of the St. Vincent De Paul soup kitchen and food pantry in Norwich, Connecticut. ”It’s not really a definite answer that we have right now.” As people lined up early Saturday for hot meals and groceries, the organization had 10 extra volunteers to help newcomers navigate the process. On Wednesday, some 400 families visited the food pantry and 555 people received hot meals. “It’s kind of like everything is unraveling at the same time,” Corbin said. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York criticized Trump for spending Saturday at one of his Florida golf courses, saying on social media that “Trump and Republicans are illegally withholding SNAP benefits.” “Millions of children could go hungry,” he added. Democrats demanded this week that the government fund SNAP, but Republicans responded by arguing the program is in such a dire situation because Democrats have repeatedly voted against a short-term government funding bill. “We are now reaching a breaking point thanks to Democrats voting no on government funding, now 14 different times,” House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said at a news conference Friday. Trump injected himself into the debate late Thursday by suggesting that Republican senators, who hold the majority, end the shutdown by getting rid of the filibuster rules that prevent most legislation from advancing unless it has the support of at least 60 senators. Democrats have used the filibuster to block a funding bill in the Senate for weeks. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Republican leaders quickly rejected Trump’s idea, prompting the president to double down on the demand Saturday night. “Don’t be WEAK AND STUPID. FIGHT,FIGHT, FIGHT! WIN, WIN, WIN!” Trump posted on social media, arguing that Democrats would terminate the filibuster rules if they regain the Senate majority. “We will immediately END the Extortionist Shutdown, get ALL of our agenda passed, and make life so good for Americans that these DERANGED DEMOCRAT politicians will never again have the chance to DESTROY AMERICA!” “Republicans, you will rue the day that you didn’t TERMINATE THE FILIBUSTER!!!” he added. Health care subsidies expiring The annual sign-up period for the Affordable Care Act health insurance also begins Saturday, and there are sharp increases in what people will have to pay for coverage. Enhanced tax credits that help most enrollees pay for the health plans are set to expire next year. Democrats have rallied around a push to extend those credits and have refused to vote for government funding legislation until Congress acts. “Millions of Americans in every state across this country are waking up to drastically higher premiums for the same health care coverage they’re already on.” said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., in a statement. If Congress does not extend the credits, subsidized enrollees will face cost increases of about 114%, or more than $1,000 per year, on average, health care research nonprofit KFF found. Some Republicans in Congress have been open to the idea of extending the subsidies, but they also want to make major changes to the health overhaul enacted while Democrat Barack Obama was president. Thune has offered Democrats a vote on extending the benefits, but has not guaranteed a result. And he is demanding that Democrats first vote to reopen the government. So the country waits and watches for Congress to act. T.J. McCuin, whose family owns and operates farmers markets in Mesa and Apache Junction, Arizona, said 15% of the markets’ customers use SNAP benefits. “Hopefully this isn’t a long-term problem because once those benefits run out, then it’s going to start to hurt,” he said. ___ Haigh reported from Norwich, Connecticut.

Here's what to know \n         By Michelle Andrews \n        \n           Friday, October 31, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         This year's Obamacare open enrollment period, which starts Saturday in most states, is full of uncertainty and confusion for the more than  24 million people  who buy health insurance through the federal and state Affordable Care Act marketplaces. The fate of the enhanced premium tax credits that make coverage more affordable for  92% of enrollees  remains up in the air, with the prospect of significantly  higher premiums looming . But there are steps marketplace shoppers can take to ensure they make the right choices for the upcoming plan year. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       1. Understand how we got here In 2021, as part of a COVID-era relief package, the ACA premium tax credits were enhanced to lower costs for previously eligible people and expand eligibility to people with incomes over 400% of the federal poverty level (which amounts to  about $63,000  for one person in 2025). But those enhancements, which were extended in 2022,  will expire  at the end of 2025 unless Congress acts. The debate over whether to extend them again has been at the center of a political battle of wills between Republicans and Democrats in Congress, a fight at the heart of the now month-old  government shutdown. The financial implications for many marketplace enrollees are huge. Average out-of-pocket premium payments for subsidized enrollees are projected to more than double if the enhanced tax credits expire, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. \"The longer this goes on, the more damage is done,\" said  Cynthia Cox , a vice president and the director of the Program on the ACA at KFF. \"If someone logs on Nov. 1 and sees their premium doubling, they might just walk away.\" That would be a mistake, marketplace experts agree. What is clear, though, is that buyers need to beware and be informed. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       2. Follow the news It can be frustrating to track day-to-day Capitol Hill machinations. But that may be your best source for up-to-date information. Congress could make a deal to extend the enhanced subsidies anytime during the next few days, weeks or months -- or not. Either way, it could affect your enrollment decision. So, pay attention. Don't count on the marketplace or your insurer to notify you about what you should expect to pay. \"Many state marketplaces have hit delay\" on sending consumers notices of net premiums, which take premium tax credits into account, said  Sabrina Corlette , a co-director of Georgetown University's Center on Health Insurance Reforms. The federal government doesn't send enrollees notices about plan premiums for the coming year for the  28 federally facilitated  marketplaces. For 2026, it has said that health plans can also  opt not  to. 3. Update your account information and don't auto-enroll Log in to your marketplace account and update your income, household size, and any other details that have changed. This year, it's particularly important to provide an accurate estimate of your anticipated income for 2026. A provision in HR 1, sometimes called the  One Big Beautiful Bill Act ,  eliminated the caps  on what many people were required to repay if they underestimated their projected income and received more premium assistance than they should have. Next year, people will have to repay the entire excess amount. In the past few years, it's been possible to put your ACA insurance on auto-pilot with  automatic reenrollment  in your current or a similar plan. Given the uncertainty around premiums, this is not a good year to do that, enrollment specialists say. This is especially true for people who, without a deal in Congress, will no longer qualify for subsidies next year, specifically those whose incomes are over 400% of the federal poverty level. 4. Shop based on sticker prices When people see their projected premiums, assuming Congress hasn't reached a deal to extend the enhanced credits, many will be shocked. Health insurance premiums on the marketplaces are expected to increase, on average, 26% next year,  according to KFF . That's the largest rate increase since 2018. Until now, people have largely been shielded from those increases by the enhanced premium tax subsidies that nearly all enrollees receive. Here's how it works: Most people with ACA marketplace plans are responsible for paying a portion of their premium based on a sliding income scale, and the government pays the rest. According to an analysis by KFF, if the enhanced credits are not renewed, a family of four with $75,000 in income, for example,  will be responsible  for paying $5,865 in annual premiums for a benchmark silver plan in 2026 — more than double the $2,498 it'll pay if they are renewed. When evaluating a plan, focus on the listed price. If it's not affordable without the enhanced tax credits, it's not a good buy. \"People need to make a decision based on what is in front of them,\" Cox said. If you can't afford the sticker price without the enhanced credits, consider enrolling in a less generous plan with a lower premium but a higher deductible, Cox said. Bronze plans must provide comprehensive coverage, including covering preventive care at no cost, and may cover some doctor visits before the deductible. \"In most cases, it makes more sense to have a bronze plan than to be uninsured,\" she said. The Trump administration has been promoting  catastrophic plans  as a more affordable option for people who face financial hardship, including those who don't qualify for subsidies because their incomes are either less than 100% or more than 400% of the federal poverty level. Similar to bronze plans, catastrophic plans cover a set of essential health benefits, provide free preventive care, and must cover at least three doctor visits before people reach their deductible. But catastrophic plan deductibles are the highest of any type of marketplace plan: $10,600 for individuals and $21,200 for families in 2026. \"They are expensive relative to what they cover,\" said  Jennifer Sullivan , director of health coverage access at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, noting premiums can cost several hundred dollars. 5. Come back, check, and recheck If you're dismayed at premium prices on your first pass, \"don't slam the computer shut and decide that there are no options for you,\" Sullivan said. \"Congress might still act and things might change radically.\" Lawmakers could restore the enhanced premium tax credits right up to the end of the year, or later. In a majority of states, including the 28 that use the federal government's centralized marketplace, open enrollment lasts until Jan. 15. There are also other key dates to remember. In most states, people  must enroll  by Dec. 15 for coverage starting Jan. 1, and by Jan. 15 for coverage starting Feb. 1, though some states have later deadlines. 6. Wait to pay your premium Premium payments are generally due before the plan takes effect, although marketplaces and insurers have flexibility to extend deadlines, Corlette said. They might allow people extra time to make a first payment, for example. \"We've seen that in the past. State officials and insurance companies have gotten creative to try and keep people in coverage,\" she said. But if there is a last-minute deal and someone has already paid their premium for January coverage and received a lower tax credit than the deal provides, they should still be able to receive the higher credit. \"There are ways to make people whole,\" Corlette said, although how that might happen this enrollment period is unclear.

The rulings came a day before the U.S. Department of Agriculture planned to freeze payments to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program because it said it could no longer keep funding it due to the shutdown. The program serves about 1 in 8 Americans and is a major piece of the nation’s social safety net. Word in October that it would be a Nov. 1 casualty of the shutdown sent states , food banks and SNAP recipients scrambling to figure out how to secure food. Some states said they would spend their own funds to keep versions of the program going. It wasn’t immediately clear how quickly the debit cards that beneficiaries use to buy groceries could be reloaded after the ruling. That process often takes one to two weeks. Here’s the latest: New York Attorney General Letitia James seeks to block Trump administration’s subpoenas The challenge comes as James pushes back against the administration’s investigation of cases she brought against the president and the National Rifle Association, according to court documents unsealed Friday. James filed a motion in August to block subpoenas issued by acting U.S. Attorney John Sarcone for records related to the legal actions, claiming the Justice Department’s probe of the cases was retaliatory. She also argued that Sarcone was improperly appointed and therefore lacked legitimate authority to authorize the subpoenas. Dozens of court documents in the case have been filed under seal since August. Late Friday a federal judge in Manhattan granted James’ motion to unseal most of them, over the objection of the Justice Department. Judge Lorna Schofield, however, has not yet ruled on the motion to quash the subpoenas. An email seeking comment was sent to Sarcone’s office.

Here’s how it works The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program is a major piece of the social safety net used by nearly 42 million, or about 1 in 8 Americans, to help buy groceries. Originally known as the food stamp program, it has existed since 1964, serving low-income people, many of whom have jobs but don’t make enough to cover all basic costs. There are income limits based on family size, expenses and whether households include someone who is elderly or has a disability. Most participants are families with children, and more than 1 in 3 include older adults or someone with a disability. Nearly 2 in 5 recipients are households where someone is employed. Most participants have incomes below the poverty line, about $32,000 for a family of four, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The Agriculture Department, which administers SNAP, says nearly 16 million children received benefits in 2023. ▶ Read more about how SNAP works freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Air traffic controller shortages lead to broader US flight delays as shutdown nears 1-month mark The Federal Aviation Administration reported staffing shortages that were causing flight delays Friday at a number of airports, including in Boston, Phoenix, San Francisco, Nashville, Houston, Dallas and the Washington, D.C., area. Airports serving the New York City area — John F. Kennedy, LaGuardia and Newark Liberty — were also experiencing delays averaging around two hours, according to the FAA. Staffing shortages can occur both in regional control centers that manage multiple airports and in individual airport towers, but they don’t always lead to flight disruptions. According to aviation analytics firm Cirium, flight data showed strong on-time performance at most major airports for the month of October despite isolated staffing problems throughout the month. But Cirium said the data also showed a “broader slowdown” Thursday across the nation’s aviation system for the first time since the shutdown began Oct. 1, suggesting staffing-related disruptions may be spreading. ▶ Read more about the shutdown and U.S. aviation freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Instacart, DoorDash, Gopuff among companies offering discounts to SNAP recipients Instacart said Friday that it will offer customers who receive SNAP benefits 50% on their next grocery order to ease strain as the government prepares to cut off food aid payments . the company said any customer who placed an order in October using a SNAP/EBT card will be eligible for the discount, which will be available even if the government makes payments as planned on Nov. 1. Instacart said it is also expanding the number of food banks it supports through online food drives from 100 to 300. The San Francisco-based grocery delivery company said both programs amount to $5 million in direct relief.

Trump was interviewed by CBS’ Norah O’Donnell on Friday at Mar-a-Lago for the appearance, which will air Sunday. The president has a checkered history with television’s most popular newsmagazine. But he has signaled friendlier relations with CBS News after the takeover of its parent company this summer by new Paramount CEO David Ellison, the son of wealthy supporter Larry Ellison. Trump says he’ll fund SNAP if the courts give more clarity The president suggested on social media that the government would comply with court rulings to pay for food aid during the government shutdown but said more clarity is needed first. “Even if we get immediate guidance, it will unfortunately be delayed while States get the money out,” Trump said. Federal funds for the program are expected to be frozen starting Saturday. “If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding.” He sought to blame Democrats for the delay and urged SNAP recipients to call Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. New Pentagon policy undercuts trans troops’ ability to ask to stay in the military, AP learns The policy will severely undercut the ability of transgender troops who have been banned from the armed forces by the Trump administration to turn to peer boards to argue for their right to stay, according to a memo obtained by AP. If military separation boards decide to allow transgender service members to remain in uniform, commanders can override those decisions, according to an Oct. 8 memo to all services from the Pentagon’s undersecretary for personnel and readiness. That breaks with longstanding policy that boards act independently . It is the Pentagon’s latest step to drive transgender troops out of the armed forces following a presidential executive order. Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have targeted diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in what they say is an effort to make the military more lethal. The new memo also requires that trans service members appear before separation boards in uniforms that match the gender assigned to them at birth. If they do not, their absence can be used against them. ▶ Read more about the policy Court says Border Patrol official won’t have to brief judge on Chicago-area immigration sweeps An appeals court ruled in favor of the Trump administration and stopped a judge from trying to get daily updates from a Border Patrol official about the government’s immigration crackdown in the Chicago area. The court said the order from U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis put her “in position of an inquisitor rather than that of a neutral adjudicator” and would have turned her into a supervisor of Greg Bovino, a violation of the separation of powers. Ellis, concerned about allegations of excessive force and the use of tear gas against protesters, wanted daily updates from Bovino, starting Wednesday. But the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals intervened that day and suspended the order , before going further and freezing it Friday. Also Friday, advocates in a different case sued over what they called “inhumane” conditions at a Chicago-area immigration facility . Senate Democrats urge top Trump national security officials to brief lawmakers on Venezuela strikes The renewed request came in a letter Friday to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. “We also request that you provide all legal opinions related to these strikes and a list of the groups or other entities the President has deemed targetable,” the senators said in the letter, which was obtained by The Associated Press. Signatories included Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer as well as Jack Reed, Jeanne Shaheen, Mark Warner, Chris Coons, Patty Murray and Brian Schatz. The letter said the administration so far “has selectively shared what has at times been contradictory information” with some members “while excluding others.” Democrats and some Republicans have complained that the administration has failed to provide basic information about lethal strikes that U.S. forces have carried out against alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean and Pacific the last two months. Trump opens the door for sanctions on Nigeria over alleged persecution of Christians The president announced Friday that he would designate the West African nation “a country of particular concern” as it relates to religious freedom, a move that has been pushed by some U.S. lawmakers. The designation does not necessarily mean that sanctions, which could include a ban on all non-humanitarian aid, will be imposed, but it is a step ahead of that. “Christianity is facing an existential threat in Nigeria,” Trump said via social media. “Radical Islamists are responsible for this mass slaughter. I am hereby making Nigeria a ‘COUNTRY OF PARTICULAR CONCERN.’” Nigeria vehemently rejects such claims about persecution of Christians . Analysts say that while Christians are among those targeted , the majority of victims of armed groups are Muslims in Nigeria’s Muslim-majority north, where most attacks occur. Trump said he would ask lawmakers to look into the matter and report back on what the response to the designation should be. Union president for air traffic controllers says ‘end this shutdown’ The president of the union representing air traffic controllers is calling on Congress to pass a clean continuing resolution to end the government shutdown, make sure federal workers get paid and then engage in bipartisan negotiation on other pressing issues. Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, said the workers the union represents got no paycheck on Tuesday after receiving a partial check two weeks earlier. He said going without a full month’s pay or more would be unsustainable. Daniels also said the situation is creating substantial distractions for individuals already engaged in extremely stressful work. “The financial and mental strain increases risks within the National Airspace System, making it less safe with each passing day of the shutdown,” Daniels said in a statement. Top Senate Judiciary Democrat challenges YouTube’s claims of Biden censorship Attorneys for YouTube’s parent company Alphabet last month sent the Senate Judiciary Committee a letter claiming the Biden administration pressed the social media site to delete content during the COVID-19 pandemic. But Sen. Jamie Raskin, the committee’s Democratic ranking member, on Friday publicly questioned that assessment in his own letter to YouTube CEO Neal Mohan. Raskin wrote that the sworn testimony of 20 Alphabet employees contradicted the claims the company had made. He questioned whether YouTube was coerced to claim censorship by the Trump administration. “What was Alphabet promised or threatened with in order to dance to this new MAGA tune?” Raskin asked in Friday’s letter. Republicans argue the Biden administration illegally censored Americans through coercion to tech companies. Democrats dispute that narrative. Judge sides with Democratic groups that sued over Trump’s proof-of-citizenship directive The federal judge ruled that Trump’s request to add a documentary proof of citizenship requirement to the federal voter registration form is an unconstitutional violation of the separation of powers. The ruling deals a blow to the administration and its allies who have argued that such a mandate is necessary to restore public confidence that only Americans are voting in U.S. elections. “Because our Constitution assigns responsibility for election regulation to the States and to Congress, this Court holds that the President lacks the authority to direct such changes,” U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly in Washington, D.C., wrote in her opinion. Kollar-Kotelly echoed comments she made when she granted a preliminary injunction over the issue. Senators press Hegseth for more information on boat strikes The Republican chair and ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee have asked Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to provide the legal rationale for the U.S. military’s fatal attacks on alleged drug boats off the South American coast. The senators also requested the directives Hegseth approved for the military strikes, which have killed at least 61 people in 14 attacks since early September. They also want the list of drug cartels that the Trump administration has designated as terrorist organizations in its justification for the use of military force. The requests were made in two letters from late September and early October that were released Friday by Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican, and Jack Reed, a Democrat from Rhode Island. Lawmakers in both parties have raised questions about the use of military force without congressional approval. The Trump administration has shown no evidence to support its claims about the boats that have been attacked, their connection to drug cartels, or even the identity of the people killed in the strikes. Top Democrat says Trump administration must release SNAP funds after judge’s ruling Sen. Amy Klobuchar, the ranking member of the Senate Agriculture committee that oversees the food aid program, said the court’s decision “confirms what we have said all week: The administration is choosing not to feed Americans in need, despite knowing that it is legally required to do so.” The district court’s decision leaves “no excuse to withhold food assistance from Americans,” she said. If the administration decides not to issue SNAP funds, she said, “it is purely a cruel political decision, not a legal one. They should immediately act — as the court has required — to ensure food assistance continues to go to families in need.” Judges in the SNAP payment lawsuits expect updates by Monday A federal judge in Rhode Island ruled from the bench that the program must be funded using at least the contingency funds — and asked for an update on progress by Monday. A Massachusetts-based judge also gave the administration until Monday to say whether it would partially pay for the benefits for November with contingency money or fund them fully with additional funds. It wasn’t immediately clear how quickly the debit cards that beneficiaries use to buy groceries could be reloaded after the ruling. That process often takes one to two weeks. The rulings are likely to face appeals. Senate Republicans reject Trump’s call to eliminate the filibuster Trump has long pushed Senate Republicans to get rid of the rule that requires 60 votes to overcome objections and gives the minority Democrats a check on GOP power. He posted on social media late Thursday that the Senate should “Get rid of the Filibuster, and get rid of it, NOW!” But Senate Majority Leader John Thune has repeatedly said he is not considering changing the rules even as he seeks to end the shutdown, arguing that the filibuster is vital to the institution of the Senate and has allowed them to halt Democratic policies when they are in the minority. The leader’s “position on the importance of the legislative filibuster is unchanged,” Thune spokesman Ryan Wrasse said Friday. A spokeswoman for Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, the No. 2 Republican, said his position opposing a filibuster change also remains unchanged. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., also defended the filibuster Friday, while conceding “it’s not my call.” “The safeguard in the Senate has always been the filibuster,” Johnson said, adding that Trump’s comments are “the president’s anger at the situation.” Trump administration must fund SNAP payments during the shutdown, judge rules Two federal judges ruled nearly simultaneously on Friday that President Donald Trump’s administration must to continue to fund SNAP, the nation’s biggest food aid program, using contingency funds during the government shutdown. The rulings came a day before the U.S. Department of Agriculture planned to freeze payments to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program because it said it could no longer keep funding it due to the shutdown. The program serves about 1 in 8 Americans and is a major piece of the nation’s social safety net. Word in October that it would be a Nov. 1 casualty of the shutdown sent states , food banks and SNAP recipients scrambling to figure out how to secure food. Some states said they would spend their own funds to keep versions of the program going. The program costs around $8 billion per month nationally. Trump says he’s renovated the Lincoln Bathroom The president announced the renovation and posted side-by-side photos of the before and after of the rehab of the bathroom attached to one of the most famous rooms in the White House. “It was renovated in the 1940s in an art deco green tile style, which was totally inappropriate for the Lincoln Era,” Trump added. “I did it in black and white polished Statuary marble. This was very appropriate for the time of Abraham Lincoln and, in fact, could be the marble that was originally there!” White House set to resume public tours in December, after interruption for ballroom construction The White House says tours will restart Dec. 2, following their suspension for months due to the construction of Trump’s $300 million ballroom. The East Wing was once part of tour routes , but has been demolished as part of the project. The White House says it’ll now offer “an updated route offering guests the opportunity to experience the history and beauty of the People’s House.” To mark the holidays, December tours feature Christmas decorations curated by first lady Melania Trump on the State Floor. Congressional offices can begin submitting tour requests for their constituents on Monday. Such requests had been paused since the summer for ballroom construction."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/november-supermoon-2025-6f607a83e00bea1fc97fcf2f57fa3529","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"13:23:07+00:00","title":"Supermoon Event in November 2025: Moon Looks Bigger and Brighter","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A supermoon — the closest full moon of the year — will be visible on Wednesday night in November 2025, making the moon appear up to 14% larger and 30% brighter due to its proximity to Earth.

during the closest supermoon of the year. The moon’s orbit around the Earth isn’t a perfect circle, so it gets nearer and farther as it swings around. A so-called supermoon happens when a full moon is closer to Earth in its orbit. That makes the moon look up to 14% bigger and 30% brighter than the faintest moon of the year, according to NASA. November’s supermoon is the second of three supermoons this year and also the closest: The moon will come within just under 222,000 miles (357,000 kilometers) of Earth. Tides may be slightly higher during a supermoon because the moon is closer to Earth, said astronomer Lawrence Wasserman with Lowell Observatory. But the difference isn’t very noticeable. No special equipment is needed to view the supermoon if clear skies permit. But the change in the moon’s size can be tough to discern with the naked eye. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); “The difference is most obvious as a comparison between other images or observations,” said Shannon Schmoll, director of Abrams Planetarium at Michigan State University, in an email.

to make greater efforts to persuade North Korea to return to talks, as the two leaders on Saturday agreed on a set of steps to expand their economic and other ties. Their one-on-one meeting came hours after they and other Asia-Pacific leaders wrapped up an annual summit in South Korea with a joint statement pledging stronger economic cooperation. The two-day Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in the city of Gyeongju took place a day after Xi and U.S. President Donald Trump agreed to dial back earlier steps and de-escalate their trade war. During his meeting with Lee, Xi called for Seoul to work with Beijing to “practice genuine multilateralism,” according to Chinese state media, as he continued to position Beijing as the defender of the global trade order upended by Trump’s sweeping tariffs.

However, Wi Sung-lac, Lee’s national security director, said Lee during the meeting outlined his strategy for achieving denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula and “requested a constructive Chinese role to help realize the resumption of talks with North Korea.” “Xi replied that he would continue his efforts to help resolve issues involving the Korean Peninsula and promote peace and stability here,” Wi said.

China has been long suspected of avoiding fully implementing U.N. sanctions on North Korea and sending clandestine aid shipments to help the North stay afloat and continue to serve as a bulwark against U.S. influence on the Korean Peninsula. The North Korea item in the Lee-Xi meeting drew an irritated response from Pyongyang. North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Pak Myong Ho slammed South Korea for talking about “its daydream” of realizing North Korea’s denuclearization. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Lee, an advocate of reconciliation with North Korea , said earlier Saturday he would take “more active preemptive steps” to lower military tensions with the North, stressing that peace on the Korean Peninsula is essential to prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region.

Their joint statement declared that the APEC leaders “acknowledge the global trading system continues to face significant challenge.” “We reaffirm our shared recognition that robust trade and investment are vital to the growth and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region,” it says. Jeonghun Min, a professor at South Korea’s National Diplomatic Academy, said the statement avoided direct language supporting “free and open trade,” which would not have received backing from the United States, but still endorsed economic cooperation and multilateralism at the core of APEC’s mission. “It wasn’t possible to leave that out entirely,” said Min. The joint declaration said that APEC members remain committed to the Putrajaya Vision 2040, a 20-year growth vision adopted in 2020 that calls for a trade environment that’s “free, open, fair, non-discriminatory, transparent and predictable.” freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); APEC leaders discuss AI and population issues While the summit’s opening session on Friday focused on ways to boost trade and investment, Saturday’s meeting had cooperation in the field of artificial intelligence, demographic challenges and cultural industries on its agenda. Xi urged Asia-Pacific countries on Saturday to promote the “sound and orderly development” of AI in a way that is mindful of all of humanity’s well-being. He proposed the formation of a new global body called the World Artificial Intelligence Cooperation Organization. Trump, known for his dismissal of multilateralism, had quickly left South Korea after the agreement with Xi, leaving the Chinese president to steal the limelight at the APEC summit. The U.S. under Trump has stepped back from efforts to regulate AI and would be unlikely to join the group that China has proposed. APEC leaders also issued a statement Saturday calling for a coordinated approach to the changes brought by AI, which they described as a potential economic catalyst that also poses challenges. Another statement urged cooperation to address declining birth rates, aging populations and accelerated urbanization. On Friday, Xi told the summit that China would support global free trade and supply chain stability — an apparent effort to position his country as an alternative to Trump’s protectionist policies. In written remarks sent to a CEO summit held in conjunction with the APEC summit, Xi said that “investing in China is investing in the future.” freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Established in 1989, APEC champions free and open trade and investment to promote regional economic integration.

Tulsi Gabbard ’s comments before the Manama Dialogue, an annual security summit in Bahrain put on by the International Institute for Security Studies, underlines remarks Trump offered on a trip earlier this year to the Middle East. In Trump’s second term, previous American goals of fostering human rights and democracy promotion in the region have been replaced by an emphasis on economic prosperity and regional stability. That includes securing a ceasefire that has halted the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, as well as forcing an end to Israel’s 12-day war on Iran after sending American bombers to attack Iranian nuclear sites. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); “For decades, our foreign policy has been trapped in a counterproductive and endless cycle of regime change or nation building,” said Gabbard, a former Congresswoman from Hawaii and U.S. Army National Guard veteran. “It was a one-size-fits-all approach, of toppling regimes, trying to impose our system of governance on others, intervene in conflicts that were barely understood and walk away with more enemies than allies.” Related Stories Republican Jewish leaders planned a ceasefire celebration, pivoted to take on antisemitism within 5 MIN READ US envoy calls Lebanon a ‘failed state’ as Syria expected to join anti-IS coalition 3 MIN READ Israel says the latest remains returned from Gaza by Hamas are not of hostages 4 MIN READ She added: “The results: Trillions spent, countless lives lost and in many cases, the creation of greater security threats.” That assessment mirrors Trump’s own thinking about the wars that followed the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks on New York and Washington. He reached a deal in his first term to withdraw from Afghanistan, which in the Biden administration became a chaotic departure in 2021 . Meanwhile, he’s embraced Syria’s interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa , a former al-Qaida fighter once held in an American prison in Iraq. Unmentioned by Gabbard was Trump’s deployment of warships off South America, fatal strikes targeting alleged drug-running boats and his ordering of the CIA to run covert operations targeting Venezuela , which has stoked fears of invasion and speculation that Trump could try to topple its authoritarian president. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Serious challenges remain from Trump in the Middle East, however. Gabbard noted in her brief remarks that the ceasefire in Gaza remained “fragile.” She also acknowledged Iran remained a concern as the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency said renewed movement has been detected recently at the country’s nuclear sites . “The road ahead will not be simple or easy but the president is very committed down this road,” said Gabbard, who attended the event as a government shutdown grinds on back home . An Associated Press journalist had been accredited and issued a visa to cover the summit, but the Bahraini government late Wednesday said it had been rescinded as it was conducting a “post-approval review” of that permission. The government did not elaborate on why the visa was revoked.

Sign up here . LSU athletic director Scott Woodward resigned under pressure from the post he’s held for six years on Thursday night, four days after the firing of football coach Brian Kelly and a day after Republican Gov. Jeff Landry said Woodward would not hire Kelly’s replacement. Woodward, a Baton Rouge native and LSU graduate, was hired as athletic director at his alma mater in April 2019. Since then, LSU has won national championships in football, baseball (twice), women’s basketball and gymnastics. “We thank Scott for the last six years of service as athletic director,” LSU Board of Supervisors chairman Scott Ballard said. “He had a lot of success at LSU. “Our focus now is on moving the athletic department forward and best positioning LSU to achieve its full potential.” Among the coaches hired by Woodward was Kim Mulkey, who led LSU to its first women’s basketball national title in 2023. Her team played an exhibition game on Thursday night, and Mulkey declined to attend a postgame news conference, sending assistant Bob Starkey instead. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); “She’s heartbroken,” Starkey told reporters . “In 40 years of coaching, I’ve worked with two phenomenal athletic directors,” Starkey added. “One was Skip Bertman (at LSU). The other one was Scott Woodward.” No. 15 Virginia beats California 31-21 for 7th straight win No. 5 Georgia rallies and escapes ‘Cocktail Party’ with a 24-20 victory against Florida No. 13 Texas Tech takes advantage of turnovers to beat K-State 43-20, ending 8-game series skid Verge Ausberry, LSU’s executive deputy athletic director, will replace Woodward on an interim basis and lead the search for a football coach, the university announced. Think you know who belongs in the Top 25 ? Now it’s your turn to vote with the AP Top 25 fan poll. In an open letter to LSU fans, Woodward said, “Our University will always hold a special place in my heart and I will never be too far from LSU.” “Others can recap or opine on my tenure and on my decisions over the last six years as Director of Athletics, but I will not,” Woodward said. “Rather, I will focus on the absolute joy that LSU Athletics brings to our state’s residents and to the Baton Rouge community.” When Woodward was hired in 2019, James Carville, a political pundit who graduated from LSU, taught there and was named to the university’s Manship School of Mass Communications’ Hall of Fame, hosted a welcome party for him at his house in New Orleans. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); In a phone interview with The Associated Press on Thursday night, Carville, a Democrat, expressed disgust at the circumstances surrounding Woodward’s sudden departure. “The Louisiana governor and the LSU board has damaged the reputation of our university,” Carville said. “Landry’s IQ is the equivalent of the temperature of dishwater. “The LSU board is weak and pathetic,” Carville added. “This is not about my politics. It’s about my university.” According to Woodward’s contract, he is owed more than $5 million through 2029. LSU has not yet announced the financial terms of his separation agreement. Landry on Wednesday was hosting a news conference about government matters not concerning LSU when he was asked about the Tigers’ coaching situation and asserted that Woodward would not be involved in the selection of the next coach . Under Woodward, the football program bought out former coach Ed Orgeron for about $17 million in 2021. The buyout for Kelly, whom Woodward signed to a 10-year contract worth about $100 million in December 2021, is about $53 million, which is among the largest in the history of college sports. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Texas A&M’s $77 million buyout of former coach Jimbo Fisher, who was fired in 2023, is the largest. Woodward was Texas A&M’s athletic director when Fisher was hired to coach the Aggies in December 2017. But Woodward already had been at LSU for two years when A&M, in 2021, gave Fisher a contract extension that effectively doubled the cost of his buyout. Still, Landry assigned blame for Fisher’s buyout to Woodward. “This is a pattern,” Landry said. “Right now, we’ve got a $53 million liability. ... We are not doing that again.” Kelly’s firing on Sunday came a day after LSU lost at home to Texas A&M, 49-25 — the Tigers’ third defeat in four games. Kelly went 34-14 at LSU, never reaching the College Football Playoff, which was expanded from four to 12 teams in 2024. LSU does not currently have a president. Its most recent president, William F. Tate IV, left to become president of Rutgers in July. The next president will be hired by the Board of Supervisors, whose members are appointed by the governor to six-year staggered terms. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Since Landry took office in January 2024, he has appointed nine of the 18 board members, and will have the chance to appoint four more in 2026. The board has announced that it expects to select the next president on Tuesday. ___ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season. Sign up here and here (AP News mobile app).

YORK (AP) — President Donald Trump’s request to add a documentary proof of citizenship requirement to the federal voter registration form cannot be enforced, a federal judge ruled Friday. U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly in Washington, D.C., sided with Democratic and civil rights groups that sued the Trump administration over his executive order to overhaul U.S. elections. She ruled that the proof-of-citizenship directive is an unconstitutional violation of the separation of powers, dealing a blow to the administration and its allies who have argued that such a mandate is necessary to restore public confidence that only Americans are voting in U.S. elections. “Because our Constitution assigns responsibility for election regulation to the States and to Congress, this Court holds that the President lacks the authority to direct such changes,” Kollar-Kotelly wrote in her opinion. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); She further emphasized that on matters related to setting qualifications for voting and regulating federal election procedures “the Constitution assigns no direct role to the President in either domain.” Related Stories Republican Jewish leaders planned a ceasefire celebration, pivoted to take on antisemitism within 5 MIN READ SNAP benefits cut off during shutdown, driving long lines at food pantries 3 MIN READ Trump to host al-Sharaa in first-ever visit by a Syrian president to White House, official says 1 MIN READ Kollar-Kotelly echoed comments she made when she granted a preliminary injunction over the issue. The ruling grants the plaintiffs a partial summary judgment that prohibits the proof-of-citizenship requirement from going into effect. It says the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, which has been considering adding the requirement to the federal voter form, is permanently barred from taking action to do so. In a statement, Sophia Lin Lakin of the ACLU, one of the plaintiffs in the case, called the ruling “a clear victory for our democracy. President Trump’s attempt to impose a documentary proof of citizenship requirement on the federal voter registration form is an unconstitutional power grab.” The White House disagreed with the judge’s ruling in a statement late Friday. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); “President Trump has exercised his lawful authority to ensure only American citizens are casting ballots in American elections,” said Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson. “This is so commonsense that only the Democrat Party would file a lawsuit against it. We expect to be vindicated by a higher court.” While a top priority for Republicans, attempts to implement documentary proof-of-citizenship requirements for voting have been fraught. The U.S. House passed a citizenship mandate last spring that has stalled in the Senate, and several attempts to pass similar legislation in the states have proved equally difficult. Such requirements have created problems and confusion for voters when they have taken effect at the state level. It presents particular hurdles for married women who have changed their name, since they might need to show birth certificates and marriage certificates as well as state IDs. Those complications arose earlier this year when a proof-of-citizenship requirement took effect for the first time during local elections in New Hampshire . In Kansas, a proof-of-citizenship requirement that was in effect for three years created chaos before it was overturned in federal court. Some 30,000 otherwise eligible people were prevented from registering to vote. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Voting by noncitizens also has been shown to be rare . The lawsuit brought by the DNC and various civil rights groups will continue to play out to allow the judge to consider other challenges to Trump’s order. That includes a requirement that all mailed ballots be received, rather than just postmarked, by Election Day . Other lawsuits against Trump’s election executive order are ongoing. In early April, 19 Democratic state attorneys general asked a separate federal court to reject Trump’s executive order. Washington and Oregon, where virtually all voting is done with mailed ballots, followed with their own lawsuit against the order. ___ Riccardi reported from Denver."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/","dateOfPublication":"1101-12-20","timeOfPublication":"11:00:00-11:59","title":"News | Today's latest from Al Jazeera","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article outlines a diverse range of global events, including diplomatic disputes between Nigeria and the U.S. over religious violence, a trade conflict between Canada and the U.S. sparked by a political ad, regulatory concerns over a private temple, and large-scale protests in Novi Sad commemorating a deadly railway disaster that has led to sustained anti-government unrest.

(AP) — Former President Barack Obama is encouraging voters to elect Democrats as governor in Virginia and New Jersey in races this Tuesday that could signal the national mood 10 months into Donald Trump’s second presidency and a year ahead of midterm elections that could reshape it. Obama’s appearances on Saturday for Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill contrast with Trump spending the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, leaving Republicans Winsome Earle-Sears in Virginia and Jack Ciattarelli in New Jersey to campaign for themselves. At the same time, California advocates were making a final push ahead of a statewide referendum over whether to redraw the state’s congressional map in Democrats’ favor. The effort backed by Gov. Gavin Newsom is part of a national redistricting battle that began when Trump urged GOP-run states to help him keep a friendly House majority in 2026. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); At an afternoon rally in Norfolk, Obama praised Spanberger, a former congresswoman and CIA case officer, as a hard worker who would improve Virginians’ financial circumstances and quality of life. Yet he focused much of his half-hour-plus on stage lambasting Trump for “lawlessness and recklessness” and “shambolic” economic policy, while urging voters to “set a glorious example for the nation” by rebuking Trump and nominees loyal to him. Related Stories Debate over energy costs fuels clear divide in New Jersey and Virginia governor’s races 5 MIN READ “The stakes are now clear,” said Obama, who remains Democrats’ most popular national figure. “We don’t need to speculate about the dangers to our democracy. We don’t need to ask ourselves how much more coarse and mean our culture can become. Elections matter, and they matter to you.” Obama was scheduled to appear Saturday evening in Newark with Sherrill. Earle-Sears, currently Virginia’s lieutenant governor, and Ciattarelli, a former state lawmaker, had busy schedules of their own to counter Democrats’ large rallies. Ciatarelli’s sharpest closing arguments nodded to Sherrill’s ubiquitous inclusion of her experience as a Navy helicopter pilot and her frequent attacks on Trump. “Her disdain for the president. And she can fly a helicopter. Is any of that going to fix New Jersey?” Ciattarelli said Saturday in suburban Westfield. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Trump isn’t on site, but he’s been in the conversation Trump endorsed Ciattarelli and has said — without naming Earle-Sears — that he backs her Virginia bid. The president conducted a phone rally for Ciattarelli. He has not campaigned in person for either nominee. On Friday evening in south Florida, Trump attended a shindig at his resort with the theme “A Little Party Never Killed Nobody.” On Saturday, he headed to Trump International Palm Beach in West Palm Beach, Florida, and is scheduled to attend a dinner for MAGA, Inc., a super PAC founded by allies. The president is due to return to Washington on Sunday. Trump’s arms-length approach reflects a complicated reality for Republicans: He remains intensely popular among the most conservative voters but has a more precarious standing with the rest of the electorate. Earle-Sears was leading GOP turnout rallies Saturday in Republican-rich small towns, first in Abingdon in the southwest corner of Virginia, then in Purcellville, in the state’s northernmost reaches near the Pennsylvania border. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Ciattarelli was on a bus tour promising to “Fix New Jersey.” In Westfield, Ciattarelli shook voters’ hands and took selfies for about an hour and talked about proposals to lower energy costs and property taxes, among other ideas. His campaign also has concentrated on his family’s deep roots in the state and argued it’s time for a “Jersey guy” to lead the state. Sherrill was born in Virginia. Some of the supporters wore red baseball caps that said “Make New Jersey Great Again,” a nod to Trump’s national “MAGA” slogan. Sherrill and Spanberger were both among the center-left Democrats who helped their party win a House majority in 2018 during Trump’s first presidency. Sherrill has been more pointed in her Trump critiques this fall, while Spanberger has carefully crafted economic arguments to criticize Trump’s policies. She has been more circumspect about his moves to upend democratic norms. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); “Virginia voters can and will send a message amid the recklessness and the heartlessness coming out of Washington,” she said ahead of Obama’s address. She criticized “the political turmoil coming out of Washington right now” and introduced Obama by recalling “a time not that long ago ... when we had a president ... who worked to bring us together instead of tearing us apart.” Still, according to AdImpact data, Spanberger’s biggest advertising investments has gone to spots that try to tie Earle-Sears to Trump. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); The economy and shutdown overshadow the governor’s races Spanberger and Sherrill have both pledged to tackle rising consumer costs and blasted Trump for failing to reduce prices as he promised in the 2024 campaign. In New Jersey, however, Ciattarelli has blamed Democrats for higher energy costs because outgoing Gov. Phil Murphy has been leading the state for two terms. The Democratic candidates have blasted the Republicans’ federal domestic policy and tax cut bill. In Virginia, Spanberger on Saturday repeated her criticisms of Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency and the ongoing federal shutdown — both of which have a disproportionate impact in a state that has more than 300,000 federal employees, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Earle-Sears has tried to pin the shutdown on Spanberger, arguing the former congresswoman should use her leverage with Virginia’s Democratic U.S. senators. Both have voted against the GOP’s spending extension bill as Democrats demand Republicans address looming health care cuts. Additionally, the contests could offer some clues as to whether social issues carry any less weight with voters than in previous elections. Spanberger and Sherrill herald their support for abortion rights, Spanberger doing so in the last Southern state not to impose new restrictions or bans in recent years. Earle-Sears counters with a focus on transgender policies, framing Spanberger as extreme, just as Trump used the issue against Democrat Kamala Harris in 2024. California will have an immediate midterm impact While results in Virginia and New Jersey will be mere guideposts for the 2026 midterms, California stands to have the most immediate impact. Voters there are deciding whether to override a nonpartisan redistricting commission and approve a new congressional map intended to send five more Democrats to Washington, countering a new Texas map drawn for GOP gains. Other states are pushing new maps, as well. Republicans began the current Congress with just a 220-215 advantage in the House, meaning a few seats could determine whether Trump enjoys outright GOP control in Washington for the duration of his presidency or faces a new Democratic majority. ___ Barrow reported from Atlanta.

centre said.\n\nAuthorities in Jamaica said on Saturday that the Norman Manley International Airport in Kingston will be closed. They did not say whether they will close the Sangster airport in Montego Bay, on the western side of the island.\n\nMore than 650 shelters were activated in Jamaica. Officials said warehouses across the island were well-stocked and thousands of food packages prepositioned for quick distribution if needed.\n\nMelissa was expected to unleash punishing rains of up to 76 centimetres (30 inches) on Jamaica and southern Hispaniola – Haiti and the Dominican Republic – according to the hurricane centre.\n\nIt should be near or over Cuba by the middle of the week. The Cuban government on Saturday afternoon issued a hurricane watch for the provinces of Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guantanamo and Holguin.\n\nThe erratic and slow-moving storm has killed at least three people in Haiti and a fourth person in the Dominican Republic, where another person remains missing.\n\n“Unfortunately for places along the projected path of this storm, it is increasingly dire,” Jamie Rhome, the centre’s deputy director, said earlier on Saturday. He said the storm will continue to move slowly for up to four days.\n\nIn Haiti, there were also reports of rising river levels, flooding and a bridge destroyed due to breached riverbanks in Sainte-Suzanne, in the northeast.\n\n“The storm is causing a lot of concern with the way it’s moving,” said Ronald Delice, a Haitian department director of civil protection, as local authorities organised lines to distribute food kits. Many residents are still reluctant to leave their homes.\n\nThe storm has damaged nearly 200 homes in the Dominican Republic and knocked out water supply systems, affecting more than half a million customers. It also downed trees and traffic lights, unleashed a couple of small landslides and left more than two dozen communities isolated by floodwaters.\n\nThe Bahamas Department of Meteorology said Melissa could bring tropical storm or hurricane conditions to islands in the Southeast and Central Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands by early next week.\n\nMelissa is the 13th named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to November 30."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/27/could-covid-19-mrna-vaccines-help-fight-cancer","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-27","timeOfPublication":"07:34:31+00:00","title":"Could COVID-19 mRNA vaccines also fight cancer?","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"New research from the University of Florida and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center shows that mRNA COVID-19 vaccines may significantly improve survival in cancer patients, especially those with advanced or 'cold' tumors. Analysis of over 1,000 patients found that those who received mRNA vaccines before immunotherapy lived longer—survival in lung cancer nearly doubled—and patients with immunologically cold tumors showed the strongest benefit.

What does it mean for cancer patients? And how did the COVID-19 pandemic become the medium for this unlikely discovery?\n\nUnlike traditional vaccines, which used weakened or inactive parts of a virus to trigger the immune system to build a defence, mRNA vaccines deliver a small strand of genetic code known as “messenger RNA” directly into the body’s cells.\n\nThe cell reads this blueprint as an instruction to manufacture a spike protein which mimics that of the virus, and display it on its surface, effectively waving a red flag that alerts the immune system to build a defence.\n\nThe body then creates antibodies and memory cells trained to recognise and attack that protein spike if it ever appears again.\n\nThis is an area of research which has been going on for some years, most notably by paediatric oncologist Elias Sayour, the Stop Children’s Cancer/Bonnie R Freeman Professor for Pediatric Oncology Research at the University of Florida, in the United States.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic presented a particular opportunity to study the implications of mRNA for cancer treatment as the world moved en masse to vaccinate the population.\n\nWhen Sayour’s former student, oncologist Adam Grippin, examined clinical data of more than 1,000 patients treated between August 2019 and August 2023 at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, he found a striking pattern.\n\nPeople who had received a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine within 100 days of starting immunotherapy lived significantly longer than those who received the same medical treatment but did not have the vaccine.\n\nFor patients with advanced lung cancer, the median survival rate nearly doubled if they had the vaccine, rising from 20.6 months to 37.3.\n\nMore strikingly, the survival improvements were most pronounced in patients with immunologically “cold” tumours – meaning that the mRNA vaccine appeared to “wake up” the immune system in patients with these harder-to-treat cancers – turning “cold” tumours into ones the immune system could more easily recognise and attack.\n\nThe researchers noted that their findings were consistent across varying factors, such as different vaccine manufacturers, doses and time of vaccination.\n\nThe researchers also compared the survival rates in a smaller group of patients receiving immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma, the most advanced stage of a type of skin cancer. In the study, 43 patients had an mRNA COVID vaccine and 167 did not.\n\nPatients who did not receive the vaccine had a median survival of just more than two years. By contrast, those who were vaccinated before starting treatment had not yet reached their median survival point more than three years into follow-up, the research found.\n\nThe researchers discovered that mRNA vaccines work like an alarm for the body’s defence system.\n\nWhen the vaccine is given, it puts the immune system on alert, making it more likely to notice cancer cells that it might have ignored before. Once the immune system is activated, it begins to attack these cells.\n\nBut cancer cells fight back. They produce a protein called PD-L1, which works as a shield that “hides” them from the immune system. However, there are drugs known as immune checkpoint inhibitors that can block this shield.\n\nWhen both the vaccine and these drugs are used, it creates the ideal situation – the immune system is active and alert, and the cancer’s defences are down, Grippin explained.\n\nWhile the researchers said that they do not yet fully understand the mechanisms, the findings suggest that mRNA vaccines can be used to re-programme immune responses to cancer.\n\nThese findings are preliminary. If, however, the study is validated in clinical trials, it could have huge implications for the treatment of cancer.\n\n“These vaccines produce powerful anti-tumour immune responses that are associated with massive improvements in survival for patients with cancer,” Grippin said.\n\n“The implications are extraordinary – this could revolutionise the entire field of oncologic care,” said Sayour. “We could design an even better nonspecific vaccine to mobilise and reset the immune response, in a way that could essentially be a universal, off-the-shelf cancer vaccine for all cancer patients.”\n\nGrippen, who co-led the study with Steven Lin, professor of radiation oncology, said his team is launching a Phase 3 clinical trial to confirm the initial results and investigate whether COVID mRNA vaccines should be made part of the standard of care for patients.\n\nIn the mouse experiments, researchers found that injecting an mRNA COVID vaccine directly into a tumour made dendritic cells – a type of white blood cell – more alert.\n\nOnce the dendritic cells picked up on presence of the tumour, they sent out signals that attracted T cells to come and attack it. In some mice, this helped slow the growth of the cancer.\n\nBut there’s a big catch. Not everyone naturally has T cells that are capable of killing cancer cells. For some people, their immune system can tell that a tumour is dangerous, but their specific T cells do not know how to destroy it.\n\nThat’s one reason why immunotherapies – treatments that boost the immune system to fight cancer – work for some patients but not for others.\n\nHaving an mRNA COVID vaccine will not make your body produce new tumour-fighting T cells. What it might do, based on this early research, is make dendritic cells more likely to notice a tumour and effectively deploy the T cells."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/21/what-caused-amazons-aws-outage-and-why-did-so-many-major-apps-go-offline","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"02:23:04+00:00","title":"What caused Amazon’s AWS outage, and why did so many major apps go offline?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A major outage at Amazon Web Services (AWS) began at 07:11 GMT on Monday, October 20, 2025, after a technical update to DynamoDB’s API caused a DNS failure in AWS’s Virginia data center.

at the Amazon Web Services (AWS) on Monday disrupted a large portion of the internet, taking down apps, websites and online tools used by millions of people around the world, before services were eventually restored.\n\nThe hours-long  breakdown  of the cloud system that supports a portion of the internet revealed just how much of modern-life depends on the infrastructure – from banking apps and airlines to smart home devices and gaming platforms.\n\nHere is what we know:\n\nAt about 07:11 GMT, Amazon’s cloud service experienced a major outage, meaning some of its systems stopped working, which disrupted many popular apps and websites, including banks, gaming platforms and entertainment services.\n\nThe problem started in one of AWS’s main data centres in Virginia, its oldest and biggest site, after a technical update to the API – a connection between different computer programmes – of DynamoDB, a key cloud database service that stores user information and other important data for many online platforms.\n\nThe root cause appears to have been an error in the update that affected the Domain Name System (DNS), which helps apps find the correct server addresses. A DNS works like the internet’s phone book, turning website names into the numeric IP addresses that computers use to connect to servers.\n\nBecause of the DNS issue, apps could not find the IP address for DynamoDB’s API and were unable to connect.\n\nAs DynamoDB went down, other AWS services also began to fail. In total, 113 services were affected by the outage. By 10:11 GMT, Amazon said that all AWS returned to normal operations, but there was a backlog “of messages that they will finish processing over the next few hours”.\n\nAt the time of publication, Downdetector, a website that tracks internet outages based on user reports, was still showing problems with platforms such as OpenAI, ESPN and Apple Music.\n\nUpdated look at the total impact of the AWS Outage up to this point! https://t.co/Bgpm1fFGtf   pic.twitter.com/TAAxjagNl6\n\n— Downdetector (@downdetector)  October 20, 2025\n\nA cloud is a way of storing and using data or programmes over the internet instead of on your computer or other physical storage devices.\n\nWhen people say something is “in the cloud”, it means the files, apps or systems are running on powerful computers (called servers) in data centres owned by companies like Amazon (AWS), Google or Microsoft, not on your personal device.\n\nIn this case, AWS allows companies to rent computing power and storage. It supplies the technology that runs websites, apps and many online services behind the scenes.\n\nOne of AWS’s core services is DynamoDB, a database that stores important information for companies, such as customer records. On Monday, Amazon reported that customers were unable to access their DynamoDB data.\n\nAWS is the biggest cloud service provider in the world.\n\nCloud outages are not rare, but they have become more noticeable as more companies rely on these services every day.\n\n“The fallout impacted people across a number of different spheres,” Joshua Mahony, the chief market analyst at Scope Markets, told Al Jazeera. [But] of course this kind of comes with the territory with tech companies; the key is they can resolve it quickly, and it doesn’t cost them a lot of money.”\n\nHe said Amazon would likely weather the storm from the incident.\n\n“You’re looking at something that is relatively contained,” he said. “Amazon Web Services has cornered 30 percent of the market alone. Their users are not going to suddenly jump ship. Their businesses are deeply ingrained.”\n\nThe outage affected dozens of websites, including Snapchat, Pinterest and Apple TV, according to Downdetector.\n\nOther communication apps were also affected including: WhatsApp, Signal, Zoom and Slack; gaming services such as Roblox, Fortnite and Xbox; and places like Starbucks. Etsy also experienced issues.\n\nIn the United States, people were having issues with financial apps too, including Venmo.\n\nSome users said their Ring doorbells and Alexa speakers stopped working, while others could not access the Amazon website or download books on their Kindles.\n\nThe language app Duolingo and creative tool Canva were among those reporting errors on their websites, and several media organisations were hit, including the Associated Press news agency, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal.\n\nBanks, the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, and AI firm Perplexity also reported issues, along with US airlines Delta and United.\n\nWhen AWS had its outage, it was not just Amazon’s tools that were affected. Thousands of other companies that use AWS for storage, databases or web hosting were also hit. These companies include many major apps that rely on AWS to run key parts of their systems.\n\n“Whenever we see these headlines, the first thought that goes through everybody’s mind, that sends a shiver up the spine, is, ‘Is this one of those cyberattacks? Is this a military or intelligence-led thing that has led to this disruption?’ And in this case, it’s not,” Bryson Bort chief executive of the cybersecurity company Scythe told Al Jazeera.\n\n“In fact, most of the time, it isn’t. It’s usually human error.”\n\nAWS  acknowledged  the outage and said engineers were “immediately engaged” to fix the problem.\n\nAWS said it worked on “multiple parallel paths to accelerate recovery”. It also reported that the main issue had been fully resolved, though some users continued to face minor delays as systems recovered.\n\nThe company also said it would publish a detailed post-event summary explaining what happened."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/29/rfk-jr-walks-back-trump-administrations-claims-linking-tylenol-and-autism","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"23:36:41+00:00","title":"RFK Jr walks back Trump administration’s claims linking Tylenol and autism","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"United States Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

I’ll say it. It’s not good.”\n\nKennedy has offered his own sweeping statements about Tylenol and its alleged risks, despite having no professional medical background.\n\n“Anyone who takes this stuff during pregnancy, unless they have to, is irresponsible,” he said in a cabinet meeting on October 9.\n\nKennedy also mischaracterised studies on male circumcision earlier this month. He  falsely  said the studies showed an increase in autism among children who were “circumcised early”.\n\n“It’s highly likely because they’re given Tylenol,” he added.\n\nKenvue stressed in a statement on Tuesday that acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women, noting that high fevers and pain are potential risks to pregnancies if left untreated.\n\n“We stand firmly with the global medical community that acknowledges the safety of acetaminophen and believe we will continue to be successful in litigation as these claims lack legal merit and scientific support,” Kenvue said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/23/tropical-storm-melissa-takes-aim-at-caribbean-islands-on-alert","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"06:29:43+00:00","title":"Tropical Storm Melissa takes aim at Caribbean, islands on alert","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tropical Storm Melissa, the first named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, is moving through the Caribbean Sea and threatening several islands with dangerous rainfall, flooding, and landslides.

Melissa could be ‘catastrophic’ for Jamaica\n\nPeople in Jamaica have been urged to take shelter as  Hurricane Melissa  continues to strengthen offshore, with heavy rains and tropical storm-strength winds already hitting parts of the island.\n\nThe hurricane, which has intensified to a Category 5 storm, was about 160km (100 miles) south of Jamaica on Monday and on course to hit the western flanks of the island early Tuesday. Moving at just 7km/h (4mph), the storm could cut a particularly punishing path, bringing landslides and storm surges as it crawls across the country, officials warned.\n\nStill, on Monday, Evan Thompson, the principal director of the Meteorological Service of Jamaica, said a slight chance remained that the storm could miss the island.\n\n“Of course, all of us are hoping for that and praying for that,” Thompson said. “But at the same time, we have to be practical. Right now, the projected path takes it to the southwestern part of Jamaica, impacting either eastern Westmoreland or extreme western Saint Elizabeth.”\n\nCurrently, the storm is projected to travel northeast across the island, exiting along the coast of Saint Anne Parish, Thompson said.\n\nCategory 5 is the highest on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, with sustained winds exceeding 250km/h (157mph). Up to about one metre (40 inches) of rainfall could hit parts of Jamaica as the storm passes directly over the island, threatening flash flooding and landslides.\n\n“I don’t want to encourage fear or worry, but I do expect you to become concerned about what is taking place,” Thompson said.\n\n“If you think that you are free from [the worst of the storm], think again, because the heavy rains will affect you, the strong winds reaching tropical storm force could still continue to affect you as we go through the day on Tuesday.”\n\nIn an earlier webcast, US National Hurricane Center (NHC) Deputy Director Jamie Rhome said the potential for extreme rain, coupled with the slow speed of the storm, could “create a catastrophic event” in Jamaica.\n\n“You need to just be wherever you’re going to be and be ready to ride this out for several days,” Rhome said.\n\nJamaica’s government ordered mandatory evacuations late on Sunday for Port Royal in Kingston; Portland Cottage and Rocky Point in Clarendon; Old Harbour Bay in Saint Catherine; and Taylor Land, Bull Bay, New Haven and Riverton City in Saint Andrew.\n\n“Many of these communities will not survive this flooding,” Desmond McKenzie, minister of local government, said at a news conference. “Kingston is low, extremely low … No community in Kingston is immune from flooding.\n\n“There is nothing more we can do as a government but to beg and beseech persons to heed the warning. And if it will help, I will go on my knees,” he said.\n\n“This is one bet you cannot win. You cannot bet against Melissa,” McKenzie warned, advising that people could go to more than 650 shelters that are open across the country.\n\nThe AFP news agency spoke with Winston Moxam as he hurried to prepare his home for the approaching storm.\n\n“I lose my roof, I lose a whole lot of things,” Maxim said, adding that he was particularly worried by warnings that the storm could be worse than 1988’s Hurricane Gilbert, which left more than 40 dead in Jamaica and killed hundreds more around the Caribbean and in Mexico.\n\nJamaica’s two main airports, the Norman Manley International Airport and Sangster International Airport in Montego Bay, as well as seaports, were closed.\n\nAfter passing over Jamaica, the storm is forecast to head north and cross over eastern Cuba on Tuesday night, while continuing to bring rains and heavy winds to Haiti and the Dominican Republic.\n\nMelissa has already been blamed for at least four deaths in Haiti and the Dominican Republic this week, as its outer bands brought heavy rains and landslides.\n\nThe Dominican Republic’s emergency operations centre has placed nine of 31 provinces on red alert due to a risk of flash floods, rising rivers and landslides.\n\nThe Cuban government issued a hurricane warning for the provinces of Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guantanamo, and Holguin. It also sent a tropical storm warning to the province of Las Tunas.\n\nAlthough Jamaica is used to hurricanes,  climate change  is making tropical storms more frequent and severe, including by causing heavier rainfall and slower-moving storms, due to warming oceans and air temperatures.\n\nWith a population of less than three million people, Jamaica is responsible for just 0.02 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to data from the World Resources Institute. But as an island nation, it is expected to continue to bear the brunt of worsening climate effects.\n\nSpeaking at the United Nations General Assembly in September, Jamaica’s Prime Minister Andrew Holness urged wealthy countries to increase climate financing to assist countries like Jamaica with adapting.\n\n“Climate change is not a distant threat or an academic consideration. It is a daily reality for small island developing states like Jamaica,” he said.\n\nMelissa is the 13th named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from early June to late November.\n\nThe last major hurricane to affect Jamaica was Beryl in early July 2024, which was an abnormally strong storm for the time of year.\n\nBeryl brought downpours and strong winds to Jamaica as it moved past the island’s southern coast, leaving at least four people dead."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/29/jamaica-declares-disaster-after-monstrous-melissa-ravages-island","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"07:27:00+00:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa hits Cuba after killing dozens in Haiti, Jamaica","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record, devastated the Caribbean, killing at least 32 people across Haiti, Jamaica, and the Dominican Republic.

dozens in Haiti, Jamaica\n\nHurricane Melissa is pummeling the Caribbean island of Cuba after it first caused devastation in Haiti and Jamaica, leading to the deaths of at least 32 people.\n\nTwenty of the reported deaths on Wednesday came after a river burst its banks in the southern coastal Haitian town of Petit-Goave, flooding and collapsing dozens of homes.\n\nThe mayor of the town, Jean Bertrand Subreme, said that people were still trapped under the rubble of their homes.\n\n“I am overwhelmed by the situation,” Subreme said, as he pleaded for help from the government.\n\nThree other deaths were reported from Melissa in Haiti. Eight people were killed in Jamaica, including a baby killed after a tree fell in the western side of the island, according to State Minister Abka Fitz-Henley. One person was also reported to have been killed in the Dominican Republic.\n\nThe storm was one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record when it hit Jamaica on Tuesday, according to the US National Hurricane Center.\n\nAs it crossed Cuba on Wednesday, it weakened to a Category 2 storm from its previous Category 5 classification. It is projected to move into the Bahamas later on Wednesday, where dozens of people have been evacuated from the south east of the archipelago.\n\nJamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness had declared Jamaica a “disaster area” after Hurricane Melissa barrelled across the island.\n\nThe hurricane ripped off the roofs of homes, inundated Jamaica’s “bread basket”, and felled power lines and trees, leaving most of its 2.8 million people without electricity.\n\n“It’s not going to be an easy road, Jamaica,” said Desmond McKenzie, deputy chairman of Jamaica’s Disaster Risk Management Council. “I know persons … are wondering what their futures are going to be like.”\n\nMelissa took hours to cross over Jamaica, a passage over land that diminished its winds, before it ramped back up as it  continued  towards Cuba.\n\nThe governor of Cuba’s Granma, Yanetsy Terry Gutierrez, said that parts of the province, including in the provincial capital Jiguani, were “under water”.\n\nOfficials in Cuba have also reported collapsed houses, blocked mountain roads, and roofs blown off.\n\nThe Jamaican government had lifted the tropical storm warning by Wednesday, but officials are struggling to assess the damage.\n\n“There’s a total communications blockout on that side,” said Richard Thompson, the acting director general of Jamaica’s Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management, referring to the south and southwest of the island.\n\nMcKenzie said that four hospitals had been damaged and one was left without power, forcing the evacuation of 75 patients.\n\nHeavy damage was also reported in Clarendon, in Jamaica’s south, and Saint Elizabeth, in the southwest, where a landslide blocked main roads in the town of Santa Cruz, and winds ripped off part of the roof of a school used as a shelter.\n\n“I never saw anything like this before in all my years living here,” said one resident of the town, Jennifer Small.\n\n“The entire hillside came down last night,” said another, Robert James.\n\nPrime Minister Holness said on Tuesday that his government was mobilising quickly to start relief and recovery efforts by Wednesday morning.\n\nEven before Melissa slammed into Jamaica, seven deaths – three in Jamaica, three in Haiti and one in the Dominican Republic – were caused by the hurricane.\n\nA roof was completely torn off a building at a section of the Savanna La Mar Public General Hospital due to the passage of Hurricane Melissa.

This cold-resistant species is native to the Palearctic, which refers to Europe, North Africa and most of Asia north of the Himalayas. The Culiseta annulata are not known to carry disease but are generally considered a nuisance.\n\n“It has adapted to a rather cold climate, surviving the winter as an adult and then staying in shelter, such as outbuildings and basements. The fly stings but is not considered dangerous to humans as it does not carry any known infections in these areas,” a news release published by the Natural Science Institute on Tuesday stated.\n\nMosquito species that are well adapted to cooler conditions and can survive winters as eggs or larvae do not tend to carry disease.\n\n“Their development is slower, their active season shorter and most tropical diseases cannot complete their life cycle before cold weather sets in,” British entomologist Luke Tilley from the Royal Entomological  Society told Al Jazeera. “Cooler regions, therefore, tend to have mosquitoes but with lower disease risk.”\n\nThere are more than 3,500 species of mosquitoes around the globe, and they can be found in most parts of the world, bar a very few, including Antarctica.\n\nMosquitoes breed in shallow, stagnant bodies of water, which Iceland has in abundance. Despite having many marshes and ponds, however, it has never had a native mosquito population.\n\nThis is because mosquitoes are cold-blooded, which means they thrive in warmer environments. Male mosquitoes also feed on flowers, which thrive in warmer temperatures.\n\n“Warmer air and water speed up their growth, feeding and reproduction and also allow disease‑causing organisms inside them to develop more quickly. Longer warm seasons mean more generations of mosquitoes each year, and changes in rainfall can create new pools and puddles for breeding,” Tilley said.\n\nIceland is generally cold throughout the year. Its average temperature varies from minus 1 degree Celsius (30 degrees Fahrenheit) in the winter to 11C (52F) in the warmest months.\n\nMosquitoes lay their eggs during cold weather, and when the water thaws, the larvae hatch from the eggs. In Iceland, however, water typically freezes and thaws several times a year, making the landscape generally inhospitable for mosquitoes.\n\nBefore mosquitoes were spotted this month, the closest they had come to Iceland was in the 1980s when biologist Gisli Mar Gislason spotted one inside his aeroplane that had arrived at Keflavík International Airport from Greenland. The mosquito is preserved at the Icelandic Institute of Natural History.\n\nGislason told Al Jazeera that more mosquito species are in warm climates than cold, and the greatest diversity of mosquitoes is seen in tropical areas.\n\n“There is one species in Greenland, Aedes nigripes. It is a high Arctic species, and their density is controlled by the abundance of hosts, [such as] muskoxen, Arctic foxes, reindeers, polar bears and humans.”\n\nIn a statement, the Natural Science Institute said it is unclear how this particular mosquito species came to be in Iceland. However, it added: “It is likely that it was transported by freight. It is uncertain whether it has settled here permanently, but everything indicates that it can survive in Icelandic conditions.”\n\nA growing number of new insect species are being observed in Iceland due to a warming climate and increased transportation, the institute said.\n\nThe country is warming at an unprecedented rate. In May, Iceland and neighbouring Greenland experienced record-breaking heat due to a persistent weather pattern that brought unusually warm air from the south. In May, temperatures recorded in Iceland were 13 degrees Celsius (23.4 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the 1990-2020 average – 10 times higher than the average warming of 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) across the world as a whole.\n\nThe country’s glaciers have been rapidly melting and are projected to lose about half their volume by 2100, the country’s Vatnajokull National Park website said.\n\nIncreasingly, “cooler climates can support mosquito development and survival. They can adapt to cooler temperatures up to a certain temperature below which they cannot survive. It depends which mosquito species,” Yaw Afrane, a professor of Medical Microbiology at the University of Ghana, told Al Jazeera.\n\nYes. Warming temperatures are changing how mosquitoes behave in many parts of the world.\n\nAs the planet warms, “vector-borne diseases will move to areas that have been free of them as the climate will be more permissive to disease vectors,” Afrane said.\n\nThe World Health Organization has identified an increase in insect-borne disease as one of the biggest health threats to humans associated with climate change.\n\n“Warmer conditions can allow mosquitoes and the pathogens they carry to survive in new regions, extending the potential range of diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and West Nile virus,” Tilley said.\n\n“International travel, trade and changes in land use also play a part. The key is careful monitoring and preparedness to prevent local transmission.”\n\nIn September 2023, the United Kingdom found the eggs of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in the country for the first time near Heathrow Airport. Then in August 2024, four Aedes albopictus eggs were found at a motorway service station in Kent. No further specimens were found on investigation.\n\nThe Aedes aegypti is responsible for the spread of diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika. Aedes albopictus can also transmit diseases such as dengue and chikungunya.\n\nEuropean countries have reported increasing cases of mosquito-borne illnesses recently. Last year, Italy had more than 200 local dengue cases. France and Spain also reported cases of the disease. This year, France has recorded 500 cases of chikungunya.\n\nWarmer countries that already have high rates of mosquito-borne illnesses are seeing a surge in numbers. In September, Bangladesh recorded the largest single-day rise in both deaths and hospital admissions from dengue fever when 12 people died and 740 new people were hospitalised in just 24 hours.\n\nBesides increasing temperatures, heavy rainfall can also allow mosquitoes to thrive. The rain flushes mosquito eggs, larvae and pupae from areas where they breed to new areas. If rainwater does not drain away properly, it leaves pools of shallow, stagnant water, the ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes.\n\nTilley explained that besides the spread of disease, changing mosquito populations can also create shifts in the ecosystem. “More mosquitoes can benefit their predators such as bats, dragonflies and birds, but disease in wildlife may also rise,” he said.\n\n“A mosquito in a new area will be a prey for predators like fish, waterfowl and insect-eating insects. There is, therefore, more diversity of food for these predators,” Gislason told Al Jazeera, adding that it is difficult to predict accurately what will happen if a mosquito enters a new area. He said, however, that major changes in aquatic ecosystems in Iceland have not been observed yet.\n\nTilley said these shifts in mosquito behaviour also allow insect scientists to study climate change patterns, noting, “Insects like mosquitoes are valuable indicators of environmental change, helping insect scientists track how ecosystems respond to a warming climate.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/1/deadly-temple-stampede-in-indias-andhra-pradesh","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"12:45:57+00:00","title":"Temple stampede in India’s Andhra Pradesh kills at least 9","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A stampede at the Sri Venkateswara Swamy temple in Kasibuga, Andhra Pradesh, killed at least nine people—including eight women and a young boy—and injured several others during a religious ceremony.

leaders have pledged their support for trade and investment that “benefits all”, concluding a summit dominated by  an agreement  between the leaders of the United States and China to call a truce in their trade war.\n\nThe declaration by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) leaders on Saturday came after US President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, earlier agreed to lower the temperature in the heated  US-China rivalry  during a high-stakes summit held on the sidelines of the event.\n\nTrump departed South Korea on Thursday after his talks with Xi, their first face-to-face meeting since 2019, leaving the Chinese leader to take centre stage at the two-day economic forum.\n\nXi, who has cast China as a defender of multilateralism and free trade, told the opening of the event on Friday that countries needed to work together as they faced an “increasingly complex and volatile” global environment.\n\nIn their declaration, the APEC leaders said “robust” trade and investment were vital to the region’s growth, and stressed their commitment to “deepening economic cooperation to navigate the evolving global environment”.\n\nAPEC, whose 21 members include the US, China, Japan and South Korea, will advance economic integration that is “market-driven” and enhance “experience sharing, capacity building, business engagement”, the declaration said.\n\nThe leaders also pledged regional cooperation on artificial intelligence and demographic challenges arising from falling birth rates.\n\nSpeaking before the declaration, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, the summit’s host, warned that economies were navigating an era of mounting global uncertainty.\n\n“The free trade system is experiencing strong turbulence, global economic uncertainty is deepening, and momentum for trade and investment is weakening,” Lee said.\n\nSaturday’s statement notably did not directly reference multilateralism or the World Trade Organization, a reminder of the fraying consensus on free trade amid rising populism worldwide.\n\nDeborah Elms, head of trade policy at the Hinrich Foundation in Singapore, said it was “probably a miracle” that the leaders had been able to agree on a joint statement.\n\n“Given the strong positions of some APEC economies, getting any agreed language into a document was a fraught exercise,” Elms told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Normally, these are wrapped up well in advance. This one hung in the balance to the last minute as officials swapped out wording to find an acceptable compromise.”\n\nXi, who a day earlier held meetings with his Japanese, Canadian and Thai counterparts, later on Saturday joined Lee for their first bilateral summit since the South Korean leader’s election in a  snap poll  in June.\n\nIn opening remarks, Lee expressed hope that South Korea and China would “strengthen strategic communication” to resume dialogue with nuclear-armed North Korea, which has repeatedly dismissed Seoul’s efforts at rapprochement.\n\n“The importance of peace and stability in the region cannot be overstated,” Lee said.\n\nLee also called for the sides to work together for “shared prosperity” as they moved from a “vertical” model of economic ties to a “horizontal and mutually beneficial one”.\n\nXi described China and South Korea as “important neighbours that cannot be moved apart” and “inseparable cooperation partners”, as he called on the sides to manage their differences through “friendly consultations”.\n\nLee has pledged to pursue a more balanced policy towards China than his conservative predecessor, Yoon Suk Yeol, who was impeached for briefly declaring martial law last year.\n\nSouth Korea, like other countries in the region, has had to walk a fine line between the US, its security guarantor, and China, its biggest trading partner.\n\nThe US stations about 28,500 troops in South Korea and is treaty-bound to come to its defence if it is attacked, a legacy of Washington’s support for the country in its 1950-53 war with North Korea.\n\nSouth Korea sent nearly one-fifth of its exports to China in 2024, with the value of its shipments hitting $133bn.\n\nThe US was the country’s second-largest export destination, with shipments of $127.8bn.\n\nSouth Korea’s relations with China have been tested by a series of disputes in recent years, most notably a spat over the US’s 2017 deployment of a THAAD missile defence system in the country.\n\nRob York, director for regional affairs at the Hawaii-based Pacific Forum, said Lee wants South Korea’s most important relationships to “remain stable, which means lowering tensions with China, preventing a drastic decline in US relations and capitalising on the diplomatic heavy lifting his predecessor did with Japan.”\n\n“For now, that will mean striking a friendly note with both Chairman Xi and President Trump, even as he takes steps behind the scenes to lessen dependencies on the US for security and to counter PRC hybrid war operations in South Korea related to maritime issues and technology theft,” York told Al Jazeera, referring to China’s official name, the People’s Republic of China.\n\n“Initial signs suggest Lee is serious about tackling those issues but will try to do so discreetly – there really isn’t much to be gained right now in having those issues erupt in public.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/23/why-has-pakistans-hpv-vaccine-campaign-faced-a-backlash","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"08:09:33+00:00","title":"Why has Pakistan’s HPV vaccine campaign faced a backlash?","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pakistan launched a national HPV vaccine campaign in September 2025 to immunize over 13 million girls aged 9–14, aiming to reduce the high rate of cervical cancer—currently killing eight women daily.

campaign faced a backlash?\n\nIn September, Pakistan launched its first-ever national human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine campaign, aiming to immunise more than 13 million girls aged nine to 14 in its first phase.\n\nHPV is the most common cause of cervical cancer, which kills eight Pakistani women every day, according to Dr Dapeng Luo, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) in Pakistan. The United Nations health agency has set a goal of  eradicating cervical cancer  globally by 2030.\n\nBut the vaccine has met resistance in Pakistan, as conspiracy theories about inoculations have circulated.\n\nHere is more about what HPV is, how it causes cervical cancer, and why the vaccine rollout in Pakistan has faced a backlash.\n\nHPV is a common group of viruses that enter the body via skin-to-skin contact, typically through a cut or abrasion.\n\nThere are more than 100 types of HPV, and they are often spread through sexual contact.  Infection can be hard to identify because many people who have contracted an HPV have no symptoms at all, and it can take many years for cancer to develop.\n\nSome types of the virus eventually cause warts on the genitals or other parts of the body. These may appear flat or bumpy.\n\nMore than 95 percent of the 660,000 cervical cancer cases recorded each year worldwide are caused by HPV, according to the WHO. In Pakistan, more than 5,000 new cases of cervical cancer are reported every year, it said.\n\nSome strains of HPV can cause different types of cancer, such as cervical cancer, vulvar cancer or vaginal cancer. However, cervical cancer typically develops 20 years after the onset of the HPV infection.\n\nWhile the body’s immune system can clear away many strains of HPV within two years of infection, certain strains are more persistent. When the body’s immune system is unable to fight off the more persistent HPV strains, the virus interferes with normal cell growth, causing cells to become abnormal and potentially leading to a pre-cancerous state. If this is left untreated, cancer can develop.\n\nSufferers of cervical cancer do not experience symptoms in its early stages. Hence, women aged 30 to 65 are advised to have a pap smear every three years, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nPakistan’s HPV vaccine campaign began on September 15. While the first phase was scheduled to run until September 27, it was later extended to October 1.\n\nSome 49,000 government health workers – all women – have been trained by the WHO to administer the vaccines across the country. The WHO and Pakistan’s government partnered to conduct this training with funding support from GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, a public-private partnership that works to improve access to immunisations.\n\nIn advance of the first phase, vaccine centres were set up in public buildings such as schools. Health workers also went door-to-door to administer the HPV vaccine.\n\nA single dose of Cecolin, an HPV vaccine developed in China, was administered free of charge. While most HPV vaccines require either two or three doses, WHO confirmed in October last year that Cecolin could be used as a single dose.\n\nIn the first phase of the rollout in Pakistan, girls between the ages of nine and 14 from Sindh, Punjab, Pakistan-administered Kashmir and the Islamabad Capital Territory received the single-dose vaccine.\n\nPakistan’s federal health minister, Syed Mustafa Kamal, said at a launch ceremony for the vaccine on September 16 in Islamabad, “I urge all parents to ensure their daughters and sisters are vaccinated. Do not fall prey to negative campaigns. This vaccine is safe, effective and essential for protecting our girls.”\n\nKamal told Al Jazeera that when the vaccine campaign started, there was a lot of criticism and scepticism towards it. “A few unknown people had spread some fake videos and fake information.”\n\nHe said that during the first four days of the campaign, the response to the vaccine was negative. “The refusals were very high, so much so that there are schools which had committed before [to serve as vaccination centres], but refused our workers entry into the school.”\n\nOn the fifth day, Kamal got his own daughter publicly vaccinated during a ceremony at the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) office in Karachi. During the event, Kamal told journalists: “I have never brought my family into the public eye in my 30-year political career. But to put an end to these baseless rumours, I have taken this step.”\n\nHe said that after this, the refusals went down and acceptances went up. He added that this upward trend of acceptance and vaccine administration continued till the end of the campaign.\n\n“It was noticed that after clarifying rumours, people started to get vaccine. Especially, schools were requesting to send teams as parents were agreeing to get their daughters vaccinated,” Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho, the health minister of Sindh province, told Al Jazeera in a written statement.\n\nThe initial reluctance is why, she said, the vaccination campaign was extended by four days.\n\nThe Cecolin vaccine does not contain the live HPV virus. Instead, it contains recombinant L1 capsid proteins, laboratory-made proteins that mimic the outer shell of the virus but do not have any viral DNA and therefore cannot cause infection.\n\nOther countries have used the US-manufactured Gardasil HPV vaccine, which also does not contain the live HPV virus and contains recombinant L1 capsid proteins.\n\nThe government says that this particular age group of girls was selected per the recommendations of the WHO’s National Immunisation Technical Advisory Groups (NITAGs), responsible for providing evidence-based recommendations for immunisation.\n\n“As per WHO, the immune response generated by the body after the vaccine jab is maximum at this age of 9-14 years, and the child gets the best and long-term protection. Hence, this particular age group,” Pechuho said.\n\n“Currently, the vaccine is available free of cost for 9-14-year-old girls only. There have been talks at the federal ministry level to make this vaccine available commercially so others [boys, women and teenage girls, etc] can benefit, as well.”\n\nIn September, Sana Ali Manzoor and her husband – who say they are strongly in favour of vaccinations for their children – took their 11-year-old daughter to be vaccinated at her private school campus in Karachi after school hours. The whole process took about 20 minutes.\n\nManzoor said she heard about the vaccine rollout via a mobile application operated by her daughter’s school, Haque Academy, which is located in the upmarket neighbourhood of Defence Housing Authority. Parents were invited to register on the mobile app and accompany their children for the vaccination.\n\nManzoor, a lactation specialist who supports new mothers, said approximately 30-40 other children were also present when her daughter received her vaccination.\n\n“So we went to school, and there were two or three tables set up. The health workers were there. They first checked if our name was on the list. After that, we went and got the vaccination done. And then right after that, there was a manual card entry filling that was done, then they gave us the card.”\n\nShe described the process as “very organised”. Manzoor says she was encouraged by friends, including a paediatrician and a gynaecologist, to get the HPV vaccine for her daughter. She has also had her children vaccinated against chickenpox, which she travelled to Dubai to get.\n\nThe rollout has not hit its target, authorities say — though they insist that despite this, the campaign counts as a success.\n\n“Around 13 million girls were supposed to be vaccinated in the first phase of the HPV vaccine campaign. So far, 9.2 million have been vaccinated, which is 78 percent of the total target,” Pechuho said.\n\nIn the southern province of Sindh, the estimated target for the HPV campaign was 4,081,279 girls. Sixty-six percent of the total target was reached, with 2,674,210 girls vaccinated.\n\nThe low take-up is down to a general hesitancy towards vaccines in Pakistani society, experts say. Compounding this, specific concerns about the HPV vaccine have been fuelled by misinformation, particularly online.\n\nThe vaccine will eventually roll out to other provinces, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2026, and Balochistan and Gilgit-Baltistan in 2027. The government has not yet announced when the next phase will begin.\n\n“Every age girl will be vaccinated periodically,” Kamal, the federal minister, said. He added that the government hopes to vaccinate boys and men against HPV once girls and women have been vaccinated.\n\nWhile vaccine hesitancy is a global phenomenon, in Pakistan it was aggravated by the CIA’s use of a fake hepatitis B vaccination campaign in Pakistan’s Abbottabad as cover for a manhunt for fugitive al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.\n\nThe vaccine campaign, carried out in collaboration with a local doctor, was used to covertly collect blood samples to find links to bin Laden and his family. The plan was to compare the DNA of any of bin Laden’s children to that of his sister, who had died in Boston in 2010. The al-Qaeda leader was eventually killed in a military operation in Abbottabad by US Marines in 2011.\n\nIt was never revealed whether the CIA obtained any DNA from bin Laden’s family. However, news outlets at the time said that one source suggested the operation had not succeeded. In 2014, the White House promised that the CIA would never again use a false vaccination campaign for espionage. However, mistrust towards vaccines persisted.\n\nThis was apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic, when vaccines were free, but according to a recent study, 30 percent of people in Pakistan did not want to get vaccinated. An opinion piece, co-written by a Pakistani doctor and published on the website of GAVI, said: “Misconceptions that the [COVID] vaccine could lead to infertility, death or be tied into shadowy foreign agendas circulated rapidly through social media and community gossip.”\n\nManzoor said she has herself noticed “anti-vaxxer” sentiment among some of her clients. She recalled advising a young mother not to bring her unvaccinated newborn into her house, explaining that it is not a sterile environment. The young mother responded, “It’s fine, we don’t believe in such things.”\n\nThe HPV vaccine has faced especially heated pushback in Pakistan.\n\nSome argue that, as HPV is a sexually transmitted infection, it is not required in Pakistan, where consensual sex before marriage is not only culturally frowned upon, but is also illegal.\n\nA Pakistani user wrote on X, “Cerv. Cancer is spread via Sexual contact which is NOT IN PAKISTAN for 9-14 year old – only in west.”\n\nAnother user wrote, referring to the vaccine, “its common in societies where women has multiple sex partners!”\n\nManzoor said that she had her daughter vaccinated because, to her, it made sense to ensure that her daughter remains safe from the virus.\n\n“It’s not even about being sexually active, it’s even about, God forbid, molestation. It’s not always consensual,” Manzoor said.\n\nIn 2023, Islamabad-based NGO Sahil reported that, on average, one child was sexually abused every two hours in Pakistan. According to the  World Population Review , 5,867 rape cases were reported in Pakistan in 2023.\n\nAnother conspiracy theory circulating online is that the HPV vaccine causes infertility. There is no evidence to support this claim. Pakistan, with a population in excess of 250 million, is the fifth most populous country in the world, according to World Population Review. While  birthrates  in the country have declined, much like the rest of the world, Pakistan’s current birthrate is 3.32, well above the replacement rate of 2.1 required to maintain current populations.\n\nIn May 2020, a peer-reviewed US study found no evidence of increased infertility among women who received the HPV vaccine. However, this study was conducted in the US, and the sample was inoculated with a different vaccine – Gardasil.\n\nOther rumours, along with pictures and videos, have spread online. A video which attracted more than 340,000 views on X this year shows girls in school uniforms collapsing, with the caption asserting that these girls became sick after “forced vaccinations”.\n\nIn fact, the video was filmed last year and shows a scene in which police are clashing with protesters over electricity taxes in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Tear gas shells fired by the police are what caused the girls at the school to collapse.\n\n“The vaccine has an excellent safety profile. It has been around for almost two decades now. It doesn’t contain any virus, but the active component is the HPV L1 protein,” Pechuho said.\n\nIn an assessment of Cecolin published last year, the WHO said that “the vaccine was safe and showed a good immunogenicity”.\n\nIt can cause a few mild side effects, Pechucho said. “Most common side effects are related to any other vaccine, like fever, pain at the injection site and, rarely, allergic reactions,” he said.\n\nKamal too insisted that the most common side effect is a fever, which subsides in a day or two with the help of over-the-counter medicines.\n\n“People used to die of diseases like polio and tuberculosis. They’re not dying today because we now have vaccines. People are not dying of COVID because we have vaccines. The world has moved to prevention,” Kamal said.\n\n“The point of an effective healthcare system is to prevent people from becoming patients. And people will be safe from becoming patients when they take preventative measures and get their children vaccinated.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/1/egypt-unveils-grand-egyptian-museum-dedicated-to-its-ancient-civilisation","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"16:11:24+00:00","title":"Egypt unveils Grand Egyptian Museum dedicated to its ancient civilisation","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Egypt has officially unveiled the Grand Egyptian Museum near the Giza Pyramids, a 24,000-square-meter facility housing a vast collection of ancient artifacts, including the full display of King Tutankhamun’s 5,000 items since 1922.

open the long-awaited Grand Egyptian Museum that Egypt hopes will  celebrate the nation’s heritage  and also revitalise its struggling economy and tourism sector.\n\nAccording to a statement from the Egyptian presidency, world leaders – including monarchs, and heads of state and government – were expected to attend the grand opening ceremony in the Egyptian capital, Cairo, on Saturday.\n\nIt described the museum opening as “an exceptional event in the history of human culture and civilisation”.\n\nMassive statues and historical artefacts from the country’s ancient civilisation will be on display across the 24,000 square metres (258,000 square feet) of permanent exhibition space. Two decades in the making, the museum is located near the Giza Pyramids on the edge of Cairo.\n\nPresident Abdel Fattah el-Sisi wrote on social media that the museum will bring “together the genius of ancient Egyptians and the creativity of modern Egyptians, enhancing the world culture and art with a new landmark that will attract all those who cherish civilisation and knowledge”.\n\nThe museum is one of several megaprojects championed by el-Sisi since he took office in 2014, embarking on massive investments in infrastructure with the aim of reviving an economy weakened by decades of stagnation and battered by the unrest that followed the 2011 Arab Spring uprising.\n\nPreparations for the grand reveal have been shrouded in secrecy. Security around Cairo has been tightened ahead of the opening ceremony, with the government announcing that Saturday would be a public holiday. The museum, which has been open for limited visits over the past few years, was closed for the final two-week preparations.\n\nThe government has revamped the area around the museum and the nearby Giza Plateau that holds the pyramids and the Sphinx. Roads were paved and a metro station is being constructed outside the museum gates to improve access. An airport, Sphinx International Airport, has also opened west of Cairo, 40 minutes from the museum.\n\nThe $1bn facility had faced multiple delays, with construction beginning in 2005 but interrupted due to political instability.\n\nFrom the atrium, a grand six-storey staircase lined with ancient statues leads up to the main galleries and a view of the nearby pyramids. A bridge links the museum to the pyramids, allowing tourists to move between them either on foot or via electric vehicles, according to museum officials.\n\nThe museum’s 12 main galleries, which opened last year, exhibit antiquities spanning from prehistoric times to the Roman era, organised by era and themes.\n\nTwo halls are dedicated to the 5,000 artefacts from the collection of King Tutankhamun, which will be displayed in its entirety for the first time since British archaeologist Howard Carter discovered King Tut’s tomb in 1922 in the southern city of Luxor.\n\nThe government hopes the museum will draw more tourists who will stay for a while and provide the foreign currency needed to shore up Egypt’s battered economy.\n\nA record number of about 15.7 million tourists visited Egypt in 2024, contributing about 8 percent of the country’s gross domestic product, according to official figures. Egypt, which has needed repeated bailouts to stabilise its economy, uses the foreign currency it collects from tourism to pay for crucial imports such as fuel and wheat.\n\nThe government aims to attract 30 million visitors annually by 2032. The museum will be open to the public starting from Tuesday, authorities said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/28/record-rains-drive-flooding-in-vietnam-submerging-ancient-city","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"14:12:41Z","title":"Record rains drive flooding in Vietnam, submerging ancient city","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Record-breaking rainfall in central Vietnam, particularly in the historic cities of Hue and Hoi An, triggered severe flooding with water levels in the Huong and Bo rivers surpassing previous historical highs.

top tourism destinations Hue, a former imperial capital, and the ancient town of Hoi An.\n\nOn Tuesday, Vietnam’s disaster management agency recorded more than 1,000 millimetres (39.4 inches) of rainfall over a 24-hour period ending late on Monday in parts of Hue and Hoi An.\n\nVietnam’s National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting said the volume of rainfall in Hue marked the highest ever for a 24-hour period since the country started its record-keeping.\n\nThe newspaper VNExpress reported that water levels in the Huong and Bo rivers, which flow through Hue, reached 5.25m (17.2 ft) on Monday afternoon, shattering the previous historical high recorded in 2020.\n\nAs of Tuesday morning, water levels from both rivers have receded, but Hue remains submerged by more than one metre (3.3ft) of water.\n\nImages showed a wide area of the ancient city, including the palace grounds, under murky waters.\n\nAuthorities in Hue were quoted by the state news agency Vietnam News as saying that the rain and flooding may last until Friday.\n\nThe area was designated a world heritage site in 1993 by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).\n\nThe heavy rain also triggered a massive landslide of red mud on Tuesday morning about 3km (1.9 miles) long in coastal Quang Ngai province, leaving about 1,700 people isolated, authorities said.\n\nAs of Tuesday, more than 8,600 people in four central provinces were evacuated due to risks from severe flooding and landslides.\n\nHeavy flooding has also forced the state-run Vietnam Railways Corp to suspend services between the capital Hanoi and the business hub Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nThe government said in a separate report that more than 306,000 households and businesses in Hue, Danang and Quang Tri provinces were suffering from blackouts.\n\nScientists warn that storms are becoming increasingly powerful as the planet warms due to human-induced climate change.\n\nThis month’s rainfall comes after  Typhoon Bualoi  battered the country in September, leaving at least 13 people dead and 20 others missing.\n\nAccording to the General Statistics Office, natural disasters — mostly storms, floods and landslides — left 187 people dead or missing in the country in the first nine months of 2025, with total economic losses estimated at more than $610m."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/1/israel-still-blocking-most-gaza-aid-as-military-carries-out-more-attacks","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"21:32:41Z","title":"Israel

companies, including Eni, ExxonMobil and TotalEnergies.\n\n“Major global banks are exacerbating climate change and future emissions by continuing to give carte blanche to these fossil fuel companies that are destroying the planet,” said Louis-Maxence Delaporte, energy research manager at Reclaim Finance, one of the NGOs involved in the study.\n\nChina accounts for 43 percent of “carbon bombs”. Russia accounts for 9 percent, the United States for 5 percent.\n\nWestern oil majors  have the most such projects, although Saudi Arabia’s Aramco and China’s CHN Energy produce the most total emissions.\n\nThe report also identified more than 2,300 smaller extraction projects, approved or launched since 2021, whose potential emissions exceed five million tonnes of CO2 each, equivalent to the annual emissions of a city like Paris.\n\nCombined, the potential CO2 emissions from all these projects are 11 times greater than the global “carbon budget” remaining to keep global warming below 1.5C (2.7F) compared with the pre-industrial era, according to the authors’ calculations."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/1/iran-grapples-over-social-freedoms-after-war-with-israel","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"11:39:45+00:00","title":"Iran grapples over social freedoms after war with Israel","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Iran’s moderate President Masoud Pezeshkian has attempted to connect with Gen Z youth by appointing Amirreza Ahmadi as a 'Gen Z adviser,' but the initiative has been met with public criticism for lacking authenticity and youth representation.

about a month ago, posing for a smiling photo with him that went viral online.\n\nThe adviser, Amirreza Ahmadi, told local media that he sees his mission as listening to the youth of Iran, “from Tehran to the borders of this country”, going so far as to share his mobile number.\n\nBut he later blocked commenting on his social media profiles after criticism from users who claimed that Ahmadi did not “resemble” Gen Z Iranians, was using bots to boost his social media accounts, and had no established connection with youth groups or students demanding change.\n\nThe appointment appears to have been part of an effort by the moderate administration, which promised improved social freedoms and lifted sanctions during election campaigns, to connect with younger generations, who have been  driving political change across Asia  and globally.\n\nPezeshkian and his administration have struggled, though – partly as a result of indifference from many young Iranians to their overtures, and partly because many of the Iranian establishment’s more hardline factions have little interest in appeasing the youth.\n\nSanam Vakil, director of Chatham House’s Middle East and North Africa Programme, said the Iranian state is struggling to speak the language of a generation that grew up online and outside its ideological frame.\n\nAs such, she added, its outreach “feels transactional rather than transformative and ultimately is directed to staving off unrest and protests”, while the hardline elite’s fear of losing control outweighs any concern about losing the young.\n\n“That imbalance keeps Iran locked in a politics of repression rather than renewal. I think the system will be locked between conflicting messages, narratives, and policies,” she told Al Jazeera.\n\nMany of the people defying aspects of state controls are Gen Z youth, who are, like most Iranians, also crushed by the deteriorating economic conditions and rampant inflation amid  corruption and mismanagement .\n\nWith Israel and its Western allies openly touting regime change in Iran since the 12-day war between them in June, authorities say they recognise that public support is needed to get the country through difficult conditions, including reinstated UN sanctions and the lingering threat of war.\n\nThis forced some officials, mostly those in the more moderate or pragmatic camps, to advocate for dialling down some controls on social freedoms.\n\nFormer President Hassan Rouhani, a moderate camp leader, last week criticised hardline lawmakers and politicians for advancing legislation opposed by an overwhelming majority of Iranians, in a likely reference to the  contentious issue of mandatory hijab .\n\nThe government has said it will not enforce the law.\n\nIranshahr, Tehran\n\npic.twitter.com/8nIaJAZVAO\n\n— Arash Azizi آرش عزیزی (@arash_tehran)  October 25, 2025\n\nBut, on the other hand,  hardline factions within the establishment  have mobilised to reintroduce as many restrictions as possible.\n\nA video recorded in downtown Tehran went viral online this week, showing young men and women, who disregarded the dress code imposed by the theological establishment, enjoying a street music performance.\n\nAfter years of musicians defying a state ban on street performances, they have become increasingly common, but still face crackdowns if they get too much attention.\n\nAt least one of the band members had their Instagram account closed by Iranian authorities, with the police posting on the account that it was shut down by judicial order due to “publishing criminal content”.\n\nThe authorities have not publicly confirmed whether the band member could face further punishment.\n\nHardline conservative media outlets this week reported another crackdown in Tehran.\n\nTicket sales for a “disco that included naked women dancing with boys” in the Pakdasht area were stopped, and legal cases were opened against organisers, according to the state-run Fars news website, affiliated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.\n\nThis was in reference to an electronic music event that had been running for weeks and was selling tickets legally after obtaining the required permits from the authorities.\n\nDancing in public spaces, especially when done by men and women together, are prohibited and at times, punished by Iranian authorities.\n\nDrinking alcohol remains outlawed, as well, leading to some Iranians purchasing smuggled goods or dangerous homemade products. Alcohol tainted with ethanol and other chemicals continues to  claim dozens of lives each year .\n\nBut some cafes and restaurants continue to hire DJs – and at times, serve alcohol – despite the restrictions.\n\nIn mid-September, authorities permanently shut down a major restaurant located in Tehran’s Nahjol Balaghe Park because a clip showed people dancing to music inside and because alcohol was allegedly served there.\n\nSeveral clothing shops and other vendors have been shut down over recent weeks after they held events where young people danced in attendance.\n\nIn mid-September, authorities also  cancelled a major public concert  at Tehran’s iconic Azadi Tower that was initially conceived by the government as a demonstration of national unity.\n\nThe apparent contradiction between the positions of different factions within the establishment highlights the nature of Iran – with the government not necessarily having the final say in diffferent matters, and other forces, such as the Revolutionary Guard, able to defy government policy.\n\nThe Supreme National Security Council has ordered authorities to stop heavily enforcing the  controversial hijab law , which penalises women and men with prison time, being lashed or paying fines if the state determines their attire is improper.\n\nIran experienced months of deadly nationwide protests in 2022 and 2023 after the death in police custody of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman who was arrested over her hijab.\n\nHowever, some so-called “morality police” vans have been seen in cities across the country, even though Pezeshkian’s government said no budget had been dedicated towards it.\n\nAnother group defying the system in Iran are women riding motorcycles, as the state still won’t issue them motorcycle licences.\n\nThe government introduced legislation to allow women to ride, but it is stuck in a parliament  dominated by hardline lawmakers  after a record-low turnout in elections since 2020.\n\nMore women are riding motorcycles across the country, however, with hundreds filmed recently taking part in group rides in Tehran.\n\nPezeshkian’s government has also failed to honour another campaign promise: lifting  draconian state bans  on almost all global social media and tens of thousands of websites.\n\nThe government this week blamed Israel for the continued imposition of the tough internet restrictions, claiming that the controls would have been lifted had it not been for the June war.\n\nAzadeh Moaveni, writer and associate professor at New York University, told Al Jazeera she does not believe any faction of the state enjoys broad support from the younger generation, as they haven’t been able to offer them anything substantial.\n\n“Pragmatists within the state are just offering their own frustration, which is of zero value, and at best pointing out, as the president has, that he won’t enforce laws that the majority of the country opposes, like the hijab law,” she said.\n\nMoaveni said the dynamic of loosening and tightening of social freedoms by the state to manage society was no longer working, partly due to the changes taking place in society and also because of the dire economic conditions and multiple  ongoing crises reshaping daily life ."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/28/hurricane-melissa-live-category-5-storm-nears-jamaica-strongest-this-year?update=4067201","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"07:34:24Z","title":"Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article discusses Hurricane Melissa, referred to as the 'Storm of the Century,' making landfall in Jamaica.

UN\n\nIsraeli settlers have carried out more attacks against Palestinians across the occupied West Bank, as the United Nations warned that  this year’s olive harvest  is on track to be the most violent in more than a decade.\n\nThe Palestinian official news agency Wafa reported several incidents of settler violence on Saturday, including in fields close to the towns of Beita and Huwara, near the northern West Bank city of Nablus, and in Sinjil, a town near Ramallah.\n\nThree Palestinian farmers also were wounded in al-Maniya, southeast of Bethlehem, after Israeli settlers opened fire on them as they were harvesting their olives.\n\nPalestinians in the West Bank have experienced a surge in settler and military attacks since Israel launched its Gaza war in 2023. But this year’s  olive harvest season , which began last month, has brought an even greater increase in violent incidents.\n\nThe UN’s agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) said on Saturday that October “is on track to be the most violent month since UNRWA began tracking settler violence in 2013”.\n\n“The annual olive harvest is the primary livelihood for tens of thousands of Palestinians, with olive trees deeply rooted in Palestinian heritage and identity,” Roland Friedrich, director of UNRWA affairs in the West Bank, said in a statement shared on social media.\n\n“Attacks on the olive harvest threaten the very way of life for many Palestinians and further deepen the coercive environment in the occupied West Bank,” Friedrich said. “Families should be allowed unhindered access to their lands to harvest their olives in safe conditions.”\n\nAccording to the  latest UN figures , released on Thursday, at least 126 Israeli settler attacks have been recorded in 70 Palestinian towns and villages so far this olive harvest season.\n\nMore than 4,000 olive trees and saplings also have been vandalised, the UN’s humanitarian office (OCHA) found.\n\nMeanwhile, OCHA said that the expansion of illegal Israeli settlement outposts in the West Bank has “further undermined Palestinian farmers’ ability to reach their lands” to harvest their olive trees.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government has been rapidly expanding settlement activity in the shadow of  the Gaza war , drawing condemnation and warnings from the UN and international human rights groups.\n\nFar-right Israeli politicians, including members of Netanyahu’s governing coalition, have also been pushing for Israel to  formally annex  the West Bank.\n\nIn July, the UN human rights office  warned  that escalating settler violence in the West Bank is being carried out “with the acquiescence, support, and in some cases participation, of Israeli security forces”.\n\nSettler and military attacks “are part of a broader and coordinated strategy of the State of Israel to expand and consolidate annexation of the occupied West Bank, while reinforcing its system of discrimination, oppression and control over Palestinians there”, it

The ad, which selectively edited and reorganized excerpts from Reagan’s 1980s speech to suggest he opposed tariffs, was claimed by the US to be misleading and false.

he instructed the recently renamed  Department of War  to “prepare for possible action”.\n\nIn a social media post on Saturday, Trump said the United States would immediately cut off all assistance to the African country “if the Nigerian Government continues to allow the killing of Christians”.\n\nThe US “may very well go into that now disgraced country, ‘guns-a-blazing,’ to completely wipe out the Islamic Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities”, Trump added, without specifying which groups or alleged “atrocities” he was referring to.\n\n“I am hereby instructing our Department

Nigeria is a country with constitutional guarantees to protect citizens of all faiths,” the statement continued.\n\n“Our administration is committed to working with the United States government and the international community to deepen understanding and cooperation on protection of communities of all faiths.”\n\nKimiebi Ebienfa, a spokesperson for Nigeria’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stressed his country’s commitment to protecting all of its citizens.\n\n“The Federal Government of Nigeria will continue to defend all citizens, irrespective of race, creed, or religion,” Ebienfa wrote in a statement on Saturday.\n\n“Like America, Nigeria has no option but to celebrate the diversity that is our greatest strength.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/28/hurricane-melissa-live-category-5-storm-nears-jamaica-strongest-this-year?update=4067258","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"07:34:24+00:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":[],"content":"Published: 2025-10-28T07:34:24+00:00\n\nTitle: Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica\n\nThis live page has now been closed."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/11/1/live-israel-continues-attacks-on-gaza-as-palestinians-fear-return-to-war?update=4076415","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"06:24:47+00:00","title":"Updates: Israel blocking vast majority of Gaza aid agreed under ceasefire","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israel is obstructing the delivery of vast amounts of humanitarian aid to Gaza, despite a ceasefire agreement that had previously been agreed upon.

paramilitary Rapid Support Forces in western Sudan’s Darfur, while thousands more remain missing.\n\nThe capital of North Darfur state was the last Sudanese army stronghold in the vast region before falling to the RSF after 18 months of siege on Sunday.\n\nSince then, the United Nations and international aid agencies  have raised the alarm  over the fate of civilians as accounts of  mass killings , rape and other abuses continue to emerge.\n\nAlkheir Ismail, a young Sudanese man who has fled to the town of Tawila, some 50km (31 miles) away, said he was among a group of 300 people who were stopped by RSF fighters as they tried to escape el-Fasher on Sunday. The fighters only spared him because one of the captors recognised him from his school days, he added.\n\n“There was a young man I studied with, in the university in Khartoum, he told them, ‘Don’t kill him’. After that, they killed the rest of the people, the youths with me and my friends.”\n\nOther Sudanese in Tawila also described the fear they experienced after being stopped by fighters.\n\n“All of a sudden they showed up, from where I don’t know. Three young men showed up, different ages. They shot in the air, and said, ‘Stop, stop’. They were wearing RSF clothes,” Tahani Hassan said. “They hit us hard. They threw our clothes on the ground. Even I, as a woman, was searched. The attacker, he could be younger than my daughter.”\n\nFatima Abdulrahim, who fled with her grandchildren, said she walked for five days in brutal conditions to reach Tawila.\n\n“They beat the boys and took everything we owned; they left us with nothing. After we arrived here, we learned that the girls in the group that came after us had been raped, but our girls escaped,” she said.\n\nRawaa Abdalla, a young woman who fled the city, said her father is missing.\n\n‘We don’t know whether he’s alive or dead, whether he’s with the people who left or if he’s injured,” she said.\n\nIn a speech on Wednesday night, RSF head Mohamed Hamdan “Hemedti” Dagalo called on his fighters to protect civilians and said violations will be prosecuted.\n\nOn Thursday, the paramilitary group, which has been fighting the Sudanese army since April 2023, claimed to have arrested several fighters accused of abuses, but UN humanitarian affairs chief Tom Fletcher questioned the RSF’s commitment to investigating violations.\n\nA high-level RSF commander called the accounts “media exaggeration” by the army and its allied fighters “to cover up for their defeat and loss” of el-Fasher, according to Reuters news agency.\n\nBoth the RSF and the army have faced war crimes accusations over the course of the conflict that has killed tens of thousands of people, forced some 14 million from their homes and created the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, according to the UN. Famine is widespread while outbreaks of cholera and other deadly diseases are on the rise.\n\nMore than 62,000 people fled el-Fasher between Sunday and Wednesday, according to the UN. As of late August, el-Fasher was still home to 260,000 people.\n\nIn a statement on Friday, Doctors Without Borders (Medecins Sans Frontieres or MSF) said agencies operating on the ground estimate that only a little over 5,000 people managed to make their way to Tawila over the past five days.\n\n“Based on what patients tell us, the most likely, albeit frightening, answer is that they are being killed, blocked, and hunted down when trying to flee,” said MSF head of emergencies Michel Olivier Lacharite, calling on mediators the United States, Saudi Arabia, the  United Arab Emirates  and Egypt to intervene.\n\nMSF said every single child under five years old, of the 70 new arrivals in Tawila on October 27, was acutely malnourished, with 57 percent of them suffering from severe acute malnutrition.\n\nSurvivors told the aid agency that RSF fighters separated people by gender, age or perceived ethnic identity, with many remaining held for ransom, with sums ranging from 5 million to 30 million Sudanese pounds (more than $8,000 to nearly $50,000).\n\nAnother survivor reported gruesome scenes of RSF fighters crushing several prisoners with their vehicles, it said.\n\nWe denounce the horrendous mass atrocities and killings, both indiscriminate and ethnically-targeted, that have culminated this week in and around El Fasher, Sudan. https://t.co/YGo84UxEn5\n\n— MSF International (@MSF)  October 31, 2025\n\nThe UN Population Fund (UNFPA), the organisation’s sexual and reproductive health agency, which offers humanitarian assistance in Tawila, spoke to more survivors while protecting their identities.\n\nA 24-year-old man said that of a group of 200 men, women and children, only four people who could pay a ransom ended up surviving four different encounters with RSF soldiers at checkpoints on the way to Tawila.\n\n“The rest were killed. They killed children, the elderly, and women. I cannot describe the scene, it was unbearable to watch people die right in front of you, each with a single bullet,” he was quoted as saying.\n\nA 26-year-old woman said her husband was only able to pay a ransom for her and their children, and was killed in front of them. A 19-year-old girl said she was raped by soldiers after they asked if she was a virgin.\n\nThe UNFPA has also confirmed that at least 460 people were killed by RSF fighters in the el-Fasher maternity hospital on October 29.\n\nThe actual death toll may have been much higher, with patients, visitors, displaced people and healthcare workers among those killed, it said.\n\nIn the nearby state of North Kordofan, the UN estimates that more than 36,000 people have  fled the Bara locality , which was captured by the RSF last week.\n\nThe UN says North Kordofan is likely to be the next battleground between the RSF and the Sudanese army, as state capital el-Obeid remains under army control.\n\n“Reports are also emerging of serious violations in the context of RSF capture of Barra town, including the alleged summary execution of five Red Crescent volunteers. Our human rights colleagues have also received alarming reports of sexual violence,” Stephane Dujarric, spokesperson for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, told reporters on Friday.\n\nMohammed Elsheikh, spokesperson for the Sudan Doctors Network, told Al Jazeera from Manchester in the UK that people fleeing Bara are in very poor health.\n\n“It is a long walk between Bara to el-Obeid city, through very unsafe roads in very difficult environmental conditions. We’re talking a desert, really high temperatures during the day and extremely cold weather at night,” he said.\n\nBara has been a scene of intense fighting between the army and the RSF, with the paramilitary group making advances in nearby areas as well.\n\nIn July, RSF fighters descended on North Kordofan villages and burned them in an  attack that killed nearly 300  people, including children and pregnant women."},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5582617","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"How one legal team is building support for people with cognitive disabilities","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article highlights how a legal team in Los Angeles County, led by lawyer Noah Cox, has formed a neurocognitive disorder unit to address the overrepresentation of individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities in prisons and jails.

2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         A few years ago, Noah Cox noticed something about some of the people he represented in court. They struggled to communicate, think logically or problem solve. \"I wanted to know their account of what happened, and I'd ask them questions. And many of them would struggle with a basic explanation,\" says Cox, a lawyer in the Los Angeles County Public Defender's Office. \"It seemed like they were having challenges related to some sort of intellectual ability.\" What Cox was seeing was indicative of a broader trend: Studies show people with  intellectual and developmental disabilities  are overrepresented in the nation's prisons and jails. He set out to break that pattern, forming a team within the public defender's office known as the neurocognitive disorder team. It's a pioneering effort built on the premise that prison is not always the right place for people with these types of disabilities. 'A cycle of being involved in the system' There are many reasons why someone might experience a cognitive impairment, including conditions such as Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, Down Syndrome, a traumatic brain injury, or an intellectual disability, which can limit learning and everyday tasks. But many of Cox's clients were never diagnosed with any sort of disability. That doesn't surprise Leigh Anne McKingsley, senior director of disability and justice initiatives for The Arc, a nonprofit that advocates for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. \"Often the disability goes unrecognized,\" McKingsley says. \"They could have gone through their school system not ever really passing much, but it never got documented.\" She says it can be easy for people like this to fall through the cracks. That can lead to trouble. Compared to the general population, people with intellectual and developmental disabilities are  more likely to be the victims of violent crimes . But that can go in the other direction, too. \"Often people with intellectual disabilities are misunderstood, and that can lead to this cycle of being involved in the system,\" McKingsley says. A person with this kind of impairment may not understand consequences or be able to discern who's a friend and who isn't. They can be highly suggestible, McKingsley says, and more easily led during a police interrogation. \"They go into a system that doesn't address their disability. They probably come out much worse and more likely to commit more crime or get involved with people that will,\" she says. 'I wasn't aware' Jimmy is 56, and a native of East LA. He's wirey, with tattoos on his neck and glasses that are a little too big for his face. NPR is not using his last name because he and his family worried about the stigma of his criminal record. For as long as he can remember, he has been getting in trouble – with family, with teachers, with the police. \"I wasn't aware of anything, that anything was even wrong,\" he says. \"It took me a while to understand things.\" Jimmy has been homeless, struggled with substance abuse, and been in and out of prison most of his life. He came to Cox's office on a burglary charge. It was a third strike, meaning he already had two violent felonies on his record and would now face a harsher sentence. \"I remember meeting Jimmy,\" Cox says. \"He was trying very hard to tell me something that was very important to him. But I could not understand what he was trying to say.\" Cox asked the judge to appoint a neuropsychologist to evaluate Jimmy. His initial testing showed weak cognitive skills, and an IQ low enough to indicate impairment. \"It became apparent that this was somebody who had a developmental disability, who had not been identified when he was young,\" Cox says. 'They were actually trying to help' Cox, along with a small team of paralegals, interns and social workers, wanted to make the argument that a diversion program, an alternative to prison, would be more appropriate for Jimmy. Being diagnosed with a developmental disability, defined as beginning in childhood, would make Jimmy eligible for California's regional centers, a network that provides support to people with these conditions. Access to such support could improve his chances at diversion. So the team gathered as many records as they could, and interviewed Jimmy's family to get a sense of his childhood. \"They were actually trying to help him. And it was very new to us,\" his sister Sylvia says. Sylvia has always known something was different about her brother. He was late to crawl and speak. He couldn't remember how to adjust the bathtub water temperature. He struggled in school. She says he started getting in trouble with police before he even hit his teen years. \"I think it was a self-fulfilling prophecy for him. The more he was labeled bad, I think the more he became bad,\" she says. After all the interviews and tests, Jimmy was diagnosed with a mild intellectual disability, one he'd had since he was a child. He was 54 years old. 'I'm not frustrated anymore' Skeptics of diversion say they can be too lenient on offenders. But Ricardo Garcia, the public defender who leads the LA County office, says if done right, it can address a person's underlying issues, whether they're related to mental health, substance abuse, or a cognitive disorder. \"You give them purpose and you teach them the skills for self-determination,\" Garcia says. \"It's not telling individuals how to live their life better. It's showing them options so they become aware and can decide for themselves with all the best information available to live the life that most people want to live.\" Jimmy is now a third of the way through his two-year diversion plan. He lives in a group home, attends therapy, and most days he comes to LA's Ladera Park as part of a day program that works with adults with disabilities. His days are looking a lot different than they used to. \"I go to my therapy. I come to this program. I'm busy all the time,\" Jimmy says. \"All I can say is that it offers more than prison has to offer me, because I've just changed my life completely. I don't even use drugs anymore. I'm not homeless anymore. I'm not frustrated anymore. I've traded in my life for a new one.\" \n         \n         Transcript \n         SCOTT SIMON, HOST:   The Los Angeles County Public Defender's Office has an unusual unit, a team dedicated to representing people who have cognitive disabilities. It's built on the premise that prison is often not the right place for someone with this type of impairment. NPR criminal justice reporter Meg Anderson has the story. MEG ANDERSON, BYLINE: A few years ago, Noah Cox started to notice something about many of the people he was representing in court. NOAH COX: I wanted to know their account of what happened. And I'd ask them questions. ANDERSON: Cox is a lawyer in the LA County Public Defender's Office. COX: And many of them would struggle with a basic explanation. And it seemed like they were having challenges related to some sort of intellectual ability. ANDERSON: What Cox was seeing was indicative of a broader pattern. Studies show people with intellectual and developmental disabilities are overrepresented in the nation's prisons and jails. Those are conditions that limit learning and reasoning, like Down syndrome and fetal alcohol syndrome. Without support, a person with this kind of impairment might have trouble keeping a job, living independently, knowing who's a friend and who isn't. Once they're behind bars, they're in a system that isn't built for them. They might come out worse off. Cox wanted to disrupt that cycle. COX: Our team is often the first time that somebody is accurately diagnosed. It is sad to me that a lot of my clients at age 30, 40, 50 are being diagnosed for the first time by the criminal legal system. ANDERSON: It's one of the only public defense teams of its kind in the country, partly, Cox says, because it takes a lot of resources to do this kind of work, which brings us to Jimmy (ph). We're not using his last name because he and his family worried about the stigma of his record. JIMMY: I'm 56 years old. I was born and raised in East LA. ANDERSON: Jimmy is wiry, with tattoos on his neck and glasses that are a little too big for his face. For as long as he can remember, he's been getting in trouble with family, with teachers, with the police. JIMMY: I couldn't control myself. I wasn't aware of my sicknesses. I wasn't aware of anything, really - you know? - that anything was even wrong, you know? ANDERSON: He has been homeless and struggled with drug abuse, and he's been in and out of prison most of his life for various crimes. Cox remembers the first time Jimmy came to his office on a burglary charge. COX: He was trying very hard to tell me something that was very important to him. But I could not understand what he was trying to say. ANDERSON: It was his third strike, meaning he already had two violent felonies on his record. Now he could face a much harsher sentence. After some initial testing by a neuropsychologist... COX: It became apparent that this was somebody who had a developmental disability who had not been identified when he was young. ANDERSON: Cox, plus a small team of paralegals, interns and social workers, wanted to make the case that a diversion program - an alternative to prison - would be a better fit for Jimmy, and that would be easier with a diagnosis. So the team gathered as many records as they could and interviewed Jimmy's family to get a sense of his childhood, including his sister Sylvia (ph). SYLVIA: They were actually trying to help him. And it was very new to us. ANDERSON: Sylvia always knew something was different about her brother. He was late to crawl, late to speak. He couldn't do his paper route on his own. He struggled in school. She says he started getting in trouble with the police before he even hit his teen years. SYLVIA: I think it was a self-fulfilling prophecy for him. The more he was labeled bad, I think the more he became bad. ANDERSON: After all the interviews and tests, Jimmy was diagnosed with a mild intellectual disability. SYLVIA: We always knew it. So it was very validating. ANDERSON: That diagnosis made Jimmy eligible for disability services in California. After a lot of discussion with his family, Jimmy chose to seek diversion in his burglary case, and the prosecutor and judge approved. On a sunny day in LA's Ladera Park, Jimmy is going through his workout routine. JIMMY: I do my pushups right here, like, 50. ANDERSON: Yeah. JIMMY: And you feel it burn, you know? ANDERSON: He comes to this park almost every day with a program that works with adults with disabilities. Lately, his days are looking a lot different than they used to. He lives in a group home, goes to therapy. He's a third of the way through his two-year diversion. JIMMY: All I can say is that it offers more than prison has to offer me, you know? Because I'm - just changed my life completely. I don't even use drugs anymore. I don't - I'm not homeless anymore. I'm not frustrated anymore. I'm just - I traded in my life for a new one. ANDERSON: Each time he got out of prison, he felt like he'd take one step forward, then three steps back. Now with a lot of support, he's viewing his life as a clean slate. And Cox says that's the point. COX: Jimmy himself made a decision that he wanted to invest in his future. This is his opportunity for a real life. ANDERSON: And hopefully, Cox says, he's the last lawyer Jimmy will ever need.

Serbians mark anniversary of deadly train station collapse\n\nTens of thousands of people have marked the first anniversary of a train station roof collapse in the Serbian city of Novi Sad, observing 16 minutes of silence for the 16 victims of the tragedy.\n\nAt 11:52am (10:52 GMT), the time when the incident occurred on November 1, 2024, the large crowd stood in silence outside the railway station on Saturday.\n\n“You could hear a pin drop, it was totally silent for 16 minutes,” Al Jazeera’s Milena Veselinovic reported from the scene.\n\nShe said that the mood was “incredibly sombre” at the event, stressing that the protesters’ aim was both to commemorate the victims but also demand accountability.\n\n“A year on from this disaster, no one has been tried,” said Veselinovic.\n\nThirteen people, including former construction minister Goran Vesic, were  charged  in a criminal case over the collapse, but they have not been tried yet.\n\n“Within the Serbian legal system, those charges still need to be confirmed by a higher court – that hasn’t happened and people here don’t have much faith system in the system that any trial will happen any time soon,” said Veselinovic. “They blame the government and they blame corruption.”\n\nA separate anticorruption probe continues alongside a European Union-backed investigation into the possible misuse of EU funds in the project.\n\nRegular student-led protests have gripped Serbia since the collapse of the canopy at the newly renovated railway station in the country’s second largest city, which became a symbol of entrenched corruption.\n\nProtesters first demanded a transparent investigation, but their calls soon escalated into demands for early elections.\n\nStudents, who called for the “largest commemorative gathering” on Saturday, and others, have been pouring into Novi Sad since Friday, arriving by car, bicycle, or on foot.\n\nThousands  marched  from Belgrade for some 100km (62 miles) and other parts of the country, including Novi Pazar, about 340km (210 miles) south of the capital. It took them 16 days to finish the march.\n\nResidents of Novi Sad took to the streets to greet the marchers, blowing whistles and waving flags, many visibly moved.\n\nPolice said 39,000 people rallied in the city, but according to journalists with the AFP news agency present at the scene and aerial images the crowd appeared to be significantly larger, at around 100,000.\n\nAfter speeches, a choir performance, and a walk through central Novi Sad, thousands lined the bank of the Danube river on Saturday evening to offer the day’s last tribute to the victims.\n\nThe rally ended with 16 minutes of silence, during which 16 lanterns were released from boats.\n\nOn the Petrovaradin Fortress across the Danube, a giant banner was unfurled, reading: “See you tomorrow and every other day until there is justice”.\n\nDijana Hrka’s 27-year-old son was among the victims.\n\n“What I want to know is who killed my child so I can have a little peace, so that I don’t keep going through hell,” she told Al Jazeera.\n\nHrka added: “I am looking for justice. I want no other mother to go through what I am going through.”\n\nThe protests over the station’s collapse have led to the resignation of the prime minister, the fall of his government and the formation of a new one. But nationalist President Aleksandar Vucic has remained defiantly in office.\n\nVucic has denied accusations and regularly labelled demonstrators as foreign-funded coup plotters, while members of his SNS party pushed conspiracy theories, claiming that the train station roof collapse may have been an orchestrated attack.\n\nBut in a televised public address on Friday, Vucic made a rare gesture and apologised for saying things that, he said, he now regretted.\n\n“This applies both to students and to protesters, as well as to others with whom I disagreed. I apologise for that,” Vucic said and called for dialogue.\n\nThe government declared Saturday a day of national mourning while the head of the Serbian Orthodox Church (SPC), Patriarch Porfirije, presided over a memorial service for the victims at the Belgrade Saint Sava church.\n\nIt was attended by several hundred people, including government ministers and Vucic. Several thousand others gathered in front of the church and lit candles for the victims.\n\n“On this sad anniversary, we appeal to everyone … to act with restraint, to de-escalate tensions and to avoid violence,” the EU delegation in Serbia said in a statement.\n\nAleksandar Popov, a Serbian political analyst, told Al Jazeera that “sky-high” corruption is a major issue in the country that needs to be addressed.\n\n“We’re not talking about tens of millions of euros, but hundreds of millions of euros spun through large infrastructure projects, perhaps billions of euros,” he said.\n\n“This government and the president have captured all key institutions of state, like the judiciary,” he added.\n\nThe EU’s enlargement commissioner Marta Kos posted on X that the “tragedy is changing Serbia”.\n\n“It moved masses to stand for accountability, free expression and inclusive democracy. They are the same values to lead Serbia into the EU.”\n\nSerbia is formally seeking to join the EU, but the accession process has been stalled because Vucic has nurtured close ties with Russia and China, while being accused of clamping down on democratic freedoms.\n\nThe protests have remained largely peaceful, but, in mid-August, they  degenerated  into violence that protesters blamed on heavy-handed tactics by government loyalists and police."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/1/two-more-suspects-charged-over-louvre-heist","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"19:02:17+00:00","title":"Two more suspects charged over Louvre heist","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a major security breach, two more individuals have been charged in connection with a daylight heist at the Louvre Museum in Paris, where thieves stole high-value imperial jewelry including a crown and a necklace linked to Empress Eugenie and Empress Marie-Louise.

prosecutor says two more people have been handed preliminary charges for their alleged involvement in a recent  jewel heist  at France’s Louvre Museum, days after they were arrested by Paris police as part of a sweeping probe.\n\nParis Public Prosecutor Laure Beccuau said in a statement on Saturday that a 37-year-old suspect was charged with theft by an organised gang and criminal conspiracy, while the other, a 38-year-old woman, is accused of being an accomplice.\n\nBoth have been incarcerated and both denied involvement, said Beccuau.\n\nThe male suspect has been placed in pre-trial detention pending a hearing to take place in the coming days, said the prosecutor, adding that he had been known to the judicial authorities for previous theft offences.\n\nBeccuau justified the detention of the woman, who lives in the French capital’s northern suburb of La Courneuve, on the grounds of a “risk of collusion” and “disturbance of public order”.\n\nThe woman’s lawyer, Adrien Sorrentino, told reporters his client is “devastated” because she disputes the accusations.\n\n“She does not understand how she is implicated in any of the elements she is accused of,” he said.\n\nFive people were arrested  by Paris police on Wednesday in connection with the case, including one who was identified by his DNA at the crime scene. Three of them have been released without charges, Beccuau said. Seven people have been arrested in total.\n\nLast month, thieves wielding power tools raided the Louvre, the world’s most visited art museum, in broad daylight, taking just seven minutes to steal jewellery worth an estimated $102m.\n\nFrench authorities initially announced the arrest of two male suspects over the Louvre robbery.\n\nThe two men were charged with theft and criminal conspiracy after “partially admitting to the charges”, Beccuau said this week.\n\nThey are suspected of being the two who broke into the gallery while two accomplices waited outside.\n\nBoth lived in the northeastern Paris suburb of Aubervilliers.\n\nOne is a 34-year-old Algerian national living in France, who was identified by DNA traces found on one of the scooters used to flee the heist. The second man is a 39-year-old unlicensed taxi driver.\n\nBoth were known to the police for having committed thefts.\n\nThe first was arrested as he was about to board a plane for Algeria at Paris Charles de Gaulle airport.\n\nThe second was apprehended shortly after near his home, and there was no evidence to suggest that he was planning to go abroad, prosecutors said.\n\nThe stolen loot remains missing.\n\nThe thieves dropped a diamond- and emerald-studded crown that once belonged to Empress Eugenie, the wife of Napoleon III, as they escaped.\n\nThe burglars made off with eight other items of jewellery.\n\nAmong them are an emerald-and-diamond necklace that Napoleon I gave his second wife, Empress Marie-Louise, and a diadem that once belonged to the Empress Eugenie, which is dotted with nearly 2,000 diamonds.\n\nLast week, the Louvre director  told the French Senate  the museum’s security operations “did not detect the arrival of the thieves soon enough”.\n\n“Today we are experiencing a terrible failure at the Louvre, which I take my share of responsibility in,” the director said, adding that she submitted her resignation to Culture Minister Rachida Dati, who turned it down."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/tag/science-and-technology/","dateOfPublication":"2910-12-20","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00Z","title":"Science and Technology | Today's latest from Al Jazeera","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article highlights a range of global developments in science and technology, including public health initiatives like HPV vaccination in Pakistan, climate-related environmental shifts such as mosquitoes invading Iceland, digital infrastructure challenges like an AWS cloud outage, and growing concerns over AI-driven misinformation and data privacy.

Major-General Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi, has resigned after admitting to leaking footage showing the gang rape of a prisoner at the Sde Teiman prison facility in August last year.\n\nThe video of the rape had originally been  leaked  to the press in early August in the midst of a right-wing backlash following the arrest of a number of soldiers for the rape of a Palestinian prisoner.\n\nIn her resignation statement on Friday, Tomer-Yerushalmi blamed pressure from the right-wing on her rape investigation for her decision to leak the footage, claiming that she was countering “false propaganda directed against the military law enforcement authorities”.\n\nIn the leaked footage, soldiers can be seen grabbing and leading away a blindfolded Palestinian prisoner before surrounding him with riot shields to obscure the rape.\n\n“For 15 minutes, the accused kicked the detainee, stomped on him, stood on his body, hit him and pushed him all over his body, including with clubs, dragged his body along the ground, and used a taser gun on him, including on his head,” the original indictment stated.\n\nAccording to medical information obtained by the Israeli daily Haaretz, the victim suffered a ruptured bowel, severe anal and lung injuries, and broken ribs as a result of the assault. He later required surgery.\n\nAt least nine soldiers were detained in connection with the man’s rape. All but five were released relatively quickly.\n\nIn February, the remaining soldiers were indicted for “severely abusing” the detainee, but not raping him. The trial is ongoing.\n\nA United Nations commission, reviewing the change of indictment and other instances of Israel’s use of sexual and gender-based violence, determined that the decision to downgrade the indictments, despite the evidence, “will inevitably result in a more lenient punishment” if there is a conviction.\n\nBecause they determined that doing so was somehow unpatriotic.\n\nA  number  of Israel’s far-right politicians, including Heritage Minister Amichai Eliyahu, were among those who stormed the Sde Teiman prison in protest at the arrest of the soldiers for rape.\n\nIsrael’s hard-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir appeared to address Tomer-Yerushalmi directly in July 2024, writing in Hebrew, “The Military Advocate General, take your hands off the reservists!” he said, referring to the soldiers accused of rape.\n\nBen-Gvir’s fellow traveller on the far-right, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, was equally active on social media at the time, writing that the alleged rapists should be treated like “heroes, not villains”.\n\nReturning to social media during the furore following the rape, Smotrich chose to ignore the credible accusations of rape and instead called for “an immediate criminal investigation to locate the leakers of the trending video that was intended to harm the reservists and that caused tremendous damage to Israel in the world, and to exhaust the full severity of the law against them”.\n\nMany of the loudest voices in defending the alleged rapists were equally vocal in welcoming the resignation of the woman responsible for sharing evidence of that rape.\n\nWriting on social media hours after Tomer-Yerushalmi’s resignation, Smotrich accused her and much of Israel’s judicial system of rank corruption, as well as launching what he called an “anti-Semitic blood libel” against their military.\n\nBen-Gvir was no less critical of Israel’s judicial system in the leaking of the footage, writing: “All those involved in the affair must be held accountable.”\n\nBoth ministers are active supporters of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s ongoing attempts to  weaken the judiciary  and reduce its political oversight.\n\nAt least 135 of the  mutilated bodies  returned to Palestinian officials in Gaza by Israel last week as part of the Gaza ceasefire deal, had been held at Sde Teiman, documents that accompanied each corpse showed.\n\nSeveral of the bodies had been left with blindfolds on, and some had their hands still tied behind their back. One had a rope around its neck.\n\nThe same UN report that examined the reduced indictment against the soldiers also noted that detainees at Sde Teiman – including children – were regularly shackled, forced into stress positions, denied toilets and showers and beaten.\n\nSome were subjected to sexual violence, including the insertion of objects, electric shocks and rape."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/30/jamaica-haiti-and-cuba-take-stock-after-hurricane-melissa-destruction","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"07:33:17+00:00","title":"Jamaica, Haiti and Cuba take stock after Hurricane Melissa destruction","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, a Category 5 storm, devastated the northern Caribbean, killing at least 34 people across Jamaica, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic, with the highest toll in Haiti’s Petit-Goave and severe damage in Jamaica’s western parishes.

Jamaica, Cuba and Haiti.\n\nThe hurricane – at Category 5, the  strongest  on record to hit Jamaica directly – ripped across the Caribbean islands on Tuesday and Wednesday, killing at least 25 people in Haiti, eight in Jamaica and one in the Dominican Republic.\n\nThe United States-based National Hurricane Center said early on Thursday that Melissa’s eye was expected to move away from the southeastern and central Bahamas before passing west of Bermuda.\n\nAlthough the storm was downgraded to Category 1, the lowest strength on the Saffir-Simpson scale, it was still packing winds of 155km/h (100mph) with even higher gusts, the NHC reported.\n\nIn Haiti, where roughly 12,000 people remained in emergency shelters, families grappled with the rising death toll. Twenty people were reported dead in the southern coastal town of Petit-Goave alone, where a river burst its banks and collapsed dozens of homes.\n\nResident Steven Guadard told The Associated Press news agency that Melissa killed his entire family: “I had four children at home: a one-month-old baby, a seven-year-old, an eight-year-old and another who was about to turn four.”\n\nAlthough no deaths were tallied in Cuba, more than 735,000 evacuated residents slowly returned home as the military helped to rescue people in isolated communities.\n\nRecovery efforts were rolling out across Jamaica’s western parishes, where Melissa ripped roofs from homes, felled trees, flooded hospitals, and cut off electricity and water.\n\nYet even as Prime Minister Andrew Holness pledged a “credible and strong” recovery strategy, residents pleaded for help.\n\nSylvester Guthrie, a resident of the hard-hit parish of St Elizabeth, was left with only his bicycle.\n\n“I don’t have a house now,” Guthrie told the AP. Although he has land in another location, he said, “I am going to need help.”\n\nThe centre of Melissa did not cross over Jamaica’s capital, Kingston, allowing emergency relief flights ferrying water, food and other supplies to start landing at Norman Manley International Airport after it reopened late on Wednesday.\n\nAs the prime minister took a helicopter tour of the damage, the Jamaica Public Service utility kicked off a damage assessment as the majority of the island’s 2.8 million residents were left without electricity. It warned them to avoid downed power lines “at all costs”.\n\nTo the island’s west, parishes, including St James and St Elizabeth, were rocked by torrential floodwaters, powerful winds and landslides.\n\nIn the historic port town of Black River, the hurricane levelled homes, destroyed historic buildings and flooded medical care facilities, destroying the “entire infrastructure”, Holness said in a video update from the town.\n\nTo the north, heavy construction equipment crawled through the mud-soaked streets of St James Parish to clear blockages and push aside felled trees.

their losses and the long road to recovery on Friday.\n\nMore than 60 percent of Jamaica remains without power, and nearly half of its water systems are offline.\n\nIn the historic seaside town of Black River, in southwest Jamaica, up to 90 percent of all structures were left without roofs, while the storm also snapped power lines and toppled concrete structures.\n\n“People are hungry,” said Monique Powell as she stood watch over a stash of groceries and household items for herself and a group of residents from Greenfield, one of many hurricane-torn communities on the outskirts of Black River.\n\n“Everything is gone,” said Michelle Barnes as she and her 13-year-old daughter secured their portion of handouts from local food establishments that were giving away their goods, many of which had become water-soaked and damaged.\n\nThe storm, one of the most powerful ever recorded, was made four times more likely because of human-caused climate change, according to a study by Imperial College London.\n\nJamaica’s Information Minister Dana Morris Dixon told a briefing that authorities had “quite credible” reports of a potential five additional deaths, but had not yet been able to confirm.\n\n“We’re still at 19 confirmed, but we do expect that will change today,” she said.\n\nIn nearby Haiti, authorities reported at least 31 people killed and 21 others missing, mostly in the country’s southern region. More than 15,800 people also remained in shelters.\n\nNo deaths were reported in Cuba as of Friday, where the civil defence evacuated more than 735,000 people across the eastern part of the island and where dangerous flooding continued in some areas on Friday.\n\nAlthough the full cost of Jamaica’s recovery is not yet known, the Caribbean country has allocated money for disaster response, including through a unique catastrophe bond arrangement with the World Bank.\n\nDixon said the bond, issued in 2024, provides Jamaica with $150m in financial protection for four hurricane seasons.\n\n“This bond, which provides payouts in the event of natural disasters until 2027, has been triggered by Hurricane Melissa,” she said on Friday.\n\nJamaica is  among many countries calling on wealthy nations to  increase climate financing  to help cover  the costs of climate-induced disasters.\n\nMeanwhile, Jamaica’s Minister of Science, Energy and Technology Andrew Wheatley said that the country “deeply appreciates the global outpouring of support” in the wake of Melissa, but urged potential donors to be wary of scams and use the official government portal for donations.\n\nCuba was working on Friday to rescue residents still stranded by unprecedented floodwaters in the wake of Melissa.\n\nThe Cauto River overflowed its banks shortly after the Hurricane slammed into Cuba as a dangerous Category 3 hurricane, bringing upwards of 380mm (15 inches) of rain to some areas of the eastern end of the island.\n\nEmergency workers on Friday waded waist-deep in wetsuits and used boats and military vehicles to rescue residents from the still-rising waters of the country’s longest river.\n\nRio Cauto resident Eduardo Verdecia, 83, said he and his family had expected the river to subside, but continuing rains, plus run-off from nearby mountains and a fast-rising reservoir, had surprised them.\n\n“When night fell, we thought it would go down. But look at it now – and it’s still raining,” Verdecia said, indicating brown water that had inundated his house to near roof level."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gjjyvg1nqo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"23:14:42.657+00:00","title":"Shein accused of selling childlike sex dolls in France","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Shein, a major Asian fast fashion brand, has been accused by France's consumer watchdog, the DGCCRF, of selling sex dolls with a childlike appearance on its website, which the watchdog claims suggests child pornography content.

The men jailed for vandalism in French hybrid warfare case\n\nThis week's trial of three undercover operatives, accused of helping the Kremlin to wage a hybrid warfare campaign to \"destabilise\" France, sounds like a surefire recipe for drama, sophistication, and intrigue.\n\nIf only.\n\nOver the course of three days, in a spacious, pine-panelled courtroom on the northern edge of Paris, the case against three seemingly unremarkable Bulgarian men, seated behind glass and shadowed by three police officers who seemed absorbed with their own mobile phones, unfolded with all the panache and excitement of a half-whispered lecture in a library.\n\n\"I had absolutely no idea where we were.\"\n\n\"I did it for the money.\"\n\n\"In the future I plan to get involved in charity work.\"\n\nThese few lines from the men's testimony may help convey the general tone.\n\nAll three were jailed on Friday for two to four years.\n\nBut to bemoan the barely audible banality of it all – the dull motives, the mumbled attempts to shift blame, the sullen complaints about prison life and unsatisfactory psychiatric evaluations - is to miss the truth.\n\nThe banality is the whole point.\n\nLike the cheap drones that both Russia and Ukraine now use to patrol their front lines, the three men on trial in courtroom 2.01 at the Palais de Justice in Paris represent a low-budget evolution of modern hybrid warfare.\n\nImprovised and startlingly effective.\n\nRising in turn inside their glass cage, Georgi Filipov, Nikolay Ivanov and Kiril Milushev admitted carrying out the acts, but denied working for a foreign power as well as antisemitism.\n\nEarly one morning in May 2024, on the banks of the River Seine in the heart of Paris, the three men conspired to spray red paint - and filmed themselves doing so - on the Wall of the Righteous, a monument to those who saved French Jews from the Holocaust during World War Two.\n\nThirty-five red handprints were left on the Shoah memorial. Five hundred more were painted elsewhere.\n\nIt was the first in a series of symbolic attacks in France: pigs' heads placed outside mosques (an act blamed on a group of Serbians); coffins left ominously by the Eiffel Tower; Stars of David painted around the capital.\n\nNews of each event was swiftly broadcast around the world – not just by regular media outlets, but by the automated army of Russian social media trolls which, according to the French agency monitoring such activity, routinely seeks to weaponise each sliver of news that might raise doubts about the stability of French society, and the strength of Europe's democracies, its institutions, and its values.\n\nFrance is seen as a particularly tempting target for the Kremlin, given its current political and social divisions, its often ambiguous attitude to Nato, its large Muslim and Jewish populations, the increasing popularity of the far right, and a history of close ties to Moscow on both extremes of the political spectrum.\n\nIn another era, the Kremlin might have used its own deep undercover agents to carry out acts of sabotage or vandalism.\n\nBut – to make the drone warfare comparison again – why rely solely on valuable assets like highly trained spies, giant ballistic missiles, or submarines used to cut undersea cables, when for a few thousand euros you can, through discreet and easily deniable channels, recruit your own disaffected army of petty criminals, or unemployed wannabe fascists?\n\n\"I had absolutely no idea where we were,\" said Georgi Filipov, as he tried to play down his alleged role in the \"red hands\" operation, arguing that he had travelled from Bulgaria simply to make a little money to help with child support payments for his nine-year-old son.\n\nHe was allegedly paid €1,000 (£875) plus travel expenses.\n\nIn the dock, Filipov, 36, cut a gaunt but muscular figure, twitching slightly like a boxer before a fight as he attempted to defuse awkward questions about his tattoos. In particular, the swastika on his chest and the social media photos showing him giving a Nazi salute and wearing a t-shirt that claimed Hitler \"was right\".\n\n\"I made bad choices in the past,\" Filipov explained, and pointed out that he had already removed several tattoos.\n\nThe Paris criminal court sentenced him to two years in jail.\n\nHaving been successfully extradited from Bulgaria and Croatia to face trial in France, the men all sought to place the blame on a fourth man, Mircho Angelov, who remains at large but is alleged to have links to a Russian intelligence officer. He was given a three-year term in absentia.\n\nThe second defendant, Kiril Milushev, 28, said he had only come to France because he had broken up with his partner, was struggling with a bipolar disorder, and wanted to keep his friend, Mircho, company. He was given two years.\n\nSeated beside Milushev, Nikolay Ivanov creased his forehead as he denied any links with Russia.\n\nHe spoke of his grandparents' role in saving Jews during World War Two and said his ambition now was to obtain a master's degree in law, and to be reunited with his girlfriend - if she'd still have him, when all this was over.\n\nConsidered the mastermind behind the plot, he was given the heaviest jail term of four years.\n\nAs for Russia's alleged role in the red-hands affair, even the defence lawyers openly admitted that \"we suspect\" Moscow's hand.\n\nBut they insisted, as did their clients, that they were unwitting pawns, proxies – one might even say \"drones\" – in a shadow war against the West."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3dnnpvjkjvo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"10:49:44.904+00:00","title":"Andrew should answer Jeffrey Epstein questions in US, Democrats say","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, brother of King Charles III, is facing intense scrutiny over his alleged ties to Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender.

Andrew has always denied wrongdoing.\n\nAt least four Democrat members of the House Oversight Committee have since renewed their calls for Andrew to testify - although the panel is controlled by Republicans, who have not indicated they would support the move.\n\nCongressman Suhas Subramanyam told the BBC: \"If he wants to clear his name, if he wants to do right by the victims, he will come forward\".\n\nAndrew could appear remotely, have a lawyer present and could speak to the panel privately, Subramanyam said.\n\n\"Frankly, Andrew's name has come up many times from the victims,\" he told Radio 4's Today programme on Saturday.\n\n\"So he clearly has knowledge of what happened and we just want him to come forward and tell us what he knows.\"\n\nHe added: \"No matter who it is - American or not - everyone should be looked at.\"\n\nFellow committee member   Raja Krishnamoorthi told BBC Newsnight he would be willing to formally summon Andrew   with a subpoena - although he conceded this would be difficult to enforce while he was outside of the US.\n\nHe said on Friday: \"However, if Andrew wishes to come to the United States or he's here, then he's subject to the jurisdiction of the US Congress, and I would expect him to testify.\"\n\nHe added: \"At the end of the day, we want to know exactly what happened, not just to give justice to the survivors, but to prevent this from ever happening again.\"\n\n\"Come clean. Come before the US Congress, voluntarily testify. Don't wait for a subpoena. Come and testify and tell us what you know.\"\n\nCongressman Stephen Lynch also told the BBC hearing from Andrew \"might be helpful in getting justice for these survivors\" but said the committee would be unable to subpoena him \"as the situation stands\".\n\nMeanwhile, Liz Stein - one of Epstein's accusers - said Andrew should \"take some initiative\" and help US investigators.\n\nShe told BBC Breakfast on Saturday: \"A lot of us are curious as to why he's unwilling to cooperate and be questioned about his involvement with Epstein.\"\n\n\"If he has nothing to hide, then why is he hiding?\"\n\n\"We know he had a longstanding friendship with Epstein and that he was in his social circle - so he may have seen things during his involvement with Epstein that he could speak to.\"\n\nAnother of Epstein's accusers, Anouska De Georgiou, likewise told Newsnight Andrew should appear before Congress, saying \"it would be appropriate for him to be treated the same as anybody else would be treated\".\n\nIt comes after UK trade minister Chris Bryant told the BBC Andrew should go to the US to answer questions about Epstein's crimes if invited, \"just as with any ordinary member of the public\".\n\nMeanwhile, the police watchdog said it had approached the Metropolitan Police to ask whether there are matters it should be looking into, in light of media reports about Andrew.\n\nThe Independent Office for Police Conduct said it had contacted Scotland Yard's Directorate of Professional Standards last week - which oversees internal investigations into misconduct - and had not yet received any referrals.\n\nReports  emerged  in mid-October that Andrew sought to obtain personal information about his accuser Virginia Giuffre through his police protection in 2011. He has not commented on the reports, while the Metropolitan Police previously said it was \"actively\" looking into them.\n\nSeparately, new court documents published in the US on Friday showed that Andrew  wrote in an email in 2010  that it would be \"good to catch up in person\" with Epstein, after he was released from prison for soliciting prostitution from a minor.\n\nThe pair were then pictured together in Central Park in New York in December 2010, in a meeting that Andrew later told the BBC was to break off their friendship.\n\nAndrew's ties to Epstein were at the centre of Thursday's decision, with the Palace  announcement  stating: \"These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him.\"\n\n\"Their Majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse.\"\n\nIn recent weeks, pressure had increased on the monarchy to resolve the issue of Charles's brother.\n\nIn early October, emails which re-emerged from 2011 showed Andrew in contact with Epstein months after he claimed their friendship had ended.\n\nA posthumous memoir by Virginia Giuffre was also released - repeating allegations that, as a teenager, she was forced to have sex with Andrew on three separate occasions, claims he has always denied.\n\nAnd earlier this week, the King was heckled about the matter.\n\nAlthough Andrew denies the accusations, the Royal Family considers there have been \"serious lapses of judgement\" in his behaviour.\n\nAs well as losing his titles and honours, he was ordered to move out of his Windsor mansion - Royal Lodge - and into a property on the King's Norfolk estate, paid for by the monarch.\n\nThe BBC understands that he will not have to move out immediately, and could move to Sandringham as late as the new year.\n\nOn Saturday, a black Land Rover with a number plate ending DOY was seen leaving Bishops Gate near Royal Lodge just before 08:00 GMT.\n\nOnly a driver was in the vehicle as it left the grounds of Windsor Great Park. Andrew has previously been pictured driving a vehicle with the same private number plate."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clykwk9vwryo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"07:20:14.475+00:00","title":"The 'silver influencers' taking TikTok and Instagram by storm","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the rise of 'silver influencers' — older women, particularly aged 50 and above — who are increasingly using platforms like Instagram and TikTok to share fashion, lifestyle, and personal content.

officially the scariest night of the year and, while everyone in Hollywood and beyond has been showing off their elaborate costumes, there is one party we're all watching.\n\nHeidi Klum has cemented her place as the official Queen of spooky season thanks to her wild, weird and wonderful costumes and her annual bash that attracts celebrities across the globe.\n\nShe had kept fans on their toes all day, dropping snippets of her costume on Instagram in the lead up to her party - despite being one of the last arrivals of the night - and she did not disappoint.\n\nFollowing her notorious worm and peacock costumes in recent years, the Project Runway star took her animal theme to new levels as a bright green, and pretty hideous, Medusa.\n\nShe slithered up the carpet with several moving snakes protruding from her intricate headpiece, sticking her vile tongue out at the waiting photographers.\n\nAlthough she warned fans that her costume would be \"very ugly\", this probably isn't what anyone expected.\n\nHeidi collaborated with Oscar-nominated make-up artist Mike Marino once again to pull off her costume, with a team of more than 35 people working hard to ensure she had all eyes on her.\n\nAs the festivities continue, here is a look at some of the most impressive outfits at Heidiween 2025 and beyond.\n\nBut it's not all about Hollywood (or Heidiwood). Even politicians are getting in on the action, including President Trump, who is hosting a party at his Florida home.\n\nLike Heidi, her husband Tom Kaulitz, is never one to shy away from playing dress up.\n\nHe was by her side arriving to the party as a man who was unfortunately turned to stone after looking directly at Medusa.\n\nThe Tokio Hotel musician committed to the bit by posing with his weapon and shield raised, suggesting Medusa's appearance caught him by surprise moments before his demise.\n\nIce-T and Coco Austin have never shied away from going all out for Halloween, and are regulars at Heidi's annual bash. This year was no different as the rapper looked menacing in a red hooded jumpsuit, hiding his face with a blood-splattered white mask. He had a selection of weapons on hand to make his costume truly terrifying.\n\nModel Coco also got the horror memo in a bright red wig and denim bodysuit, with Chucky's tagline: \"Wanna play?\" scrawled across the front, layered on top of a striped, long-sleeved turtleneck top.\n\nYouTuber James Charles carried his own head as he made his way into the party, reminiscent of Jared Leto's red carpet arrival at the 2019 Met Gala.\n\nThe beauty vlogger put his own spin on things as a \"headless horseman\" and even filmed a make-up tutorial on Instagram for his unique accessory.\n\nDarren Criss may have taken some inspiration from his host as he donned a Shrek costume, including bright green face paint, a prosthetic nose and huge stomach, which he patted in front of the cameras.\n\nNot quite as epic as when Heidi did the same in 2018, the Glee star switched his efforts up with tartan red trousers alongside wife Mia Swier - who chose not to be his Princess Fiona, but instead Puss in Boots, complete with a black cape and a hair thong.\n\nOlympian Ilona Maher was a real-life vintage Barbie at Klum's Halloween party, modelling a strapless sparkly custom black Undone by Kate gown. She accessorized simply with black opera gloves and a chunky gold necklace.\n\nUnveiling her outfit on Instagram, the rugby player proudly posed with her very own Barbie doll, as well as a handkerchief emblazoned with the phrase: \"Beast. Beauty. Brains. Barbie.\"\n\nNot every costume has gone down well, with some saying that US model Julia Fox's costume as a blood-soaked Jackie Kennedy was in poor taste.\n\nOthers have been more popular.\n\nSinger  Demi Lovato recreated her \"Poot Lovato\" meme  which went viral on Tumblr in 2015 - a reference to her alter-ego who has been locked in a basement.\n\nOther highlights on social media include Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's daughter North West and her friends dressing up  as Japanese kawaii-metal band BABYMETAL.\n\nMaria Carey also went for Japanese theme, with hot pink hair and a frilly pastel blue dress,  and posting \"Happy Halloween from Japan\" in a photo with her two twin children .\n\nRapper Megan Thee Stallion opted for portraying  Choso from the Manga series Jujutsu Kaisen.\n\nSinger Jade, formerly of girl group Little Mix,  dressed up as Greta from the Gremlins , while the  Cat in the Hat's famous aesthetic was recreated  by singer Janelle Monae.\n\nElsewhere, Paris Hilton recreated the  famous look from Britney Spears's music video  for Oops!... I Did It Again.\n\nActress Keke Palmer channelled her inner rapper by  dressing up as Snoop Dogg  (and lip-synching to his music).\n\nActress and BLACKPINK member Lisa  looked dazzling as The Golden Woman  from the animated series Love, Death + Robots.\n\nKourtney Kardashian Barker is famously a big Halloween fan, with this year's costume serving as  a nod to the Bride of Frankenstein.\n\nLizzo, who dressed up as a weight loss drug last year, called Halloween \"so cheesy\"  as she dressed this year as a mozzarella stick , complete with an oozing cheese dress and boots.\n\nContent creator and media personality Amelia Dimoldenberg never takes the easy option when it comes to dressing up for Halloween and this  devilish costume certainly looks like it required some effort.\n\nThe night earlier, on the eve of Halloween, she went to a party in New York as the divorce of singer Lily Allen and Stranger Things actor David Harbour. Dressed as Harbour's sheriff character, she listened to the latest Allen album, which references their breakup.\n\nAnd singer Ed Sheeran  dressed up as Pennywise the clown,  Stephen King's character from It.\n\nMeanwhile, US Vice-President JD Vance wore a wig as he became the bizarre meme-version of himself. That same meme is alleged to have gotten  a Norwegian tourist banned from the US  earlier this year."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3ep1epqjkpo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"01:10:03.703+00:00","title":"Henley Passport Index: Why Indian passport is falling in global ranking","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"India's passport has dropped to 85th place in the Henley Passport Index, down from 80th in 2023 and 2024, despite gaining access to more visa-free countries (from 52 in 2015 to 57 in 2025).

influencer complaining about India's weak passport went viral on social media.\n\nHe  said  that while neighbouring countries like Bhutan and Sri Lanka were more welcoming of Indian tourists, getting visas to travel to most Western and European countries remained a challenge.\n\nHis dissatisfaction with India's poor passport strength was reflected  in the latest Henley Passport Index  - a ranking system of the world's passports based on visa-free travel - which placed India in the 85th spot out of 199 countries, five spots lower than last year.\n\nThe Indian government has not commented on the report yet. The BBC has reached out to the ministry of external affairs.\n\nCountries like Rwanda, Ghana and Azerbaijan with much smaller economies than India - which is the fifth-largest economy globally - are ranked higher on the index at the 78th, 74th and 72nd spots, respectively.\n\nIn fact, India's rank in the past decade has hovered in the 80s, even dipping to the 90th spot in 2021. These rankings are dismal compared to Asian nations like Japan, South Korea and Singapore, which have consistently held top positions.\n\nThis year, like the last, Singapore topped the index with visa-free travel to 193 countries. South Korea came in second with 190 visa-free destinations and Japan ranked third with 189 countries.\n\nMeanwhile, Indian passport holders have visa-free entry to 57 countries, just like the citizens of the African country Mauritania, which shares the 85th rank with India.\n\nPassport strength reflects a nation's soft power and global influence. It also translates into better mobility for its citizens, boosting business and learning opportunities. A weak passport means more paperwork, higher visa costs, fewer travel privileges and longer waiting times for travel.\n\nBut despite the decline in the rank, the number of countries offering visa-free access to Indians has actually increased in the past decade or so.\n\nFor example, in 2014 - the year Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came to power - 52 countries offered visa-free travel to Indians and its passport ranked 76th on the index.\n\nA year later, it tumbled to the 85th position, then rose to 80th in 2023 and 2024, dropping again to the 85th position this year. Meanwhile, visa-free destinations for Indians increased from 52 in 2015 to 60 in 2023 and 62 in 2024.\n\nThe number of visa-free destinations in 2025 (57) is higher than what it was in 2015 (52), yet India's rank for both these years is 85. So, why is that?\n\nExperts say that a major reason is the increasingly competitive landscape in global mobility - meaning countries are entering into more travel partnerships to benefit their citizens and their economies. According to a 2025 report by Henley & Partners, the global average number of destinations travellers are able to access visa-free has nearly  doubled from 58 in 2006 to 109 in 2025 .\n\nFor example, China has increased the number of visa-free destinations its citizens can travel to from 50 to 82 in the past decade. Consequently, its rank on the index has improved from 94th to 60th during the same time period.\n\nMeanwhile, India - which was ranked 77th on the index in July (the Henley Passport Index is updated quarterly to reflect changes in global visa policies) as it enjoyed visa-free access to 59 countries - dropped to the 85th position in October after losing access to two countries.\n\nAchal Malhotra, former Indian ambassador to Armenia, says there are other factors that affect the strength of a country's passport, like its economic and political stability as well as its openness to welcoming citizens from other countries.\n\nFor example, the US passport has dropped out of the top 10 and now occupies the 12th position - a historic low -  because of its increasingly insular stance in world politics , the report says.\n\nMr Malhotra recalls how in the 1970s, Indians enjoyed visa-free travel to many Western and European countries, but that changed after the  Khalistan movement  in the 1980s, which called for an independent homeland for Sikhs in India and caused internal turmoil. Subsequent political upheavals have further chipped away at India's image as a stable, democratic country.\n\n\"Many countries are also becoming increasingly wary of immigrants,\" Mr Malhotra says. \"India has a high number of people migrating to other countries or overstaying their visas and that interferes with the country's reputation.\"\n\nFactors such as how secure a country's passport is and its immigration procedures also play a role in gaining visa-free access to other countries, Mr Malhotra says.\n\nIndia's passport remains vulnerable to security threats. In 2024, the Delhi police  arrested 203 people  for alleged visa and passport fraud. India is also known for having cumbersome immigration procedures and a slow pace of visa processing.\n\nMr Malhotra says that technological advances, like India's recently-launched  electronic passport or e-passport , can improve security and ease the immigration process. The e-passport includes a small chip that stores biometric information, making it harder to forge or tamper with the document.\n\nBut more diplomatic outreach and travel agreements remain key to boosting the global mobility of Indians and, by extension, India's passport ranking.\n\nFollow BBC News India on  Instagram ,  YouTube,   X  and  Facebook ."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0jdd186l0go","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"02:10:13.047+00:00","title":"Desperation in Black River, Jamaica, after Hurricane Melissa","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"After Hurricane Melissa, a powerful Category 5 storm, devastated Black River, Jamaica, nearly 90% of homes and vital infrastructure like hospitals and police stations were destroyed.

They tossed water and items to others also in need.\n\n\"We had to throw food to other people.\"\n\nNearby, others told the BBC of a local pharmacy being looted in Black River, describing anarchy as people ran in and out carrying armfuls of drugs and alcohol.\n\n\"I saw items covered in mud being hauled out,\" Aldwayne Tomlinson told the BBC. \"At first, I thought the place was still open, but then I really got a second glance.\n\n\"I heard a lady say: 'Mi need go get some alcohol.' That's when I knew they were looting the pharmacy as well.\"\n\nJust down the road, a woman standing atop a pile of debris describes the situation there as \"chaos, chaos. Total. No food. No water\".\n\n\"We don't have access to money. We need help. No help has come,\" Chegun Braham continued.\n\nOne couple told the BBC that they owned multiple stores in the area, several of which they said had been looted. They are now standing guard outside one of their stores in the hope of preventing future thefts.\n\nA short walk from the market, Jimmy Esson leaned against a massive metal beam that had been knocked to the ground.\n\n\"I lost everything, all my things,\" he said. \"We need food. We have no food.\"\n\nSurvival is the primary concern on most people's minds here. The other is the rising death toll. Officials in Jamaica said on Thursday that at least 19 people had died in the country, a big jump from the five that had been counted the day before. Another 30 have died in neighbouring Haiti due to the storm.\n\n\"My community, we have dead bodies there,\" Mr Walker said.\n\nHe said he, like many others in the area, still has not heard from family and doesn't know if they made it out of the storm alive. Mr Walker is stuck in Black River, sleeping in whoever's house is still standing that will accept him, he says, while his eight-year-old son is in Westmoreland, the next parish over.\n\nWestmoreland shares Jamaica's western coast, along with Black River in the St Elizabeth parish, and was also severely damaged by Melissa.\n\n\"There's no way of getting to my family to find out if they're OK,\" he said as his eyes began to swell. Along with the unusable roads making travel difficult, there is little to no cell phone service and no electricity or running water in many hard-hit spots.\n\n\"The entire town of Black River is devastated,\" the town's Mayor Richard Solomon has said.\n\nHe noted to local media the desperation of residents who are looting and - while not condoning it - said he understood why it was happening.\n\n\"It is a delicate balance,\" Solomon said of the response to it. \"Persons are seizing the opportunity to pick up what they can off the ground [from damaged stores]. However, you have others being a little bit more forceful, where they are trying to get into people's properties to get all sorts of supplies.\"\n\nLocal officials estimate that 90% of the houses here were destroyed. Much of the town's vital infrastructure has been destroyed too, including the local hospital, police station and fire station.\n\n\"There are entire communities that seem to be marooned and areas that seem to be flattened,\" Information Minister Dana Morris Dixon said.\n\nAid supplies are starting to arrive more rapidly to the main airport in Kingston, but smaller regional airports - some of which are located near where humanitarian assistance is most needed - remain only partly operational.\n\nAid agencies and the military are bringing in the urgently needed supplies from Kingston by land but many roads remain unpassable in places, including in places like Black River.\n\nThe town is about a two-hour drive from Kingston but the main road in is - at various points - flooded, damaged and clogged with cars.\n\nMichael Tharkurdeen, a local medic, was in the town's fire station when the storm hit.\n\n\"We were upstairs, the entire bottom floor was flooded. The water was around maybe four feet going five feet. When the water came in, the seas came in, flooded everywhere,\" he said.\n\n\"Nobody could be on the bottom floor. Trust me, there were waves there about this high,\" he added, pointing to his shoulder.\n\nPeople who did make it to him from the flooded-out buildings nearby arrived in bad condition. They had \"lacerations on their hands, their feet\", he says. \"Kids, elders, everybody.\"\n\nMr Tharkurdee also found a man \"lifeless\" and with \"no pulse\" once the flood waters receded.\n\n\"I'm not a doctor, I'm a medic, so I couldn't pronounce him dead,\" he said. \"All we could have done was document that and cover his body.\"\n\nBy mid-afternoon on Friday, a fleet of military helicopters flew into Black River - with many hoping they came with desperately needed supplies.\n\nArmed officials carrying machine guns descended onto the streets and soon the crowds rummaging the looted pharmacy and grocery store had cleared. A line of cars that had jammed the sole road in the area had been cleared.\n\nA relative quiet replaced the noise and chaos of hundreds of people fighting for their survival.\n\n\"St Elizabeth, we want it to come back again,\" Shawn Morris said of the area's future and his hopes to get aid here.\n\n\"It's not about the money,\" he said. \"We need food and water.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c993ygv9g25o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"00:52:35.386+00:00","title":"Hair transplants, finasteride and hair systems: Welcome to the world of hair restoration","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the growing cultural and commercial shift in how men perceive and address hair loss, highlighting increasing demand for hair transplants, medications like finasteride and minoxidil, and hair systems.

and that bothered me for a long time. ​​\n\nIt bothered me that I was bothered. But just one swipe down my Instagram feed reveals I'm not the only man who is self-conscious about his hair.\n\nI'm greeted with videos and posts offering me hair transplants, regrowth tablets, thickening sprays, powders that fill gaps, and hair systems (once known as wigs or toupees).\n\nThese products promise to restore my \"lost confidence\" and stop my lack of hair from \"holding back\" my life.\n\nBut does the wealth of treatment options on offer mean attitudes towards hair loss have shifted? Is what was once viewed as something to be resigned to now seen as reversible, albeit at a cost?\n\nAccording to the International Society of Hair Restoration Surgery (ISHRS), hair transplants are becoming more common around the world - and the people having them are getting younger.\n\nThis global collective of surgeons, doctors and experts found 95% of its members' patients sought hair restoration surgery between the ages of 20 and 35 - and that's something hair-loss surgeon Dr Nilofer Farjo confirms is mirrored in the UK.\n\nWhen my hair first began to recede in my early 20s, I tried my best to cover it up, tactically styling and positioning it in a way that hid the new patches of scalp I hadn't seen before.\n\nThen, while out for my brother's stag do in a Liverpool nightclub, something happened that I haven't been able to forget since.\n\nI had suggested we wear white t-shirts and carry permanent markers so people we met could leave funny messages on our shirts.\n\n\"Best man? Best comb-over,\" one woman wrote.\n\nI laughed it off at the time, but inside, I was crushed. It was clear my hair loss was now noticeable to other people. And from then on, I became more and more self-conscious about my thinning hair.\n\nWhen I was younger, bald men were often the butt of jokes - but taking steps to regain lost hair seemed to be viewed as effeminate and vain. Still, I began to wonder if a hair transplant was my only option. Was that a possibility for someone like me? In my mind, they were only for rich people, and celebrities like Elton John.\n\nFast forward ten years, and social media and dating apps have made us all more aware of how we look, says Dr Farjo, and seeing celebrities and influencers being more open about hair transplants has normalised the procedure.\n\nShe says more and more young men are now choosing to treat their hair loss, and what might have once been deemed \"vanity\" is now considered \"routine self-care\".\n\nWhen I started considering having a hair transplant, I had just finished university, had little money, and no real idea how much the procedure might actually cost.\n\nI began to do some research and discovered a nearby transplant clinic offering free consultations and monthly payment plans.\n\n\"You're still quite young,\" I remember the hair transplant consultant telling me, as he drew on my scalp with a felt-tip pin. \"After this transplant, your hair could recede further. But you can just come and get it filled in.\"\n\nDespite the payment plan, I realised I couldn't afford a hair transplant - especially if I'd have to come and get a top-up later in life.\n\nSince my own consultation in Cardiff in 2014, I've heard about men travelling abroad in increasing numbers to countries like Turkey to have hair transplants. Dr Farjo says this is down to costs being \"a fraction\" of what they are in the UK.\n\nBut while the price may be attractive, she says there are concerns about industry practices, with limited regulations in place. Dr Farjo also warns that cheap, unregulated procedures, not only in Turkey, can sometimes lead to people needing \"costly corrective surgery\" to deal with scarring and \"poor hairline design\".\n\nBut hair transplants in Turkey remain popular and there are many happy customers - including content creator, Ben Placito.\n\nAfter jokey comments from his barber, Ben decided to consider having a hair transplant. And after months of research, he discovered it would be cheaper to have the procedure carried out in Turkey than in the UK.\n\nSome quotes from Turkish clinics were \"crazy cheap\", Ben says, offering surgery for around £1,500. But the 31-year-old chose not to go with the cheapest hair transplant on offer and instead selected a \"premium\" option.\n\nBen felt reassured about his chosen clinic after speaking to other men who had been there and had good experiences. Ben travelled to Turkey in 2022 to have the procedure, sharing his experience on his TikTok account.\n\n\"People have said to me 'it's the best thing you've done,'\" Ben says. \"I'm really happy I did it.\"\n\nAbout a year after I gave up on the idea of surgery, I came across an advert for a clinic offering non-surgical treatments, like finasteride tablets and minoxidil cream, which can be used to stimulate hair growth.\n\nFinasteride is one of the most common pills for hair loss, taken by tens of thousands of men in the UK. It is only available by private prescription.\n\nIt works by preventing testosterone turning into another hormone called dihydrotestosterone (DHT) that can stop hair growing.\n\nMinoxidil, originally a blood pressure medication, has hair growth as a side effect and is commonly sold in the form of a daily cream applied directly to the hair and scalp.\n\nI paid several hundred pounds for a combined course of minoxidil and finasteride but the treatment requires consistent daily use, and I often forgot doses. Eventually, I realised I couldn't justify the cost - or trust myself to stick with it. Health concerns also weighed on me, something the clinic had made clear.\n\nAccording to a 2024 report by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), finasteride is linked to psychiatric issues like depression and suicidal thoughts, and can have side effects affecting sexual function.\n\nThe MHRA advises users to monitor symptoms and stop using the drug if adverse effects occur.\n\nMy experience was a decade ago, but the market for hair-loss medication has since exploded. Superdrug's private online doctor service says it has seen a 68% increase in new patients requesting hair-loss services in the last three months versus the equivalent period last year.\n\nHaving given up on medication, I relied on hats and carefully positioned sunglasses that would \"hide\" my receding hair. If I was taking a photo with family or friends, I'd position the camera so it cropped out the top of my head.\n\nThen in 2019, I began to see adverts for hair systems. These seamless-looking hair pieces are glued to a shaved scalp and blended with existing hair, with regular clinic visits for maintenance. This seemed like a side-effect-free, instant solution.\n\nBut I couldn't shake the thought of suddenly appearing at work or family events with a full head of hair - everyone knew I was balding. I also questioned the legitimacy of the adverts. Were the results real? Or just the result of clever lighting and angles?\n\nI had seen some people with systems telling their social media followers they could start peeling off in the middle of the day - and I dreaded that.\n\nHowever, for 36-year-old Adam Lomax, who has male pattern baldness and trichotillomania (a mental health disorder where you can't resist pulling out your own hair), a hair system was \"life changing\".\n\nAdam had already tried finasteride, which left him feeling anxious, depressed and low in libido.\n\n\"People have been really positive,\" Adam says of the reception to his new hair. \"The conversation around men's hair loss has shifted massively - but you still get the odd troll on TikTok.\"\n\nIt's clear there are plenty of options for men facing hair loss, but not every bald man sees losing their hair as something that needs to be fixed or prevented.\n\n\"The narrative around hair loss needs to change both socially and commercially,\" says Tariq Kazemi, co-founder and CEO of skincare company Bld Bro, a brand which began life as a support group for bald men.\n\nTariq recalls a colleague poking fun at his bald spot during a shopping trip, and describing that as \"like an ice pick to my heart\".\n\nTariq later shaved his head and noticed that jokes about his hair loss stopped. He chose not to pursue any form of hair restoration.\n\n\"Those industries prey on the fear and anxiety of young men,\" he says. \"We've been told it's our identity, our confidence and our attractiveness that will all disappear with the hair on our head.\"\n\nIn 2020, when the world went into coronavirus lockdown many people grew out their hair or attempted to cut it themselves.\n\nBy this time, the only remaining hair I had was around the back of my head and in a thin patch on the top of my forehead. I took the plunge and decided to shave my head. There was a freedom in skipping to the end stage of the balding process, and I've continued to shave my head ever since.\n\nThere's so much social media noise around hair loss, and money to be made from men's worries about it. But after speaking to different men about their hair loss experiences, it's clear there is no single right way to feel happy with your appearance.\n\nThe anxiety I felt while I was losing my hair has gradually ebbed away and I feel more accepting of the way I look. I've come to terms with my baldness now and I prefer to be bald than balding."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyk1nq6v4lo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"01:02:54.391+00:00","title":"Sudan war: A boy's escape from el-Fasher amid accusations of spying","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A twelve-year-old boy named Abdiwahab escaped from the conflict-ridden city of el-Fasher in Sudan, where the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have been accused of widespread violence, including rape, torture, and false accusations of espionage.

escape from el-Fasher amid accusations of spying\n\nTwelve-year-old Abdiwahab - not his real name - sobs as he recounts what happened to him as he escaped from the western Sudanese city of el-Fasher.\n\nThe young boy left el-Fasher on Sunday as it fell to the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), the paramilitary group that has been fighting a two-and-a-half-year civil war against the army.\n\nIn a video received by the BBC, his face reflects deep sorrow and fatigue, his voice low as he describes being assaulted \"many times\" by RSF fighters.\n\nFearing reprisal attacks from RSF fighters, Abdiwahab had joined a wave of people - including some of his family - trying to get out.\n\nThe UN estimates that 60,000 have managed to get out of el-Fasher with many narrating horrendous stories of atrocities, including rape.\n\nAfter three days of walking Abdiwahab reached the relative safety of Tawila - an 80km (50-mile) journey - but he arrived on his own.\n\n''I left the city with my father and siblings but because of the chaos we were separated, I came to Tawila alone,\" he says on the video.\n\nHe was assaulted on the way and accused of being involved in espionage.\n\n\"I walked along the road, and on the road, [the RSF] caught me, many times. They beat me and hit me, saying, 'this little boy is a spy'.\"\n\nThis chimes with other accounts of how men and boys are especially at risk as they face arbitrary arrest, violence and summary execution.\n\nAbdiwahab says that RSF fighters had already taken his mother and one of his sisters about a month ago, and he does not know if they are still alive.\n\nAli, not his real name, who is now a volunteer aid worker after fleeing el-Fasher himself a fortnight ago, was the one who filmed Abdiwahab's account.\n\nHe is stationed at the entrance to Tawila where a temporary camp has been established and where new arrivals gather before being relocated to permanent camps inside the town.\n\nIn a voice note to the BBC explaining the context, Ali's words were almost drowned out by the noise and chaos at the camp.\n\n\"[Abdiwahab] keeps asking me about his parents. I decided to take him home until we found them,\" Ali says.\n\nHe noticed how the boy was traumatised, fearing that any light appearing at night was an RSF vehicle coming to get him.\n\n\"He saw a light in the distance and held me tight, screaming. He froze.\"\n\nAli says each new arrival to the camp carries a story of survival and despair.\n\nThere are many unaccompanied minors, including children who lost their parents on the road, coming in every day.\n\n\"Just yesterday, twin children around 10 years old arrived with a woman who said their parents had died on the way,\" the volunteer aid worker says.\n\n\"The situation is terrifying. People continue arriving with many conditions, some with injuries and malnutrition.

2025-11-01T23:39:02.052+00:00\n\nTitle: Tourism to Xinjiang booms as China gives the region a makeover\n\nWhen Anna was planning her first visit to Xinjiang in 2015, her friends were perplexed.\n\n\"They couldn't understand why I'd visit a place that back then was considered one of China's most dangerous areas.\"\n\nOne of her friends pulled out of the trip and started \"ghosting\" her on WeChat, said the 35-year-old Chinese national, who did not want to reveal her real name.\n\n\"She said her parents forbade her from going anywhere near Xinjiang and did not want to engage further.\"\n\nAnna went anyway, and returned this June. But it had changed, she says.\n\n\"Xinjiang was as beautiful as I remember it, but there are far too many tourists now, especially at the major attractions.\"\n\nFor years, Xinjiang had bristled under Beijing's rule, sometimes erupting into violence, which kept many domestic Chinese tourists away. Then it became infamous for some of the worst allegations of Chinese authoritarianism, from the detention of more than a million  Uyghur Muslims  in so-called \"re-education camps\", to  claims of crimes against humanity , by the United Nations.\n\nChina denies the allegations, but the region is largely cut off to international media and observers, while Uyghurs in exile continue to recount stories of terrified or disappeared relatives.\n\nAnd yet in recent years Xinjiang has emerged as a tourist destination – within China and, increasingly, outside of the country. Beijing has pumped in billions of dollars to develop infrastructure, help produce TV dramas set in its unusual landscapes, and has occasionally welcomed foreign media on carefully orchestrated tours.\n\nIt has been repackaging the controversial region into a tourist haven, touting not just its beauty but also the very local \"ethnic\" experiences that rights groups say it is trying to erase.\n\nStretched across China's north-west, Xinjiang borders eight countries. Located along the Silk Road, which fuelled trade between the East and West for centuries, some of its towns are packed with history. It is also home to remote, rugged mountains, majestic canyons, lush grasslands and pristine lakes.\n\n\"The views exceeded my expectations by miles,\" says Singaporean Sun Shengyao, who visited in May 2024 and describes it as \"New Zealand, Switzerland and Mongolia all packed into one place\".\n\nUnlike most of China which has a Han majority, Xinjiang mostly has Turkic-speaking Muslims, with the Uyghurs being the largest ethnic group. Tensions escalated throughout the 1990s and 2000s as Uyghur allegations of marginalisation by Han Chinese spurred separatist sentiments and deadly attacks, which intensified Beijing's crackdown.\n\nBut it is under Xi Jinping that the Chinese Communist Party has begun tightening control like never before, sparking allegations of the forcible assimilation of Uyghurs into Han Chinese culture. On a visit in September, he hailed the region's \"earth-shattering\" development and called for the \"Sinicisation of religion\" – the transformation of beliefs to reflect Chinese culture and society.\n\nMeanwhile investment has been pouring into the region. Some 200 international hotels, including prominent names like Hilton and Marriott, are either already operating or planning to open in Xinjiang.\n\nIn 2024, the region welcomed some 300 million visitors, more than double the number in 2018, according to Chinese authorities. Tourism revenue from Xinjiang grew about 40% over this period to reach 360 billion yuan ($51bn; £39bn). In the first half of this year, some 130 million tourists visited the region, contributing about 143bn yuan in revenue.\n\nWhile foreign tourism has been growing, the vast majority are domestic visitors.\n\nBeijing now has an ambitious target: more than 400 million visitors a year, and tourism revenue of 1 trillion yuan by 2030.\n\nSome people are still scared to go. Mr Sun says it took him a while to gather friends for a trip in May 2024 as many of them saw Xinjiang as unsafe. The 23-year-old himself had a bout of the jitters, but as the trip continued, they vanished.\n\nThey started off in the bustling streets of the regional capital, Urumqi. They then spent eight days on the road with a Chinese driver, travelling through mountains and lush steppes, which left Mr Sun in awe.\n\nIt is common for drivers and tour guides in Xinjiang to be Han Chinese, who now make up about 40% of the region's population. Mr Sun's group did not interact extensively with local Uyghurs, but the few they managed to strike up conversations with were \"very welcoming\", he says.\n\nSince he has returned, Mr Sun has become somewhat of an advocate for Xinjiang, which he says has been \"misunderstood\" as dangerous and tense. \"If I can inspire just one person to learn more about the province, I would have helped reduce the stigma by a little.\"\n\nTo him, the stunning sights he enjoyed as a tourist seem far removed from the disturbing allegations that put Xinjiang in global headlines. All he saw was evidence that Xinjiang remains highly surveilled, with police checkpoints and security cameras a common sight, and foreigners required to stay in designated hotels.\n\nBut Mr Sun was unfazed by that: \"There is heavy police presence, but that's not to say that this is a big problem.\"\n\nNot every tourist is convinced that what they are seeing is the \"real\" Xinjiang.\n\nSingaporean Thenmoli Silvadorie, who visited with friends in May for 10 days, says: \"I was very curious about Uyghur culture and wanted to see how different things may be there. But we were quite disappointed.\"\n\nShe and her friends were wearing hijabs and, she says, Uyghur food vendors had approached them saying they were \"envious we could freely wear our hijabs... but we didn't get to have very deep conversations\". They also weren't allowed to visit most local mosques, she adds.\n\nStill, the allure for foreign visitors is strong. China itself is a hugely popular destination, and Xinjiang has emerged as an \"untouched\", less commercialised option.\n\nA growing number of foreigners are \"approaching Xinjiang with open minds and a genuine desire to see and assess the truth for themselves\", China's state-run newspaper Global Times wrote in May.\n\nThe party has also been quick to promote content on Xinjiang by foreign influencers that aligns with the state's narrative. Among them is German vlogger Ken Abroad, who in one of his videos said he'd seen \"more mosques [in Xinjiang] than in the US or any countries in Europe\".\n\nBut others take a different view. Writer Josh Summers, who lived in Xinjiang in the 2010s, tells the BBC the city of Kashgar's Old Town was \"completely torn down, reimagined and rebuilt in a way that doesn't reflect Uyghur culture in any way\".\n\nAccording to a Human Rights Watch report from 2024, hundreds of villages in Xinjiang had their names - which were related to the religion, history or culture of Uyghurs -  replaced  between 2009 and 2023. The group has also accused authorities of  closing, destroying and repurposing mosques  in Xinjiang and across China to curb the practice of Islam.\n\nGrave rights violations have also been documented by other international organisations, including the UN. The BBC's reporting from 2021 and 2022 found evidence supporting the existence of detention camps, and allegations of sexual abuse and forced sterilisation.\n\nBeijing, however, denies all of this. Within the country, the party has been remaking the image of what was once seen as a troubled province to woo more domestic tourists. And it appears to be working.\n\nWhen Anna went for the second time, it was with her mother, who was eager to visit after watching a drama series set in the mountainous Altay prefecture in the north. The series, To the Wonder, was funded by the government and promoted on state media.\n\nAltay has plenty of fans on the Chinese internet. \"Who would have known that I'd wander into God's secret garden in Altay? At the Ka Nasi Lake, I finally understood what it means to be in paradise. This is a place where the romance of mountains, rivers, lakes and the seas are woven together in a single frame,\" reads one comment on RedNote.\n\nAnother says: \"At dawn, I watch from the guesthouse as the cattle graze the fields. Golden birch forests glow in the sunlight, and even the air seems wrapped in sweetness – such undisturbed beauty is the Altay I've always longed for.\"\n\nTravel agencies describe the region as \"exotic\" and \"mysterious\". It offers a \"magical fusion of nature and culture you won't experience anywhere else in China\", says one such agency, The Wandering Lens. The prices for these tours vary. A 10-day trip could set you back between US$1,500 and US$2,500 (£1,100-1,900), excluding flights.\n\nA typical itinerary for the north would include the Kanas National Park, with outings to alpine lakes and the popular five-coloured beach, and a visit to a Uyghur village where you can ride on carriages and spend time with a Uyghur family.\n\nThings get more adventurous in the south, where trips often include drives through the desert, various lake excursions, and a visit to Kashgar, a 2,000-year-old Silk Road city.\n\nVisitors share their itineraries online, complete with coloured-coded route maps and snaps of Uyghur delicacies, like the spicy stew, \"big plate chicken\", grilled lamb skewers, and wine made with horse milk. Some even mention \"hours-long performances that recreate the splendour of the Silk Road\".\n\nIf you search for Xinjiang on social media platforms RedNote and Weibo, as you'd expect, you get posts raving about its beauty and iconic architecture. There is no mention of the allegations that clash with this idyllic appeal.\n\nAt this time of the year, Chinese social media is awash with photographs of Xinjiang's poplar forests bathed in autumn's amber glow.\n\nThe Communist Party is \"selling its own version of Uyghur culture by presenting Uyghur people as tourist attractions\", says Uyghur-American Irade Kashgary who left the region in 1998.\n\n\"They are telling the world we're no more than dancing, colourful folk who look good on social media.\"\n\nWatching her hometown grow in popularity from across the Pacific, Ms Kashgary, the Uyghur activist, urges tourists to \"recognise the serious issues\" in Xinjiang.\n\n\"It's not my place to tell people not to visit, but they need to realise that what they experience there is a whitewashed version of [Xinjiang],\" she says.\n\n\"Meanwhile, people like me will never be able to go back because of our activism. It is far too dangerous... and yet, why can't I? This is my homeland.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg441qyv2xo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"17:06:11.200+00:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa: Britons to be evacuated from Jamaica as UK sends aid","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, a catastrophic Category 5 storm that struck Jamaica on October 22, 2025, caused massive destruction, killing at least 19 people and leaving entire communities without electricity, shelter, or medical care.

In Haiti, at least 30 people were killed, while Cuba also saw flooding and landslides.\n\nJamaica's Information Minister Dana Morris Dixon said on Friday \"there are entire communities that seem to be marooned and areas that seem to be flattened\".\n\nAround 8,000 British nationals were thought to have been on the island when the hurricane hit.\n\nThe UK foreign office has asked citizens there to register their presence and also advises travellers to contact their airline to check whether commercial options are available.\n\nThe UK initially set aside a £2.5m immediate financial support package for the region, with an additional £5m announced by Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper on Friday.\n\nCooper said the announcement came as \"more information is now coming through on the scale of devastation caused by Hurricane Melissa, with homes damaged, roads blocks and lives lost\".\n\nThe British Red Cross said the King and Queen's donation would help the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent (IFRC) \"continue its lifesaving work\" - which includes search and rescue efforts in Jamaica as well as ensuring access to healthcare, safe shelter and clean water.\n\nThe Red Cross said that 72% of people across Jamaica still do not have electricity and around 6,000 are in emergency shelters.\n\nUntil the Jamaican government can get the broken electricity grid back up and running, any generators aid agencies can distribute will be vital.\n\nSo too will tarpaulins, given the extent of the housing crisis.\n\nMeanwhile, with so many in need of clean drinking water and basic food, patience is wearing thin and there are more reports of desperate people entering supermarkets to gather and give out whatever food they can find.\n\nThe BBC has seen queues for petrol pumps, with people waiting for hours to then be told there is no fuel left when they reach the front of the queue.\n\nSome people are seeking fuel for generators, others for a car to reach an area in which they can contact people, with the power down across most of the island.\n\nThe country's health minister, Dr Christopher Tufton, on Saturday described \"significant damage\" across a number of hospitals - with the Black River Hospital in St Elizabeth being the most severely affected.\n\n\"That facility will have to be for now totally relocated in terms of services,\" he said.\n\n\"The immediate challenge of the impacted hospitals is to preserve accident and emergency services,\" Dr Tufton added. \"What we're seeing is that a lot of people are coming in now to these facilities with trauma-related [injuries] from falls from the roof, to ladders, to nails penetrating their feet\".\n\nThe minister said arrangements had been made for the ongoing supply of fuel to the facilities as well as a \"daily supply of water\".\n\nAlthough aid is entering the country, landslides, downed power lines and fallen trees have made certain roads impassable.\n\nHowever, some of the worst affected areas of Jamaica should finally receive some relief in the coming hours.\n\nAt least one aid organisation, Global Empowerment Mission, rolled out this morning from Kingston with a seven-truck convoy to Black River, the badly damaged town of western Jamaica, carrying packs of humanitarian assistance put together by volunteers from the Jamaican diaspora community in Florida.\n\nHelp is also coming in from other aid groups and foreign governments via helicopter.\n\nIt remains only a small part of what the affected communities need but authorities insist more is coming soon."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpq11v5d1rno","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"11:27:16.505+00:00","title":"Campari shares worth €1.3bn seized by police over alleged tax evasion","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Italian police have seized €1.3bn in shares from Lagfin, a Luxembourg-based entity that controls the Campari Group, over allegations of tax evasion.

conditions\" defending Pokrovsk - a key eastern front-line town - against massed Russian forces.\n\nGen Oleksandr Syrskyi said Ukrainian troops were facing a \"multi-thousand enemy\" force - but denied Russian claims that they were surrounded or blocked.\n\nHe confirmed that elite special forces had been deployed to protect key supply lines which, army sources said, were all under Russian fire.\n\nThe defence ministry in Moscow reported that Ukrainian troops were surrendering and 11 of their special forces had been killed after landing by helicopter, something denied by Kyiv.\n\nIn Saturday's posts on Telegram, Gen Syrskyi said he was \"back on the front\" to personally hear the latest reports from military commanders on the ground in the eastern Donetsk region.\n\nIn a short video, Syrskyi is seen studying battlefield maps with other commanders, including the head of Ukraine's military intelligence, Kyrylo Budanov.\n\nIt is unclear when and where the footage was recorded.\n\nUkrainian media earlier reported that Budanov was in the region to personally oversee the operation by the special forces.\n\nThe deployment of special forces suggests officials in Kyiv are determined to try to hold on to the town, which Russia has been trying to seize for more than a year.\n\nUkraine's 7th Rapid Response Corps said on Saturday Ukrainian troops \"have improved [their] tactical position\" in Pokrovsk - but the situation remained \"difficult and dynamic\".\n\nLate on Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stressed that the defence of Pokrovsk was a \"priority\".\n\nThere have been growing reports of Russian advances around the strategic town to the west of the Russian-seized regional capital of Donetsk.\n\nImages shared with news agencies late on Friday appear to show a Ukrainian Black Hawk helicopter deploying about 10 troops near Pokrovsk, although the location and date could not be verified.\n\nRussia's defence ministry said it had thwarted the deployment of Ukrainian military intelligence special forces north-west of the town, killing all 11 troops who landed by helicopter.\n\nDeepState, a Ukrainian open-source monitoring group, estimates about half of Pokrovsk is a so-called \"grey zone\" where neither side is in full control.\n\nA military source in Donetsk told the BBC that Ukrainian forces were not surrounded but their supply lines were under fire from Russian troops.\n\nThe US-based Institute for the Study of War said Ukrainian forces had \"marginally advanced\" during recent counter-attacks north of Pokrovsk, but said the town was \"mainly a contested 'grey zone'\".\n\nMoscow wants Kyiv to cede the Donetsk and the neighbouring Luhansk regions (collectively known as Donbas) as part of a peace deal, including the parts it currently does not control.\n\nRussia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory, including the Crimean peninsula Moscow annexed in 2014.\n\nPokrovsk is a key transport and supply hub whose capture could unlock Russian efforts to seize the rest of the region.\n\nBut Kyiv also believes its capture would help Russia in its efforts to persuade the US that its military campaign is succeeding - and, therefore, that the West should acquiesce to its demands.\n\nWashington has grown increasingly frustrated with the Kremlin's failure to move forward with peace negotiations - culminating in US President Donald Trump  placing sanctions on two largest Russian oil producers and axing plans for a summit  with President Vladimir Putin.\n\nZelensky has publicly agreed with Trump's proposal for a ceasefire that would freeze the war along the current front lines.\n\nPutin is refusing to do so, insisting on his maximalist pre-invasion demands that Kyiv and its Western allies see as a de facto capitulation of Ukraine.\n\nAdditional reporting by Jaroslav

A collapse in its $446 billion real estate economy would bring California to its knees. Gov. Gavin Newsom’s administration went into crisis negotiations with the insurance industry, and emerged in September 2023, with what was billed as an “historic” compromise, one that would reward insurers with higher rates in exchange for protecting homeowners in neighborhoods that climate change was turning into tinder boxes.\n\nThe central promise was that insurers would have to write policies in fire-prone areas at a rate equal to at least 85 percent of their market share across the state. But a New York Times investigation has found that a series of loopholes quietly negotiated by the insurance industry all but eliminated that guarantee.\n\nVast swaths of the designated areas where insurers must write new policies do not in fact overlap with areas that California’s state fire marshal deems to be the most fire-prone, the investigation found, meaning that insurers can load up on coverage in areas the state considers to be safer and still qualify to charge higher rates.\n\nAs a result, insurance companies will be able to raise rates and offload billions of dollars in costs and liabilities to ratepayers while taking on few, if any, new customers in high fire-risk areas.\n\nUnder new rules, insurers get credit\n\nfor writing new policies anywhere\n\nwithin “distressed” counties and ZIP\n\ncodes, even where many homes are\n\ndeemed less fire-prone by the state.\n\nSan Francisco\n\nLos Angeles\n\nUnder new rules, insurers get credit\n\nfor writing new policies anywhere\n\nwithin “distressed” counties and ZIP\n\ncodes, even where many homes are\n\ndeemed less fire-prone by the state.\n\nSan Francisco\n\nLos Angeles\n\nUnder new rules, insurers\n\nget credit for writing new\n\npolicies anywhere within\n\n“distressed” counties and\n\nZIP codes, even where\n\nmany homes are deemed\n\nless fire-prone by the state.\n\nSan Francisco\n\nLos Angeles\n\nSan Francisco\n\nSources: “Distressed” areas from the California Department of Insurance; Footprints of residential buildings from FEMA.\n\nThe New York Times\n\nAnd while the regulations were billed as an attempt to get homeowners off the state’s toverburdened last-resort insurance program, FAIR, the number of residential FAIR policies has nearly doubled since the new insurance deal was announced, rising to 625,033 from 320,581, the Times review found.\n\nSome insurers began minimizing their potential losses even before the new regulations were finalized. In the six months after the deal was announced, California’s three largest insurance groups informed the state of their plans to dump nearly 50,000 existing policies, five times the number filed by those companies in the 20 months preceding the deal. And the new regulations will effectively reward them for doing it.\n\nMore than a fifth of the nonrenewals — about 11,000 policies in total — were in ZIP codes within or adjacent to areas that would burn in the January fires, the Times analysis found. The vast majority of those were in and around Pacific Palisades, where fire later destroyed more than 6,800 structures.\n\nMaggie Neilson, a 53-year-old philanthropy consultant, had a policy from Foremost on her 2,500-square-foot house in Pacific Palisades until the company elected not to renew it in March 2024.\n\nThe only insurer Ms. Neilson could find to replace the policy was the FAIR plan, which charged her about 40 percent more than Foremost had for about 40 percent less coverage. “At the time, the media was saying everyone knows this is a problem and the governor and others are working on it, so I didn’t think too much about it,” she said.\n\nThen in January, her home and all of its contents were destroyed by the Palisades fire. She said her FAIR policy will pay her $1.5 million for a rebuild that she has been told will cost around $3 million.\n\nProponents of the new rules said they would allow rates to reflect the risks of hotter, drier weather and provide a business case for insurers to offer policies in high-risk areas. Representatives for Farmers Insurance, one of the few companies that agreed to discuss the regulations, praised them as a “return to a more effective rating regime” that “will bring positive change to the California insurance marketplace.”\n\nRicardo Lara, California’s elected state insurance commissioner who led the drafting of the new rules, said the state was “in crisis mode” when it negotiated the new regulations, with seven of the 12 top insurers in the state halting or restricting the writing of new policies in California.\n\n“You constantly have to strike the balance between, you know, the consumer protections, giving consumers options, and having a robust and thriving insurance market,” Mr. Lara said.\n\nHe said the new rules would offer tens of thousands of Californians the chance to purchase protection for their homes that might otherwise have been unavailable at any price.\n\nConfronted with The Times’ findings about ways insurers could shortchange their promises to insure in high-risk areas, Mr. Lara conceded that the rules might not deliver the hoped-for outcomes immediately. Insurers, he said, had “bullied” the state as it drafted the new rules. But he predicted that, as rates rose, competition would eventually push insurers back into writing policies in high-risk zones.\n\n“This is uncharted territory,” he said. “Will this be perfect? Absolutely not.”\n\nFrom the insurance industry’s perspective, the roots of the current crisis can be traced back to 1988. Voters passed an initiative that year that made California one of about a dozen states where homeowners’ insurance rate increases must be preapproved by an elected insurance commissioner. The industry has long complained that the system keeps rates in California artificially low.\n\nBy the early spring of 2023, when Governor Newsom began meeting with industry lobbyists, some of California’s largest property insurers had already stopped or curtailed writing new business in the state. State Farm and Farmers, which together comprise one third of the market, started pulling back in May and July of that year.\n\nExisting policies were not affected, but the changes meant that home buyers were left with few options for insuring their new properties other than the FAIR plan, a consortium of all the companies licensed to offer property insurance in the state. FAIR is required by law to sell bare-bones fire policies to people who can’t find coverage in the regular market.Insurers share any profits from FAIR in good times, but must cover all of its losses.\n\n“I think that was the moment when we really started to get nervous,” recalled Ann Patterson, a senior counselor to the governor who was involved in the discussions. “We only have so many more big carriers that can pick up that demand, and if they can’t pick it up, then everybody’s going to end up on the FAIR plan.”\n\nIt was generally agreed that FAIR was not a solution. Its lean policies rarely covered the actual cost to rebuild a home, even though they generally cost more than regular policies. Nearly 7 percent of realtors surveyed in 2023 by the California Association of Realtors said that they had deals fall out of escrow that year because buyers couldn’t find adequate, affordable coverage.\n\nIt was not a problem just for wealthy homeowners in Brentwood and Malibu. Nearly a third of California’s 40 million residents live in or near highly flammable, brushy or densely forested wildlands.\n\nInsurers made it clear that big, regulatory changes were needed to keep them in the market, addressing rising construction costs as well as climate change.\n\nCalifornia requires companies to provide detailed financial information justifying rate-increase requests; if they seek 7 percent or more, the requests can be challenged in public hearings and take up to a year to resolve.\n\nHistorically, wildfire losses figured in those calculations, but insurers had to show data on their actual payouts. They wanted California regulators to instead join other states in allowing rates based on climate-change models that estimate future losses.\n\nSeren Taylor, vice president of the Personal Insurance Federation of California, the lead lobbying group for insurers in California, said rate increases will help avert a serious threat to the state’s economy. “You don’t have to care about insurers per se, but you have to care about having a healthy insurance market,” he said. “We had to give insurers the tools they need to have a functional market.”\n\nThe deal with insurers, as described by Mr. Lara when he announced it, contained an unambiguous promise: If carriers wanted to charge higher rates, they would have to write policies in “fire zones” at a rate “no less” than 85 percent of their statewide market share.\n\nIf a carrier’s statewide market share is 20 percent, for example, its share in designated distressed areas would have to be at least 17 percent.\n\nTo reach the 85 percent standard, insurers can offer policies to homeowners currently on the FAIR plan, though nothing requires them to do that. Or they can write policies anywhere in a list of 662 distressed ZIP codes.\n\nSome of those ZIP codes neatly overlap the state’s high-fire-risk zone maps, like the one covering Topanga, a town known for its hippie scene. Topanga sits in a steep, rugged canyon in the Santa Monica Mountains that can become a wind tunnel, where embers can be blown for miles.\n\nBut the Times analysis found that many “distressed” ZIP codes extend well beyond the riskiest fire zones. The 90063 area, for instance, is in the dense heart of urban East Los Angeles, with only a small sliver overlapping areas deemed at high risk of a blaze — and that sliver has no homes in it at all.\n\nLOS ANGELES\n\n“Distressed”\n\n(TK LA COUNTY\n\nNo residential homes within\n\nthis “distressed” ZIP code\n\noverlap with the state’s\n\nhigh fire hazard zones.\n\nCITY TERRACE\n\nLos Angeles\n\nArea of detail\n\nNo residential homes  within this “distressed”  ZIP code overlap with the state’s high fire hazard zones.\n\nCITY TERRACE\n\nLos Angeles\n\nArea of detail\n\nSources: California Department of Insurance, CalFIRE, FEMA.\n\nNote: Includes “high” or “very high” fire hazard zones. Residential buildings, shown in dark gray, include single-family, multi-family and manufactured homes. Non-residential buildings are shown outlined in light gray.\n\nThe New York Times\n\nAnd half of California’s 58 counties qualify under the regulations as “distressed” in their entirety, even though only a minority of the single-family homes located within them are in high or very high fire risk zones. In Ventura County, which sprawls from urban strip malls and moist strawberry fields to forested peaks, more than 100,000 homes, or roughly 60 percent of the county’s single-family structures, are clustered in areas with lower wildfire risk. Yet insuring any of them would help a company meet the 85 percent target.\n\nPlacer County, just north of Sacramento, stretches east from  suburbs dominated by new subdivisions with few mature trees into the pine-covered slopes of the Sierra Nevada mountains, where rugged terrain and dense vegetation create a higher fire danger.\n\nPolicies written anywhere in the county count toward the requirement.\n\nBut a savvy insurer could meet it by zeroing in on Roseville, a city of about 160,000 residents whose boundaries barely graze the high-risk zones — in fact, one of its three main ZIP codes falls entirely outside the zones.\n\nIn Placer County, a “distressed” county, over\n\n75% of homes are outside of “high” or “very high”\n\nstate fire hazard zones.\n\nConsidered “distressed” by officials, over 75%\n\nof homes in Placer County are outside of\n\n“high” or “very high” wildfire risk zones.\n\nPLACER COUNTY\n\nIn Placer County, deemed “distressed”\n\nby insurance regulators, over 70% of\n\nhomes are outside of the state’s\n\nhigh fire hazard zones.\n\nPLACER COUNTY\n\nIn Placer County, deemed “distressed”\n\nby insurance regulators, over 70% of\n\nhomes are outside of the state’s\n\nhigh fire hazard zones.\n\nPLACER COUNTY\n\nIn Placer County, deemed “distressed”\n\nby insurance regulators, over 70% of\n\nhomes are outside of the state’s\n\nhigh fire hazard zones.\n\nPLACER COUNTY\n\nIn Placer County, deemed “distressed” by insurance\n\nregulators, over 70% of homes are outside of the\n\nstate’s high fire hazard zones.\n\nSources: California Department of Insurance, CalFIRE, FEMA.\n\nNote: Analysis of homes inside of “high” or “highest” fire hazard severity zones based on FEMA single-family or multi-family residential buildings.\n\nThe New York Times\n\nIn more than 100 of the state’s distressed ZIP codes, fewer than a third of single-family homes are in high-fire-risk zones, the Times analysis found. In more than 70 of the ZIP  codes, less than 10 percent of homes are in those zones.\n\nMr. Lara’s deputy commissioner, Mike Peterson, acknowledged in an interview that insurers will probably gravitate toward those lower-risk homes. But he predicted that those opportunities “will be sucked up very quickly, which will force everybody into the more-fire-risk areas.”\n\nInsurers who cannot or choose not to meet the 85-percent requirement can still qualify for the new rate increases. A pair of what industry lobbyists called “offramps” were negotiated as alternatives to the 85 percent rule. Insurers can claim hardship and petition the commissioner for a waiver; or they can take advantage of an option, originally intended just for small companies, that requires only that they increase the number of policies they have in the designated distressed zones by 5 percent over the previous year.\n\n“We decided to include the 5 percent option in order to give all companies a way to incrementally get to the 85 percent target in a way that is sustainable and doesn’t put their solvency at risk,” said Michael Soller, Mr. Lara’s spokesman.\n\nBut the way the provision was written meant that insurers that had spent much of 2024 dumping customers by the tens of thousands would, at least initially, be able to meet an even lower bar.\n\nEight days after the deal was announced in September 2023, Foremost Insurance reported that it had already begun to drop policies in fire-prone areas across the state.\n\nOver the following five months, as Mr. Lara’s office was writing the regulations, three insurers followed suit: Farmers Insurance, CSAA and State Farm.\n\nThese companies told Mr. Lara that they would be dropping more than 50,000 policies in more than 800 ZIP codes, heavily concentrated in the most fire-prone areas of the state.\n\nThis was a different thing entirely than declining to write policies for new customers. It meant that even people whose homes met underwriting standards and who had paid their premiums on time weren’t safe.\n\nBesides Pacific Palisades and other Los Angeles County communities like Calabasas and Brentwood, some of the hardest-hit neighborhoods were in Contra Costa, Santa Cruz and Santa Clara counties, the Times review found. In one ZIP code in Los Gatos, a forested town pressed up against the foothills of the Santa Cruz mountains, State Farm indicated that it would dump two out of three of its customers, and Farmers said it would dump half.\n\nYvette Curran got her nonrenewal notice from Farmers n January 2024. Effective in April, the company would no longer insure her home in the hills north of Santa Cruz. She had been a loyal customer for 12 years.\n\n“What do you do?” she said. “There’s no nobody else to insure you.”\n\nSimilar stories were unfolding across the state. In Lake County in Northern California, where more than 2,000 homes and 65 percent of the land area has burned in a series of devastating fires over the last decade, Foremost dropped the vast majority of its customers; Farmers also issued  nonrenewal notices there, but was more selective.\n\n“I can’t go to the grocery store or walk into a coffee shop or go to a Rotary meeting where there isn’t a couple or three folks who have a horrific story about being nonrenewed,” said Mike McGuire, the California State Senate leader, who represents Lake County.\n\nRex Frazier, president of the Personal Insurance Federation of California, said the nonrenewals occurred at a time when insurers were not yet certain of what the final rules would be, and “needed to respond to their mounting financial problems.”\n\nBut Governor Newsom was frustrated, aides said. Insurers had issued nonrenewals in large numbers before, but this wave came after the industry and the state had struck their deal.\n\nMr. Lara said in an interview that he was angry, too. “I was livid, and yes, I did feel like we were being bullied,” he said. But whatever he felt privately, he said little in public, telling The Times that he felt it would be counterproductive to berate the very companies he was trying to woo back.\n\nYet the state effectively rewarded their behavior by grandfathering in the nonrenewals when it finalized the regulations. Companies like State Farm and Foremost that had dumped more than 5 percent of their customers in fire zones could now add back that 5 percent — perhaps in a lower-risk part of a ZIP code — and still qualify to charge the new higher rates.\n\nBy the time the department put the finishing touches on the regulatory package in December 2024, the state had offered two additional carrots to the industry. One was a cap on the amount of wildfire-related losses that insurance companies comprising the FAIR plan previously had to shoulder. Now, anything above $500 million would have to be borne by residential policyholders across the state. The other was to let insurers factor into their rate calculations the cost of reinsurance, which they buy to hedge the risk of an expensive catastrophe.\n\nConsumer Watchdog, an advocacy group that by law represents California policy holders in rate hearings, estimated that the reinsurance provision alone could raise premiums by an additional 40 percent.\n\nEight days after state officials put the final piece of the new regulations into place, wildfires swept through Los Angeles.\n\nIn their aftermath, Mr. Lara imposed a 1-year moratorium on nonrenewals, but only in the fire-affected areas. It will expire in January 2026.\n\nInsurers already have applied to charge their residential customers $425 million in losses incurred by the FAIR plan in the January fires, based on the new pass-through approved by Mr. Lara.  Consumer Watchdog has filed a lawsuit challenging those assessments.\n\nThe incentive to shed customers in risky areas remains in place for insurers that have yet to file for rate increases under the new system.\n\nSo far, five companies — serving 20 percent of the California market —- have filed for increases. Mr. Lara said that is a promising sign that the new incentives are luring insurers back.\n\nBut the total number of policies they say they will add in distressed areas — 2,500 — is not really a net gain, because it does not take into account the number of policies that some of those same companies dropped since the deal was announced.\n\nThose companies now stand to collect nearly $250 million in additional premiums. Each filed for rate increases just under the 7 percent threshold that would trigger the requirement for public hearings, and could seek additional increases later.\n\nPeople living in hazardous fire zones will probably see rate hikes much larger, since the rate filing is an average, Mr. Lara’s spokesman said.\n\nMeanwhile, the number of homeowners resorting to the FAIR plan has not gone down, as hoped, but doubled. Operators of the plan last month asked for a rate increase of nearly 36 percent. Nor have home buyers found it any easier to obtain insurance. The percentage of realtors reporting that they had deals fall through for lack of insurance has more than doubled since 2023, to 16.6 percent.\n\nThe trends so far suggest that the regulatory package will do little to help homeowners get the coverage they need, said Jamie Court, Consumer Watchdog’s president.\n\n“This isn’t the balanced deal the insurance commissioner sold to Californians,” he said. “It’s a giant giveaway to insurers.”\n\nMr. Lara said state officials will not know if the overhaul worked for another year, at least.\n\nIn the meantime, he said, he was grateful for the Times analysis, and had asked his staff to be on the lookout for the issues it raised. He said the state would make adjustments if needed.\n\n“There’s no guarantees,” he said. “But our current system doesn’t have guarantees, either.”\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this investigation, The New York Times obtained and analyzed a range of data sources.\n\nCalifornia’s Department of Insurance publishes a list of ZIP codes and counties that meet the new insurance regulations’ definition of “distressed.” The Times cross-referenced those designations with the state’s fire hazard maps (focusing, as the regulations do, on “high” and “very high” risk zones), as well as a Federal Emergency Management Agency data set of building outlines. This allowed reporters to compare the number of homes inside those hazard zones versus outside of them. The Times used ZIP code boundaries published by the state’s Department of Technology, ultimately based on boundaries sourced from TomTom, and excluded ZIP codes containing fewer than 100 single-family home structures from those analyses.\n\nTo obtain data on thousands of policies that were canceled by insurers, known as “block nonrenewals” in industry parlance, The Times examined regulatory filings submitted by insurers. (That information is not otherwise readily available because the Department of Insurance does not publish statistics on block nonrenewals.) The Times focused on filings by companies in California’s three largest homeowners insurance groups, measured by total “direct premiums written” in 2023: State Farm Group, Farmers Insurance Group (which also owns Foremost Insurance), and CSAA. These filings indicate the number nonrenewals being undertaken or planned in each California ZIP code. Because insurers do not indicate the specific date any given nonrenewal was planned, The Times analyses focused on the dates insurers submitted the relevant filing exhibits.\n\nNicholas Bogel-Burroughs contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/01/world/africa/trump-nigeria-military.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"19:33:55-04:00","title":"Trump Threatens Military Action in Nigeria Over Protections for Christians","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump threatened military action against Nigeria, accusing its government of failing to protect Christians and designating the country a 'country of particular concern' for religious freedom violations.

potential military action and said the United States might cut off aid, accusing the West African country’s government of failing to protect Christians.\n\nMr. Trump said in a post on social media that he was instructing the Pentagon “to prepare for possible action” to wipe out “Islamic Terrorists” in the country. “If we attack,” he wrote, “it will be fast, vicious, and sweet, just like the terrorist thugs attack our CHERISHED Christians!”\n\nThe announcement came a day after Mr. Trump said he would designate Nigeria a country of particular concern, a label given by the government for nations “engaged in severe violations of religious freedom.” He claimed on social media on Friday that “Christianity is facing an existential threat in Nigeria,” adding that thousands of Christians were facing targeted violence — a claim made by some evangelical groups and U.S. lawmakers.\n\nNigeria has denied the accusations, and its president, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, on Saturday defended the country’s protection of religious groups, before Mr. Trump’s threat.\n\nThe characterization of Nigeria “as religiously intolerant does not reflect our national reality, nor does it take into consideration the consistent and sincere efforts of the government to safeguard freedom of religion and beliefs for all Nigerians,” he said in a statement, responding to Mr. Trump’s announcement on Friday.\n\nMr. Trump’s threat of military action faces major challenges. The United States withdrew its forces last year from Niger, to Nigeria’s north, and airstrikes would most likely seek to target small groups scattered across a large area. Effective military action against these groups, analysts say, is likely to require assistance from the Nigerian military and government — which Mr. Trump also threatened to cut off from assistance.\n\nAround 220 million people live in Nigeria, and parts of the country have long suffered violence at the hands of extremist groups, including Boko Haram, an Islamist terror group that has attacked Christians and Muslims it does not consider faithful enough.\n\nBut there are also secessionists in the south, criminal groups known for kidnappings in the northwest and other violent groups with their own motives.\n\nExtremist violence in the country “affects large numbers of Christians and Muslims in several states across Nigeria,” the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom found in 2024.\n\nMr. Trump has already targeted American aid work around the world, working to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development, which has long been central to distributing foreign aid. Nigeria has been a major recipient of U.S. global health funding, relying on it for about 21 percent of its national health budget.\n\nRuth Maclean, Eric Schmitt and Helene Cooper contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgkk841r4eo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"20:27:57.332+00:00","title":"Anger lingers in Serbia a year after train station tragedy","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"One year after a deadly collapse at the Novi Sad railway station in Serbia killed 16 people, including children and an elderly man, public anger persists.

sea of people flowed along the roads leading up to Novi Sad railway station.\n\nThey came in their tens of thousands to remember the 16 people who died there this time last year, on another unseasonably warm and sunny autumn day.\n\nThe victims were standing or sitting underneath a concrete canopy at the recently-renovated facility, when it collapsed. The two youngest were just six years old, the oldest, 77.\n\nRegular protests have rocked Serbia in the 12 months that have followed. But on Saturday morning, the huge crowd participated in an event that put the emphasis on quiet commemoration.\n\nAt 11:52 (10:52 GMT), the time of the disaster, they observed a silence for 16 minutes - one for each of the victims. Family members cried. One woman needed to be physically supported by men wearing the red berets of armed forces veterans.\n\nAfter the silence, relatives laid flowers at the front of the station.\n\nThe rubble of the collapsed canopy has been cleared away, but otherwise the building appears to have remained untouched since the disaster.\n\nTwisted metal protruding from the walls and broken glass still offer evidence of the catastrophe.\n\nNovi Sad station was supposed to be a symbol of Serbia's progress, under President Aleksandar Vučić's Progressive Party. The country's second city would be a key stop on the high-speed railway line whipping passengers from Belgrade to Budapest in less than three hours.\n\nVučić and Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban jointly opened the renovated facility in 2022. Its angular, Yugoslav-era form had been upgraded as part of the high-speed project.\n\nBut now, after another renovation and the disaster that followed, the station stands as the prime example of everything that is wrong in Serbia.\n\nFor the government's flagship infrastructure project to prove deadly to its citizens was more than many people could bear. They took to the streets, carrying placards reading \"corruption kills\".\n\nUniversity students quickly took leadership.\n\nAnti-government demonstrations are not exactly a novelty in Serbia, but in contrast to previous movements which fizzled out, the student-led anti-corruption protests have persisted.\n\n\"Every other protest movement was organised by political opposition parties and people in Serbia don't trust them,\" says Aleksa, a 23-year-old management student at Novi Sad University.\n\n\"We are the most trusted group in the country - that's why, even though we have made mistakes, people believe in us.\"\n\nThe students have shunned the opposition parties. After initially demanding accountability from the authorities, they are now calling for fresh elections.\n\nThey plan to submit a list of independent, expert candidates who could run a technocratic government. This would, they say, be the best way to rid Serbian institutions of the cronyism and corruption which they hold responsible for the railway station disaster.\n\nIn September, 13 people, including former construction, infrastructure and Transport Minister Goran Vesić, were charged in a criminal case over the collapse.\n\nA  resolution in the European Parliament last month called for full and transparent legal proceedings  and an assessment \"of potential corruption or negligence\" - underlining the \"need to examine more broadly the extent to which corruption led to the lowering of safety standards and contributed to this tragedy\".\n\nThe government has denied accusations of corruption.\n\nThe student protesters' approach has gained the respect of some opposition leaders.\n\n\"They showed integrity and perseverance,\" says Biljana Djordjević, an MP and co-leader of the Green-Left Front.\n\n\"The new generation have found their way of participating, that is the difference this time. They have cut across generations in the families, we always wanted them to be more vocal, and now they are.\"\n\nPolitical scientist Srdjan Cvijić, from the Belgrade Centre for Security Policy, believes the students have cut through in a way that Serbia's opposition parties simply could no longer do.\n\n\"Until last year, the regime had been effectively managing to render traditional politics disgusting to the overall population,\" he says.\n\n\"They haven't managed to do so with the student movement and the result is that the student movement has managed to pierce into the traditional electorate of the ruling party in a way that nobody previously managed to do.\"\n\nPerhaps this explains a sudden change in tone from President Vučić. He has generally taken a combative line with the protesters, accusing them of attempting a \"colour revolution\" - the kind of popular movements that were behind pro-European protests which toppled governments in European countries in earlier years.\n\nThese changes in former Soviet republics in the early years of the 21st Century pushed the likes of Georgia and Ukraine in a pro-EU direction.\n\nBut on the eve of the commemoration, Vučić apologised for his fiery rhetoric towards protesters, claiming that he had \"said some things that I am now sorry for saying\".\n\nThe students responded dismissively. They told the president, \"You have blood on your hands.\"\n\nThis day may have been about respect and remembrance. But the anger remains."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm277455158o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"16:46:12.204+00:00","title":"Delays at US airports as staff absences surge, aviation agency says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A government shutdown has triggered a surge in air traffic controller absences, leading to severe delays and cancellations at major US airports, including in New York.

former Canadian prime minister and an American pop star who has toured the world and reached the edge of space.\n\nJustin Trudeau and Katy Perry have made it official. The couple were spotted holding hands in Paris last weekend as they left the Crazy Horse cabaret, where they had been celebrating Perry's 41st birthday.\n\nWhile they may seem an unlikely duo, Trudeau and Perry – who have both been in the spotlight for the better part of the last decade – have more in common than some might think. And their budding romance is not entirely unprecedented in Canadian political history.\n\nThe pairing also allows them to change the conversation after a year in which both have faced hits to their reputations.\n\nThe relationship is a \"rebranding for both of them in a very interesting and unexpected way\", says Jose Rodriguez, a professor of communication studies at California State University Long Beach.\n\nPartnering with a statesman creates a credible bridge for Perry into civic and philanthropic endeavours, he adds. It expands her audience and access to a politically engaged public, and global organisations outside the music industry.\n\nFor Trudeau, 53, the California Girls singer helps his new persona because she is in \"a softer arena\", Mr Rodriguez says, rather than the tough world of politics.\n\nAt the core of it is simple human connection, too, observers note. Both are newly single - Trudeau and his wife separated in 2023 - and this is the first post-split high-profile romance for both.\n\nThe romance rumours between them began swirling in late July, when the two were spotted having dinner together at Le Violon, a swanky restaurant in the heart of Montreal.\n\nTwo days later, Trudeau was spotted attending Perry's show in the city, singing along to her hits Firework and Teenage Dream.\n\nThen, in mid-October, images of them kissing aboard Perry's yacht off the coast of Santa Barbara, California, went viral.\n\nNeither Trudeau nor Perry have publicly spoken about their romance. Their representatives did not respond to the BBC's requests for comments. But before the weekend photos landed, the singer appeared to hint at the relationship during a London tour stop last month.\n\nA fan in the audience proposed to her shortly after photos of her and Trudeau canoodling surfaced.\n\n\"You know, you really should have asked me about 48 hours ago,\" Perry responded.\n\nEven though many may not have seen it coming, observers say their getting together helps serve their individual public images.\n\nAfter becoming a global progressive icon when he was catapulted into Canada's highest office in 2015, Trudeau was forced to resign earlier this year after his popularity plummeted.\n\nDespite winning a sweeping majority a decade ago - promising \"sunny ways\" domestically while being admired for his youthful charm abroad - it did not take long for scandals to tarnish his image.\n\nA series of luxury vacations drew criticism for being tone-deaf - including one trip to the private island of the Aga Khan in the Bahamas, which was found to have violated federal conflict-of-interest laws. Trudeau then faced another controversy in 2019 after old photos of him in blackface surfaced, forcing him to issue a public apology.\n\nBy the end of his tenure, Canadians had grown frustrated with his leadership and were ready to move on.\n\nPerry has similarly faced a crop of undesirable headlines after riding high for years.\n\nThe singer was enjoying the height of pop stardom in the 2010s, churning out consistent hits, and her bold, colourful style helped define pop culture. In 2018, Billboard magazine named her one of the greatest popstars of the 21st Century.\n\nBut scandal found her, too. Her newest album, 143, was panned by critics as her worst artistic effort to date. The Guardian called it \"some way short of a total catastrophe\", while the Telegraph called it \"disastrous\".\n\nAnd earlier this year, she was mocked for taking part in an all-woman Blue Origin space flight with billionaire Jeff Bezos' wife Lauren Sanchez and CBS anchor Gayle King. Perry acknowledged the criticism in April, saying \"I'm not perfect\" but that \"the internet is very much a dumping ground for the unhinged and unhealed\".\n\nThen came the split between her and Bloom, who she was with after her marriage to comedian Russell Brand fell apart in 2011.\n\n\"When you're in the middle of an unfortunate storyline, the best thing you can do is move onto a different storyline,\" notes Los Angeles Times pop music critic Mikael Wood.\n\nThe relationship with Trudeau \"changes the subject from a flop album and from a tour that seemed a little thirsty and misguided, and makes us talk about something else\".\n\nThe measured roll-out of the relationship also seemed to ease observers into the romance.\n\nProf Rodriguez notes that the optics of them appearing together in Paris was \"a high signal, low speech confirmation\" of their affection that allowed the visuals to do the work.\n\n\"Each has weathered scrutiny, so a carefully staged relationship narrative can re-index attention around vitality, optimism and cross-domain relevance.\"\n\nThe pair do have things in common.\n\nPerry and Trudeau are ideologically aligned, LA-based music writer Gerrick Kennedy observes, being \"anti-establishment\" disruptors in their respective fields.\n\nPerry herself is no stranger to activism and politics, having performed at multiple campaign events in 2016 for Democratic US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, and publicly endorsed Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.\n\nShe is a vocal advocate for LGBTQ rights and has supported various feminist charities and causes - issues that Trudeau had also publicly backed (he famously made gender-parity in cabinet central to his policy).\n\nThey also each appear to be dedicated parents to their young children. Perry's four-year-old daughter, Daisy, features frequently on her Instagram. Trudeau's Instagram shows he spent the summer taking each of his three children on separate holidays.\n\nBy dating Perry, Trudeau is charting a different path post-politics than his predecessors, who often assume high-level consulting gigs or join law firms.\n\nIt is, however, on-brand for a prime minister who was always unusual, says Michael Mulvey, a marketing professor at the University of Ottawa.\n\nAs the son of another former prime minister, Pierre Eliott Trudeau, he grew up in the spotlight. One of the earliest photos of him is of an infant Justin being held by former US First Lady Pat Nixon.\n\nAfter the separation from his wife, the youngest Trudeau could not escape the inevitable comparisons to his father, who also separated from his first wife and the mother of his children, Margaret, while in office.\n\nThe senior Trudeau had his own famous flings, namely with American singer Barbra Streisand and Canadian actress Kim Cattrall, of Sex and the City fame.\n\n\"There's no question that we see history repeating itself,\" says Jonathan Malloy, a professor of political science at Carleton University in Ottawa.\n\nBut Prof Mulvey notes that there are others who connect with his human experience of being a newly single dad.\n\nNot long after his exit from politics, Trudeau posted a photo of himself buying kitchenware, which commentators took as him signalling the start of his \"divorced dad era\".\n\n\"There are probably some people that hope he gets it together, has a cooling off period from the post-divorce trauma and gets on with his life,\" Prof Mulvey says."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly44qwgnx0o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"05:31:42.696+00:00","title":"China to loosen chip export ban to Europe following Netherlands row","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"China has announced a loosening of its chip export ban to Europe following the Netherlands' intervention in Nexperia, a Chinese-owned chipmaker, citing 'serious governance shortcomings.'

following Netherlands row\n\nBeijing has said it will loosen a chip export ban it imposed after Dutch authorities took over Nexperia, a Chinese-owned chipmaker based in the Netherlands.\n\nIn September, the Netherlands invoked  a Cold War-era law  to take control of Nexperia, stating \"serious governance shortcomings\" which could impact the availability of chips - which are critical for making cars - in an emergency.\n\nChina said in response that it would not re-export Nexperia chips completed in its Chinese factories to Europe. Last month, the likes of Volvo Cars and Volkswagen warned it could lead to temporary shutdowns at their plants.\n\nOn Saturday, Beijing said it would consider exempting individual firms from the ban.\n\nAround 70% of Nexperia chips made in Europe are sent to China to be completed and re-exported to other countries.\n\nOn Saturday, the Chinese government said: \"We will comprehensively consider the actual situation of enterprises and grant exemptions to exports that meet the criteria.\"\n\nIt did not elaborate on what that criteria is, but criticised \"the Dutch government's improper intervention in the internal affairs of enterprises\" which, it said, led to \"the current chaos in the global supply chain\".\n\nLast week, in a letter seen by the Reuters news agency, Nexperia told customers it would stop sending chips to China to be processed. It said it was developing \"alternative solutions to ensure supply continuity\" for customers.\n\nNexperia is headquartered in the Netherlands but owned by Wingtech, a company backed by the Chinese government, which acquired the Dutch business in 2018.\n\nIn October, Zhang Xuezheng, Nexperia's chief executive and the founder of Wingtech, was ousted as the firm's boss after a Dutch court suspended him as a director.\n\nThe Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs said at the time it was concerned about \"serious managerial shortcomings\" under his leadership and \"observed that Nexperia's operations in Europe were being compromised in an unacceptable manner\".\n\nLast month, the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA) had warned Nexperia chip supplies would only last a few weeks unless the Chinese ban was lifted.\n\n\"Without these chips, European automotive suppliers cannot build the parts and components needed to supply vehicle manufacturers and this therefore threatens production stoppages,\" the group said.\n\nThe latest plans by Beijing to relax its export controls have emerged after US President Donald Trump and Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping met in South Korea earlier this week.\n\nTrump later said the leaders  discussed chips , while Beijing's post-meeting readout did not explicitly mention any area of trade.\n\nThe White House is expected to release a fact sheet later on Saturday detailing its new trade agreement with China.\n\nIn December 2024, the US government placed Chinese chip manufacturer Wingtech on its so-called \"entity list\", identifying the company as a national security concern.\n\nIn the UK, Nexperia was forced to sell its silicon chip plant in Newport after MPs and ministers expressed national security concerns. It currently owns a UK facility in Stockport."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnvee260n8eo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"16:47:30.481+00:00","title":"ACA open enrollment begins with spike in healthcare premiums","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the open enrollment period for the Affordable Care Act marketplace begins, millions of Americans face potentially devastating increases in health insurance costs—up to 114% without subsidies—threatening the continuation of coverage for those relying on tax credits.

It can either make full payments by Monday, or partial payments by Wednesday, to spare low-income Americans from hardship.\n\nThe written order by Judge John J. McConnell of the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island underscored the vast uncertainty that still surrounds the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, whose roughly 42 million recipients remain in the dark as to when they may see their next round of benefits.\n\nA spokeswoman for the White House budget office did not respond to a request for comment. Late Friday, President Trump predicted that food stamp aid would “unfortunately be delayed” in November, and warned that the payments would not begin until he received “appropriate legal direction” from the court.\n\nThe legal saga began earlier that day, when Judge McConnell told the Trump administration that it must tap an existing, emergency reserve in order to pay for SNAP starting Saturday, when its typical budget was set to run out. Absent that intervention, the administration’s actions would have cut off assistance to the roughly one in eight Americans who are enrolled in the program.\n\nBut the thrust of the judge’s order raised logistical questions. The SNAP reserve totals about $5 billion, less than the roughly $8 billion needed to pay full SNAP benefits each month. Even if they used the money, officials at the Agriculture Department had also warned they might have to slash benefits by more than half, and that it could take weeks to pay them out because of technical constraints.\n\nSo, on Saturday, Judge McConnell clarified his ruling, citing the president’s request, and offered the Trump administration a timeline.\n\nHe said the government “must make” a partial payment by Wednesday, but he also encouraged federal officials to explore the use of a second source of money that might allow it to pay SNAP benefits more quickly and in full. He pointed specifically to a pot of funds at the Agriculture Department largely composed of tariff revenue, which the government had used earlier in the shutdown to preserve another federal nutrition program.\n\nThe judge said that the two funding sources, combined, could reduce any delay in delivering SNAP benefits, and alleviate “irreparable harm” facing families — and he ordered the administration to make those full payments by Monday.\n\nIt remained unclear how the Trump administration might proceed — or, potentially, if it might appeal the ruling. The Justice Department appeared to signal the mere possibility in a late Friday filing with the court, hinting that it was “considering whether any emergency relief is required.”\n\nA spokesman for the agency did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/01/opinion/shutdown-congress-power-federal-snap.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"07:00:10-04:00","title":"Congress Is Dying in Real Time","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article discusses a deepening crisis within Congress, which is currently experiencing a government shutdown entering its second month.

transparency about the funding of a new ballroom, but the White House withheld the identities of several donors to the project, including some with business before the administration, The New York Times found.\n\nA list released last month by the White House of more than three dozen donors omitted donation amounts, as well as the names of several individuals and companies that collectively have billions of dollars riding on the outcome of administration policy decisions.\n\nThe rush of major business interests to fund a pet project of Mr. Trump’s has reinforced a perception in corporate America that the ballroom is a way to curry favor with, or seek protection from, a president who has repeatedly demonstrated a willingness to use the levers of government to help allies and punish foes.\n\nAmong the donors not disclosed by the White House are a pair of health care companies seeking to protect or expand Medicare reimbursement for their products, as well as the Wall Street powerhouse BlackRock, whose bid to acquire a stake in Panama Canal ports has been supported by Mr. Trump amid opposition from China. Another is Jeff Yass, a major investor in TikTok’s parent company who could benefit from a Trump-backed deal to keep the social media app up and running in the United States.\n\nThe chip-making giant Nvidia, which could be the beneficiary of a deal with the Trump administration to facilitate trade with China, was also not on the list of donors released by the White House. But last week the company’s chief executive revealed that it was among the donors, saying he was “proud to contribute in a small way to what will be a historic and national monument for our country.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Livestock\n\nPublished: 2025-10-31T12:44:14-04:00\n\nIsaiah Beck, a carpenter, was trying to reach his storm-battered house in the New River community in St. Elizabeth parish, on Jamaica’s storm-battered southwestern coast. His home was on the other side of a large pool of chest-high water.\n\nBut he thought better of it when he saw the dead livestock.\n\n“There is a dead cow and hog; the water is starting to get infested,” he said. “The water is coming from all sides.”\n\nThree days after Hurricane Melissa roared across Jamaica, many people in communities stricken by the powerful storm find themselves trapped by floodwaters that keep rising, apparently because of a drainage system that had become blocked.\n\nThe hurricane, one of the strongest ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean, ripped through several island nations, leaving behind death and widespread destruction.\n\nAt least 19 people were killed in Jamaica, and at least 30, including children, in Haiti, officials said. Jamaican officials said they expected the death toll to climb as the authorities reached and searched through the worst hit areas.\n\nThe Jamaican authorities would be “all-hands on deck” to help the country recover from “unimaginable” devastation, the country’s information minister, Dana Morris Dixon, said at a news conference.\n\nIn New River, where there was still no power on Friday, residents said they thought the worst of the storm was behind them — until the water started coming. Water began seeping into people’s homes two days ago and started rising considerably again on Friday, residents said.\n\nAt the height of the storm, one person said, the wind kept peeling the roofs off homes, forcing people to run from house to house in search of safe shelter.\n\nBefore the storm, Mr. Beck said, he had been boarding up windows at a local infirmary, and ended up riding out the storm there.\n\nWhen he was able to get back to his home, he said, the roof had been torn off.\n\n“My house is rubbish,” Mr. Beck said.\n\nReginald Campbell, 64, dragged cushions and mattresses into the sunlight from his flooded house.\n\n“I am trying to get some sun on it because it is starting to stink,” he shouted from his porch, which was surrounded by water.\n\nMr. Campbell said the blocked drainage system was causing the water to keep rising.\n\n“We are anxious,” he said.\n\nElsewhere, a man with a chain saw tackled a palm tree that had fallen across his front yard. He climbed another tree that had power lines draped across it, trying to cut it down.\n\nAbout 2,000 feet down the road, drone footage of the area showed the dead cow and pig that had given Mr. Beck pause. People in houses with roofs torn off peeked through windows in homes surrounded by water. Those with a bit of exposed land had scattered their belongings outside to try to dry them in the sun.\n\nTwo little boys, one barefoot and both shirtless, walked down the street carrying their belongings in plastic bags on their heads. They reached a large pool of water and debated going further.\n\nThey waded through the knee-high water.\n\nWeston Brown, who works as an embalmer for funeral homes, drove to check the conditions at the Bailey Parlor funeral home, which had part of its roof torn off.\n\nMr. Brown was certain that the death toll would rise, as the authorities received more and more reports of bodies deteriorating inside homes.\n\n“We are going to have more people dying,” he said. “People are going to start dying from hunger.”\n\nEmiliano Rodríguez Mega contributed reporting from Mexico City.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/01/us/harvard-medical-school-explosion.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"18:15:34-04:00","title":"‘Intentional’ Explosion Took Place at Harvard Medical School, Officials Say","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"An intentional explosion occurred at the Goldenson building of Harvard Medical School in Boston at 2:48 a.m. on November 1, 2025, prompting a rapid response from Harvard University Police, the Boston Fire Department, and the FBI.

On the fire line, levels regularly exceeded 500.\n\nThe fire began on July 1 after a lightning storm passed over the Shasta-Trinity National Forest.\n\nThe fire began on July 1 after a lightning storm passed over the Shasta-Trinity National Forest.\n\nBy July 16, much of the area was shrouded in smoke.\n\nBy July 16, much of the area was shrouded in smoke.\n\nThat afternoon, a bulldozer carved a containment line that firefighters would expand by carefully burning a wide swath around it, depriving the flames of more fuel.\n\nThat afternoon, a bulldozer carved a containment line that firefighters would expand by carefully burning a wide swath around it, depriving the flames of more fuel.\n\nForest Service crews had to hike up a ridge to get to the line.

Visibility was good, and the air didn’t smell smoky. But our monitors showed readings well into hazardous levels.\n\nAround 6 p.m., the La Grande Hotshots started their shift and set off toward the fire line.\n\nCapt. Nick Schramm, a crew leader, assumed the air was reasonably safe. He has done this work for nearly two decades, and like most firefighters, he often has coughing fits after long shifts. But he believes that exposure to hazardous air is unavoidable.\n\n“That’s just the harsh truth,” he said later.\n\nAs climate change makes fire seasons worse, several states have tried to shield outdoor workers from wildfire smoke, which can contain poisons like arsenic, benzene and lead. California now requires employers to monitor air quality during fires, and to provide breaks and masks when the air turns unhealthy.\n\nBut these rules don’t apply on the wildfires themselves, because state agencies and private companies successfully argued that those constraints would get in the way of fighting fires.\n\nUntil recently, federal firefighters weren’t even allowed to wear masks on the job. Masks are now provided, but they are still banned during the most arduous work, closest to the fire. The Forest Service says face coverings could cause heatstroke, though wildland firefighters in other countries regularly use masks without this problem.\n\nAs crews descended the ridge toward the fire line, the levels of toxic particles nearly doubled.\n\nAs crews descended the ridge toward the fire line, the levels of toxic particles nearly doubled.\n\nFirefighters say that during their shifts they worry more about immediate dangers — falling trees, burns, sharp tools — than about smoke exposure. As the La Grande crew hiked down the steep terrain, Lily Barnes, a squad leader, concentrated on keeping her footing.\n\nBack home in the off-season, she sometimes wonders what the smoke is doing to her body, she said in an interview. “Maybe I’ll realize one day I shouldn’t have been doing this work.”\n\nOn the fire line, the La Grande crew waited for conditions to be right to burn away vegetation.

But our readings showed that it was just as hazardous.\n\nMany firefighters believe that if they can sidestep visible plumes of smoke, they will be in somewhat safer air. But our readings showed that it was just as hazardous.\n\nThe handbook issued to Forest Service crews has 10 words of guidance for smoke exposure on the fire line: “If needed, rotate resources in and out of smoky areas.” The agency declined to comment for this story, but in the past has told The Times that while exposure cannot be completely eliminated, rotating crews helps limit risk.\n\nIn practice, according to interviews with hundreds of firefighters, workers feel as though they are sent into smoke and then forgotten. Over months of reporting, Times journalists never saw a boss pull a crew back because of exposure.\n\nEven experienced supervisors can’t tell exactly how unhealthy the air is just by looking.\n\nChuy Elguezabal, the La Grande superintendent, says he pulls his crews out of smoke when it becomes impossible for them to work — when they cannot see or breathe, or they are overcome by headaches and coughing fits.\n\nOn the Green fire, he said, the smoke seemed like more of an inconvenience, like the 105-degree daytime heat or the poison oak that had given many of the firefighters weeping sores.\n\nSince the 1990s, Forest Service researchers have suggested giving crews wearable air sensors, but the agency hasn’t done it. Other dangerous workplaces, like coal mines, have long been required to monitor airborne hazards.\n\nA 1999 Forest Service report that recommended wearable air monitors.\n\nOn the Green fire, The Times used a device that weighs as much as a deck of cards and costs about $200.\n\nLast year, firefighters wore the same devices during a small federal research project to measure their exposure. For hours, those readings stayed at 1,000 — as high as the monitors go — according to Zach Kiehl, a consultant who worked on the project.\n\nMr. Kiehl said that ideally, crews would be issued monitors to know when to put on masks or pull back from a smoky area. “You can pay now and prevent future cases, or pay out later when a person is losing a husband or a father,” he said.\n\nThe La Grande crew has been working in heavy smoke for hours now. They spray water to make sure the fire doesn’t reach the treetops, where it can’t be contained.\n\nThe La Grande crew has been working in heavy smoke for hours now.

They think the exposure was fleeting.\n\nIn fact, the monitors show, the air was never safe.\n\nTo measure particulate concentrations at the Green fire, The Times followed U.S. Forest Service crews and carried two Atmotube PRO sensors. These portable, inexpensive monitors are the same as those the Forest Service has tested in the field.\n\nWe consulted with Dr. Aishah Shittu, an environmental health scientist, and Dr. Jim McQuaid, an atmospheric scientist, both from the University of Leeds. They are co-authors of a study showing that Atmotube Pro sensors demonstrated good performance for measuring fine particulate matter concentrations despite being a fraction of the size of reference-grade models. We also developed our approach in consultation with experts from the Interior Department and the Forest Service.\n\nOn the Green fire, the sensors recorded minute-by-minute averages of airborne particles that are 2.5 micrometers in diameter or smaller. The Times then matched these readings with time stamps and locations from a satellite-enabled GPS watch.\n\nGenerally, the harm associated with PM2.5 levels is calculated based on a 24-hour average. Here, for near-real-time monitoring on the fire line, we followed the guidance of Drs. Shittu and McQuaid by first averaging the readings from the two sensors and then calculating a 15-minute rolling average.\n\nUsing those figures, we categorized the health risks of PM2.5 exposure according to standards set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. We used standards meant for the public because there are no federal occupational standards for wildfire smoke exposure.\n\nAfter averaging, our data had a correlation coefficient of 0.98 and a mean coefficient of variation between the two sensors of 7.5 percent. The E.P.A. recommends that PM2.5 air measurements have a correlation coefficient of at least 0.7 and a mean coefficient of variation less than 30 percent. Our correlation and variance measures gave us confidence that the sensors were largely in agreement.\n\nThe 3-D base map in this article uses Google’s Photorealistic 3D Tiles, which draw from the following sources to create the tiles: Google; Airbus; Landsat / Copernicus; Data SIO, NOAA, U.S. Navy, NGA, GEBCO; IBCAO.\n\nAdditional reporting by Max Whittaker and Lauren McCarthy.

will be focused on a big race, full of colorful slogans and signs.\n\nNo, not the mayoral election. Sunday is the 54th New York City Marathon. Fifty thousand runners from all over the globe will be at the starting line, and thousands more New Yorkers will come out along the 26.2 mile course to cheer them as they attempt to finish what many consider the most challenging of the seven major marathons.\n\nWhether you’re running, cheering or maybe just trying to get around the city on Sunday to early vote, here’s what you need to know:\n\nLast year, the New York Road Runners, which organizes the event, tested out crossing zones in two locations in Brooklyn so that spectators and New Yorkers trying to get around had a way to cross the course. This year, they added two more in Manhattan.\n\nFollow the instructions of the volunteers at these spots to cross.\n\nBrooklyn: Lafayette Avenue and Fulton Street near Atlantic Terminal\n\nBrooklyn: Bedford and Broadway in Williamsburg\n\nManhattan: First Avenue at 72nd Street\n\nManhattan: First Avenue and 86th Street\n\nFor runners, the pre-race bag drop has moved to Central Park West between 69th and 70th streets on Friday and Saturday. Ted Metellus, the marathon’s director, said they moved it because people had trouble finding the bandshell near 72nd Street that the Road Runners used in previous years.\n\nAlso, the Road Runners have consolidated to one phone app. If people have already downloaded the NYRR app, they do not need to download a new one.\n\nWith partly cloudy skies and temperatures starting near 45 and warming to 57 by the afternoon, Sunday is shaping up to be decent for both runners and spectators. There will be a slight wind chill when the first waves start, but not unbearable. There also might be slight humidity in the air near the start but probably not bad and diminishing as the later waves begin their race.\n\nAfter the elite men’s race begins, the remaining runners are divided into five waves based on their expected finish times. This prevents runners from getting too jammed up in the early stages.\n\n8 a.m. Professional men’s wheelchair division\n\n8:02 a.m. Professional women’s wheelchair division\n\n8:22 a.m. Handcycle category and select athletes with disabilities\n\n8:35 a.m. Professional women\n\n9:05 a.m. Professional men\n\n9:10 a.m. Wave 1 of the remaining runners\n\n9:45 a.m. Wave 2\n\n10:20 a.m. Wave 3\n\n10:55 a.m. Wave 4\n\n11:30 a.m. Wave 5\n\nThe race begins on Staten Island, and then turns north through Brooklyn and Queens. Next, runners head west across the Queensboro Bridge into Manhattan, north into the Bronx and back to Manhattan. The finish line is in Central Park, near the West 60s\n\nwillis ave.

Here’s our full guide on where to watch the race, depending on what kind of experience you want to have.\n\nIf you’re looking for somewhere to watch that’s easy to reach from other parts of the city, you could go to Fourth and Flatbush Avenues in Brooklyn, near the Atlantic Avenue-Barclays Center station, which is served by the B, D, N, Q, R, 2, 3, 4 and 5 trains and the Long Island Rail Road.\n\nIf you’re looking for a place where your cheers could make a big difference, go to the Bronx. Mile 20, around 135th Street and Alexander Avenue, is a notoriously challenging part of the course where some runners hit the proverbial wall.\n\nAnd if you like to do your cheering in a crowd, the stretch of First Avenue from 59th to 96th Street in Manhattan, which is lined with bars and restaurants, is always jammed with spectators.\n\n9:30 a.m. Professional men’s wheelchair athletes\n\n9:40 a.m. Professional women’s wheelchair athletes\n\n11 a.m. Professional women\n\n11:15 a.m. Professional men\n\n11:55 a.m. on Remaining runners start crossing the finish line\n\n8:30 p.m. on Final runners start crossing the finish line\n\nLast year, the final two finishers arrived just after 9:30 p.m.\n\nThe upper level of the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, which connects Staten Island and Brooklyn, will close at 11 p.m. on Saturday and reopen at 4 p.m. on Sunday. The lower level will close at 7 a.m. on Sunday and reopen at 4 p.m. the same day.\n\nOther roads along the route will close starting from 6:30 to 9 a.m. on Sunday. Roads will reopen after most runners have passed through, starting at 6:30 p.m. in the early miles through 10:30 p.m. for First Avenue.\n\nThere will still be runners out along the route even after roads reopen, but they are supposed to move to the sidewalks.\n\nNo. While bicyclists used to routinely ride the course in the early morning hours despite it being officially against the rules, in 2023 a cyclist hit a pedestrian. Last year, the Road Runners cracked down on the practice, and they are repeating the warning this year as well: Anybody who tries to ride a bike on the course after roads close will be removed.\n\nIf you’re watching from home, you can catch the race live on ESPN2 and in Spanish on ESPN3 from 8 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. Eastern time. In New York, it will air locally on WABC-TV, Channel 7, from 7 a.m. to 1 p.m., with a view of the finish line from 10:30 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nABC will also broadcast from the finish line from 3 to 5 p.m. nationally, well after the pro runners finish, to showcase celebrity and regular runners as they complete the race.\n\nThe NYRR app will have uninterrupted livestreaming of all four professional races (men’s and women’s, wheelchair and open divisions) in full, as well as cameras streaming the entire race from certain locations along the course.\n\nThe app also allows you to track runners in real time.\n\nThere are plenty of well-known people in the race this year, some of whom are running  for the first time. Anthony Ramos, who was in the original cast of “Hamilton,” is running his first marathon with his brother, a high school guidance counselor, and with the Olympic marathoner Des Linden, who is coaching Mr. Ramos. Oliver Phelps, who played George Weasley in the Harry Potter movies, is also running his first marathon.\n\nSome musicians are running as well, including Ben Gibbard and Dave Depper from Death Cab for Cutie and N.O.R.E., a Queens native and hip-hop star. And “The Bachelor” and “The Bachelorette” reality shows are always well-represented, with Joey Graziadei, Tyler Cameron, Matt James, Zac Clark, Joe Amabile and Tanner Courtad all running.\n\nHere are the other celebrities running the race, several of whom are raising money for a charity:\n\nBryan Arenales\n\nNic Vansteenberghe\n\nAlexi Pappas\n\nPhil Keoghan\n\nClaire Holt\n\nChloe Lukasiak\n\nOlivia Maher\n\nTayshia Adams\n\nChristine Doan\n\nIsabelle Glasgow Jensen\n\nKaren Sarahi Gonzalez\n\nLauren Ridloff\n\nNev Schulman\n\nPatina Miller\n\nMerle Dandridge\n\nJordan Litz\n\nErrol Barnett\n\nIsaac Rochell\n\nRudy Valdez\n\nCasey Neistat\n\nBrooke Monk\n\nJudson Jones contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/31/books/zoe-wicomb-dead.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"10:01:09-04:00","title":"Zoë Wicomb, Acclaimed South African Author, Dies at 76","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Zoë Wicomb, a celebrated South African author of mixed-race heritage, died at 76 in Glasgow, UK, from a pulmonary embolism.

She was 76.\n\nHer death, at a hospital, was caused by a pulmonary embolism, said her husband, Roger Palmer.\n\nMs. Wicomb (pronounced WICK-um) grew up in a desert-like region of arid scrubland, within a country that enforced racial discrimination through law and terror. She left South Africa in 1970, she said, to put “the whole oppressiveness” she’d felt far behind her, and settled in Britain. She taught secondary school before embarking on an acclaimed literary career in her 30s.\n\nHer body of work was compact — four novels, two short-story collections and a book of essays — but she nevertheless became, the South African author and Nobel laureate J.M. Coetzee wrote in an email, “the most significant of the writers who quit South Africa in the 1970s to get away from the grinding pressures of apartheid.”\n\n“From her eyrie in Scotland, yet with roots deep in pre-colonial Africa,” Mr. Coetzee wrote, “she explored in one book after another the modalities of South African experience, in language whose wit and irony masked a deep seriousness.”\n\nMs. Wicomb’s first book, “You Can’t Get Lost in Cape Town,” was published in 1987 and garnered enthusiastic reviews. The American author and future Nobel laureate Toni Morrison offered a book-jacket blurb describing her work as “seductive, brilliant” and noting that “her talent glitters.” In a review for The New York Times, the novelist Bharati Mukherjee called her a “sophisticated storyteller who combines the open-endedness of contemporary fiction with the force of autobiography and the simplicity of family stories.”\n\nA collection of loosely connected stories, “Cape Town” offers scenes from the life of Frieda Shenton, a mixed-race girl growing up under apartheid, from childhood to young adulthood. Despite the city’s breadth, the world available to Frieda is constrained to segregated sections of trains and buses and unpaved sides of the road. As the novel’s title wryly suggests, in a way she cannot get lost in Cape Town.\n\nAt one point, Frieda describes a longing “for the veld of my childhood,” where geographical landmarks “blaze their permanence.” “Plump little buttocks of cacti squat as if lifting the skirts to pee, and the swollen fingers of vygies burst in clusters out of the stone, pointing the way,” Frieda observes. “In the veld you can always find your way home.”\n\nMs. Wicomb’s first novel, “David’s Story,” published in 2000, is set during South Africa’s transition out of apartheid. The main character, David Dirkse, a leader in the military arm of the previously outlawed African National Congress, is disoriented in the new political era. As he sets out to uncover the history of his mixed-raced  ancestors known as the Griquas, he finds himself on a hit list, possibly by embittered former colleagues or maybe by newer acquaintances.\n\nThe novel, Mr. Coetzee assessed at the time, was “beholden to no one in its politics” and “a huge step in the remaking of the South Africa novel.”\n\nIn 2013, Yale University awarded Ms. Wicomb the inaugural Windham Campbell Literature Prize for fiction, which came with a $150,000 purse.\n\n“The challenge,” she said of her aims as a novelist in an interview that year with the website 2paragraphs, “is to capture marginal voices, thus not only a matter of my voice but, rather, one of polyphony, the many different, even contradictory, voices that engage with each other.”\n\n“My project,” she added, “includes the recovery of minor, neglected or disparaged peoples and events.”\n\nZoë Charlotte Wicomb was born in Beeswater, in the Western Cape province, on Nov. 23, 1948, a few months after apartheid was formalized as government policy. She was the middle of three children of Robert Wicomb, a village schoolteacher and sheep farmer, and Rachel le Fleur, the daughter of a Griqua chief.\n\nAfrikaans, the language of Dutch colonizers, was predominately spoken in the region, but she told the newspaper The Scotsman in 2006 that her parents were committed to teaching her English so she would have a better chance in life than working in the region’s mines or as a domestic servant.\n\nShe wore out the only two works of English-language fiction available to her at home, Jane Austen’s “Pride and Prejudice” and Charles Dickens’s “Oliver Twist.” “I still love both,” Ms. Wicomb said in a 2017 interview for the website the Bookseller. “I was transported from the vulgarity of apartheid by books — books opened up different worlds, and brought freedom from an oppressive social order.”\n\nShe was around 13 when her mother died, and she was sent to live with an aunt to attend high school in a suburb of Cape Town. In 1968, she received a bachelor’s degree in English at the University of the Western Cape, which at the time was a segregated school. She said she was exposed to a larger canon of Western literary masterpieces, including works by Shakespeare and Chaucer, but life under apartheid remained suffocating.\n\n“I had never been to a theater, seen an art film, or come across any Black writing before I went abroad,” she said in an interview with the scholar Andrew van der Vlies, who edited her 2018 collection, “Race, Nation, Translation: South African Essays, 1990-2013.”\n\nAfter arriving in England, Ms. Wicomb said she was shocked by the overt racism she initially experienced. “At least with apartheid, one always knew one’s place,” she often remarked, according to Mr. Palmer. She taught at secondary schools while working toward a bachelor’s degree from the University of Reading in 1979. A decade later, she received a master’s degree in linguistics from the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow.\n\nIn what she described as a marriage of convenience after South Africa revoked her passport, she married a gay British friend, Martin Kaufman, in 1972, so she could more easily obtain a British passport for return visits to her home country.\n\nShe and Mr. Kaufman technically remained married until 2005. She filed for divorce that year so she could wed Mr. Palmer, an artist whom she first met in 1976 and with whom she had a daughter, Hannah. Her husband and daughter survive her, as do a brother, Neil, and three grandsons.\n\nMs. Wicomb followed Mr. Palmer for his teaching career, first to Nottingham, England, and then to Glasgow in 1987. Meanwhile, her discovery of other novelists who were women of color and from southern Africa, notably Bessie Head, inspired her to start writing.\n\nReading Ms. Head, she said, “gave me the courage or perhaps permission to write.”\n\nShe taught English and creative writing at the University of Strathclyde from 1994 to 2012 and also taught at universities in South Africa. She continued to dissect themes of dislocation and identity in a post-apartheid South Africa in two more novels — “Playing in the Light” (2006) and “October” (2014) — and a short-story collection, “The One That Got Away” (2008), set in Cape Town and Glasgow.\n\nHer last novel, “Still Life” (2020), chosen by The Times as one of the 10 best historical novels of the year, examined the life of Thomas Pringle, the Scottish-born 19th-century writer often described as the English-language father of South African poetry.\n\nAs an author, Ms. Wicomb said she valued her independence and wanted to let her work stand on its own merit without public-relations machinery. She preferred working with small literary presses, avoided using literary agents and rarely granted interviews. She said her writing was a way to reconcile feeling like an émigré longing for but disconnected from her homeland.\n\n“In my privileged position, I don’t have the right to be quibbling about what home is and where home is,” she told The Buenos Aires Herald in 2015. “Let’s say I’ve got two homes, let’s look at it not in terms of lack, let’s stop thinking about it as a problem. I can enjoy both places.”\n\n"}]}
