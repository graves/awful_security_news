Nancy Mace of South Carolina allegedly berated police officers at Charleston International Airport Thursday morning, allegedly “loudly cursing” at officers and saying they were “f**king incompetent,” according to an incident report from police.\n \n\n   \n  Mace, who  closely aligns herself  with President Donald Trump and is  currently running  for South Carolina governor, has repeatedly shared concerns about her safety in the past. Last December, she reported being  “physically accosted”  on Capitol grounds.\n \n\n   \n  One officer said in their report: “Any other person in the airport acting and talking the way she did, our department would have been dispatch (sic) and we would have addressed the behavior.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Mace’s office for comment. Mace’s Director of Operations Cameron Morabito  told The New York Times , “Apparently, simply arriving at an airport now makes headlines if you’re leading the race for governor.”\n \n\n   \n  “We are forced to take the congresswoman’s safety extremely seriously,” Morabito told the Times. “After the world watched Charlie Kirk’s assassination, the threats against her have only intensified. Our security procedures are based solely on legitimate safety concerns, and any attempt to politicize this reality is both dangerous and reckless.”\n \n\n   \n  Mace also briefly spoke with the Times, saying she did complain to the airport because she is concerned about her safety given recent death threats against her. “We all get frustrated when it’s not taken seriously,” she told the outlet.\n \n\n   \n    Mace ran late, arrived in different vehicle\n \n\n   \n  Two Charleston County Aviation Authority police officers were informed at 6 a.m. they would need to escort Mace from the curb to her flight, according to an incident report filed by the officers. They were told she would arrive at 6:30 a.m. in a white BMW, the report says.\n \n\n   \n  At 6:20 a.m., three officers went to the ticketing curb area and waited for her car, the report said. They were informed at around 6:35 a.m. she was running 15 minutes late and kept waiting for the car, they said, not seeing a white BMW.\n \n\n   \n  Security video provided to CNN by the airport shows Mace arriving at a sidewalk entrance area at 6:50 a.m. in a dark gray sedan. No other people were visible in the video. Airport officials said they had no further comment.\n \n\n   \n  A little before 7 a.m., officers were told Mace was waiting at the Transportation Security Administration known crewmember entrance, and the officers made their way over “in less than a minute,” the report said.\n \n\n   \n  When officers met Mace to escort her, they said she was “very irate” and “began loudly cursing and making derogatory comments to us and about the department.”\n \n\n   \n  “She repeatedly stated we were ‘f**king incompetent,’ and ‘this is no way to treat a f**king US Representative’,” one officer said in his report. “She also said we would never treat (US Sen.) Tim Scott like this.”\n \n\n   \n  A different security video provided to CNN by the airport shows the TSA security checkpoint with Mace speaking with two airport officials at the known crewmember entrance. It appears an airport employee made a call to an unknown person, and approximately three minutes later the two officers arrived to escort Mace. It took about seven minutes from the time Mace appears at the known crewmember entrance and starts interacting with airport employees to when the escorting officers arrive, according to the video.\n \n\n   \n  Mace allegedly continued cursing at the officers and into her phone while they walked with her to the gate, according to the account of one officer. After she boarded her flight, an airline employee and several other TSA agents said they were shocked and upset by her behavior, the officer said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/judge-blocks-trump-citizenship-proof-voting-form","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"10:57:00-04:00","title":"Federal judge rules Trump can’t require citizenship proof on federal voting form","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal judge, Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, ruled that President Donald Trump lacks the constitutional authority to require documentary proof of citizenship on the federal voter registration form, declaring the directive an unconstitutional violation of the separation of powers.

federal voting form \n       \n  By Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:57 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump’s request to add a documentary proof of citizenship requirement to the federal voter registration form cannot be enforced, a federal judge ruled Friday.\n \n\n   \n  US District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly in Washington, DC, sided with Democratic and civil rights groups that sued the Trump administration over a March executive order to overhaul US elections.\n \n\n   \n  She ruled that the proof-of-citizenship directive is an unconstitutional violation of the separation of powers, dealing a blow to the administration and its allies who have argued that such a mandate is necessary to restore public confidence that only Americans are voting in US elections.\n \n\n   \n  “Because our Constitution assigns responsibility for election regulation to the States and to Congress, this Court holds that the President lacks the authority to direct such changes,” Kollar-Kotelly wrote in her opinion.\n \n\n   \n  She further emphasized that on matters related to setting qualifications for voting and regulating federal election procedures, “the Constitution assigns no direct role to the President in either domain.”\n \n\n   \n  Kollar-Kotelly echoed comments she made when  she granted a preliminary injunction over the issue. \n \n\n   \n  The ruling grants the plaintiffs a partial summary judgment that prohibits the proof-of-citizenship requirement from going into effect. It says the US Election Assistance Commission, which has been considering adding the requirement to the federal voter form, is permanently barred from taking action to do so.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, Sophia Lin Lakin of the ACLU, one of the plaintiffs in the case, called the ruling “a clear victory for our democracy. President Trump’s attempt to impose a documentary proof of citizenship requirement on the federal voter registration form is an unconstitutional power grab.”\n \n\n   \n  A message seeking comment from the White House was not immediately returned.\n \n\n   \n  While a top priority for Republicans, attempts to implement documentary proof-of-citizenship requirements for voting have been fraught. The US House passed a citizenship mandate last spring that has stalled in the Senate, and several attempts to pass similar legislation in the states have proved equally difficult.\n \n\n   \n  Such requirements have created problems and confusion for voters when they have taken effect at the state level. It presents particular hurdles for married women who have changed their name, since they might need to show birth certificates and marriage certificates as well as state IDs. Those complications arose earlier this year when a proof-of-citizenship requirement took effect for the first time during local elections in New Hampshire.\n \n\n   \n  In Kansas, a proof-of-citizenship requirement that was in effect for three years created chaos before it was overturned in federal court. Some 30,000 otherwise eligible people were prevented from registering to vote.\n \n\n   \n  Voting by noncitizens also has been shown to be rare.\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuit brought by the DNC and various civil rights groups will continue to play out to allow the judge to consider other challenges to Trump’s order. That includes a requirement that all mailed ballots be received, rather than just postmarked, by Election Day.\n \n\n   \n  Other lawsuits against Trump’s election executive order are ongoing.\n \n\n   \n  In early April, 19 Democratic state attorneys general asked a separate federal court to reject Trump’s executive order. Washington and Oregon, where virtually all voting is done with mailed ballots, followed with their own lawsuit against the order.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/asia/us-japan-trump-takaichi-analysis-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"19:58:00-04:00","title":"In Tokyo, Trump and Takaichi Bonded Over a Mutual Friend – and a Mutual Enemy","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During a closely watched meeting in Tokyo on October 31, 2025, former US President Donald Trump and Japan’s new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi displayed an unusually warm and personal rapport, reminiscent of the close ties forged during Shinzo Abe’s tenure.

Montgomery, Betsy Klein, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:58 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  During their closely watched  first meeting  in Tokyo, Donald Trump and Sanae Takaichi looked more like old friends than world leaders.\n \n\n   \n  There were smiles, back slaps, hugs and even a joke about running late because they’d been watching the LA Dodgers – led by Japanese megastar Shohei Ohtani – play in the World Series.\n \n\n   \n  The US president received a Nobel Peace Prize nomination (the second of his Asia trip), and a golf putter previously owned by the late former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who famously bonded with Trump on the green.\n \n\n   \n  Their easy camaraderie continued at the Yokosuka naval base, where Trump invited  Takaichi  on stage aboard the USS George Washington and praised her leadership. The new Japanese PM responded with a triumphant fist pump and a twirl, a moment that quickly went viral in her country.\n \n\n   \n  The message was unmistakable: the  Abe-era chemistry between Washington and Tokyo  is back.\n \n\n   \n  “She is a delight,” Trump told business leaders at the conclusion of the day’s activities. “I got to know her pretty well in a short period of time.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s not often Trump shows this level of warmth toward a foreign leader, particularly one from a country that’s weathered his tariff wars. It’s just as rare to see a Japanese prime minister display such open affection on the world stage.\n \n\n   \n  It certainly helps that the two see eye to eye on several political issues. Both are right-wing conservatives who support military buildup and a tougher stance on China. Their shared connection to Abe also helps explain their rapport. Abe was one of Trump’s “best friends” in global politics, as well as being Takaichi’s political mentor.\n \n\n   \n  But beneath the photo ops and nostalgia also lies a strategic alliance born of mutual need. Especially as both leaders eye the same adversary in Beijing.\n \n\n   \n  For Trump, having a staunch ally in the Asia-Pacific region willing to take a hard line against China is an undeniable win. Takaichi, a longtime China hawk, has criticized Beijing’s military expansion and economic coercion for years. Her hardline stance dovetails neatly with Trump’s “America First” worldview.\n \n\n   \n  The two also unveiled a new framework on rare earths, aimed at reducing dependence on China’s near-monopoly over critical resources. Details were vague, but the message of cooperation was clear. Japan still remembers the 2010 “rare earths shock,” when Beijing cut off exports after a territorial dispute. Takaichi has since made securing stable supply chains a key part of her economic agenda.\n \n\n   \n  Trade and investment also featured prominently at the summit. Japan pledged roughly $490 billion in US-bound investments, led by companies in AI, semiconductors, defense and advanced manufacturing, part of a broader trade deal already agreed upon by the allies in September.\n \n\n   \n  For Trump, who prizes loyalty and has a long memory for slights, an allegiance to Japan solidified early in his first term. Abe took great care to develop the US-Japan relationship, at a time when the president did not have a lot of support on the world stage.\n \n\n   \n  Foreign dignitaries and leaders  openly laughed  at the president during a 2018 United Nations General Assembly address. In 2019, a group of NATO leaders were  captured  on camera gossiping about him.\n \n\n   \n  But Abe cultivated his American counterpart with thoughtful gestures that played directly to Trump’s interests: multiple golf outings, the pomp and circumstance of a state banquet, and a trip to a sumo wrestling tournament where Trump bestowed the winner with a “President’s Cup.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump remained close to his counterpart until Abe’s assassination in 2022, and hosted his widow at Mar-a-Lago last year.\n \n\n   \n  That goodwill paved the way for Takaichi’s success on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  “He really likes her,” said a senior Trump administration official who observed their interactions behind closed doors.\n \n\n   \n  She also benefited from timing: Takaichi took office after Trump’s reciprocal tariffs rocked markets and reimagined US alliances – shielding her from tangling with the Trump administration to negotiate a trade deal.\n \n\n   \n  For Takaichi, standing shoulder to shoulder with Trump strengthens her hand at home. Her approval ratings soared after taking office, but her ruling party still lacks a parliamentary majority after recent election losses. Public frustration over past scandals also lingers. Projecting Japan’s influence abroad, and reaffirming its bond with Washington, helps her rebuild political capital.\n \n\n   \n  For Trump, the optics are just as valuable. Hardening a close alliance with Tokyo gives him diplomatic momentum ahead of a more contentious meeting with China’s Xi Jinping. It’s also a reminder to Beijing that he’s not short on powerful friends in the region.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/asia/apec-summit-xi-trump-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"03:34:00-04:00","title":"China’s Xi in the limelight at Pacific summit with Trump conspicuous by his absence","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"At the APEC summit in Gyeongju, South Korea, China’s President Xi Jinping led diplomatic efforts, calling for global cooperation, supply chain resilience, and a new global AI governance framework.

November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Leaders of Pacific countries and territories, including China’s Xi Jinping, adopted a joint declaration on trade and investment at a major summit in South Korea Saturday. But the leader of one global powerhouse is conspicuously absent: Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n  The US president flew out of South Korea Thursday, moments after his  landmark meeting  with his Chinese counterpart that appeared to  de-escalate the protracted trade conflict  between the world’s two largest economies.\n \n\n   \n  With Trump choosing to skip the annual summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation – which groups together countries accounting for more than half of global trade – Xi stepped into the limelight by calling for unity, cooperation and proposing a global body to govern artificial intelligence.\n \n\n   \n  Despite his absence, Trump’s protectionist trade policies and punishing global tariffs have loomed over the two-day event in the city of Gyeongju. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stood in for Trump during the discussions.\n \n\n   \n  The grouping of 21 economies on both sides of the Pacific signed the “Gyeongju Declaration,” which included commitments to cooperate on economic recovery and growth. The leaders also adopted an AI initiative and a framework to respond to demographic changes caused by low birth rates and aging populations.\n \n\n   \n  “The world is undergoing rapid changes unseen in a century,” Xi told the forum in his opening remarks Friday. “The more turbulent the times are, the more we must stand together in solidarity.”\n \n\n   \n  “China’s door to openness will not close; it will only open wider,” Xi said.\n \n\n   \n  Decisions made in Gyeongju are non-binding — and leaders have faced difficulty reaching consensus in the past including on thorny issues like Russia’s war in Ukraine. But a major focus for the forum this year was on strengthening supply chains and encouraging cooperation as economies worldwide reel from Trump’s tariff offensive.\n \n\n   \n  In their declaration, the leaders acknowledged that “the global trading system continues to face significant challenges,” and as su﻿ch they would “support efforts to ensure resilient supply chains” and “create new drivers of growth” through digital innovations, including AI.\n \n\n   \n  “We are standing at a critical inflection point with a rapidly changing global economic order,” South Korean president and APEC chair Lee Jae Myung said in his address to the summit Friday. “Only cooperation and solidarity can surely lead us to a better future.”\n \n\n   \n  Lee will sit down for talks with Xi, who is on a state visit to South Korea, in the first summit meeting between the two leaders. ﻿On the agenda are discussions on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and regional peace and stability.\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of the talks, Lee said the relationship between Seoul and Beijing has “not completely recovered yet” and there was a need to “find the path for helping one another.” He looked forward to China playing a role in promoting peace on the peninsula, Lee said.\n \n\n   \n  North Korea called talk of denuclearization a “pipedream” that will never be realized. The country’s Vice Foreign Minister Pak Myong Ho accused South Korea of lacking “common sense” for refusing to acknowledge Pyongyang as a nuclear-armed state, the state-run Korea Central News Agency reported Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  Among the high-profile meetings Xi had on the sidelines of APEC was with Japan’s newly installed Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, a staunch conservative who has criticized China’s growing military presence in the region and called for cooperation with Taiwan, the self-ruled island that Beijing claims as its own.\n \n\n   \n  Xi told Takaichi that China was ready to “work with Japan for constructive, stable bilateral ties that meet requirements of the new era,” Chinese state news agency Xinhua reported.\n \n\n   \n  “I aim to maintain communication with you and therefore jointly promote the development of China-Japan relations along the right track,” Xi said.\n \n\n   \n  Takaichi faced a tough balancing act in her meeting with Xi. China remains Japan’s largest trading partner and Takaichi inherited a country facing  mounting economic woes. \n \n\n   \n  She told reporters after the meeting that China and Japan agreed to build a “strategic mutually beneficial relationship.” But Takaichi said she also expressed concerns to Xi on sensitive issues including Chinese export controls on rare earths, China’s activity in the East China Sea, and the detention of Japanese nationals in China.\n \n\n   \n  “I also asked China to resume Japanese beef and seafood imports,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The meeting appeared in stark contrast to the  warm camaraderie  showed by Takaichi and Trump in Tokyo just days before, when the two allies had embarked on a “new golden age” of relations. Takaichi and Trump demonstrated a close bond complete with smiles, fist pumps and jokes.\n \n\n   \n  For Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who is involved in an escalating trade war with Trump, meeting with Xi marked a “turning point” in their relationship, according to his office.\n \n\n   \n  In an earlier speech that echoed Xi and Lee’s addresses to APEC, Carney told the forum that the world was “facing another hinge moment in history.”\n \n\n   \n  “Our world is undergoing one of the most profound shifts since the fall of the Berlin Wall,” he said. “That old world… of steady expansion of liberalized trade and investment… that world is gone.”\n \n\n   \n  Carney had been looking for a reset of Canada-China relations after years of worsening ties and  diplomatic rows . Trade negotiations with the US, Canada’s biggest trading partner, are at  a dead end , and Carney said at the APEC summit that he was aiming to double non-US exports over the next decade in an effort to diversify away from the US.\n \n\n   \n  The two leaders “affirmed their commitment to renewing the relationship between their two countries in a pragmatic and constructive way” and discussed a framework “to deepen cooperation across a range of areas – from clean and conventional energy, to agriculture, manufacturing, climate change, and international finance,” the prime minister’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  Carney also accepted an invitation to visit China and both leaders “directed their officials to move quickly to resolve outstanding trade issues and irritants.”\n \n\n   \n  Speaking to reporters on Saturday, Carney said that he had apologized to Trump for a  political advertisement  that angered the President so much that he terminated trade talks with Canada.\n \n\n   \n  “I did apologize to the President,” Carney said when asked by a reporter about the issue on Saturday. “The President was offended by the ad. It’s not something I would have done… which is to put in place that advertisement, and so I apologized to him.”\n \n\n   \n  The ad was released last month by the government of Canada’s Ontario province and featured audio from  a speech by former US President Ronald Reagan  criticizing tariffs on foreign goods.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/letitia-james-challenges-appointment-us-attorney","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"18:57:00-04:00","title":"New York AG Letitia James challenges appointment of US attorney in Albany","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"New York Attorney General Letitia James has filed a legal motion to challenge the appointment of John Sarcone as U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of New York, arguing that the appointment is illegal and that a subpoena seeking information about her investigations into Donald Trump and the National Rifle Association is retaliatory, violates First Amendment rights, and infringes on New York’s state sovereignty.

administration to use emergency funds to partially cover food stamp benefits \n       \n  By Devan Cole, Tami Luhby, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:25 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Two federal judges said Friday that the Trump administration must tap into billions of dollars in emergency funds to at least partially cover  food stamp benefits  for tens of millions of Americans in November.\n \n\n   \n  The rulings from judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island reject a controversial US Department of Agriculture claim that it could not use a contingency fund, which the agency says has $5.3 billion remaining in it, to help cover the benefits amid the month-long government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Hours later, President Donald Trump said he has instructed the administration’s lawyers to ask the courts how it can legally fund the benefits as quickly as possible because the attorneys “do not think we have the legal authority to pay SNAP with certain monies we have available.”\n \n\n   \n  “Even if we get immediate guidance, it will unfortunately be delayed while States get the money out,” Trump  posted  on Truth Social Friday evening. “If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding, just like I did with Military and Law Enforcement Pay.”\n \n\n   \n  The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, costs between $8 billion and $9 billion a month, so the judges’ orders will not cover all of the needed payments for November.\n \n\n   \n  “There is no doubt that the … contingency funds are appropriated funds that are without a doubt necessary to carry out the program’s operation.” US District Judge John McConnell in Rhode Island said. “The shutdown of the government through funding doesn’t do away with SNAP, it just does away with the funding of it.”\n \n\n   \n  During proceedings Friday, McConnell said he was ordering the government to use the contingency fund to ensure some benefits could be distributed starting November 1.\n \n\n   \n  McConnell’s ruling during a hastily scheduled hearing came minutes after US District Judge Indira Talwani in Boston made a similar order. Both judges, appointees of President Barack Obama, also said that USDA is allowed to tap into another bucket of money of nearly $17 billion to pay November SNAP benefits in full, but that decision is currently up to the administration.\n \n\n   \n  Though Talwani stopped short on Friday of requiring the administration to tap into the contingency fund, she said the USDA was required to use money in that rainy-day fund to partially cover November benefits and gave it until Monday to decide whether it would use only those funds or also dip into a separate pot of money.\n \n\n   \n  “This court has now clarified that Defendants are required to use those Contingency Funds as necessary for the SNAP program. And while these contingency funds reportedly are insufficient to cover the entire cost of SNAP for November, Defendants also may supplement the Contingency Funds by authorizing a transfer of additional funds … to avoid any reductions,”  Talwani said in a 15-page order. \n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration opposes tapping into those other funds, arguing in court it will hurt the child nutrition programs that the revenue supports.\n \n\n   \n  Even with Trump’s directive and the judge’s rulings, millions of recipients will still face delays in getting their benefits, which were scheduled to start being distributed on November 1. It will take time for the Department of Agriculture and states to get the money flowing again.\n \n\n   \n  In the program’s decades-long history, a government shutdown has never prevented it from distributing SNAP funds to states, which administer the benefits, though the program was at risk during the 2018-2019 impasse.\n \n\n   \n  The Boston lawsuit was filed earlier this week by a group of Democratic attorneys general and governors from 25 states and Washington, DC, while the case in Rhode Island was brought Thursday by a coalition of cities, non-profits, unions and small businesses.\n \n\n   \n  As the government shutdown nears its one-month mark, courts are increasingly being asked to intervene to stave off a series of dramatic developments. Earlier this week, a federal judge in California indefinitely blocked the administration from laying off thousands of federal workers, saying the government was unlawfully using the shutdown as legal justification for the layoffs.\n \n\n   \n  The administration could seek appeals. Asked earlier Friday by CNN what the department would do if courts required USDA to tap into the contingency fund, Secretary Brooke Rollins said, “We’re looking at all the options.”\n \n\n   \n    Delayed payments\n \n\n   \n  States stopped the process of issuing benefits for November after the USDA sent them a letter on October 10 ordering them to do so. States send SNAP enrollees’ information to vendors every month so they can load funds onto recipients’ benefit cards.\n \n\n   \n  Each state has a specific date by which they must send the information ahead of the new month in order for benefits to go out on time, according to the lawsuit. Payments are made on a staggered basis throughout the month.\n \n\n   \n  Talwani acknowledged the likely delay in benefits during a hearing Thursday, and also asked about the process of providing partial payments to recipients next month since the contingency fund alone won’t cover the full amount.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re dealing with the reality that … the benefits aren’t going to be there on November 1,” she said.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/business/how-to-help-snap-benefits","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"03:00:00Z","title":"How to Help SNAP Recipients as the Shutdown Drags On","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As a government shutdown delays the distribution of SNAP benefits in November 2025, millions of Americans face heightened risks of food insecurity.

to help SNAP recipients as the shutdown drags on \n       \n  By Ramishah Maruf, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:00 AM EDT, Sat November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  More likely than not, someone in your community – whether friend, family or neighbor – uses   SNAP benefits.\n \n\n   \n  As  millions of people could lose access to food assistance programs  during the government shutdown, many Americans are trying – in however small a way – to fill in the gaps for people at risk of being left behind.\n \n\n   \n   Two federal judges ruled that the Trump administration has to tap into emergency funds  to at least partially cover November food assistance. But the aid, which was scheduled to disperse on the first of the month, will still be delayed reaching recipients.\n \n\n   \n  Tee Tran, the owner of Vietnamese restaurant Monster Pho in Oakland, California, knows the struggle all too well. He was one of the thousands of Vietnamese boat people, eventually reaching California in 1989, where his mother worked five jobs and used SNAP benefits to keep food on the table. Now he’s decided to give away free meals to children receiving help through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, and a discount for their parents.\n \n\n   \n  “When I see these kids going through this and not having food, it really makes me think of me,” Tran said. “I know how it’s like when you look up to your parents and they want to give you so much… but financially they can’t do it.”\n \n\n   \n  But even though people are pitching in as much as they can to help, there are few options for families that help as much as food stamps. \n \n\n   \n  “No food bank, no charitable organization, can fill the gap if November SNAP isn’t provided,” Stefanie Shuman, Food Bank For New York City’s communications director, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    Check with local businesses\n \n\n   \n  Kevin Cassidy, the owner of a chain restaurant on Long Island called KC’s Pizza & Wings, made a heartfelt post on social media saying he would provide a free meal, no questions asked, to anyone presenting a SNAP/EBT card. He didn’t expect the flood of support.\n \n\n   \n  In two days, he said he got over $1,000 in donations and hundreds of messages from people around the country asking how they can help. Now, he’s planning on prepping pre-made meals, working with a local food bank and using community donations to give out gift cards to local grocers.\n \n\n   \n  “Everyone is struggling a bit, and when you help others it comes back tenfold. The only way to receive is to give,” Cassidy said.\n \n\n   \n  Tran, the owner of Monster Pho, said he has lost 30% of his business in the past six months because of tariffs, immigration restrictions and reduced spending from his customers. That’s why he’s offering free meals to children and a discount to their parents, to help as much as he can without going under.\n \n\n   \n    Donate to a food bank\n \n\n   \n  Food Banks say that cash donations are more helpful than giving food directly if people are able to do so, because they are able to buy a lot more food in bulk themselves. In New York City, for example, $1 can provide up to 5 meals at Food Bank For NYC.\n \n\n   \n  Many companies also match employee donations to organizations such as these, so check with your employer, as well.\n \n\n   \n  The money goes a long way, especially right now.  Food banks have already been feeling the strain  due to increased lines and higher prices of food.\n \n\n   \n    Grocery Buddies\n \n\n   \n  Other people are using online forums to act as “grocery buddies” for families at risk of losing benefits,  CNN previously reported .\n \n\n   \n  Neighbors post in these community groups that they are willing to be a “grocery buddy,” offering help to whoever needs. Then, the parties figure what that help will look like, whether that means shopping together, using gift cards or something else.\n \n\n   \n    Local food pantry and mutual aid groups\n \n\n   \n  For those donating physical food, food bank groups said the best options are non-perishables. Key items include proteins such as canned chicken, tuna and salmon, as well as beans and nut butters. Pastas and rice also have a long shelf life.\n \n\n   \n  Other items food banks and local groups tend to need are hygiene products, such as tampons, pads, diapers and wipes, which can eat away at peoples’ grocery budgets.\n \n\n   \n    Call your local representative\n \n\n   \n  Other advocates say an easy and free way to take action is to call your local representative as the government is still shut down.\n \n\n   \n  Some local and state governments have stepped up to attempt to fill the gap left by SNAP, though it’s still not enough to totally cover the amount of aid.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s no face to hunger. It’s oftentimes, again, working families… (when) the wage has not kept pace with the cost of living,” Shuman said.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Tami Luhby and Alisha Ebrahimji contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/china/china-sends-youngest-astronaut-to-space-station-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"20:03:00-04:00","title":"China sends its youngest astronaut and four black mice to ‘Heavenly Palace’ space station","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"China successfully launched the Shenzhou-21 spacecraft, carrying its youngest astronauts Zhang Hongzhang and Wu Fei, as well as four black mice, the first small mammals in space on the Tiangong space station.

Here’s what we know about the judges’ rulings \n       \n  By Tami Luhby, Devan Cole, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:15 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Two federal judges have  ordered  the Trump administration to use emergency funds to provide at least partial  food stamp benefits  to tens of millions of Americans in November, as the federal government shutdown drags on.\n \n\n   \n  And President Donald Trump on Friday evening said that he’s instructed the administration’s lawyers to ask the courts how it can legally fund the benefits as quickly as possible.\n \n\n   \n  “Even if we get immediate guidance, it will unfortunately be delayed while States get the money out,” Trump  posted  on Truth Social. “If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding, just like I did with Military and Law Enforcement Pay.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, the much needed assistance won’t come that quickly for many food stamp recipients. Also, it remains unclear whether they’ll receive their full benefits or a smaller amount since the US Department of Agriculture’s contingency fund doesn’t have enough money to cover the total cost.\n \n\n   \n  Several legal and procedural challenges must be overcome before the benefits can start flowing to the nearly 42 million people in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, the formal name for food stamps. The US Department of Agriculture halted November allocations, arguing it  doesn’t have the funds  to provide them, which prompted  a coalition of Democratic-led states  and a group of cities, non-profits, unions and small businesses to sue earlier this week.\n \n\n   \n  It’s now unclear whether the administration will appeal the rulings. However, the Justice Department signaled during a hearing on Thursday that it would do so if US District Judge Indira Talwani in Boston issued an adverse ruling.\n \n\n   \n  Though Talwani stopped short on Friday of requiring the administration to tap into the contingency fund, she said the USDA was required to use money in that rainy-day fund to partially cover November benefits and gave it until Monday to decide whether it would use only those funds or also dip into a separate pot of money.\n \n\n   \n  A judge in Rhode Island said during proceedings Friday in a separate case over the SNAP payments that he was ordering the government to use the contingency fund to ensure some benefits could be distributed starting November 1. The administration could also appeal this decision.\n \n\n   \n    Delayed payments\n \n\n   \n  Whatever happens in court, it will take time for SNAP recipients to get access to any assistance in November.\n \n\n   \n  States stopped the process of  issuing benefits for November  after the USDA sent them a letter on October 10 ordering them to do so. States send SNAP enrollees’ information to vendors every month so they can load funds onto recipients’ benefit cards, often days or weeks before the new month begins. Those steps need to take place before SNAP can restart.\n \n\n   \n  The delay will be felt immediately. Some 3 million recipients should receive their benefits on November 1, according to an estimate by Code for America, which works with all levels of government to improve access to food assistance and other safety net programs. The number grows to nearly 13.7 million by November 5, with remaining SNAP enrollees getting their allotments on a staggered basis during the month.\n \n\n   \n  “They are not going out on time,” Gina Plata-Nino, interim director of SNAP at the Food Research & Action Center, an advocacy group, said of the November benefits.\n \n\n   \n  Still, providing full payments would be the fastest way to get assistance to food stamp recipients.\n \n\n   \n  “If the administration complies with the courts’ rulings to release the SNAP contingency funds immediately and supplements those amounts using its legal transfer authority, which the courts also affirmed, then SNAP benefits could begin to be issued with only a short delay,” said Dottie Rosenbaum, director of federal SNAP policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n \n\n   \n    Partial payments harder to do\n \n\n   \n  However, the process could become much more complicated — and time consuming — if the USDA opts to only tap into its contingency fund and doesn’t augment it with leftover tariff revenue dedicated to child nutrition programs, as it did with the  WIC nutrition assistance program .\n \n\n   \n  The emergency fund only has $5.3 billion remaining in it, while benefits total about $8.2 billion for the month, according to court filings submitted by the Justice Department, which represents the USDA in the case. (Other expenses and benefits bring the total closer to $9 billion.)\n \n\n   \n  The USDA also has access to nearly $17 billion in tariff revenue, but a Justice Department attorney told a judge Friday that using the funds for SNAP would hurt the child nutrition programs that the money supports. Both Talwani and the judge in Rhode Island, John McConnell, left it up to the USDA to decide whether to use the additional resources to pay full benefits in November.\n \n\n   \n  If only the contingency fund were tapped, the USDA would have to reduce benefits for all SNAP recipients, which it has never done, according to a declaration filed by the agency official who oversees the program. Also, state agencies would need to recode their systems to issue the smaller benefit amounts, which could result in payment errors.\n \n\n   \n  “Because no template, processes, or past experience exist to inform a reduction in benefits, there are multiple variables which could lead to significant problems in attempting to reduce benefits for every SNAP household in the country,” Patrick Penn, deputy undersecretary of the USDA’s Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services, said in his declaration. “The ability, time and resources to accomplish this system change would vary greatly among State agencies, with some State agencies working with systems that are decades old.”\n \n\n   \n  For at least some states, the process could take anywhere from a few weeks to several months, Penn said, drawing upon informal conversations with state agencies.\n \n\n   \n  Before states could even act, the USDA would also have to determine how to calculate and authorize the reduced allotments. This effort could be hampered if its employees have been furloughed during the shutdown or laid off or departed amid the Trump administration’s efforts to downsize the federal government, Plata-Nino said.\n \n\n   \n  While some states have identified potential ways to issue smaller benefits quickly, the methods must be programmed, tested and verified, which could take time, she noted.\n \n\n   \n  If recipients receive partial benefits in November, they would get retroactive payments to make them whole once the government reopens, she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/politics/snap-benefits-november-most-affected-vis","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"18:22:00Z","title":"Millions of Americans Could Face Delays in SNAP Benefits Amid Government Shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Due to a government shutdown, millions of Americans relying on SNAP food assistance are facing delays in receiving benefits, with the Trump administration now required by two federal judges to access emergency funds to at least partially cover the shortfall.

Millions of Americans could still face delays to their benefits, which were scheduled to be distributed tomorrow but were disrupted by the government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Nearly 42 million people — or about 1 in 8 Americans — received food stamps in May, according to the latest USDA data.\n \n\n   \n  About 3 million people were set to receive their food stamps on November 1, according to estimates from Code for America, which works with governments of all levels to improve access to food assistance and other safety net programs. That figure grows to about 13.7 million by November 5 and 26.6 million by November 10. The remaining enrollees are scheduled to receive their November benefits after that.\n \n\n   \n    Who relies on SNAP benefits for food assistance\n \n\n   \n  Overall, 12% of the US population relies on SNAP for food assistance. SNAP participation ranges widely across the United States, with the highest shares in New Mexico, Louisiana and the District of Columbia.\n \n\n   \n  Households with children, an elderly individual or a non-elderly person with a disability received 83% of SNAP benefits in fiscal year 2023, according to the USDA.\n \n\n   \n  Among recipients themselves, about 39% were children, while 20% were elderly and 10% were non-elderly individuals with a disability.\n \n\n   \n  Households receive about $350 a month, on average, in SNAP benefits.\n \n\n   \n  Nearly three-quarters of the households that rely on the benefits to afford groceries have an income below 100% of the federal poverty level.\n \n\n   \n  The assistance doesn’t expire at the end of each month, but beneficiaries typically use all the funds in the month they receive them, said Lauren Bauer, a fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution.\n \n\n   \n  Unfortunately, there aren’t a lot of good alternatives to food stamps.\n \n\n   \n  Americans can turn to food pantries and other community food assistance programs, but these groups have been under pressure from rising food prices and increased need in recent years.\n \n\n   \n  “The shutdown adds another layer of strain to an already stretched emergency food system,” Celia Cole, CEO of Feeding Texas, the state association of food banks, said in a statement, noting that more than 3.5 million Texans receive food stamps.\n \n\n   \n  States don’t have enough money to cover $8 billion in monthly food stamp benefits, though several have said they will beef up their food assistance programs next month.\n \n\n   \n  Multiple states have said they will pour millions of dollars into their emergency food programs — but it will be far less than the typical federal outlays in most cases.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/pentagon-strikes-pacific-drug-trafficking","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"10:35:00-20:00","title":"Pentagon shifts to Pacific strikes seeking stronger link between targets and US drug trafficking","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Pentagon has shifted its military drug interdiction strategy from the Caribbean Sea to the eastern Pacific Ocean, citing stronger intelligence linking cocaine trafficking from Colombia and Mexico to U.S. markets.

Pacific strikes seeking stronger link between targets and US drug trafficking \n       \n  By Natasha Bertrand, Zachary Cohen, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:35 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Pentagon has deliberately shifted its strategy in recent weeks to striking suspected narcotraffickers in the eastern Pacific Ocean, rather than the Caribbean Sea, because administration officials believe they have stronger evidence linking cocaine transport to the US from those western routes, according to people familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  The intelligence suggests that cocaine is far more likely to be trafficked from Colombia or Mexico, rather than Venezuela, the sources said, raising more questions about the true purpose of the US military buildup in the Caribbean Sea.\n \n\n   \n  The last four US military strikes targeting suspected drug smugglers were carried out in the eastern Pacific, according to Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, and sources said that future attacks are likely to be concentrated in that area because of the stronger link to US markets.\n \n\n   \n  By contrast, there have been questions about whether every boat struck by the US in the Caribbean was actually heading toward, or sending drugs to, the US. After the first boat strike in September, for example, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the vessel had likely been headed toward Trinidad and Tobago.\n \n\n   \n  Venezuela is also not known to be a major source of cocaine for the US market, but the Trump administration has been aggressively trying to link Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro to the drug trade while accumulating a huge military presence near Caracas.\n \n\n   \n  “At the direction of the President, the Department of War is taking the fight to the cartels and defending our Homeland from Designated Terrorist Organization’s illicit activities before their violence and poison reaches our shores – this includes all of our nation’s borders,” a Pentagon official told CNN. “The Department’s newly established counter-narcotics Joint Task Force is expanding efforts on both the East and West Coasts to counter illicit drug trafficking by narco-terrorists using maritime routes.”\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has not provided Congress with evidence to back up its claims that the 15 vessels the military has struck since September in both the Caribbean and the Pacific, killing at least 61 people, were ferrying drugs and carrying known drug traffickers.\n \n\n   \n  During a classified briefing on Capitol Hill this week, Pentagon officials also told lawmakers they do not know how to gauge success in the ongoing military campaign, according to a source familiar with the closed-door session.\n \n\n   \n  “They don’t know whether there’s any data or metrics that would show (the strikes are) impeding the flow of drugs, whether there has been an increase in the price due to higher demand or lower supply, like there’s just no information,” the source said. “None of the briefers could say what they’re going to do when the traffickers change their tactics. None of them could say how they’re addressing air and land routes.”\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Rep. Sara Jacobs said following the briefing on Thursday that administration officials confirmed that they do not necessarily know the individual identities of each person on board a vessel before they attack it.\n \n\n   \n  “They said that they do not need to positively identify individuals on the vessel to do the strikes,” Jacobs said, adding that the administration did not want to detain or try survivors in court, “because they could not satisfy the evidentiary burden.” The US military briefly held and then repatriated two survivors of one of its strikes earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  Military officials also told lawmakers on Thursday that the strikes were targeting cocaine, not fentanyl.\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump told a collection of senior military brass assembled during an  unusual event in Virginia last month  that the strikes were primarily targeting fentanyl transporting ships.\n \n\n   \n  “These boats, they’re stacked up with bags of white powder, that’s mostly fentanyl and other drugs too,” he said. “Every boat kills 25,000.”\n \n\n   \n  Fentanyl killed more than double the number of Americans than cocaine did in 2023, according to  US government data . By Trump’s math, the campaign against alleged drug boats thus far should prevent roughly 375,000 deaths, or slightly more than the total population of Cleveland.\n \n\n   \n  Jacobs said the briefers insisted that cocaine is a “facilitating drug of fentanyl but it was not a satisfactory answer for most of us.”\n \n\n   \n  “None of them could say what they’re doing for fentanyl,” said the source familiar with the briefing. “Fentanyl is the real problem here, and they’re actually not addressing fentanyl in any of these operations.”\n \n\n   \n  Democrats and Republicans also want a better explanation of the legal justification for the strikes, but military lawyers have been conspicuously absent from recent congressional briefings. The legal counsel to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was supposed to brief lawmakers on Thursday but pulled out after it became clear that lawyers from the defense secretary’s office were given a “pass” at attending, sources told CNN. Without the lawyers there, Democrats said the briefers could not fully answer their questions about the legality of the strikes.\n \n\n   \n  “They didn’t even show up with the lawyers,” Democratic Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts said after the briefing. “They canceled at the last minute.”\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth told reporters on Friday while traveling in Asia that he had engaged with Congress on a bipartisan basis about the strikes. But also on Friday, the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Republican Sen. Roger Wicker and Democratic Sen. Jack Reed, publicly released two letters they’d written to Hegseth over the last month seeking clarity on the operations, both of which have gone unanswered, the lawmakers said.\n \n\n   \n  The letters requested the execute orders for the US military strikes on the boats, and the Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel opinion that CNN has reported the administration is leaning on to legally justify the strikes. Some Republican senators were shown the OLC memo by administration officials during a briefing on Wednesday, infuriating Democrats who were not invited to the briefing and have still not seen document.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner called the move “a partisan stunt” that “is a slap in the face to Congress’ war powers responsibilities and to the men and women who serve this country.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/health/state-medicaid-undocumented-immigrants-kff-health-news","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"17:22:00Z","title":"Trump’s HHS Orders States to Investigate Medicaid Enrollees’ Immigration Status","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration has directed state Medicaid agencies to verify the immigration status of individuals enrolled in Medicaid, resulting in over 170,000 names being reviewed across five states and Washington, D.C.

Those without legal status are ineligible for federally funded health coverage, including Medicaid, Medicare, and plans through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces.\n \n\n   \n  At least one state said it disagreed with Oz’s comments.\n \n\n   \n  “Our payments for coverage of undocumented individuals are in accordance with state and federal laws,” said Marc Williams, a spokesperson for Colorado’s Department of Health Care Policy & Financing, which administers the state’s Medicaid program. “The $1.5 million number referenced by federal leaders today is based on an incorrect preliminary finding, and has been refuted with supporting data by our Department experts.”\n \n\n   \n  He added: “It is disappointing that the administration is announcing this number as final when it is clearly overstated and the conversations are very much in the education and discussion phase.”\n \n\n   \n  In August, CMS began sending states the names of people enrolled in Medicaid that the agency suspected might not be eligible, demanding state Medicaid agencies check their immigration status.\n \n\n   \n  KFF Health News in October reached out to Medicaid agencies in 10 states. Five provided the approximate number of names they had received from the Trump administration, with expectations of more to come: Colorado had been given about 45,000 names, Ohio 61,000, Pennsylvania 34,000, Texas 28,000, and Utah 8,000. More than 70 million people are enrolled in Medicaid.\n \n\n   \n  Most of those states declined to comment further. Medicaid agencies in California, Florida, Georgia, New York, and South Carolina refused to say how many names they were ordered to review or did not respond.\n \n\n   \n  Oz said in his X post that California had misspent $1.3 billion on care for people not eligible for Medicaid, while Illinois spent $30 million, Oregon $5.4 million, Washington state $2.4 million, Washington, D.C., $2.1 million, and Colorado $1.5 million.\n \n\n   \n  “We notified the states, and many have begun refunding the money,” he said. “But what if we had never asked?”\n \n\n   \n  Washington, D.C.’s Medicaid director, Melisa Byrd, said CMS had identified administrative expenses for the district program that covers people regardless of immigration status that should not have been billed to the federal government and her agency has already fixed some of those areas. “We run a big program that is very complex and when mistakes or errors happen, we fix them,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The program plans to pay $654,014 back to CMS by mid-November.\n \n\n   \n  All five states, plus Washington, D.C., are led by Democrats, and President Donald Trump didn’t win any of them in the 2024 election.\n \n\n   \n  In recent days, Deputy Health and Human Services Secretary Jim O’Neill  began posting pictures  on X of people he said are convicted criminals living in the U.S. without authorization who had received Medicaid benefits.\n \n\n   \n  O’Neill could not be reached for comment.\n \n\n   \n  “We are very concerned because this seems, frankly, to be a waste of state resources and furthers the administration’s anti-immigrant agenda,” said Ben D’Avanzo, senior health advocacy strategist with the National Immigration Law Center, an advocacy group. “This duplicates what states already do,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  As part of the administration’s crackdown on people in the U.S. without authorization, President Donald Trump in February directed federal agencies to take action to ensure they are not obtaining benefits in violation of federal law.\n \n\n   \n  In June, advisers to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ordered CMS to share information about Medicaid enrollees with the Department of Homeland Security, drawing a lawsuit by some states alarmed that the administration would use the information for its deportation campaign against unauthorized residents.\n \n\n   \n  In August, a federal judge ordered HHS to  stop sharing the information  with immigration authorities.\n \n\n   \n  State Medicaid agencies use databases maintained by the Social Security Administration and Department of Homeland Security to verify enrollees’ immigration status.\n \n\n   \n  If states need to go back to individuals to reverify their citizenship or immigration status, it could lead some to fall off the rolls unnecessarily — for example, if they don’t see a letter requesting paperwork or fail to meet a deadline to respond.\n \n\n   \n  “I am not sure that evidence suggests there really is a need for this” extra verification, said Marian Jarlenski, a health policy professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Public Health.\n \n\n   \n  Oz made clear that the Trump administration disagrees.\n \n\n   \n  “Whether willful or not, the states’ conduct highlights a terrifying reality: American taxpayers have been footing the bill for illegal immigrants’ Medicaid coverage, despite many Democrats and the media insisting otherwise,” Oz said in his X post.\n \n\n   \n  In an August press release, CMS said it would ask states to verify eligibility for enrollees whose immigration status could not be confirmed via federal databases. “We expect states to take quick action and will monitor progress on a monthly basis,” the agency said.\n \n\n   \n  Leonardo Cuello, a research professor at Georgetown University’s Center for Children and Families, called the CMS order to states “unprecedented” in the Medicaid program’s 60-year history.\n \n\n   \n  He said the federal government may have been unable to verify certain individuals’ immigration status because names were misspelled or outdated, such as when a beneficiary is identified by their maiden instead of married name. The names may also include people helped by Emergency Medicaid, a program that covers the cost of hospital emergency services, including labor and delivery, for people regardless of immigration status.\n \n\n   \n  “CMS is conducting pointless immigration status reviews for people whose hospital bills were paid by Emergency Medicaid,” Cuello said.\n \n\n   \n  Oz noted in his post that federal law “does permit states to use Medicaid dollars for emergency treatment, regardless of patients’ citizenship or immigration status,” and that states can “legally build Medicaid programs for illegal immigrants using their own state tax dollars, so long as no federal tax dollars are used.”\n \n\n   \n  The states Oz mentioned all  run their own  such programs.\n \n\n   \n  The verification checks create an added burden for state Medicaid agencies that are already busy preparing to implement the tax and policy law Trump signed in July. The measure, which Republicans call the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, makes many changes to Medicaid, including adding a work requirement in most states starting by 2027. The law also requires most states to more frequently check the eligibility of many adult Medicaid enrollees — at least twice a year.\n \n\n   \n  “I fear states may do unnecessary checks that create a burden for some enrollees who will lose health coverage who should not,” Cuello said. “It’s going to be a whole lot of work for CMS and states for very little pay dirt.”\n \n\n   \n  Cuello said the effort may have “greater political value than actual value.”\n \n\n   \n  Brandon Cwalina, a spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services, which runs Medicaid in the state, said the state already requires every Medicaid applicant to verify their citizenship or, where applicable, their eligible immigration status.\n \n\n   \n  However, he said, the directive issued by CMS “constitutes a new process, and DHS is carefully reviewing the list in order to take appropriate actions.”\n \n\n   \n  Oz did not name Pennsylvania, which Trump won in 2024, in his post.\n \n\n   \n  If a lawful resident does not have a Social Security number, the state confirms their legal status by checking a database from Homeland Security, as well as verifying specific immigration documents, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Other state Medicaid agencies said they also needed to regroup before reaching out to enrollees.\n \n\n   \n  “Our teams just received this notice and are working through a process by which we will perform these reviews,” Jennifer Strohecker, then Utah’s Medicaid director, told a state advisory board in August.\n \n\n   \n   Renuka Rayasam and Rae Ellen Bichell contributed reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/poll-numbers-trump-fact-check","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"17:05:00Z","title":"Fact check: Trump’s false claims about his poll numbers","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article by CNN criticizes former President Donald Trump for making false claims about his poll numbers during his second term, asserting that his approval ratings have significantly declined from their peak, with multiple polling sources indicating net approval in the negative range (as of October 31, 2025).

But Trump also said two things about his popularity that are not even close to true.\n \n\n   \n  He said, “I have my highest poll numbers that I’ve ever had.” And he said, “I have the best numbers for any president in many years – any president.”\n \n\n   \n    Trump’s approval is down markedly from his second-term peak\n \n\n   \n  In reality, polls show that Americans’ approval of Trump has declined significantly since the beginning of his second term in late January. Multiple polling averages confirm that Trump’s poll numbers are nowhere in the ballpark of their highest-ever levels.\n \n\n   \n   A New York Times average  put Trump’s net approval at negative-11 points as of Tuesday: 43% approval and 54% disapproval. That is down a  net 20 points  from the first week of the term, when Trump was at positive-9 points – 52% approval and 43% disapproval.  CNN’s Poll of Polls  average, updated Wednesday, has Trump’s net approval at negative-15 points (41% approval and 56% disapproval), down a net 14 points from our first average of the term in early February.\n \n\n   \n  Other polling averages also show large drops in Trump’s standing since the beginning of the term.\n \n\n   \n  An  average produced by G. Elliott Morris , co-founder of the polling data website  FiftyPlusOne.news , put Trump’s net approval at roughly negative-14 points as of Tuesday, down about a net 26 points from the first days of the term. An  average produced by data journalist Nate Silver  put Trump’s net approval at roughly negative-10 points as of Tuesday, down about a net 22 points from the first days of the term.\n \n\n   \n  The White House didn’t respond to a CNN request for comment for this article.\n \n\n   \n  It’s worth noting that Trump does continue to have  extremely high   approval   among Republicans , often in the vicinity of 90%. But he never said Tuesday that he was talking about his popularity with his own party rather than the country as a whole, and he is not at a personal record high even among Republicans in particular.\n \n\n   \n    Many other presidents had far better numbers\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s current poll numbers are nowhere close to “the best numbers for any president in many years,” even if you ignore the fact that they’re not even his own best numbers in many years.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s current low standing – a negative net approval, with approval specifically in the low-40s – clearly does not approach the  approval  peaks   of recent predecessors. President Barack Obama hit 69% approval in the early days of his first term, according to tracking by polling firm Gallup, while President George W. Bush hit 90% approval in the wake of the terror attacks of September 11, 2001. Even President Joe Biden, who struggled with weak poll numbers for much of his term, was up at 57% approval in both January 2021 and April 2021.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s claim is also wrong even if he was referring specifically to other presidents’ poll numbers on the same date of a term.\n \n\n   \n  Biden had low net approval on the equivalent day of his term, but it was still better than Trump’s in both  Morris’s average  and  Silver’s average . And Trump’s boast about beating “any president in many years” clearly suggested he was comparing himself to other presidents in addition to Biden; the data shows that  every other person elected president after World War II  had better poll numbers than Trump on the equivalent date in their ​first term, in both net approval and approval alone.\n \n\n   \n  Silver’s  historical tracking  shows that, on the date Trump made this claim while having a roughly negative-10 net approval, Obama had about a positive-9 net approval in his first term, George W. Bush about positive-76, President Bill Clinton positive-2, President George H.W. Bush about positive-38, President Ronald Reagan about positive-20, President Jimmy Carter about positive-24, President Richard Nixon about positive-27, President John F. Kennedy about positive-65, President Dwight D. Eisenhower about positive-45, and President Harry Truman about positive-41.\n \n\n   \n  It would be fair to point out that Trump is serving a (non-consecutive) second term rather than a first term. But that added context doesn’t make Trump’s assertion correct. Gallup, which  assessed presidential approval on a quarter-by-quarter basis , found that, other than Nixon, Trump had a lower average approval in his 19th quarter as president – the third quarter of the second term, running from July 20 through October 19 – than any president elected to two terms from at least Eisenhower in the 1950s onward.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Ariel Edwards-Levy contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/us/michigan-potential-terrorist-attack-averted-fbi","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"16:03:00Z","title":"FBI Averts Potential ISIS-Inspired Terror Attack in Michigan Over Halloween Weekend","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The FBI thwarted a potential ISIS-inspired terrorist attack in Michigan during Halloween weekend by identifying a group of individuals who had allegedly discussed a violent plot in online chatrooms.

But experts broadly emphasize the safety and benefits of fluoride.\n \n\n   \n  Fluoride is a mineral that can be found naturally in some foods and groundwater. It can help prevent tooth decay by strengthening the protective outer layer of enamel that can be worn away by acids formed by bacteria, plaque and sugars in the mouth.\n \n\n   \n  The practice of adding fluoride to public water systems started in the United States in 1945 to help improve oral health in a cost-effective and equitable way. The CDC named fluoridation of drinking water  one of the 10 greatest health interventions in America  in the 20th century alongside vaccination, family planning and safer workplaces.\n \n\n   \n  Most US residents live in a community where fluoride is added to public drinking water, according to  federal data  from 2022. In places where fluoride is not in the water, fluoride tablets or drops may be prescribed for babies and children to reduce the risk of tooth decay — and reliance on fluoride supplements could become more common, as Utah and Florida became the first states to  ban the practice  of adding fluoride to drinking water and similar legislation has been introduced in several other states.\n \n\n   \n  In April, the US Department of Health and Human Services and the US Environmental Protection Agency Administration  announced  that they would study the science to make a new recommendation on fluoride. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has also said he will tell the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to stop recommending fluoridation for drinking water in communities.\n \n\n   \n  The FDA launched a ”safety review and public comment period” on the issue in ​May,   ﻿and a  strategy report  from the MAHA Commission – with an agenda spearheaded by Kennedy – specifically named fluoride supplements as an issue to investigate, along with vaccine injuries and exposures to pesticides and microplastics.\n \n\n   \n  In the resulting  scientific evaluation , published Friday, the agency concluded that fluoride supplements “should not be used in children under age 3 or by older children who are not at high risk of tooth decay.”\n \n\n   \n  “For the same reason fluoride may work to kill bacteria on teeth, it may also alter the gut microbiome, which may have broader health implications,” the agency said in a news release.\n \n\n   \n  “There are better ways to protect children’s teeth than taking unapproved ingestible fluoride, which is now recognized to alter the gut microbiome. The microbiome is increasingly recognized to be central to a child’s health and development,” FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary said in the release.\n \n\n   \n  The FDA on Friday also referenced “preliminary but potentially concerning” data about the risks that fluoride can have for children’s intellectual development. A  meta-analysis published earlier this year , which would become the basis for further federal investigation, concluded that IQ drops as fluoride levels rise. But some experts have raised concerns about biases in the analysis and emphasized that it focused on levels of fluoride that are far higher than most people are exposed to.\n \n\n   \n  As water fluoridation starts to roll back in some communities, experts say that protecting the option to use prescription supplements is key. In fact, the legislation in Utah that banned the addition of fluoride to the public drinking water included provisions to expand access to prescription fluoride — and  prescriptions spiked  after the change.\n \n\n   \n  For some oral health advocates, the latest action from the FDA is a win simply because it is not an outright ban.\n \n\n   \n  “We are actually quite pleased about this decision, because fluoride supplements remain available and will continue to be a benefit to oral health,” said Dr. James Bekker, a pediatric dentist from Utah who spoke at public meeting to discuss the risks and benefits of the prescription fluoride supplements in July.\n \n\n   \n  “We feel that the decision of the FDA to continue making fluoride supplements available is an indication that all of the input generated from health professionals was heard and considered in their decision,” Bekker said in an email to CNN on Friday. “Providers can prescribe according to their consultation with parents and patients at recommended levels. We still recommend starting fluoride supplements at age 6 months in non-fluoridated water communities and will rely on knowledgeable health professionals to follow the documented science as they consider appropriate ages and dosages.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/uk/brother-virginia-giuffre-king-charles-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"16:00:00Z","title":"Brother of Virginia Giuffre calls for a meeting with King Charles to shed more light on the Epstein case","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Sky Roberts, the brother of Virginia Giuffre, has called for a meeting with King Charles III to share his sister’s traumatic experiences and urge the monarchy to use its influence to expose the full scope of Jeffrey Epstein’s sex-trafficking network.

4:26 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump announced on Thursday that he has renovated the Lincoln Bedroom bathroom, sharing before and after images on social media as he continues to put his touch on the  White House .\n \n\n   \n  “I renovated the Lincoln Bathroom in the White House. It was renovated in the 1940s in an art deco green tile style, which was totally inappropriate for the Lincoln Era,” Trump said on Truth Social. “I did it in black and white polished Statuary marble. This was very appropriate for the time of Abraham Lincoln and, in fact, could be the marble that was originally there!”\n \n\n   \n  The president posted about the renovations aboard Air Force One en route to Florida, where he will spend the weekend. The post comes as the government remains shutdown, and the Trump administration says it will not tap into emergency funds to fund SNAP food assistance benefits through the month of November.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after, Trump posted more images of the bathroom, showing gold detailing on the faucet and shower handle, as well as other fixtures. A plush white robe with presidential seal also hangs on a golden hook.\n \n\n   \n  The president discussed the changes he was making to the bathroom earlier this month during a dinner at the White House, saying in part that the old style of the bathroom “was not exactly Abe Lincoln.”\n \n\n   \n  “We have little things like at the Lincoln Bedroom. The bathroom was done by the Truman family and you know, long time ago. And it’s done in a green tile, and it’s done in a style that was not exactly Abe Lincoln,” the president said.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s actually Art Deco. And Art Deco doesn’t go with, you know, 1850 and Civil Wars…But what does do is statuary marble. So I ripped it apart and we built a bathroom. It’s absolutely gorgeous and totally in keeping with that time because the Lincoln bedroom is, uh, so incredible, for those of you that have seen it,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Trump on Friday also gave a status update on a separate construction project he’s overseeing at the Kennedy Center, which he said he “just inspected.”\n \n\n   \n  “The exterior columns, which were in serious danger of corrosion if something weren’t done, are completed, and look magnificent in White Enamel — Like a different place! Marble is being done, stages are being renovated, new seats, new chairs, and new fabrics will soon be installed, and magnificent high end carpeting throughout the building. It is happening faster than anticipated, one of my trademarks,” Trump said.\n \n\n   \n  “We are bringing this building back to life. It was dead as a doornail, but it will soon be beautiful again!” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The moves are part of Trump’s effort to put his stamp on the White House – which has seen a slew of changes since he took office – and the greater DC area.\n \n\n   \n   So far, the renovations include paving over the grass in the historic Rose Garden, demolishing the East Wing to make way for a new ballroom and adorning the Oval Office with gold.\n \n\n   \n  Trump often says the White House needed a new ballroom to host world leaders, to avoid situations where they are outside and a temporary tent has to be used when it rains. And he frequently remarked that the Rose Garden paving was necessary, because women in high heels would sink into the grass during events. It now has a touch of Mar-a-Lago with the same white and yellow umbrellas at tables on the patio.\n \n\n   \n  His  redecoration  of the Oval Office to his liking, as presidents do when they take office, has tripled the number of paintings on the walls with gold just about everywhere. Trump also installed portraits of every president framed in gold on the West Colonnade – except for former President Joe Biden who is instead represented by his autopen signature – and large floor-to-ceiling mirrors, which press can see when they are escorted into the Oval Office.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to those changes, Trump plans to build a  new arch monument  in DC in honor of the country’s 250th anniversary.\n \n\n   \n  As he pushes forward with his plans to leave his mark on the White House and the nation’s capital, Trump this week  fired the members  of the Commission of Fine Arts. The independent federal agency is charged with advising the president, Congress and the city of Washington, DC, on “matters of design and aesthetics.” The president has also installed allies on the National Capital Planning Commission, which will be tasked with approving plans for the new ballroom on White House grounds.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/world/un-human-rights-chief-drug-boats-strikes-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"15:11:00Z","title":"UN Human Rights Chief Says U.S. Strikes on Alleged Drug Boats Are 'Unacceptable'","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The UN Human Rights Chief, Volker Türk, has condemned U.S. military strikes on boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean, calling them 'unacceptable' and a violation of international human rights law.

Press\n \n   \n  The UN human rights chief said Friday that US  military strikes  against boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean allegedly carrying illegal drugs from South America are “unacceptable” and must stop.\n \n\n   \n  The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights,  Volker Türk , called for an investigation into the strikes, in what appeared to mark the first such condemnation of its kind from a United Nations organization.\n \n\n   \n  Ravina Shamdasani, a spokeswoman for Türk’s office, relayed his message Friday at a regular UN briefing: “These attacks and their mounting human cost are unacceptable. The US must halt such attacks and take all measures necessary to prevent the extrajudicial killing of people aboard these boats.”\n \n\n   \n  She said Türk believed “airstrikes by the United States of America on boats in the Caribbean and in the Pacific violate international human rights law.”\n \n\n   \n  US President  Donald Trump  has justified the attacks on the boats as a necessary escalation to stem the flow of drugs into the United States, but the campaign against drug cartels has been divisive among countries in the region.\n \n\n   \n  The strikes and the US military’s growing presence near Venezuela have stoked fears that the Trump administration could  try to topple Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro , who faces charges of narcoterrorism in the United States.\n \n\n   \n  Asked Friday if he’s considering land strikes in Venezuela,  Trump said, “No.”  He did not elaborate as he spoke to reporters aboard Air Force One as he heads to Florida for the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking earlier this week from the USS George Washington aircraft carrier in Japan, Trump noted the US attacks at sea and reiterated that “now we’ll stop the drugs coming in by land.”\n \n\n   \n  US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Wednesday announced the latest US military strike in the campaign, against a boat he said was carrying drugs in the eastern Pacific Ocean. All four people aboard were killed. It was the 14th strike since the campaign began in early September, while the death toll has grown to at least 61.\n \n\n   \n  Shamdasani noted the US explanations of the efforts as an anti-drug and counterterrorism campaign, but said countries have long agreed that the fight against illicit drug trafficking is a law enforcement matter governed by “careful limits” placed on the use of lethal force.\n \n\n   \n  Intentional use of lethal force is allowed only as a last resort against someone representing “an imminent threat to life,” she said. “Otherwise, it would amount to a violation of the right of life and constitute extrajudicial killings.”\n \n\n   \n  The strikes are taking place “outside the context” of armed conflict or active hostilities, Shamdasani said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/jeffrey-epstein-financial-records-unsealed-jp-morgan","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"17:16:00-04:00","title":"Newly unsealed Epstein records shed light on years of his financial transactions with Wall St. figures","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Newly unsealed court records reveal that JPMorgan Chase filed over 17 years of suspicious activity reports (SARs) between 2002 and 2019 detailing more than $1 billion in financial transactions involving Jeffrey Epstein.

Two accounts included in the report were linked to Russian banks Alfa Bank and Sberbank.\n \n\n   \n  The bank wrote in the SAR it was flagging the transactions because of negative media about Epstein’s alleged sex trafficking of minors, media reports of allegations Epstein misappropriating money as an investment adviser, his use of multiple accounts, the Russian banks, and his relationships with two US presidents.\n \n\n   \n  Epstein was arrested in July 2019 and charged with sex trafficking underaged girls. He died weeks later by suicide in the Metropolitan Correctional Center while awaiting trial.\n \n\n   \n  Judge Jed Rakoff ordered the unsealing of the records, which were part of a lawsuit between the US Virgin Islands and JPMorgan Chase, following requests by The New York Times and Wall Street Journal. In 2023, JPMorgan Chase agreed to pay $290 million to settle a class action lawsuit from survivors of Epstein and an additional $75 million to settle with USVI, where Epstein owned an island. There was no admission of wrongdoing in these settlements.\n \n\n   \n  The documents are the latest in a slow release of materials tied to Epstein as public demand for accountability and transparency about Epstein has gone global. Thursday, Britain’s King Charles took the extraordinary step of stripping his brother Andrew of his prince title. The Justice Department remains under pressure to release more information about its investigation into Epstein, and House lawmakers are taking depositions for their investigation.\n \n\n   \n  Included in the hundreds of pages of unsealed documents are emails between Epstein and Jes Staley, a former top official at JPMorgan bank, who in 2021 resigned as head of Barclays bank following media scrutiny over his long relationship with Epstein. This year, Staley  said  he didn’t know about Epstein’s involvement with underaged girls but admitted in court that he had sex with one of Epstein’s assistants.\n \n\n   \n  Among the pages are emails between Epstein and Staley, with Epstein suggesting he could set up meetings for Staley to recruit new clients including the co-founders of Google and heads of nations.  None of the individuals were accused of any wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  Prior to Epstein’s death in 2019, JPMorgan filed a number of SARs involving the disgraced financier’s accounts, and the documents show banking officials shared news articles about Epstein’s alleged activities. JPMorgan closed its accounts with Epstein in 2013, five years after Epstein pleaded guilty to state prostitution charges and reached a non-prosecution agreement with the US attorney’s office in the Southern District of Florida.\n \n\n   \n  The newly unsealed records include the SARs, including one dating as far back as 2002, as well as the last one filed in September 2019.\n \n\n   \n  “Generally, the only new material here is the SARs themselves. Those basically summarize financial information produced in litigation, much of which has been public for years. The SARs do confirm what’s been inferred all along: the bank filed SARs about Epstein early on, and specifically when it exited Epstein from the bank in 2013 – and repeatedly between 2013 and 2019, as required,” said Patricia Wexler, a spokesperson for JPMorgan Chase.   “It does not appear that anyone in the government or law enforcement acted on those SARs for years.”\n \n\n   \n  In the batch of documents, there’s a letter from the US attorney’s office for the Southern District of Florida which in 2007 sought records from Bear Stearns, one of Epstein’s banks that was later acquired by JPMorgan, as part of its then investigation into Epstein that resulted in the non-prosecution agreement.\n \n\n   \n  One of the biggest Wall Street names mentioned on the list of transactions on the 2019 SAR is Leon Black, a long-time associate of Epstein, who has maintained that Epstein gave him financial advice.\n \n\n   \n  “After an exhaustive investigation more than four years ago, the Dechert law firm concluded that Mr. Black paid Epstein only for tax and estate planning advice that saved him and his family billions of dollars. To imply that Epstein somehow had influence over Mr. Black is false and patently absurd,” Susan Estrich, an attorney for Black, said in a statement. “Indeed, it was Mr. Black who fired Epstein because he was disruptive and believed the fees for his services were excessive. The Dechert Report also found that Mr. Black had no knowledge of Epstein’s criminal activities.”\n \n\n   \n  The unsealed records include emails between Staley and Epstein about meeting in 2010 with then Prince Andrew. The then-Prince emailed Staley, “Wishing you a very happy Christmas and New Year.”\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat, has asked JPMorgan for banking records and suggested officials turned a blind eye to Epstein’s conduct to make millions of dollars in fees from his accounts.\n \n\n   \n  In a recent response, the bank denied knowledge of Epstein’s activities, writing, “with the exception of former JPMC executive Jes Staley, the bank’s executives (current and former) are respected professionals who acted with integrity and would never have allowed Epstein to remain a client if they knew of his ongoing crimes.”\n \n\n   \n  “The Firm deeply regrets having had Epstein as a client and would never have continued doing business with him if it believed he engaged in ongoing criminal conduct,” the bank also said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/middleeast/turkey-ski-resort-fire-sentence-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"16:26:00Z","title":"Turkish court sentences hotel owner and 10 others to life for deadly fire that killed 78","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Turkish court sentenced hotel owner Halit Ergul and 10 others to life imprisonment for severe negligence in a deadly fire at the Grand Kartal Hotel in Bolu on January 21, 2025, which killed 78 people—including 34 children—and injured 133 others.

owner of a ski resort hotel and 10 others to life in prison after convicting them of severe negligence in connection with a  deadly fire  that swept through the property, the state-run Anadolu Agency reported.\n \n\n   \n  The blaze hit the 12-story  Grand Kartal Hotel  at the Kartalkaya ski resort in the province of Bolu on January 21 during the winter school break,  killing 78 people  and injuring 133 others. A total of 34 children taking family vacations were among the victims.\n \n\n   \n  The court convicted hotel owner Halit Ergul, along with his wife, two daughters, hotel managers, a deputy mayor and a deputy fire chief of negligence with “probable intent to kill.” They were each sentenced to life imprisonment for the deaths of the children, and received an additional 25 years in prison for the 44 other fatalities.\n \n\n   \n  The defendants, who have rejected responsibility for the deaths, were expected to appeal the decision. The courtroom broke into applause after the verdicts were read, with families welcoming the sentence, Haberturk news channel reported.\n \n\n   \n  The disaster forced terrified guests and hotel staff to leap from windows or dangle bedsheets to escape rooms engulfed in smoke and flames.

Staff noticed the flames seven minutes later, but within two minutes, the fire had spread beyond control. Air from an open door accelerated the flames, which quickly engulfed the wooden ceiling.\n \n\n   \n  Poor safety measures — including lack of smoke extraction, faulty alarms, inadequate staff training and missing sprinkler systems — allowed fumes to fill upper floors.

  \nUpdated: \n        3:52 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  A Republican-dominated Ohio panel adopted new US House districts on Friday that could boost the GOP’s chances of winning two additional seats in next year’s elections and aid President Donald Trump’s efforts to hold on to a slim congressional majority.\n \n\n   \n  The action by the Ohio Redistricting Commission came as  Virginia’s  Democratic-led General Assembly advanced a proposed constitutional amendment that could pave the way for redistricting in the state ahead of congressional midterm elections next year. The Senate on Friday passed a resolution that would allow lawmakers to temporarily bypass a bipartisan redistricting commission and gerrymander their maps. The House had advanced it Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has been urging Republican-led states to reshape their US House districts in an attempt to win more seats. But unlike in other states, Ohio’s redistricting was required by the state constitution because the current districts were adopted after the 2020 census without bipartisan support.\n \n\n   \n  Ohio joins Texas, Missouri and North Carolina, where Republican lawmakers already have revised their congressional districts.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats have been pushing back. California voters are deciding Tuesday on a redistricting plan passed by the Democratic-led legislature.\n \n\n   \n  The political parties are in an intense battle. Democrats need to gain just three seats in next year’s election to win control of the House and gain the power to impede Trump’s agenda.\n \n\n   \n  In Ohio, Republicans already hold 10 of 15 congressional seats. The new map could boost Republican chances in already competitive districts currently held by Democratic Reps. Greg Landsman in Cincinnati and Marcy Kaptur near Toledo. Kaptur won a 22nd term last year by about 2,400 votes, or less than 1 percentage point, in a district carried by Trump. Landsman was reelected with more than 54% of the vote.\n \n\n   \n    Ohio residents criticize new map\n \n\n   \n  Ohio’s commission had faced a Friday deadline to adopt a new map, or else the task would have fallen to the GOP-led legislature, which could have crafted districts even more favorable to Republicans. But any redistricting bill passed by the legislature could have been subject to an initiative petition campaign from opponents seeking to force a public referendum on the new map.\n \n\n   \n  The uncertainty of that legislative process provided commissioners of both parties with some incentive for compromise. All seven commissioners — five Republicans and two Democrats — voted for the new map.\n \n\n   \n  But Ohio residents who testified to commissioners Friday denounced the new districts. Julia Cattaneo, who wore a shirt saying “gerrymandering is cheating,” said the new map is gerrymandered more for Republicans than the one it is replacing and is not the sort of compromise needed.\n \n\n   \n  “Yes, you are compromising — your integrity, honor, duty and to represent Ohioans,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Added resident Scott Sibley: “This map is an affront to democracy, and you should all — every one of you — be ashamed.”\n \n\n   \n  Republican state Auditor Keith Farber, a member of the commission, defended the map during a testy exchange with one opponent. Because many Democrats live in cities and many Republicans in rural areas, he said there was no way to draw a map creating eight Republican and seven Democratic districts — as some had urged — without splitting cities, counties and townships.\n \n\n   \n    Virginia Democrats point at Trump to defend redistricting\n \n\n   \n  Virginia is represented in the US House by six Democrats and five Republicans. Democratic lawmakers haven’t unveiled their planned new map, nor how many seats they are trying to gain, but said their moves are necessary to respond to the Trump-inspired gerrymandering in Republican-led states.\n \n\n   \n  “Our voters are asking to have that voice. They’re asking that we protect democracy, that we not allow gerrymandering to happen throughout the country, and we sit back,” said Democratic Sen. Barbara Favola.\n \n\n   \n  The proposed constitutional amendment would let lawmakers temporarily bypass a bipartisan commission and redraw congressional districts to their advantage. The measure would still need to pass the General Assembly again next year, then go before voters in a statewide referendum.\n \n\n   \n  The developments come as Virginia holds statewide elections Tuesday, where all 100 seats in the House of Delegates are on the ballot. Democrats would need to keep their slim majority in the lower chamber to advance the constitutional amendment next year.\n \n\n   \n  Republican Sen. Mark Obenshain said Democrats were ignoring the will of voters who had overwhelmingly approved a bipartisan redistricting commission.\n \n\n   \n  “Heaven forbid that we actually link arms and work together on something,” Obenshain said. “What the voters of Virginia said is, ‘We expect redistricting to be an issue that we work across the aisle on, that we link arms on.’”\n \n\n   \n  But Democratic Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, who has long championed the state’s bipartisan redistricting commission, noted the panel still would be in charge of redistricting after the 2030 census.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re not trying to end the practice of fair maps,” he said. “We are asking the voters if, in this one limited case, they want to ensure that a constitutional-norm-busting president can’t break the entire national election by twisting the arms of a few state legislatures.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/government-shutdown-billions-federal-aid-dries-up","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"16:59:00Z","title":"‘I feel guilty eating a meal’: Low-income families prepare to lose access to billions in federal aid","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the U.S. government shutdown reaches its one-month mark, millions of low-income Americans are facing severe hardships due to the suspension of key federal assistance programs.

aid \n       \n  By Isabelle Khurshudyan, Tami Luhby, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:59 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Annemarie King is eating only once a day, and her husband, Randall, is picking up extra shifts at the drywall factory where he works. They are among the nearly 42 million Americans preparing for their food stamp benefits to run dry in November because of the ongoing  government shutdown .\n \n\n   \n  The Kings, who live in Cincinnati and have eight young children, depend on the roughly $1,000 in food stamps that they receive at the start of every month to stock their refrigerator with fresh fruits, vegetables and meat.\n \n\n   \n  But since the US Department of Agriculture  announced in mid-October  that it doesn’t have the funding to provide next month’s benefits during the government shutdown, Annemarie, a stay-at-home mother, has been buying more canned and boxed items and preparing less for dinner.\n \n\n   \n  She’s also going without food herself. Her 11-year-old son has noticed, she said, but she tells him not to worry and that she ate while he was at school.\n \n\n   \n  “I feel guilty eating a meal,” Annemarie said. “I don’t want to take food away from them.”\n \n\n   \n  As the shutdown nears the one-month mark, it’s not just furloughed federal workers feeling the financial strain. Low-income households across the country will lose access to  key social safety net programs  in the coming days as billions of dollars in federal funding dries up.\n \n\n   \n  Beginning November 1, more than 65,000 children and families could lose access to Head Start programs, which provide early education and child development resources, according to the National Head Start Association. For some parents, that means they might have to quit their jobs because they won’t have child care anymore.\n \n\n   \n  Others are worried they might not get heat subsidies from the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program before the winter months. On top of that, roughly 24 million Americans who receive health insurance through the Affordable Care Act are preparing for what is likely to be a  significant increase  in premiums next year.\n \n\n   \n  In interviews with people in cities across the country, the early implications of the stop in federal funding for low-income families are starting to come into focus. Food banks and other charities are expecting higher demand, as millions face increasingly desperate situations without the programs they rely on.\n \n\n   \n  At the Kings’ household, the loss of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, means that instead of serving chicken, a fresh vegetable and either mashed potatoes or macaroni and cheese, Annemarie has been cooking chicken and canned green beans. Chilis, pastas and roasts are on the menu more often since they can last for a few days.\n \n\n   \n  “Our family is suffering because neither side will compromise,” Annemarie said of the stalemate on Capitol Hill.  “It’s no longer a Democrat thing, it’s no longer a Republican thing. It’s our lives.”\n \n\n   \n  The status of SNAP funding for November is currently uncertain, however. A federal judge in Boston indicated Thursday that she will intervene in a high-stakes fight between Democratic-led states and the Trump administration over its US Department of Agriculture’s decision to not tap into billions of dollars in emergency funds to provide benefits next month.\n \n\n   \n  However the judge rules, millions of Americans will not receive their food stamp benefits on time. An estimated 3 million people will be affected on November 1 alone, according to estimates from Code for America, which works with all levels of government to improve access to food assistance and other safety net programs.\n \n\n   \n   Food pantries  around the country are preparing for a surge in demand next week if people don’t receive their SNAP stipends. But food bank directors have warned that they can provide only a fraction of the meals that are supplied by federal assistance.\n \n\n   \n  And for some households, the loss of more than one of these programs has a compounding effect.\n \n\n   \n  In Hillsboro, Ohio – about an hour outside Cincinnati – the closure of the local Head Start program means Lauren Lowe, 42, will likely have to quit her job as a restaurant server. She and her husband were able to both work full time while their 4-year-old son, Carter, attended Head Start on weekdays.\n \n\n   \n  He and 176 other kids got meals and health care there. And he loved his friends and teachers, Lowe said. Since she’s had to tell him that this will be his last week in the program, Carter is “broken-hearted right now. He’s crying every single morning because he wants to be in school with his friends,” Lowe said.\n \n\n   \n  Lowe is feeling uneasy, too. Quitting her job means less income for the household – in addition to missing their food stamp benefits. \n \n\n   \n  “It’s really scary because, how do we make ends meet?” Lowe said. “I either stay home and school my child or figure out how we’re going to pay the bills to keep a roof over our heads and food on the table.”\n \n\n   \n  Lowe will also have to replace the two meals Carter was getting every day he was at Head Start.\n \n\n   \n  “On Monday mornings, kids do come in hungrier than usual, so we know they’re really dependent on that breakfast, lunch and snack we give them,” said Julia Wise, the executive director of the Highland County Community Action Organization, which runs the Hillsboro Head Start program. \n \n\n   \n  Wise said 45 Head Start staff will be furloughed on Monday. Other Head Start programs — particularly those run by larger entities, such as nonprofits, school districts and local governments — can limp along by drawing on community support or taking out lines of credit.\n \n\n   \n  In the Kansas City area, 17 programs with grants expiring on November 1 decided to take a “financial risk” by staying open, said Kasey Lawson, the Head Start director for the Mid-America Regional Council. The providers do not know if they will be reimbursed later when the new grant year is funded.\n \n\n   \n  In Hillsboro, teachers prepared homework packets that will take the kids through the end of November, so they can keep studying even when the program is closed. Some of that staff will likely   get other jobs before the government shutdown ends, meaning whenever Head Start does get funding again, it might not have enough educators to reopen all its classrooms, Wise said.\n \n\n   \n  For those who can’t find other work, “they’re going on furlough, they’re not going to have money coming in, so they could apply for SNAP benefits, but now SNAP is not going to be available either,” Wise said.\n \n\n   \n  “This is impacting us across the board,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  In rural Oregon, where the temperatures are already dipping below the freezing mark, the suspension of funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, is putting lives at risk, said Sheri Gutierrez, energy program manager at Community Action Program of East Central Oregon, a nonprofit that provides a range of services for residents in need.\n \n\n   \n  The $4 billion program, which helps nearly 6 million people pay their utility bills, is not in as immediate danger as SNAP and Head Start; the aid is typically distributed to utility companies between mid-November and early December.\n \n\n   \n  But barely a month into the season, Community Action in Oregon already has more than $200,000 in grant payments that are on hold until the government reopens. Many of its clients heat their homes with propane, wood and heating oil, and they don’t enjoy the same continuous service and shutoff protections available to many people who use electricity and natural gas to stay warm.\n \n\n   \n  The delay has worried local residents, some of whom are using old space heaters or their ovens, which Gutierrez says aren’t safe.\n \n\n   \n  “We hear the desperation when speaking to these clients on a daily basis. People want reassurance that they will get assistance,” she said. “LIHEAP is lifesaving. Without heat, they won’t survive.”\n \n\n   \n  In Lakeville, Minnesota, Ronda Beck is also waiting for help from LIHEAP to cover the electric bill. After speaking with her utility company “at great length,” Beck was told she could pay whatever she can until her grant is funded and she won’t be disconnected. But she’s not sure how she’ll scrape together a couple of bucks since she’s not working.\n \n\n   \n  “Where do I get $5 from?” She said. “It’s a tough situation.”\n \n\n   \n  Beck figured she could survive on groceries she picks up from her local food pantries if she and her adult son stop receiving food stamps next month – that is until she found out on Tuesday that one of the groups is only providing two or three days of food, instead two weeks’ worth. Now, she’s terrified.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t want to go hungry,” said Beck, who along with her son is looking for jobs in Lakeville, Minnesota, where they live. “I don’t want to walk into [a food pantry] and have them say, ‘We’re at our limit’.”\n \n\n   \n  Just outside Washington DC, Willissa Bullock worries about her food bank running out, as it’s dealing with a surge in demand from furloughed federal workers in the area. When the Landover, Maryland, resident heard that the USDA would not issue benefits next month, Bullock says she cried – nervous about how she would provide for her kids, who are in college.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this week, Bullock left a local food pantry run by No Limits Outreach Ministries with only enough items – including lettuce, apple juice, and canned goods – to last two or three days. Until recently, her shopping cart would be overflowing.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m telling the kids to look for jobs,” said Bullock, who is unemployed and applying for disability after having back surgery. “It’s the only way we’ll be able to eat.”\n \n\n   \n  The food pantry has been receiving fewer shipments from Capital Area Food Bank after two  Covid 19-era relief programs  were canceled earlier this year. The pantry used to be able to offer meat, fish, eggs and milk to its clients, but now it mostly has beans, rice and canned foods, said Oliver Carter, pastor of No Limits Outreach Ministries.\n \n\n   \n  “Our storage used to be full and now it’s almost empty,” Carter said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/senate-filibuster-trump-republicans","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"12:59:00-04:00","title":"Republican Leaders Reject Ending the Senate Filibuster Despite Trump’s Call to Nuke It","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Despite President Donald Trump's urgent call to end the Senate filibuster in an attempt to resolve a 31-day government shutdown, top Republican leaders—including Senate Majority Leader John Thune and House Speaker Mike Johnson—have firmly rejected the move.

But the GOP speaker warned that Democrats would use the move to pass extreme measures the next time they control the upper chamber.\n \n\n   \n  “They would pack the Supreme Court, they would make Puerto Rico and DC states. They would ban firearms. They would do all sorts of things that would be very harmful to the country,” Johnson said, stressing that Trump’s late-night Truth Social post on the filibuster was an “expression of the president’s anger at this situation.”\n \n\n   \n  The rare split between congressional Republicans and the White House comes as the Washington stalemate and the pains of the shutdown around the country have deepened in recent days. But the GOP leaders’ swift move to quash Trump’s suggestion on the filibuster is a reflection of a clear political reality on Capitol Hill: There is little support for such a move within the Senate GOP conference.\n \n\n   \n  The filibuster rule is unique to the Senate, and it gives the minority the power to block a bill from coming up for a vote as long as at least 41 senators oppose it. Since one party rarely wins more than 60 seats, proponents have argued that the filibuster encourages compromise and makes it more difficult to enact massive partisan reforms.\n \n\n   \n  Taking the so-called nuclear option would require near-unanimity, since Thune and Senate GOP leaders could only lose three votes from their own party to do so if all Democrats oppose the move. And the number of GOP senators currently opposed stands far higher than that, with at least a dozen Republicans on the record against it.\n \n\n   \n  Still, deploying the “nuclear option” would not entirely end the Senate’s filibuster. Instead, it would eliminate the 60-vote threshold to end debate, instead requiring 51 votes.\n \n\n   \n  One of those lawmakers, freshman Sen. John Curtis of Utah, made clear Friday morning that he remained opposed despite Trump’s urging.\n \n\n   \n  “The filibuster forces us to find common ground in the Senate. Power changes hands, but principles shouldn’t. I’m a firm no on eliminating it,” Curtis wrote on X.\n \n\n   \n  ﻿Several GOP senators have echoed that sentiment in a sign that Trump could face a steep battle with his own party to push through any rules change.\n \n\n   \n  GOP Sen. Roger Marshall called the idea a “non-starter” earlier this month, saying that “a republic protects the rights of the minority. Otherwise you just take a poll and you switch the direction the ship is going. So that filibuster helps protect the minority, and I think it’s served our country well.”\n \n\n   \n  Also earlier in the month, Thune himself ruled out changing the Senate rules to end the shutdown, calling the filibuster “something that’s been a bulwark against a lot of really bad things happening with the country.” At the time, Thune said he’d gotten no pressure from the White House to end it.\n \n\n   \n  His team’s Friday statement reaffirming the leader’s opposition had some Senate Republicans breathing a sigh of relief, according to one GOP senate staffer.\n \n\n   \n  “Definitely gives us cover,” the GOP aide told CNN. “No one in the conference seriously wants to nuke the filibuster except maybe two.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/media/gayle-king-cbs-news-bari-weiss-ellison","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"13:54:00-04:00","title":"CBS News roiled by rumors, with Gayle King’s future the latest flashpoint","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"CBS News is experiencing widespread speculation and internal confusion following David Ellison’s recent takeover and the appointment of controversial editor-in-chief Bari Weiss.

CNN\n \n   \n  CBS News is in an unenviable position right now: It’s the subject of anonymously sourced reporting and rumor-mongering that’s sowing confusion while division-wide layoffs cause pain and corporate changes add to anxiety.\n \n\n   \n  Many of the reported changes at CBS have not happened yet and may never happen. But each story adds to the uncertainty and unease in the air. The latest one is about Gayle King, with Variety  reporting  that she is “expected to depart” her longtime TV home, “CBS Mornings,” next year.\n \n\n   \n  If that’s the case, it would be news to King, whose contract doesn’t expire for another six months. She  told TMZ on Friday  morning: “All I’ve been told by everybody in this building is that they want me here, they like the job I’ve been doing… What I’m hearing in the building is not what I’m reading in the press.”\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the CBS News management team is in whack-a-mole mode, trying to tamp down the speculation — and probably trying to avoid any potential blowback from viewers.\n \n\n   \n  All the instability stems from David Ellison’s recent takeover of Paramount and  his decision to appoint  Bari Weiss as the editor-in-chief of CBS News.\n \n\n   \n  Weiss, the entrepreneurial and opinionated co-founder of The Free Press website, is an irresistible story to the media chattering classes. People both inside and outside CBS are desperate to know what she’s going to change at the storied news division.\n \n\n   \n  Weiss, who has been on the job for just a few weeks, has been frustrated about the leaks relating to her arrival, according to a recent  New York Times report .\n \n\n   \n  She certainly deserves time and space to get to know CBS News and think through potential changes. But just this week, there have been stories about who Weiss may or may not want to keep at “60 Minutes;” who she may or may not want to hire for the “CBS Evening News;” and now, what might happen to the morning show.\n \n\n   \n  “You know the old adage: Nobody knows anything,” a CBS source remarked, pointing out that all the speculation is destabilizing in the meantime.\n \n\n   \n  The news division also  laid off about one hundred people  earlier this week, though the cuts were foreshadowed months ago, well before Weiss was hired.\n \n\n   \n    The morning show intrigue\n \n\n   \n  The CBS weekday morning show has undergone multiple permutations over the past decade, and King has been the central player throughout, helming the show while other co-hosts have come and gone.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday night, Variety reporters Matt Donnelly and Brian Steinberg wrote that King is “expected to depart” the show and “may shift to a different role at the news division,” potentially with “a deal to produce her own programming for the network.”\n \n\n   \n  The pair also wrote that “negotiations are about to ensue,” which left some CBS staffers wondering: Is someone prematurely leaking that King is departing, and if so, why? Or is King privately telling people that she wants out, no matter what CBS offers?\n \n\n   \n  All the broadcast networks have been trying to lower salary costs in recent years, so there is little doubt that CBS would want King to accept a pay cut to stay at the network in any capacity.\n \n\n   \n  CBS responded forcefully to the Variety article, saying, “There have been no discussions with Gayle about her contract that runs through May 2026.” (And King told TMZ on Friday, “I am not going to negotiate in the media.”)\n \n\n   \n  It is highly unusual for a network to say when a star’s contract is up, but it showed that the typical window for negotiations hasn’t even opened yet.\n \n\n   \n  As Variety noted, “Moving King is a risky maneuver, especially because morning-TV is built on the relationships viewers build with the hosts.”\n \n\n   \n  That’s likely why CBS said in its statement that King is “a truly valued part of CBS and we look forward to engaging with her about the future.”\n \n\n   \n  Her co-host on the morning show, Nate Burleson, also commented personally on Instagram, reflecting how the uncertainty is weighing on staffers at the network.\n \n\n   \n  “I hope this rumor doesn’t hold up,” he wrote, calling King “a fixture, a force, and a part of the fabric of ‘CBS Mornings.’”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/pentagon-tomahawks-trump-ukraine","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"13:00:00-04:00","title":"Pentagon Cleared Giving Ukraine Long-Range Tomahawk Missiles, Leaving Final Decision to Trump","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Pentagon has cleared the White House to provide Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk missiles, asserting no negative impact on U.S. military stockpiles.

Tomahawks have a range of around 1,000 miles.\n \n\n   \n  The assessment buoyed the US’ European allies, who believ e  that the US now ha s  fewer excuses not to provide the missiles, two European officials said. Trump also said just days before meeting Zelensky that the US has “a lot of Tomahawks” that it could potentially give to Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  US and European officials were surprised, therefore, when Trump dramatically changed his tune days later, saying during opening remarks at a White House working lunch with Zelensky that the US “needs” the Tomahawks.   He then told Zelensky behind closed doors that the US would not be providing them — at least not yet.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s decision came one day after he spoke by phone to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who told Trump that Tomahawks could hit major Russian cities like Moscow and St. Petersburg – would have no significant impact on the battlefield but would damage the US-Russia relationship, CNN has reported.\n \n\n   \n  The White House and Pentagon did not return requests for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has not taken the missiles off the table altogether, sources previously told CNN, and the administration has drawn up plans to provide them to Ukraine quickly should Trump give the order. Trump has also grown so frustrated in recent weeks with Putin’s unwillingness to seriously consider peace talks that he approved new US sanctions on Russian oil firms last week and scrapped — for now — a planned meeting with Putin in Budapest to discuss Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  While the Pentagon doesn’t have concerns about stockpiles, US defense officials are still grappling with how Ukraine would train on and deploy the missiles, officials said. There are still several operational issues that would need to be resolved for Ukraine to be able to use the missiles effectively, the sources added.\n \n\n   \n  One outstanding question is how Ukraine would fire the missiles if the US provided them. Tomahawks are most commonly launched from surface ships or submarines, but Ukraine’s Navy is severely depleted ,  so the missiles would likely need to be launched on land. The Marine Corps and Army have developed ground-based launchers that could be provided to Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  But even if the US did not want to provide the launchers, European officials believe Ukraine could figure out a workaround. One official pointed out that Ukrainian engineers were able to develop a workaround to use the UK-provided Storm Shadow missiles, which were originally designed to be used by modern NATO aircraft and had to be integrated into Ukraine’s aging, Soviet-era fighter jet fleet.\n \n\n   \n  In a post on X earlier this week, Zelenksy said Ukraine hopes to expand its long-range capabilities by the end of this year so the war can end “on fair terms” for the country.\n \n\n   \n  “Global sanctions and our pinpoint precision are practically syncing up to end this war on terms fair for Ukraine,” he wrote. “All deep-strike goals must be fully locked in by year’s end, including expansion of our long-range footprint.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/us/jetblue-flight-emergency-landing-florida","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"14:02:00Z","title":"At least 15 people sent to hospital after JetBlue flight drops altitude, forcing emergency landing in Florida, officials say","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A JetBlue flight (Flight 1230) traveling from Cancun, Mexico, to Newark, New Jersey, experienced a sudden drop in altitude of about 100 feet in seven seconds around 1:48 p.m. ET, prompting emergency landing at Tampa International Airport.

a sudden drop in altitude on a JetBlue flight that forced an emergency landing in Tampa, officials said.\n \n\n   \n  Flight 1230 was heading Thursday from Cancun, Mexico, to Newark, New Jersey, when it “experienced a drop in altitude,” JetBlue said in a statement, causing pilots to call for medical help. The plane diverted to Tampa International Airport around 2 p.m. ET, the Federal Aviation Administration said.\n \n\n   \n  The plane dropped about 100 feet in about seven seconds around 1:48 p.m. before making a more normal descent into Tampa, data from  FlightRadar24  shows. Medical personnel were there to meet the plane on arrival, an airport spokesperson said.\n \n\n   \n  The FAA is investigating a “flight control issue” on the Airbus A320, it said, echoing a pilot’s message to air traffic controllers around the time of the brief descent. The National Transportation Safety Board is aware of the incident but has not started an investigation, the agency told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The flight disruption comes in a  volatile year  for air travel, with a major  midair collision ,  runway incursions  and  serious turbulence  already in play before the monthlong  government shutdown  raised staffing issues for  air traffic controllers  as the  holiday travel season  looms.\n \n\n   \n  Just before Thursday’s emergency, a strong cold front passed through Florida, leaving gusty winds and light rain showers.

The NTSB investigated that incident.\n \n\n   \n  As air traffic controllers on Thursday guided the JetBlue flight into Tampa, pilots reported injuries, including a possible “laceration in the head,” the audio indicates.\n \n\n   \n  Some 15 to 20 people aboard the plane were evaluated and taken to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, Tampa Fire Rescue spokesperson Vivian Shedd said.\n \n\n   \n  Two children and 12 adults were taken to Tampa’s St. Joseph’s Hospital with minor injuries, and all have been discharged, a hospital spokesperson said. No further details about injuries were available.\n \n\n   \n  “Our team has taken the aircraft out of service for inspection, and we will conduct a full investigation to determine the cause,” JetBlue said in its statement. “The safety of our customers and crewmembers is always our first priority, and we will work to support those involved.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Martin Goillandeau contributed to this reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/uk/prince-andrew-scandal-analysis-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"12:30:00.000-04:00","title":"King Charles Banishes Brother Andrew From Royal Status, Exiling Him to Obscurity","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a landmark decision, King Charles III has stripped Prince Andrew of his princely title and royal status, following public outrage over his alleged connections to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and the release of accuser Virginia Giuffre’s posthumous memoir.

finally banished his brother. Is it too little too late? \n       \n  Analysis by Lauren Said-Moorhouse, Max Foster, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:30 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  King Charles’  decision  to cast out his brother Andrew from the monarchy as well as the  30-room mansion  where he’s lived for more than 20 years was as sudden as it was dramatic.\n \n\n   \n  It is the ultimate humiliation for the 65-year-old now-former prince,  known to enjoy the trappings and privilege of royal life. He will move out of Royal Lodge, his sprawling mansion in the heart of the Windsor estate just outside of London, and be exiled to the countryside to live in obscurity.\n \n\n   \n  The monarchy had been under intense pressure to resolve the Andrew issue amid renewed public fury over his ties to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, which was further inflamed by the release of his sexual abuse accuser  Virginia Giuffre’s posthumous memoir.  Andrew has repeatedly denied the allegations against him.\n \n\n   \n  Two weeks ago, Andrew  gave up the use  of his titles and honors, more than five years after  stepping back as a frontline royal . He said he was putting “duty to my family and country first,” but it did little to stop the snowballing scandal.\n \n\n   \n  Then on Thursday evening, a brusque bombshell announcement from Buckingham Palace: Andrew is to lose his princely status, and effective immediately he is plain old Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, a commoner.\n \n\n   \n  The palace statement was clear – the decision was the king’s and Andrew had no choice in the matter (although he is understood not to have objected to his brother’s actions). Notable in the statement too, an expression of solidarity with victims of abuse.\n \n\n   \n  The significance of Charles’ moves on Thursday cannot be overstated. ﻿Not since the abdication crisis of 1936 has there been such a public casting aside of a senior British royal.\n \n\n   \n  The decision would doubtless have been difficult – and, given the personal family dynamics at play, deeply personal. But the monarch had no choice – Andrew’s controversies have been dogging the family for years and the publication of his accuser’s posthumous memoir was the final straw. The negotiations to get to this stage will have been challenging but the monarch had no option but to engage damage control mode.\n \n\n   \n  It was not just the public that had expressed outrage and frustration; there had also been increasing calls for Andrew to appear before a parliamentary committee. Perhaps this move will head off that particular indignity.\n \n\n   \n  Royal historian Kate Williams said the King’s decision was “unprecedented.”\n \n\n   \n  “This is a huge move from the royal family. Just recently, the King announced that Andrew was stepping back from the title Duke of York just a few days before Ms. Giuffre’s memoir was published. But that simply wasn’t enough for public opinion,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “We have had people in the past losing the title of prince or princess. Henry VIII (reigned 1509-1547) said his daughters were no longer legitimate after he annulled the marriages with their mothers, Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn – but he changed his mind later.”\n \n\n   \n  She also pointed out Prince Charles Edward – one of Queen Victoria’s grandsons – whose title of the Duke of Albany was removed by parliament in 1917 after he fought for Germany in World War I. But Andrew’s situation, Williams said, was different as he was censured because of his serious errors of judgment.\n \n\n   \n  The King’s moves were welcomed by many British politicians. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said that “the King has clearly felt that this is the right decision for the royal family” but added that it “must have been a very difficult thing” to act against his own sibling.\n \n\n   \n  The leader of the centrist Liberal Democrats said Andrew’s situation “had become totally untenable, having disgraced his office and embarrassed the country.”\n \n\n   \n  He added: “This is an important step towards rebuilding trust in our institutions and drawing a line under this whole sorry saga.”\n \n\n   \n  For several weeks, it has felt like some sort of announcement was coming down the pike and was simply a case of when, rather than if.\n \n\n   \n  Royal sources told CNN that the King was trying to act swiftly following recent developments but had needed some time to consult legal and constitutional experts.\n \n\n   \n  It is also understood that the King took action in light of his sibling’s serious lapses of judgment and has the support of the wider family, including Prince William.\n \n\n   \n  The statement, when it came, was uncompromising. “These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him,” it said.\n \n\n   \n  For many people in the country, and certainly critics of the royal family, these moves might not be enough to rehabilitate the monarchy’s tarnished reputation. For some, the removal of Andrew’s status as prince only goes so far. Other critics say the family has shielded Andrew over the years, and pressure for some sort of accountability needs to continue.\n \n\n   \n  “Losing silly titles is not an answer to very serious accusations of sexual offenses and corruption in public office,” Graham Smith, chief executive of the anti-monarchy campaign group Republic, said following the palace’s announcement.\n \n\n   \n  “This isn’t about William and Charles taking a tough line. It’s about William and Charles protecting their position by putting as much distance between them and Andrew as they can,” Smith added. “We need to see Andrew face justice, because we need to know that the royals are not above the law.”\n \n\n   \n  Despite being stripped of his prince title, Andrew remains eighth in line to the throne.

Aaron Blake, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:00 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  After the government had been shut down for nearly a month, a conspicuously quiet  President Donald Trump  finally weighed in with a prescription for how to end it.\n \n\n   \n  Republican congressional leaders are probably wishing he hadn’t.\n \n\n   \n  Trump late Thursday night urged Republicans to end the shutdown by  invoking the so-called “nuclear option”  — that is, getting rid of the filibuster and 60-vote threshold in the Senate. This would allow Republicans to pass things on party-line votes in the GOP-controlled Senate.\n \n\n   \n  “BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THE DEMOCRATS HAVE GONE STONE COLD ‘CRAZY,’ THE CHOICE IS CLEAR — INITIATE THE ‘NUCLEAR OPTION,’ GET RID OF THE FILIBUSTER AND, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  That Trump would call for this is not terribly surprising; he has spent years occasionally urging Republican leaders to scrap the filibuster. Nor is it particularly likely to provide an actual offramp in the shutdown; those same GOP leaders have steadfastly declined Trump’s entreaties before and rejected this idea repeatedly in recent weeks. It’s not even clear whether enough senators would vote for such a change if GOP leaders went along with it.\n \n\n   \n  So practically speaking, it’s a pointless interjection from the president.\n \n\n   \n  But it does matter in one way: It’s Trump yet again inserting himself into these kinds of talks in ways that are thoroughly unhelpful to his party. And this has become a trend.\n \n\n   \n  The reason it’s unhelpful in this case is that it legitimizes Democrats’ talking point that Republicans could end this shutdown any time they want to. And that could make it harder for Republicans to shake the blame they’ve been saddled with.\n \n\n   \n  It’s been pretty remarkable how much Americans have  continued to blame Republicans  more than Democrats for the shutdown, despite it being Democrats who are seeking the concession (i.e. an extension of the enhanced Obamacare subsidies). A  Washington Post-ABC News poll  released Thursday showed 45% of Americans mainly blamed Trump and the GOP, versus 33% who held Democrats responsible.\n \n\n   \n  To be clear, the idea that Republicans could end the shutdown anytime they want is a vastly oversimplified talking point. Yes, all they need is a majority of the Senate to nuke the filibuster. But there are myriad reasons to avoid invoking that nuclear option. And Republican leaders have pointed to them for weeks — specifically invoking what they fear Democrats could do without that 60-vote threshold if they regain control of the chamber.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Majority Leader John Thune earlier this month called the filibuster “a bulwark against a lot of really bad things happening to the country.” (His spokesperson on Friday said the leader’s position is “unchanged.”) Fellow Senate GOP leader John Barrasso of Wyoming argued that nixing the filibuster would ultimately allow Democrats to make Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia into states, with two senators apiece, and to pack the Supreme Court. House Speaker Mike Johnson has said it would mean there would be “no stumbling blocks or hurdles at all in the way of turning us into a communist country.”\n \n\n   \n  But Trump is now legitimizing blaming his own party for the shutdown because they won’t have done the thing he told them to do.\n \n\n   \n  And if you’re a Republican in Congress, you’ve probably got déjà vu about now. That’s because Trump does stuff like this a lot – especially during shutdown debates.\n \n\n   \n  In early 2018, Trump  contradicted his own spokeswoman’s statement  of support for a short-term continuing resolution, making a late demand to scrap an extension of the Children’s Health Insurance Program.\n \n\n   \n  Trump then pulled another  11th-hour shift a few weeks later , demanding immigration concessions that hadn’t previously been a focal point of leaders’ efforts.\n \n\n   \n  Before he was sworn in to his second term in January, Trump and Elon Musk combined in December to play the role of legislative arsonists again. GOP leaders had negotiated a bipartisan deal to avert a shutdown. But then Musk started waging war against it on X. Trump then joined him and  threw another wrench in the cogs , suddenly demanding a debt ceiling increase that hadn’t really been a part of discussions.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has regularly given congressional Republicans fits in these situations – so much so that they’ll occasionally acknowledge their frustrations publicly.\n \n\n   \n  Then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in early 2018  practically pleaded with Trump  to engage in the process and provide some direction. “As soon as we figure out what he is for, then I would be convinced that we were not just spinning our wheels,” the Kentucky Republican said at the time.\n \n\n   \n  After Trump threw a late grenade in the process in December, Sen. Kevin Cramer said he was “very frustrated.”\n \n\n   \n  When CNN’s Manu Raju asked the North Dakota Republican if he wished Trump had signaled his demands earlier, Cramer  responded dryly : “Yeah, I mean, maybe he hadn’t thought about it until just today. But yeah, that would have been very helpful.”\n \n\n   \n  None of this means Trump’s late entry into this shutdown debate is a game-changer. Perhaps GOP leaders will get through to Trump that this strategy isn’t particularly helpful – as they appear to have with other Republicans who occasionally suggested this route – and he’ll drop it.\n \n\n   \n  But his late-night social media demand has at the very least put Republicans in the uncomfortable position of explaining why they don’t attempt to do the thing that is technically in their power to end the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  And we’re already seeing Republicans try and massage this issue away.\n \n\n   \n  “What you’re seeing is an expression of the president’s anger at the situation,” Johnson said Friday.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps, but most presidents don’t lash out and kneecap their side’s negotiating power just because they get frustrated.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/trump-senate-filibuster-nuclear-option-government-shutdown","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"10:53:00.000Z","title":"Trump Calls for End of Senate Filibuster to Break Funding Stalemate","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has called on Republican lawmakers to eliminate the Senate filibuster as an emergency measure to end a weeklong government shutdown, arguing that doing so would immediately resolve the crisis and prevent Democrats from enacting the same change in future.

And it immediately ratcheted up the pressure on Republican leaders, who have adamantly opposed eliminating the  60-vote threshold for passing legislation  as a way to end the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Top GOP lawmakers have long argued for keeping that threshold in place, asserting that the filibuster benefits Republicans — and will serve as a key safeguard against Democrats passing transformative legislation the next time they’re in power.\n \n\n   \n  The filibuster rule is unique to the Senate, and it gives the minority the power to block a bill from coming up for a vote as long as at least 41 senators oppose it. Since one party rarely wins more than 60 seats, proponents have argued that the filibuster encourages compromise and makes it more difficult to enact massive partisan reforms.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Majority Leader John Thune earlier this month ruled out changing the Senate rules to end the shutdown, calling the filibuster “something that’s been a bulwark against a lot of really bad things happening with the country.” At the time, Thune said he’d gotten no pressure from the White House to end the filibuster.\n \n\n   \n  Thune spokesman Ryan Wrasse said in a statement to CNN Friday, “Leader Thune’s position on the importance of the legislative filibuster is unchanged.” The statement had some in his party breathing a sigh of relief.\n \n\n   \n  “Definitely gives us cover,” a GOP aide told CNN. “No one in the conference seriously wants to nuke the filibuster except maybe two.”\n \n\n   \n  Several GOP senators have echoed Thune’s sentiment in recent days in a sign that Trump could face a steep battle with his own party to push through the rules change. Killing the filibuster would take a majority vote in the Senate, meaning Republicans could only lose three lawmakers assuming all Democrats oppose the move.\n \n\n   \n  On Friday morning, Sen. John Curtis of Utah  posted on X  that he remained a “firm no” on eliminating the filibuster, writing that “the filibuster forces us to find common ground in the Senate. Power changes hands, but principles shouldn’t.”\n \n\n   \n  But Trump on Thursday appeared to dismiss those concerns, arguing that Republicans should take advantage of their Senate majority to end the filibuster and reopen the government. The president made a similar case during his first term, though Senate Republicans never acted on it at the time.\n \n\n   \n  “Now WE are in power, and if we did what we should be doing, it would IMMEDIATELY end this ridiculous, Country destroying ‘SHUT DOWN,’” he wrote. “If the Republicans are not using the Great Strength and Policies made available to us by ending the Filibuster, the Democrats will exercise their rights, and it will be done in the first day they take office, regardless of whether or not we do it.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s new push followed a week on Capitol Hill where lawmakers on both sides signaled potential signs of progress toward ending the impasse, even as they conceded that a deal remained well out of reach despite widening fallout across the country.\n \n\n   \n  The Senate is not slated to return to Washington until Monday evening, putting lawmakers just days away from breaking the 35-day mark for the  longest-ever government shutdown .\n \n\n   \n   Critical food aid  for tens of millions of Americans is slated to end over the weekend. The White House on Thursday also sought to highlight the stress that the shutdown is putting on air traffic controllers by convening a roundtable of airline industry representatives and union leaders.\n \n\n   \n   This story  has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/weather/noaa-hurricane-hunters-shutdown-unpaid-melissa","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"10:54:00-04:00","title":"NOAA Hurricane Hunters Fly Into Hurricane Melissa Without Pay Amid Government Shutdown","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During the federal government shutdown in October 2025, NOAA’s Hurricane Hunters flew into Hurricane Melissa — one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record, with 185 mph winds and a historic landfall in Jamaica — without pay, despite severe turbulence that caused one aircraft to return for safety inspection.

They have done it around the clock, 24/7, because their mission is considered essential to public safety.\n \n\n   \n  But this time, with the government shut down, they have done it all without pay.\n \n\n   \n  The Hurricane Hunters are a standard feature of US storm response. Information gathered by the planes’ specialized equipment, which includes a tail-mounted doppler radar that takes a virtual CT scan of the storm, are crucial for issuing accurate forecasts and gauging storm strength in real-time.\n \n\n   \n  The data, including the radar information, is fed straight into the computer models that forecasters use to predict a hurricane’s path and intensity.\n \n\n   \n  But as long-lived Hurricane Melissa rumbled on through the week, the people operating the flights have been under increasing financial stress.\n \n\n   \n  The crews of the agency’s decades-old WP-3D aircraft have now missed two paychecks due to the shutdown, according to a NOAA employee with knowledge of the hurricane hunter operations, who spoke with CNN on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.\n \n\n   \n  Crews are asked “To be fully mentally present, especially in this environment, and it’s hard to do that when you know you can’t potentially make ends meet,” the NOAA staff member said. “You’re dipping into savings to pay off your mortgage, you know, week to week or month to month.”\n \n\n   \n  The flights through the once Category 5 storm have been particularly hairy, with one of the NOAA aircraft having to return to its base for a safety inspection after exceeding its g-force limits from the turbulence.\n \n\n   \n  Videos during that flight show equipment falling from the ceiling of the plane, with roughly 20 crew members cursing and laughing as they are thrown against their safety harnesses.\n \n\n   \n  Following an inspection by ground crews, who are also working without pay, that same aircraft flew out later the same day on another mission into the storm, the NOAA staff member said.\n \n\n   \n  The NOAA crews have met all the requests that the National Hurricane Center has made of them ,  the employee said. The Center assigns them to specific flight routes and schedules where scientists think in-situ data would improve the forecasts as much as possible.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it’s just a notable thing that we have these crews going around the clock supporting the important mission that it is,” despite enduring increasing financial hardship, they said.\n \n\n   \n  They said the NOAA flights have been fully staffed with about 20 crew members per flight.\n \n\n   \n  The NOAA flights continued as the  storm plowed into Jamaica , doing immense damage to the island nation and killing at least 19 people.\n \n\n   \n  They have kept flying to support America’s international partners, with flights on Thursday aimed at making sure Bermuda residents get accurate warnings of the storm’s intensity and path.\n \n\n   \n  NOAA spokesperson Kim Doster acknowledged the crews’ hard work and their financial stress. “NOAA looks forward to a swift end to the crippling federal government shutdown which is forcing essential workers and service members like our brave Hurricane Hunter pilots to go unpaid as they perform their mission-critical duties that protect the lives of Americans every day,” she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The Air Force Reserve also flies into hurricanes and has flown numerous missions into Melissa, but those planes are not bristling with the same specialized equipment that the older NOAA aircraft are. They fly a more straightforward reconnaissance mission, keeping tabs of the storm’s intensity and movement, whereas the NOAA flights are aimed more at hurricane research and enabling forecasting improvements.\n \n\n   \n  Remarkably, one of the Air Force flights also had to turn around after getting beaten up by severe turbulence flying through Melissa. CNN reached out to the Air Force’s Hurricane Hunter squadron to inquire about their pay status but has not heard back.\n \n\n   \n  It’s unusual for two flights to have to turn back within the same storm and indicates the hurricane’s power during its approach to southwestern Jamaica. Melissa crossed the Jamaican coast tied for the strongest-ever landfalling Atlantic hurricane, with maximum sustained winds of 185 mph.\n \n\n   \n  Andy Hazelton, a hurricane researcher who works with NOAA’s hurricane research division at the University of Miami, told CNN earlier this week that the NOAA flight that had to turn around due to turbulence was the roughest ride in a hurricane that he has had since he began such work seven years ago.\n \n\n   \n  “You hit a big enough updraft and downdraft you have to make sure the plane is ok,” Hazelton, who is being paid during the shutdown via the university, said. “These crews are doing this all while not getting paid, so they deserve all the credit.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/uk/andrew-mountbatten-windsor-what-next-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"12:26:00-04:00","title":"Prince No Longer: What Next for Andrew Mountbatten Windsor?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Prince Andrew, formerly known as Prince Andrew, Duke of York, has been stripped of all royal titles and honors by King Charles III in a move tied to his alleged connections with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and sexual misconduct allegations.

October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A fortnight ago, he was  Prince Andrew , Duke of York, Earl of Inverness and Baron Killyleagh, Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order, Royal Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter.\n \n\n   \n  Now, he is simply Andrew Mountbatten Windsor.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday night, Buckingham Palace announced that  King Charles III  had started a process to strip his brother of his titles and honors and evict him from the royal estate at Windsor, capping Andrew’s fall from grace over his ties to the convicted sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein. By the next morning, Andrew’s name had already been removed from the official role of the peerage – a crucial step in the formal scrapping of his titles.\n \n\n   \n  While the royal family hopes this move can draw a line under this years-long scandal,  questions  are swirling about where Andrew, 65, will live, whether he could yet face more legal troubles and whether his banishment will appease the British public. Here, we answer some of those.\n \n\n   \n    Where will Andrew sleep tonight?\n \n\n   \n  Most likely in  Royal Lodge , the grand 30-room mansion in Windsor Great Park, west of London, which has been Andrew’s home since 2003. The late Queen Elizabeth II granted Andrew, the third of her four children, the right to live in the lodge, and his 75-year lease was due to expire in 2078.\n \n\n   \n  But in its Thursday night statement, Buckingham Palace said Andrew had been served formal notice to surrender his lease and that he would “move to alternative private accommodation.” It is understood that he will move as soon as is practicable.\n \n\n   \n    Where will he live in the future?\n \n\n   \n  Royal sources have told CNN that Andrew will be given a house on the King’s private estate in Sandringham, Norfolk. That vast estate on England’s eastern coast is home to some 150 properties.\n \n\n   \n  It is also where the royal family spends Christmas. Before the Thursday night announcement, Andrew had already been told he would not be welcome at the country retreat over the holidays, a royal source had said.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew might not move to Sandringham until after the Christmas holidays, another source said, because giving notice, surrendering the lease and orchestrating the move is expected to take some time.\n \n\n   \n    Will he receive an income?\n \n\n   \n  Yes, but we don’t know how much. After he stepped back from public duties following his disastrous 2019 interview with BBC Newsnight, Andrew was thought to receive an annual allowance of about £1 million ($1.3 million) from the late Queen, according to British media reports.\n \n\n   \n  Those payments initially continued under Charles, the reports said, but it is understood that the King had stopped providing the allowance.\n \n\n   \n  Despite now being stripped of his prince title, CNN understands that Andrew will still receive an income from Charles.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew’s finances have always been something of a mystery. His only source of income that has been declared is the pension he receives from his time in the navy between 1979 and 2001, said to amount to £20,000 ($26,000) a year.\n \n\n   \n    Is he still in the line of succession?\n \n\n   \n  Andrew may have lost his titles, status and honors but he is still eighth in line to the British throne.\n \n\n   \n  There is a process to formally remove him from the line of succession by legislation, but it would take time as it requires the consent of Commonwealth nations around the world.\n \n\n   \n  The last time this protocol was invoked was in 1936 with the abdication of Edward VIII.\n \n\n   \n    What will happen to his family?\n \n\n   \n  Andrew and Sarah Ferguson divorced in 1996 but have lived together at Royal Lodge in Windsor since 2008. His ex-wife reverted to her maiden name earlier this month when Andrew relinquished the use of his royal titles, including Duke of York. She is also moving out of Royal Lodge and make her own living arrangements. It is understood that she will not be joining Andrew when he moves to Sandringham.\n \n\n   \n  Their daughters, Princess Beatrice, 37, and Princess Eugenie, 35, are non-working royals and will retain their titles as daughters of the son of a sovereign, in line with a directive issued by King George V in 1917.\n \n\n   \n  Beatrice lives with her husband in the Cotswolds, about 100 miles from London, but has an apartment at St. James’s Palace in the capital. Eugenie and her husband have a cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace but spend a lot of time abroad. Their living situations will not be affected by their father’s exile.\n \n\n   \n    Could he be hauled in front of parliament?\n \n\n   \n  The Liberal Democrats, an opposition party, have lately called for Andrew to give evidence to a parliamentary committee about his finances and potential rent paid to live in Royal Lodge.\n \n\n   \n  So far, the government of Prime Minister Keir Starmer has refused to give members of parliament time to debate Andrew’s finances, despite public outcry for proper scrutiny.\n \n\n   \n  This week, Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, a Conservative lawmaker and chair of the Public Accounts Committee, wrote to the Crown Estate Commissioners seeking more information on Andrew’s lease arrangements for Royal Lodge.\n \n\n   \n  That committee is responsible for “upholding best value for taxpayers’ money,” Clifton-Brown wrote, and as such “we feel it is reasonable to seek further information on the status of, and rationale for, the lease of Royal Lodge.”\n \n\n   \n    Might he face further legal challenges?\n \n\n   \n  Potentially. Republic, an activist group seeking to abolish the monarchy, says it is pursuing a private prosecution of Andrew “because if the government and police won’t hold him to account, we will.”\n \n\n   \n  The group says it has instructed lawyers to investigate and, if appropriate, begin a private prosecution over allegations of sexual offenses and misconduct in public office.\n \n\n   \n   Virginia Giuffre , a prominent accuser of Epstein and his circle, alleged that Andrew had sex with her three times when she was a teenager. In her recent memoir, published posthumously, Giuffre wrote that Andrew “believed that having sex with me was his birthright.”\n \n\n   \n  Despite claiming never to have met her, Andrew reportedly paid millions of dollars to Giuffre in 2022 to settle a civil case she brought against him. He has repeatedly denied all allegations against him.\n \n\n   \n  Giuffre died by suicide in April. On Thursday, Sky and Amanda Roberts, Giuffre’s brother and sister-in-law, told CNN that Giuffre would have been “joyous” to know that Andrew had been stripped of the title that helped shield him from accountability.\n \n\n   \n  “I think she would be proud, and I think she would turn to her children and say, ‘I did it. I got the bad guy,’” said Amanda Roberts.\n \n\n   \n    Will this be enough for the British public?\n \n\n   \n  It’s hard to say. Andrew is deeply unpopular with the British public. In a poll published Thursday by YouGov, 91% of Britons had a negative opinion of Andrew. Just 4% had a positive one. By contrast, Britons generally like Prince William (76%) and Charles (62%), and overall have a positive view of the monarchy as an institution (56%).\n \n\n   \n  If Andrew’s fall from grace began in earnest after his 2019 BBC Newsnight interview, the royal family have repeatedly tried to draw a line under the scandal – first by Andrew’s withdrawing from public life, then by removing his military titles and patronages, later cutting him off financially, then by his relinquishing some of his titles – and now by the King casting him out of the palace for good as a pariah.\n \n\n   \n  None of the measures have quelled the public outcry. It remains to be seen whether this time will be different.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps the Andrew scandal has roiled on for so long because, for the public, his “punishments” do not seem proportionate to the allegations that he faces. While the loss of his titles and favored residence may be a personal tragedy for Andrew, it elicits little sympathy from a public demanding proper accountability.\n \n\n   \n  “It doesn’t matter if he’s Prince Andrew or Andrew Mountbatten Windsor – we’re still pursuing a private prosecution of him,” said Republic, the activist group.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/europe/prince-andrew-title-and-honors-remove-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"12:27:00.000-04:00","title":"King Charles Strips Prince Andrew of Titles and Evicts Him from Royal Mansion Amid Epstein Scandal","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"King Charles has taken decisive action to strip Prince Andrew of his royal titles—including Duke of York, Earl of Inverness, and Baron Killyleagh—by issuing royal warrants, and has evicted him from Royal Lodge in Windsor.

Charles strips his brother Andrew of ‘prince’ title and evicts him from royal mansion \n       \n  By Lauren Said-Moorhouse, Max Foster, Lauren Kent, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:27 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Britain’s King Charles took  the extraordinary step  of starting the process to strip his brother Andrew of his royal titles and evict him from the royal estate in Windsor, in the most dramatic attempt yet to quell the scandal over the disgraced prince’s links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  The move, described in stark terms by Buckingham Palace as “necessary censures,” cements the deepest split in the British royal family in decades. The question now: whether King Charles and the British establishment have done enough to prevent Andrew’s association with  Epstein  from engulfing the monarchy.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew, 65, had faced 15 years of on-and-off controversy over his friendship with Epstein that had reached a new intensity after the release of a posthumous memoir by Virginia Giuffre, who alleged that Andrew had sexually assaulted her as a teenager.\n \n\n   \n  Giuffre – who the prince claims never to have met – died by suicide in April at the age of 41. Andrew has repeatedly denied all allegations against him.\n \n\n   \n  Giuffre’s family said in a statement on Thursday: “Today, an ordinary American girl, from an ordinary American family, brought down a British prince with her truth and extraordinary courage.”\n \n\n   \n  Sky Roberts, Giuffre’s brother, told CNN that it had been a “joyous and happy and sad day.”\n \n\n   \n  In the statement, Buckingham Palace noted that Andrew would be forced out of his residence and take the family name. “Prince Andrew will now be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor. His  lease on Royal Lodge  has, to date, provided him with legal protection to continue in residence. Formal notice has now been served to surrender the lease and he will move to alternative private accommodation,” the statement continued.\n \n\n   \n  “These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him.”\n \n\n   \n  Andrew will move to a property on the Sandringham estate, about 100 miles north of London, which is privately owned by the British monarch. Royal Lodge sits within Windsor Great Park, part of the Crown Estate, which manages the royal family’s land and property holdings on behalf of the British state. Andrew’s new accommodation will be privately funded by King Charles.\n \n\n   \n  It’s understood the palace acted because while it acknowledges that Andrew continues to deny all allegations made against him, it had concluded that he made serious lapses of judgement.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew is not expected to move to Sandringham until after the Christmas holidays, according to a royal source.\n \n\n   \n  Moving in the new year might also avoid potential awkwardness over the holidays as Sandringham is traditionally where the royal family gathers for the festive season. It was previously announced that Andrew would be excluded from Christmas celebrations.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew had sought to end the renewed scrutiny of his conduct by relinquishing  use of his titles  earlier this month. But his moves did little to stem the flow of negative headlines and sparked fresh questions about how he was able to pay Giuffre a reportedly multimillion-dollar settlement in a civil case in 2022 and fund his lifestyle despite having not been a working royal since 2019.\n \n\n   \n  Public anger has also grown after it emerged last week that he paid $1 million for Royal Lodge, in the heart of Windsor Great Park near Windsor Castle, in 2003, and only a peppercorn rent “if demanded” each year since then, according to his lease agreement.\n \n\n   \n  Despite Thursday’s announcement, Andrew remains eighth in line to the British throne. That status  could be removed  by legislation, but it would require the consent of Commonwealth nations around the world, which would take time. The last time this protocol was used was when Edward VIII abdicated in 1936.\n \n\n   \n  CNN understands that rather than formally remove Andrew’s title as Duke of York via an act of parliament, King Charles will send royal warrants to remove Andrew’s peerages.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew was also known as the Earl of Inverness and Baron Killyleagh, a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order and as a Royal Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter. The stripping of his titles takes immediate effect.\n \n\n   \n  “Their Majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse,” Buckingham Palace added in the statement.\n \n\n   \n  In his interview with CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, Sky Roberts said King Charles’ decision vindicated the years of campaigning by his sister. “She should be here. She should be having this interview with you,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “She had been fighting for this for a long time. She always said… only one of us is telling the truth and I know that’s me,” Roberts said. “We’re really proud of her. We’re so proud of what she was able to achieve.”\n \n\n   \n  Calling it a “huge moment” for his sister and other survivors, Roberts said: “It’s an acknowledgement to say, we believe you. We see you. And for me, I love you. We love you… This is a very vindicating moment for us. And I just wish she was here to to share this with us.”\n \n\n   \n  Giuffre’s family said in their statement they would fight to ensure other associates of Epstein would face similar judgement. “Our sister, a child when she was sexually assaulted by Andrew, never stopped fighting for accountability for what had happened to her and to countless other survivors like her. Today, she declares victory,” the statement said, adding they will “not rest until the same accountability applies to all of the abusers and abettors connected to Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.”\n \n\n   \n    Calls for Andrew to face justice continue\n \n\n   \n  The anti-monarchy group Republic said Thursday that it had instructed lawyers to launch a private prosecution against Andrew “over accusations of sexual offenses and misconduct in public office.”\n \n\n   \n  The group said its lawyers would be actively investigating the case against Andrew and aim to begin proceedings in the coming weeks. Republic has previously called for the police to investigate Andrew.\n \n\n   \n  “Let’s be very clear, Prince Andrew – now Andrew Mountbatton Windsor – is not facing justice. He’s not being held to account. Losing silly titles is not an answer to very serious accusations of sexual offenses and corruption in public office,” Graham Smith, chief executive of Republic, said Thursday following the palace’s announcement.\n \n\n   \n  “This isn’t about William and Charles taking a tough line. It’s about William and Charles protecting their position by putting as much distance between them and Andrew as they can,” Smith added. “We need to see Andrew face justice, because we need to know that the royals are not above the law.”\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, the British monarch was  heckled by a protester  who could be heard shouting “How long have you known about Andrew and Epstein?” as he carried out a cathedral visit in northwest England.\n \n\n   \n    Andrew’s daughters to retain princess titles\n \n\n   \n  Andrew’s daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, will retain their titles as they are the daughters of the son of a sovereign – in line with rules set out by King George V in 1917.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew’s ex-wife Sarah Ferguson, who has lived with him for the past 20 years at Royal Lodge, will also move out and is understood to be making her own arrangements.\n \n\n   \n  Ferguson, 66, is the mother of Andrew’s two children. They wed in 1986 and divorced a decade later. She previously held the title of Duchess of York, but reverted to her maiden name when Andrew relinquished his titles earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  CNN also understands that the British government was consulted on the King’s decisions, and the government has made it clear that it supports the moves.\n \n\n   \n  The last time a prince had his title removed is understood to be more than 100 years ago, when Prince Charles Edward – one of Queen Victoria’s grandsons – had the title of Duke of Albany stripped from him by the British parliament under the Titles Deprivation Act 1917. The action was taken after he fought in World War I for Germany, where he was Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s MiSeon Lee contributed to this report.

tennis star and ‘generational talent’ João Fonseca tempering power with patience as he ascends the sport \n       \n  By George Ramsay, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:34 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Ever since he first picked up a  tennis  racket,  João Fonseca  has shown a penchant for power – even if it came with mixed results.\n \n\n   \n  “I was the kind of kid that destroyed the ball,” says Fonseca. “Sometimes, it would go into the fence; sometimes, it would go straight to the floor; and then, sometimes, we’re doing a winner.”\n \n\n   \n  That approach – fearless, furious and unrestrained – has stayed with the Brazilian into his professional career, and today, his ripping forehand is one of the most breathtaking sights in men’s tennis.\n \n\n   \n  Few players can match the 19-year-old Fonseca when it comes to  raw power , particularly on the forehand wing. This not-so-subtle, not-so-secret weapon has guided him to two ATP Tour titles this year, including in the Swiss city of Basel last week.\n \n\n   \n  There, Fonseca thumped 29 winners to see off Spain’s Alejandro Davidovich Fokina in the final, while his average forehand speed was clocked at 81 miles per hour. For comparison, top players  usually average  around 75.\n \n\n   \n  “I think my coach was really the first one that said: ‘Keep with this aggression,’” Fonseca tells  CNN Sports  about his all-out approach. “‘Keep doing this, but at the same time, let’s work with being more solid.’\n \n\n   \n  “During these last years, I understood that you can’t hit the ball hard every time … Sometimes, it’s a stupid idea, of course, but sometimes, it’s good to be aggressive, to be courageous and have confidence in your shots.”\n \n\n   \n  Lifting the title in Basel saw Fonseca become the third-youngest ATP 500 winner since the format was introduced in 2009, as well as the tournament’s youngest winner since Jim Courier in 1989.\n \n\n   \n  Still a teenager, Fonseca’s potential is huge, his freakish power likely to become more of a threat as he develops and refines his game. To some, he is destined to join  Carlos Alcaraz  and  Jannik Sinner  – by far and away the standout players in men’s tennis this year – at the very top of the game.\n \n\n   \n  “The Brazilian Blaster (Fonseca) is a generational talent as I said 2 years ago and will be right there someday with the Italian Flamethrower (Sinner) and Spanish Magician (Alcaraz),” Rick Macci, the former coach to Serena Williams,  wrote  on X recently.\n \n\n   \n  Those players, Macci added, will “create a new big three” to replace Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic.\n \n\n   \n  Davidovich Fokina spoke along the same lines during his runner-up speech in Basel, telling Fonseca that he is “for sure going to be the next Nole (Djokovic) to beat Carlos and Jannik.”\n \n\n   \n  After winning last year’s Next Gen ATP Finals title – a tournament featuring the world’s best players under 20 – Fonseca turned heads at the Australian Open in January with a straight-sets victory over ninth seed Andrey Rublev.\n \n\n   \n  He followed that up by winning the Argentina Open a month later, becoming the second-youngest South American to win an ATP title in the Open Era.\n \n\n   \n  But Fonseca’s progress hasn’t been exponential. He failed to progress past the third round of a grand slam this year, perhaps a surprise after the enormous promise he showed at the start of the season.\n \n\n   \n  The victory in Basel, however, reaffirmed his status as one of the most explosive talents in the game, with Fonseca climbing 18 spots up the rankings to No. 28. That puts him well on track to fulfill his self-ascribed objectives for next year.\n \n\n   \n  “I think one of my goals is to be a seed, top 32 (at a grand slam),” says Fonseca. “It’s my personal goal. I’m working a lot to do it … let’s see how it goes.”\n \n\n   \n  To get to this level, Fonseca had to spend his formative years building a bond with tennis. As a young player, the game would make him feel restless, and he often found himself chasing big, haymaking shots on the court. He was even more impatient off it, unable to watch a full match without losing interest.\n \n\n   \n  That changed around 2019, when Fonseca sat absorbed as Novak Djokovic defeated Roger Federer in a  Wimbledon  final lasting four hours and 57 minutes – the longest final in the tournament’s history.\n \n\n   \n  A self-proclaimed Federer superfan, that match hurt Fonseca. As he started to enjoy tennis as a spectator, he would often watch the “Big 3” play out match after memorable match on the sport’s biggest stages, but it was the Swiss star who captivated him the most.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s my idol,” Fonseca confesses. Which goes some way to explaining why he suddenly found himself a sweaty, nervous wreck before meeting Federer for the first time in September.\n \n\n   \n  “We had a nice chat, about 10 minutes, and we talked a little bit about life, tour, how it is to live in Brazil and be far from home,” says Fonseca, adding: “He’s a super nice guy. You see these amazing players, these legends, as untouchable (and think): this guy is different. But no, he’s just a human being like us, super cool.\n \n\n   \n  “It was a very important moment; it’s going to be in my mind for my whole life.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s likely that the two might cross paths again, particularly given that Fonseca is sponsored by On – the sportswear company in which Federer has invested and helped with product development. The Brazilian was only 16 when he was signed by On and earmarked as a star in the making, joining a roster that includes six-time grand slam winner  Iga Świątek  and world No. 7  Ben Shelton .\n \n\n   \n  Several years earlier, Fonseca had made the decision to focus his sporting endeavors solely on tennis, not long after a  soccer  injury had left him sidelined for months.\n \n\n   \n  Like most kids growing up in Rio de Janeiro, soccer was, and still is, one of his great loves, even though his playing days have long since passed.\n \n\n   \n  “I was a good level,” says Fonseca. “I’m a lefty leg, I had some skills, but nothing serious. I wouldn’t be professional or whatever. Fortunately, I stayed with tennis.”\n \n\n   \n  After reaching the quarterfinals of last year’s Rio Open aged 17, Fonseca decided to forego his college eligibility – he was holding a place at the University of Virginia – and turn professional.\n \n\n   \n  Since then, his march up the world rankings has been steady, quickly earning him an army of dedicated fans. Fonseca’s matches are some of the loudest on tour, and regardless of whether he’s playing in Brazil or further afield, yellow-and-green-clad spectators are guaranteed whenever he’s on a tennis court.\n \n\n   \n  It’s taken time, Fonseca admits, to grow accustomed to playing in front of such raucous crowds.\n \n\n   \n  “At the beginning, I was super nervous,” he says. “I needed to win, and there are people watching me, there are people cheering for me. The culture of Brazil is super loud, a lot of people supporting, I’ll say a little bit because of football.\n \n\n   \n  “I got used a lot to the crowd. Nowadays, I love playing with the crowd. I love them supporting me. I love that sometimes I’m in a bad situation in the match and they’re still supporting me, still cheering and motivating me.\n \n\n   \n  “I was more like a shy guy,” he adds, “and now I’m loving it.”\n \n\n   \n  Playing in loud matches at big tournaments is likely to be a mainstay of Fonseca’s career. He is slowly accumulating more experience against the world’s best players but hasn’t yet faced Djokovic – he’s hopeful of doing so before the Serb, now 38, retires – nor has he played either Alcaraz or Sinner.\n \n\n   \n  Those kinds of matches might become a regular occurrence should Fonseca, armed with that ferocious forehand, continue his march up the rankings. For now, he is watching closely as two players just a few years his senior rule over men’s tennis, sharing the past eight grand slams equally between them.\n \n\n   \n  One day, Fonseca might be in a position to challenge their duopoly.\n \n\n   \n  “What they’re doing is amazing,” he says of Alcaraz and Sinner. “They’re winning every tournament that they play.\n \n\n   \n  “They motivate all the other players to put more work in day by day, and try to be with them, try to win more tournaments, try to win matches, be more consistent. Hopefully, in the future, I will be with them, playing and competing in finals. But one step at a time, and let’s put in the work.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/travel/the-worlds-best-hotels-for-2025-revealed","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"11:46:00-04:00","title":"The world’s best hotel for 2025 is a waterfront skyscraper","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Rosewood Hong Kong, a 65-storey luxury waterfront hotel in Kowloon, Hong Kong, has been named the world’s best hotel for 2025 in the annual World’s 50 Best Hotels list, beating out Capella Bangkok and other top contenders.

October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The air is turning blue over the Capitol Dome. And the government is more shut than ever.\n \n\n   \n  Washington woke Thursday to a whiff of rare hope that  behind-the-scenes efforts  were accelerating in the Senate to end a federal shutdown now imposing severe pain on millions of Americans.\n \n\n   \n  But the day ended with senators skipping town for the weekend — to join members of the House not seen inside the Beltway for so long it’s hard to remember what they look like.\n \n\n   \n  Trump made his first intervention in the shutdown drama since returning from a trip to Asia,  calling on Senate Republicans to end the filibuster  — the device that requires 60 votes to pass most major legislation and currently represents the only brake on his power that Democrats have in Washington.\n \n\n   \n  “It is now time for the Republicans to play their ‘TRUMP CARD,’ and go for what is called the Nuclear Option,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  Such a move would allow Republicans to open the government while bypassing Democratic demands. But it would open the possibility that Democrats could pass into law sweeping progressive reforms and roll back swaths of the conservative agenda if they control both chambers of Congress at some point in the future. Trump may not care what happens when he’s no longer president, but eliminating the filibuster would represent a fundamental political shift.\n \n\n   \n  This new wrinkle in Trump’s strategy will no doubt pile more pressure on Senate Majority Leader John Thune. And while Trump can shift his position from one moment to the next, his new gambit may indicate he’s more interested in crushing Democrats than seeking a way out of the increasingly damaging shutdown. Republican leaders in both parties have stated they don’t support ending the filibuster because of the implications for any future Democratic majority.\n \n\n   \n  What’s so galling in the current shutdown   is that both Republicans and Democrats insist they are keeping faith with their duties — taking care of the American people — but that the other side is willing to drive ordinary citizens to the brink of hunger or sickness.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Democrats triggered the shutdown, refusing to extend federal funding until Republicans agree to extend expiring  enhanced Obamacare subsidies , without which millions of citizens will see  the cost of health care rocket .\n \n\n   \n  Republicans are willing to talk — but only when the government is opened again. Their assurances aren’t being taken at face value since their president routinely ignores the terms of deals and Congress’ constitutionally sound decisions on how to spend taxpayer money.\n \n\n   \n  The result:  Vital SNAP benefits  that help feed more than 40 million people are within hours of running out. Federal workers deemed essential have slogged through demoralizing weeks without pay. And it’s no vacation for their furloughed colleagues either: Financial obligations aren’t shut down just because the government is.\n \n\n   \n  Little is evident on the horizon that could prevent the monthlong shutdown from becoming the longest on record next week.\n \n\n   \n  In the absence of meaningful progress, dismayed lawmakers spent the day venting and trading insults.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats accused Republicans of starving kids. Vice President JD Vance accused Democrats of putting extreme pressure  on air traffic controllers , implying they were risking the nation’s “extra safe” skies.\n \n\n   \n  Wyoming Republican Sen. Cynthia Lummis said that staying in town for another weekend waiting for Democrats to come to the table “is gonna be a waste of time.” Sen. Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat, told CNN’s Dana Bash he was shocked “at the level of cruelty” shown by his GOP colleagues.\n \n\n   \n  And renegade Pennsylvania Democratic Sen. John Fetterman has had it up to here with everyone. “It’s an absolute failure what occurred here for the last month,”  Fetterman told CNN . He also complained about his own party’s tactics. “We can’t even get our sh*t together and just open up our government,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    One judge says she won’t let people die\n \n\n   \n  Democrats might have some justification in arguing that Republicans and their health care policies and endless attempts to kill Obamacare set the stage for this crisis. But Republicans can also point to the great contradiction of the Democratic strategy: The shutdown has now become a test of which bloc of unfortunate Americans are hurting the most — those who risk losing health care or those who don’t have enough to eat.\n \n\n   \n  Shutdowns typically end when one party can’t bear the political price of the government staying closed. In many ways, these showdowns are Washington games that can define the course of presidencies and Congresses.\n \n\n   \n  But the fact that it’s now been a month and neither side is willing to blink is also a symptom of a broken political system and a Congress that can no longer do its basic constitutional task of funding the government. And any victory for either party at this point will be hollow, since it will be built on the suffering of citizens.\n \n\n   \n  One federal judge in Boston is doing what the judiciary often seems to do these days: stepping in where Congress has failed.  US District Judge Indira Talwani  signaled she will intervene in the dispute over the Trump administration’s refusal to use billions of dollars in emergency funds to fund food stamps under SNAP.\n \n\n   \n  “Right now, Congress has put money in an emergency fund for an emergency, and it’s hard for me to understand how this isn’t an emergency when there’s no money and a lot of people are needing their SNAP benefits,” Talwani said in the kind of plain English that lawmakers seem to shed when they get to Washington.\n \n\n   \n  “The idea that we’re going to do the absolutely most drastic thing, which is that there’s not just less money but no money, seems the farthest thing from” what Congress intended, Talwani said. “We’re not going to make everyone drop dead” from hunger.\n \n\n   \n    Is there any hope for a breakthrough?\n \n\n   \n  Sometimes in Washington, the darkest hour is the one before dawn. So maybe there’s a chance the vicious rhetoric is a smokescreen allowing everyone to vent before they compromise.\n \n\n   \n  But there’s another characteristic of modern Washington that may be more apt right now — the way that disaster always has to nearly strike before two parties mired in their ideological extremes find a sliver of common ground.\n \n\n   \n  But at some point, this shutdown will end. It has to.\n \n\n   \n  If the denouement does not come from a president who discovers a moral or political imperative to live up to his 2016 convention vow, “I alone can fix it,” it may emerge from a creative fudge in the Senate in which Republicans give a handful of Democratic senators political cover to vote to break the filibuster and reopen the government.\n \n\n   \n  Thune — who ditched his suave self-control on Wednesday to  rage at Democrats  in a Senate rant — struck one hopeful note when he said there was an uptick in bipartisan conversations this week. “We got members on both sides who are continuing to dialogue,” he told reporters.\n \n\n   \n  But Thune doesn’t yet have the political space to offer Democrats the kind of tangible deliverables they would need. “When they’re willing to produce the votes to open up the government, we’re going to talk,” he said, restating the sticking point.\n \n\n   \n  One possible endgame scenario is that the Senate could blur the sequencing of when the government reopens and talks get serious on Obamacare subsidies. But knowing how something might eventually end is easier than getting there.\n \n\n   \n  Therefore, in the absence of progress, everyone had to fill the space.\n \n\n   \n  “We are now beginning Day 30 of the Democrat shutdown,” said House Speaker Mike Johnson, of Louisiana. “There are millions of Americans … that are bracing themselves for further pain and hardship.”\n \n\n   \n  House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York accused the administration of enacting “policy violence” by refusing to extend Obamacare subsidies while offering a  $20 billion bailout  to Trump’s MAGA pal President Javier Milei in Argentina.\n \n\n   \n  Republican Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming said he wasn’t worried about his own air travel as air traffic control snarls, but did “worry about the flights of thousands and thousands of people.” Mixing transportation metaphors, he accused Democrats of being “way off the rails.”\n \n\n   \n  And Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York followed his warning on Wednesday that Trump “is a vindictive politician and a heartless politician and a heartless man” by accusing Republicans of bringing down “the specter of financial disaster” on Americans — including in red states — over health care.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not exactly promising.\n \n\n   \n  But Thune told reporters, “I’m always optimistic. Aren’t you?”\n \n\n   \n  That’s a tough one, senator.\n \n\n   \n   This article has been updated with new reporting as well as to correct Sen. Cynthia Lummis’ state, Wyoming. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/health/blood-pressure-medicine-recall-cancer","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"10:04:00-04:00","title":"FDA Recalls Prazosin Blood Pressure Medicine Over Cancer-Causing Chemical Concerns","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has ordered a nationwide recall of over 580,000 bottles of prazosin hydrochloride, a blood pressure and PTSD-related medication, due to the potential presence of carcinogenic N-nitrosamine impurities.

It caught even some advisers by surprise. \n       \n  By Kevin Liptak, Kylie Atwood, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:12 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  When Chinese leader Xi Jinping inserted a reference to “twists and turns” in his relationship with  President Donald Trump  in the opening remarks of their summit this week, he could hardly have imagined the twist that came minutes before the talks began.\n \n\n   \n  Writing from Marine One, which was gliding toward the airport in South Korea where he was due to meet Xi, Trump  instructed the Pentagon  to resume nuclear testing after a 33-year pause, citing other nations’ — including China’s — own capabilities.\n \n\n   \n  “That process will begin immediately,” the president wrote on social media.\n \n\n   \n  The directive took even many of Trump’s advisers off guard, according to officials, leading to unanswered questions about when, or if, the testing would actually begin. Historically, it is the Department of Energy that maintains and tests the US nuclear stockpile, not the Department of Defense. And engineers have said accurate tests can be conducted through computer simulation, not blowing up an actual warhead underwater or in the Nevada desert.\n \n\n   \n  Hours after the president’s post, it did not appear as if the Pentagon was moving swiftly to test a nuclear weapon. Testifying on Capitol Hill, the senior military officer nominated to oversee the American nuclear arsenal said Thursday morning he was not “reading anything” into Trump’s Truth Social post — an indication, if one was needed, that the instructions hadn’t been previewed very widely ahead of time.\n \n\n   \n  The surprise message only underscored the volatile approach Trump is taking to foreign affairs nine months into his second administration. Even as he was about to sit down for a meeting intended to lend stability to the world’s most important bilateral relationship, Trump demonstrated his willingness to suddenly veer in an unexpected direction.\n \n\n   \n  Administration officials offered little clarity when questioned about the message on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the president’s Truth speaks for itself,” Vice President JD Vance said as he took questions from reporters at the White House. “We have a big arsenal. Obviously, the Russians have a large nuclear arsenal. The Chinese have a large nuclear arsenal. Sometimes you’ve got to test it to make sure that it’s functioning and working properly.”\n \n\n   \n  “To be clear, we know that it does work properly,” he added later, “but you got to keep on top of it over time, and the president just wants to make sure that we do that.”\n \n\n   \n  When asked by reporters in Malaysia on Friday about Trump’s post, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the Pentagon would move quickly and work with the Department of Energy. He argued that “resuming testing is a pretty responsible” way to keep a “credible nuclear deterrent.”\n \n\n   \n  Dating back to his first term, Trump has always maintained a somewhat complicated relationship to the nuclear weapons he can launch from a secure suitcase anywhere he goes.\n \n\n   \n  A product of the nuclear era, he recently voiced wariness at even mentioning the word itself: “We can’t let people throw around that word,” the president told generals last month. “I call it the n-word. There are two n-words, and you can’t use either of them.”\n \n\n   \n  He seemed less cautious in his  Truth Social message  this week.\n \n\n   \n  “The United States has more Nuclear Weapons than any other country,” he wrote. “This was accomplished, including a complete update and renovation of existing weapons, during my First Term in office. Because of the tremendous destructive power, I HATED to do it, but had no choice!”\n \n\n   \n  Afterwards, Trump was circumspect about what tests, precisely, he was asking for.\n \n\n   \n  “With others doing testing, I think it’s appropriate that we do also,” Trump said aboard Air Force One as he was returning to Washington.\n \n\n   \n  He said nuclear test sites would be determined later, and specified his message did not relate to China — even though he named the country specifically in his message. “It had to do with others,” he said vaguely.\n \n\n   \n  Some officials said Trump may have been prompted by Moscow’s test flights in recent days of nuclear-capable cruise missiles and torpedoes, though their existence was already known and the tests did not involve a nuclear detonation. There is also no US equivalent to those Russian systems that could be tested to demonstrate equivalence, because the US decided decades ago that developing those systems was unproductive, said a former Trump administration official who worked on nuclear issues.\n \n\n   \n  Neither China nor Russia have conducted a nuclear test in decades. While China has worked rapidly to expand its arsenal, it is not known to have conducted an explosive test since 1996.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing’s speedy buildup in nuclear weapons has nonetheless generated concern among administration officials, who regard the issue as yet another point of friction in an increasingly tense relationship. Xi presided over a flashy parade of China’s nuclear-capable missiles last month.\n \n\n   \n  “Russia has nearly completed their modernization of all of their nuclear forces, and China is modernizing, and they are growing their arsenal at a breathtaking speed,” Elbridge Colby, the US undersecretary of defense for policy, said during his confirmation hearing this year.\n \n\n   \n  Still, if Trump was ordering up the first test of a US nuclear explosive since 1992, it came as news to the military officer he nominated to oversee the nation’s vast arsenal of nuclear weapons.\n \n\n   \n  “I wouldn’t presume that the president’s words meant nuclear testing,” Vice Adm. Richard Correll, whom Trump tapped to head up US Strategic Command, said before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “I believe the quote was, ‘start testing our nuclear weapons on an equal basis,’” Correll went on. “Neither China or Russia has conducted a nuclear explosive test, so I’m not reading anything into it or reading anything out to it.”\n \n\n   \n  If confirmed to the position, Correll would be responsible for the more than 41,000 service members who look after components of the US nuclear weapons program, including submarines, ballistic missiles and Air Force bomber aircraft. He has served as the deputy commander of US Strategic Command since 2022 — so it’d be unusual if he didn’t know know about a change in the decadeslong moratorium on nuclear testing.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has not changed the nuclear modernization policy that was put into place during the final year of the Biden administration, with the aim of pivoting the strategic plan to deter China’s nuclear buildup. But carrying out a nuclear test could set back that modernization strategy because it would reorient the focus of the officials working on those ongoing efforts, according to former US officials who worked on nuclear issues.\n \n\n   \n  There are also concerns among those officials that Trump declaring the intent for US nuclear testing would actually benefit China — not the US.\n \n\n   \n  “The mere suggestion that the US may resume nuclear testing could give the green light to China to resume explosive testing, and the Chinese would benefit comparatively more than anyone else if testing resumed. There is no technical reason for the US to do this now. But for China, it could technically advance their capabilities,” a former senior US official said.\n \n\n   \n  Yet Trump has long approached nuclear weapons with a combination of morbid fascination and bombastic threats.\n \n\n   \n  In August, he announced he was ordering two nuclear submarines to be strategically positioned near Russia in response to what he said were aggressive remarks by Dmitry Medvedev, the country’s former president and current deputy chairman of its Security Council. He never clarified whether he was referring to subs with nuclear weapon capabilities, or merely nuclear-powered subs.\n \n\n   \n  In a particularly heated moment from his first term, Trump taunted North Korea’s Kim Jong Un — whose 2017 underground test is the last known example of explosive nuclear testing — for the relative size of his “nuclear button.”\n \n\n   \n  “I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!” Trump wrote on social media in 2018.\n \n\n   \n  He and Kim eventually improved relations and met in person three times — though Trump was never able to convince the despot to abandon his nuclear weapons.\n \n\n   \n  Now, Trump appears hopeful to begin tests quickly — though just how quickly may depend on his willingness to break international rules.\n \n\n   \n  “If the United States needed to conduct an immediate nuclear test to, say, verify that some of its weapons were working or for political purposes, it could violate a whole number of treaties that ban doing that in the atmosphere. And that could happen in a matter of weeks or maybe months,” said Jon Wolfsthal, a former senior director for arms control and nonproliferation at the National Security Council, who now is director of global risk at the Federation of American Scientists.\n \n\n   \n  “The United States has a test site just outside Nevada where we conducted these tests in the 1990s and before,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  “But it’s not poised to conduct testing anytime soon, and it takes years to scientifically instrument a test to make sure you’re getting the data out of it that you need. And I also assume that states like Nevada and others would sue to block the president’s ability to do this. So we’re several years away from being able to conduct explosive nuclear tests.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/africa/tanzania-opposition-dispute-election-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"10:40:00-04:00","title":"What to know about a disputed election in Tanzania, where single-party rule is being challenged","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tanzania is facing a major political crisis as protests spread over a disputed presidential election, with President Samia Suluhu Hassan seeking re-election amid allegations of a climate of fear, suppression of opposition candidates, and systemic repression.

EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  Protests are spreading in  Tanzania  as electoral authorities count the votes in a disputed presidential election that rights groups, opposition figures and others say was clouded by a climate of fear in the months leading to election day.\n \n\n   \n  The military has been deployed alongside the police to quell riots in major cities since Wednesday’s election. The sight of soldiers patrolling the streets, sporadic gunfire and closed stores is rare in the usually peaceful country that many foreigners visit for its pristine coastal beaches and safari tourism.\n \n\n   \n  That’s partly because Tanzania’s first female leader, who has served as president since 2021, has sparked widespread anger for  running virtually unopposed  after her two main opponents were blocked or prevented from contesting.\n \n\n   \n  President Samia Suluhu Hassan, who seeks five more years as president, ran against 16 candidates from smaller parties. Critics say that’s a coronation, not a contest. Hassan is now the subject of a range of uncharitable cartoons, posted on social media, derided as a dictator and lampooned as being afraid of competition.\n \n\n   \n  Tundu Lissu, leader of the Chadema opposition group, has been jailed for months, charged with treason after he called for electoral reforms that he said were a prerequisite for free and fair elections. Another opposition figure, Luhaga Mpina of the ACT-Wazalendo group, was barred from standing.\n \n\n   \n    Political maneuvering\n \n\n   \n  At stake for the ruling Chama cha Mapinduzi party, or CCM, is its decades-long grip on power amid the rise of charismatic opposition figures who hope to lead the country toward political change.\n \n\n   \n  The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data, or ACLED, a nonprofit tracking violence and protest movements around the world, describes CCM as the “last of the hegemonic liberation parties,” trying to cling to power by blocking the opposition “through administrative, legal, and extra-legal means.”\n \n\n   \n  The pattern includes enforced disappearances, arbitrary arrests and extrajudicial killings, according to Amnesty International. In June, a United Nations panel of human rights experts cited  more than 200 cases of enforced disappearance since 2019 , saying they were “alarmed by reports of a pattern of repression” ahead of elections.\n \n\n   \n  Internet access has been on and off since Wednesday as the nation awaits official results.\n \n\n   \n  Tanzania’s president has “overseen an unprecedented crackdown on political opponents,” the International Crisis Group said in its most recent analysis. “The government has curbed freedom of expression, ranging from a ban on X and restrictions on the Tanzanian digital platform JamiiForums to silencing critical voices through intimidation or arrest.”\n \n\n   \n  Local police even appeared to be “conducting so-called online patrols,” it said.\n \n\n   \n  The political maneuvering by Tanzanian authorities is unprecedented even in a country where single-party rule has been the norm since the advent of multi-party politics in 1992.\n \n\n   \n  Government critics point out that previous leaders tolerated opposition while maintaining a firm grip on power, whereas Hassan is accused of leading with an authoritarian style that defies youth-led democracy movements elsewhere in the region.\n \n\n   \n  In Uganda, the opposition leader Bobi Wine, whose real name is Kyagulanyi Ssentamu, is the leader of what began as the “People Power” movement, which aims for a break with nearly four decades of the same leader. President Yoweri Museveni took his lowest-ever share of the vote in the 2021 election, marking the 43-year-old Wine as a formidable national leader.\n \n\n   \n  In Kenya, young people have been trying to hold President William Ruto accountable over official corruption and his alleged failure to keep campaign promises. Last year and earlier this year, they held demonstrations in the capital Nairobi that were so large and persistent that Ruto deployed the military to restore order.\n \n\n   \n  In  Mozambique  a year ago, violence erupted in the streets after the opposition figure Venâncio Mondlane brought his supporters to the streets of the capital Maputo following a disputed election.\n \n\n   \n  In  Madagascar  earlier in October, protests by mostly young people helped overthrow the government of President Andry Rajoelina, who fled the country after an elite group of the military joined crowds protesting water and electricity cuts.\n \n\n   \n    Tanzania is an outlier\n \n\n   \n  But Tanzania is different, an outlier in the region.\n \n\n   \n  A version of the governing CCM party, which maintains ties with the Communist Party of China, has ruled Tanzania since independence from Britain in 1961, a remarkable streak that Hassan is trying to extend as opposition leaders try to break CCM’s grip on the country.\n \n\n   \n  CCM is fused with the state, effectively in charge of the security apparatus and structured in such a way that new leaders emerge every five or ten years. Hassan herself was able to rise to the presidency as vice president without incident when her predecessor, John Pombe Magufuli, died suddenly after the start of his second term.\n \n\n   \n  The orderly transition sustained Tanzania’s reputation as an oasis of political stability and relative peace, a major reason for CCM’s considerable support, especially among rural voters.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/travel/halloween-decorations-st-jude-fundraiser","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"09:00:00-04:00","title":"A Veteran’s Halloween Spirit Gives Him a New Purpose — $1 Million Raised for Kids with Cancer","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Jeff Robertson, a 54-year-old Army veteran from Holly Springs, North Carolina, began a Halloween tradition in 2020 to bring joy to his children during the pandemic.

We want to help sick children get out of the hospital so they can see all these neat Halloween decorations.’”\n \n\n   \n  So the family printed a simple sign on their front yard that said in part: If you like what you see, feel free to donate to St. Jude – a leading children’s hospital for kids with cancer and other diseases.\n \n\n   \n  Within days, Robertson said a car pulled up with an emotional couple and their young daughter in the backseat. The tearful father told Robertson that they’re a St. Jude family and wanted to thank him for raising money for pay for treatment for families like them.\n \n\n   \n  Robertson didn’t get their names and they never saw each other again. But that encounter changed everything for him.\n \n\n   \n  “I’d been looking for purpose after retiring from the service,” he said. “This little girl was going through such a tough time, but she saw these goofy plastic skeletons in my yard, it put her in an awesome place.”\n \n\n   \n  The family raised  over $8,000 in 2020  – and the next year, Robertson created a Facebook group called Skeletons for St. Jude to spread the idea nationwide.\n \n\n   \n  This spooky season, the group has more than 5,000 members, and over 1,000 partner homes across the country have joined the cause and raised funds. On October 21, they officially hit the $1 million mark.\n \n\n   \n  Robertson’s neighborhood in North Carolina looks forward to his epic display every year with scores of visitors stopping by every day all month long to soak in the skeleton spectacle.\n \n\n   \n  It takes Robertson a whole year to plan the theme and build new props. He’s accumulated 100 or so toy skeletons that he keeps in storage, and he adds onto the display every day until Halloween — so there’s always something new for visitors to see.\n \n\n   \n  This October, skeletons are sailing on a 25-foot phantom pirate ship that Robertson has positioned so it appears to have crashed through the first and second stories of his house.\n \n\n   \n  “The real focus isn’t on me,” Robertson said. “It’s on the thousands of people giving five or ten dollars here and there. That’s what made this a success.”\n \n\n   \n  Robertson is grateful knowing this money will help families focus on getting their kids better.

But Wall Street’s patience to see a return might be wearing a little thin.\n \n\n   \n  That message rang clear when Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple and Google parent Alphabet all said this week that they’re forking over more   on capital expenditures, like   leases and equipment for data centers and infrastructure.\n \n\n   \n  Based on the way analysts grilled executives from companies like Meta, Alphabet and Google on earnings calls this week, they’re eager for signs that these massive investments will pay off in a big way.\n \n\n   \n    AI spending continues to soar\n \n\n   \n  Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta all grew their overall revenue year-over-year and surpassed Wall Street’s expectations. Microsoft and Google saw their cloud businesses expand by 40% and 34% respectively, while Amazon Web Services sales grew 20% year-over-year – a sign that companies are indeed relying on their services in the age of AI.\n \n\n   \n  And they’re continuing to pour tens of billions of dollars into AI infrastructure and data centers, an investment they call necessary for the internet’s next era.\n \n\n   \n  The dollar amounts involved are staggering.\n \n\n   \n  Google expects to   spend $91 to $93 billion in capital expenditures for 2025, up from the $85 billion it previously forecast. Microsoft sees that spending   up 74%, to $34.9 billion this year, largely lining up with the more than $30 billion it predicted for the quarter. Meta spent $19.37 billion, up from $9.2 billion a year ago and more than the $18.4 billion analysts expected.\n \n\n   \n  And Amazon estimates the 2025 bill will hit $125 billion – and   expects to increase that in 2026.\n \n\n   \n  Even Apple, which is not a major cloud provider, expects to increase its capital expenditure spending related to AI investments, Apple Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh said on the company’s Thursday earnings call.\n \n\n   \n  Existing data centers need to be upgraded to handle AI workloads, leading to the giant outlays, said Melissa Otto, head of research for investment research service S&P Global Visible Alpha.\n \n\n   \n  Tech giants justify that spending by saying demand is outstripping supply. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said that “as fast as we’re adding capacity right now, we’re monetizing it.”\n \n\n   \n    Wall Street wants big answers from Big Tech\n \n\n   \n  But Wall Street wants more than just promises of future returns. Meta shares fell as much as 13.5% on Thursday, while Microsoft’s were down more than 3%.\n \n\n   \n  Nearly every question on Meta’s earnings call focused on how the company views its AI investments translating into income, the timeline for new products and models coming out of its Superintelligence Lab and its general approach to AI.\n \n\n   \n  Zuckerberg called AI useful for powering virtual assistants and helping advertisers plan their campaigns. More than a billion people use Meta AI on a monthly basis, he said, adding that AI can lead to “all kinds of new products around different content formats.”\n \n\n   \n  “We expect to build novel models and novel products, and I’m excited to share more when we have it,” he said about the Superintelligence Lab’s efforts.\n \n\n   \n  On the Microsoft call, analysts wanted to know if clients will make good on promised purchasing commitments and whether the tech industry can really make money from global AI investments. Amy Hood, Microsoft’s chief financial officer, said its investments reflect business that’s already been booked, saying that demand is increasing.\n \n\n   \n  Google investors wanted to know how AI summaries and agents are changing how the company makes money from search.

 9:43 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Scientists say they have found a way to test  ancient human  remains for hormones linked with pregnancy, a breakthrough that may allow archaeologists to determine whether a woman was pregnant or had recently given birth at the time of her death.\n \n\n   \n  Researchers found key reproductive hormones estrogen, progesterone and testosterone in hard tissues, such as the bones and teeth, of skeletons dating back as far as 1,000 years, according to a study published October 2 in the  Journal of Archaeological Science .\n \n\n   \n  “We found a ‘hormone archive’ in skeletons and teeth,” said lead study author Aimée Barlow, an archaeologist at the University of Sheffield, northern England.\n \n\n   \n  “This is a first. Nobody has ever detected these specific hormones in teeth or dental calculus before,” Barlow told CNN. “It is also the first time progesterone has been successfully measured in human bone tissue.”\n \n\n   \n  Pregnancy is difficult to detect in ancient human remains, and scientists previously believed that the composition of hard tissues was so overwhelmingly inorganic that these proteins would not be preserved or detected, Barlow said.\n \n\n   \n  Nonetheless, she decided to test a number of samples from seven female and three male skeletons dating from the first to 19th centuries using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). ELISA is an existing technique used to detect and quantify peptide and protein molecules such as progesterone, a key biomarker for pregnancy, the levels of which increase significantly during the first trimester and are maintained throughout.\n \n\n   \n  Levels of estrogen and testosterone also rise, although not to the same extent, meaning that it was important to also consider the relationship between the three hormones, according to the study.\n \n\n   \n  The tests revealed that estrogen, progesterone and testosterone were measurable in bone, and dentin, enamel, calculus and root samples from teeth. “High progesterone levels in dental structures and calculus, the presence of oestrogen in bone, and a lack of testosterone in hard tissues was consistent with pregnancy at the time of death,” the study authors wrote.\n \n\n   \n  This demonstrates “the feasibility and significant potential of the ELISA method for the detection of sex hormones in human skeletal remains to examine the reproductive histories of past populations,” according to the study.\n \n\n   \n  Barlow said proving that the skeleton can preserve hormones would, with many years of further study, potentially allow researchers to determine the age at which a woman first became pregnant, whether she experienced pregnancy loss and how much time had passed between births if she had multiple children.\n \n\n   \n  “This will be especially useful for historical periods where no written records exist,” Barlow said.\n \n\n   \n  More work is needed to fully develop the technique for use on ancient remains, she said, including establishing a baseline of hormone levels in skeletal tissues by conducting a much larger study that also involves living individuals with detailed medical records.\n \n\n   \n  “Secondly, we need to understand the fundamental science. We need to learn how these hormones get incorporated into and stored within these different tissues,” Barlow said.\n \n\n   \n  “And we need to explore how these hormones are preserved and broken down (degraded) over time in different burial environments.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Groundbreaking’ findings\n \n\n   \n  Nikolas Lemos, professor of forensic medical sciences at Queen Mary University of London, who was not involved in the study, told CNN that “this is a pioneering study … which has achieved a world-first.”\n \n\n   \n  Lemos underlined that the sample size was “very small,” with only two of the 10 individuals pregnant at death, adding that the ELISA method requires “further testing and validation.”\n \n\n   \n  “In short, while the findings are groundbreaking, they should be viewed as proof of concept, not yet as a routine diagnostic tool,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “Although the work is still in its early stages, it represents a remarkable step toward understanding the intimate, hormonal dimensions of life and death in the distant past,” Lemos added.\n \n\n   \n  Alexander Comninos, a professor of endocrinology at Imperial College London, who was not involved in the study, said that the research was “fascinating.”\n \n\n   \n  “By understanding reproductive profiles of the past, this can provide insights into how these may have changed over time and perhaps glimpses of the future,” he told CNN in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  “In addition, the ability to identify these key hormones in bone can trigger further contemporary work in the bone field,” Comninos added.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/us/abby-zwerner-lawsuit-trial-shot","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"09:34:00-04:00","title":"Teacher shot by a 6-year-old student thought she was ‘on my way to heaven.’ What we learned from Abby Zwerner’s testimony","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Teacher Abby Zwerner was shot in the hand and chest by a 6-year-old student at Richneck Elementary School in Newport News, Virginia, on January 6, 2023.

I thought I had died,” Zwerner said with a catch in her voice as she recounted the moment she was shot in the hand and chest on January 6, 2023, while sitting at a reading table in her classroom at Richneck Elementary School in Newport News.\n \n\n   \n  The boy’s   “blank look” as he aimed at her is a memory Zwerner said she can’t shake.\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner has filed a $40 million  lawsuit  against ex-assistant principal   Ebony Parker, saying Parker failed to act when several people approached her with concerns the boy had brought a gun to school.\n \n\n   \n  Parker also faces  eight counts  of felony child neglect in the criminal trial against her next month.\n \n\n   \n  The case offers a window into what to expect for the upcoming criminal trial against Parker. Both trials raise questions about who is responsible when children with access to guns carry out school shootings, a pervasive problem across the country.\n \n\n   \n  As of Monday, there have been  64 school shootings  in the United States this year, 27 of which took place on K-12 school grounds.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we learned from Zwerner’s moving and highly anticipated testimony.\n \n\n   \n    Effects of shooting linger\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner’s devastating hand injury has left her unable to do everyday things like open a bottle of   water.\n \n\n   \n  “I was trying to open the bag of chips on my own multiple times, different ways — trying to hold it different ways,” she testified about a recent lunch with her attorney. “And I eventually asked you to open it.”\n \n\n   \n  Even after six surgeries, Zwerner’s hand will never be normal, an orthopedic surgeon testified this week.\n \n\n   \n  Previous testimony from doctors on her care team revealed Zwerner’s injuries were life-threatening after a bullet narrowly missed her heart. And the impacts extended beyond the physical damage, she testified.\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner struggled to describe how she now feels around people, even loved ones, but indicated she feels a “distance” and “numbness.”\n \n\n   \n  Psychiatrist Dr. Clarence Watson testified Thursday Zwerner has suffered post-traumatic stress disorder after the shooting.\n \n\n   \n  “She has lost the sense of being safe, something that she had not experienced before, even when she was feeling depressed or anxious … She now doesn’t want to go anywhere,” Watson said. “She had become socially withdrawn and isolated, pulled away from friends, didn’t want to be in public as much, and felt fear in places that she didn’t feel fear before.”\n \n\n   \n  Even a planned outing to the movies to see “Hamilton,” which features a duel scene with guns, became an overwhelming task that left her in tears, Zwerner said.\n \n\n   \n  When her mother asked her what she wanted to do instead, she felt resigned.\n \n\n   \n  “I remember saying or telling them, ‘nowhere, like I can’t go anywhere. I just want to stay home,’” Zwerner said.\n \n\n   \n    Defense tries to undercut teacher’s testimony\n \n\n   \n  During cross-examination Thursday, an attorney for Parker worked to undermine Zwerner’s claims that the shooting has limited her willingness to go out in public.\n \n\n   \n  The attorney presented evidence Zwerner had been emotionally ready to attend concerts since the shooting, including the Taylor Swift Eras tour.\n \n\n   \n  The attorney also sought to undermine claims Zwerner is physically hindered by her wounds, asking Zwerner how she successfully attended and graduated from cosmetology school, worked and frequented a gym if she had physical limitations.\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner was proud of graduating but was often in pain, she said. She has yet to get a job in cosmetology and can’t work in the field until her hand heals from her latest surgery, she said.\n \n\n   \n  Additionally, her doctor had cleared her to do light workouts and she tried her best to do that with weights, Zwerner testified.\n \n\n   \n  The defense also pressed Zwerner on whether there was more she could have done after learning of the possible gun threat.\n \n\n   \n  Another school staffer told her about the boy potentially having a gun and she did not inform Parker because she knew the other staffer was going to, Zwerner testified.\n \n\n   \n  Parker’s attorneys are trying to paint a picture that Zwerner may have been “a little bit at fault” for not acting on information that she had, said Darryl K. Brown, a law professor at the University of Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  “That can be the basis for the defendant not being held negligent and having to pay damages, even if the defendant is more at fault, or mostly at fault,” Brown said .   \n \n\n   \n    What’s next\n \n\n   \n  The jury will reconvene Monday morning in the ongoing civil trial — which could be a roadmap for what’s to come with the criminal litigation against Parker.\n \n\n   \n  Holding civil cases before criminal ones is “really unusual,” Brown said. It may be because Parker waived her right to a speedy trial, and because the defense wants it that way, he added.\n \n\n   \n  “I suspect that defense would want the civil trial to go forward first, because they’re not going to be able to avoid it, and it gives them a lot of information about what would come in at the criminal trial,” Brown said.\n \n\n   \n  While Zwerner’s pain and suffering have taken center stage in this trial, the upcoming   criminal trial would be more likely to touch on what action Parker failed to take, given her duty to protect children, Brown said.\n \n\n   \n  “The more important evidence for the prosecution would be from other witnesses and sources that reveal what the defendant knew with respect to the threat the child posed, and whether he had a gun,” the professor said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/europe/dutch-centrist-d66-party-election-wins-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"08:52:00-04:00","title":"Dutch centrist D66 party confirmed as election winner, ANP says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the Netherlands' general election, the centrist, pro-EU party D66 won the most votes, narrowly beating the far-right Freedom Party (PVV) led by Geert Wilders.

by massive buyouts for fired head coaches such as Brian Kelly ($53 million at LSU) and James Franklin ($49 million at Penn State), with over $169 million owed across 10 FBS schools. Despite revenue sharing mandates from the House settlement and rising spending, universities face a stark reality: the money to pay these buyouts does not exist. The article highlights how football spending has outpaced revenue growth, with schools like LSU and Penn State seeing spending increases of over 40% while revenues rose less than 40%. Governance is strained as governors like Jeff Landry publicly criticize fiscal mismanagement, and athletic departments claim responsibility for the costs without clear institutional funding. Even staff like coordinators are now liable. Meanwhile, new contracts—such as Curt Cignetti’s $93 million deal at Indiana—reveal a culture of unchecked spending. The article concludes with a growing consensus that college football’s financial model is unsustainable and that no clear answers exist about how to fund these obligations.","keyTakeAways":["The money

football coaches are setting off alarm bells \n       \n  By Dana O’Neil, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:22 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The placard attached to the podium read “Protecting the most vulnerable,’’ but on this particular Wednesday Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry took aim at a very specific apex predator: Big-time football.\n \n\n   \n  The governor, who was supposed to be talking about  food stamps that are nearing a crisis point due to the government shutdown , instead launched a verbal grenade directed squarely at the Louisiana State University Athletics Administration Building – aimed more specifically at the desk of athletic director Scott Woodward.\n \n\n   \n  Calling out not just the lack of success under football head coach Brian Kelly but the $53 million bill LSU now has to foot to give the coach his walking papers, Landry publicly defrocked Woodward, making it clear that the man in charge of LSU athletics would not be making the biggest hire for LSU athletics.\n \n\n   \n  “My role is about the fiscal effect of firing a coach under a terrible contract,’’ Landry said after being asked about his role in Kelly’s dismissal after reports indicated discussions about the dismissal went all the way to the governor’s mansion.\n \n\n   \n  “I care about what the taxpayers are on the hook on, and I was not happy about raising ticket prices while we were having a losing season and we were paying a coach $100 million and not getting results.’’\n \n\n   \n  He wasn’t done there.  Landry told ABC  on Thursday that he plans to have the state’s attorney general review the next head coach’s contract “to understand what the extent under which the state is ultimately liable.”\n \n\n   \n  The remarks drew plenty of eye rolls. This is Louisiana, where Huey Long used his own gubernatorial position to influence LSU football nearly a 100 years ago. Pigskin and politics regularly mix.\n \n\n   \n  But in this case, Landry’s public tongue lashing resounded well beyond the reaches of the bayou, earning nods of approval in plenty of other far-flung circles of college athletics.\n \n\n   \n  “Finally, someone said it out loud,’’ said a board of trustees member at another institution. “This is so irresponsible.’’\n \n\n   \n    Buyout season\n \n\n   \n  LSU, after all, is not alone.  Since Oklahoma State fired Mike Gundy  on September 23 through Kelly’s dismissal one month later, 10 FBS schools have ousted their head coaches. Combined the coaches are owed $169 million, all coming at a time when college athletics is facing unprecedented costs.\n \n\n   \n  In June, U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken approved the $2.8 billion settlement coming from the so-called House settlement, requiring colleges to directly share revenue with their athletes. The estimated House payouts this year is $20.5 million. That will only go up annually.\n \n\n   \n  It has left plenty of university administrators equal parts dismayed and disgusted at what they believe is nothing shy of fiscal malfeasance, with schools hamstrung by deals presented as security blankets for the university but offering only protection for the coaches.\n \n\n   \n  “No one is flying the plane,’’ a board member at one of the schools affected said. “There’s not even a plane. It’s a hot air balloon. Whatever way the wind blows, that’s the way college sports go.’’\n \n\n   \n  That college football is spending at an unprecedented pace is not new news. Arguing a very expensive need to keep up with the Joneses (or maybe more accurately the Sabans and Meyers) to succeed, coaches long have asked for bigger, better and more.\n \n\n   \n  Facility one-upsmanship, all in the name of attracting better recruits, led to practice facilities with mini-golf courses (Clemson), marble showers in the locker room (Oregon) and sensory deprivation tanks (Georgia). Then came more staff – to run the analytics and sports performance and nutrition and, in some cases, the head coach. Texas has not one, not two but three special assistants to the head coach.\n \n\n   \n  Finally, when simply ballooning coaching contracts was no longer enough, the deals also had to be guaranteed, lest another school poach your leader.\n \n\n   \n  At the start of the season, nine head coaches were making more than $10 million annually, according to the USA Today head coaches database, and 12 had buyouts totaling more than $40 million, topped by Kirby Smart’s $105 million owed should Georgia decide to can him.\n \n\n   \n  Except now, as some of those bills come due at the same time revenue sharing comes into existence, the very real question is no longer an existential crisis. Just where is the money coming from?\n \n\n   \n  “I have no idea,’’ said another board member at an affected school. “The money does not exist.’’\n \n\n   \n  That startling and yet very real revelation flies in the face of what has long been the presiding sentiment about college football: That it is the big money meal ticket for an athletics department.\n \n\n   \n  For years it was not bottom-line accurate —rare was the department that ran in the black – but at least true in theory. Thanks to TV rights packages and tens of thousands of fannies in the seats on fall Saturdays, college football did draw the biggest paycheck.\n \n\n   \n  Except somewhere along the line the spending steamrolled ahead of the profits.\n \n\n   \n    ‘No one has the answer’\n \n\n   \n  Consider two of the schools on the hook for two of the biggest coaching buyouts: Penn State, which owes  James Franklin $49 million  and LSU, on the hook for $53 million for Kelly.\n \n\n   \n  According to the KnightNewhouse College Athletics Database, in the last 10 years Penn State’s football spending has jumped 113% but the entire department’s revenues have grown only 83%. At LSU, football spending jumped 44% and revenues just 40%.\n \n\n   \n  In the same decade, football coaching salaries (the entire staff) jumped 106% in State College and 90% in Baton Rouge while ticket sales only added an additional 33% and 37% respectively and donor contributions jumped 53% and 66%.\n \n\n   \n  The money owed can be mitigated. Most contracts include what are called best efforts clauses, which means the ex-coach can’t hole up in Cabo and get his entire paycheck. He has to look for a job, and should he land one, the salary owed will be less the salary gained.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s like being divorced and paying alimony,’’ one of the board members joked. “You’re rooting for them to get remarried.’’\n \n\n   \n  But it is not simply the head coaches that need to be paid out.  The Advertiser i n Louisiana reported that offensive coordinator Joe Sloan, fired along with Kelly, is due $530,000. Penn State defensive coordinator Jim Knowles reportedly is in the first year of a three-year deal worth $3.1 million annually and offensive coordinator Andy Kotelnicki is making $2.4 million. It will be up to the next coach – who, by the way, will not come at a bargain-basement price – to decide if they stay on.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile Penn State last year was on the hook for more than $900,000 in football coaching severance per the KnightNewhouse database, presumably due to Mike Yurcich, Kotelnicki’s predecessor who was fired in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  Penn State athletic director Pat Kraft, who through a spokesperson declined comment for this story, has insisted that Franklin’s buyout is “an athletics issue. This is not the institution’s issue. We in athletics are covering the costs.”\n \n\n   \n  But from where? “No one has the answer,’’ one of the board members said.\n \n\n   \n    No signs of stopping\n \n\n   \n  Still, the race to the top of the money pile goes on.\n \n\n   \n  A pitch to turn to private equity for the Big Ten has at least temporarily stalled, in large part because of pushback from conference members USC and Michigan. Deep-pocketed donors are now being asked to foot the bill for coaching salaries, facilities improvements and – thanks to the House settlement – player contracts.\n \n\n   \n  Virginia Tech recently announced a planned $229 million investment in athletics over the next four years. Along with seeking donor support for $30 million of that annually, the university said there will be “limited increases in student fees.’’ In 2024, student fees generated $14.5 million for the athletic department.\n \n\n   \n  “That deal should terrify boards everywhere,’’ one of the trustees said.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the logic gleaned from the accounting books arguing to the contrary, spending is showing no signs of stopping.  Curt Cignetti has done wonders  at Indiana, elevating a program that ranked somewhere below historically dormant to No. 2 in the nation.\n \n\n   \n  He has coached 21 games at Indiana – 21 at the FBS level entirely. And last week the school inked him to an eight-year, $93 million deal. It’s all guaranteed.\n \n\n   \n  And less than 24 hours after the governor undercut Woodward at LSU, the athletic director was, to no one’s surprise, negotiating his exit strategy from the school. That leaves the school without a university president (William Tate left in May to take the same position at Rutgers), no football coach and no athletic director.\n \n\n   \n  According to Yahoo Sports, Woodward is owed somewhere in the neighborhood of $6.4 million. The school is expected to honor the terms – another buyout on the Bayou.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/media/disney-youtube-deal-biz-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"07:30:00-04:00","title":"Disney channels go dark on YouTube TV after media giants fail to resolve carriage dispute","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Disney has removed its channels—including ESPN, ABC, Disney Channel, FX, National Geographic, and Freeform—from YouTube TV following a failed negotiation over carriage fees.

CNN\n \n   \n  For a logo with a trademark grin, Wendy’s has little to smile about nowadays.\n \n\n   \n  The burger chain’s stock has lost nearly 50% of its value this year. Wendy’s executive suite has contended with several departures, and it’s currently operating without a permanent CEO after its previous leader abruptly left after just a year-and-a-half on the job. Plus, a confusing mix of promotions hurt sales last quarter.\n \n\n   \n  “We are not happy with our sales performance,” Ken Cook, Wendy’s CFO and interim CEO, bluntly admitted on its most recent earnings call in August.\n \n\n   \n  The fast food industry is in a slump, and Wendy’s isn’t immune. Chief rivals McDonald’s and Burger King also reported sluggish sales earlier this year as consumers cut back spending. However,  both rebounded  over the summer and fall thanks to an increased focus on marketing and targeted promotions.\n \n\n   \n  Not so much for Wendy’s.\n \n\n   \n  US sales at stores open at least a year in the third quarter are forecast to fall 5.8% when the company reports earnings next week, according to Jim Salera, a research analyst for Stephens. That’s even worse than the 3.6% decline in the previous quarter.\n \n\n   \n  “Investors are really focusing on when the company can get same-store sales trends moving back in the right direction and we had seen little progress of that,” Salera told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Wendy’s is being forced to take action, recently announcing an aggressive turnaround plan that aims to reignite sales. However, revitalizing a 55-year-old chain is not easy.\n \n\n   \n  McDonald’s, which has nearly triple the number of locations in the United States, found recent success with new deals and  menu items . McDonald’s recent growth has also eaten away at some of Wendy’s market share.\n \n\n   \n  Wendy’s sits in a “more of an elevated position where it’s not just focused on price,” Salera said, and is focused on quality. After all, the chain prides itself on its “fresh, never frozen” tagline for its patties, which has been  in use since its founding in 1969 .\n \n\n   \n  “But as consumers that are trading down or in some cases just trading out entirely and just skipping (fast food) occasions, McDonald’s is leading a lot more with price than an operator like Wendy’s,” he   added.\n \n\n   \n    Back to square one\n \n\n   \n  Wendy’s recently announced a  “comprehensive strategic plan”  called “Project Fresh,” under the guidance of former Taco Bell CEO Greg Creed.\n \n\n   \n  “Wendy’s board of directors and management team are dissatisfied with the current valuation of the company and have been working to put the company on the right path to create value for our franchisees, employees and shareholders,” said Art Winkleback, chairman of Wendy’s board, in an October 9 press release.\n \n\n   \n  Plans include refreshed marketing to remind customers of its “rich heritage of quality, innovation and unique voice.” The company also intends to help franchisees improve profits and increase investments in restaurant technology, like digital menus, to “enhance the customer experience.”\n \n\n   \n  BTIG analyst Peter Saleh, however, doesn’t think Wendy’s plan is “tackling the root of the problem” and that its “issues go far deeper than some marketing changes or some menu adjustments.”\n \n\n   \n  Rather, he said that Wendy’s problems stretches back more than a decade to   a  remodel initiative  of its US restaurants that was meant to modernize the chain. Instead, the final product was “watered down a lot” from its initial plan because of several leadership changes.\n \n\n   \n  “Wendy’s is now starting to talk about kind of a multi-year plan to install digital menu boards, which have been around for over a decade,” Saleh told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  For comparison, around the same time, McDonald’s  remodeled a vast majority  of its US restaurants, adding digital kiosks and refreshed interiors. The work was largely completed by 2020.\n \n\n   \n  “The biggest problem (Wendy’s) have is not their food … it’s (their restaurants) are old and tired,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Salera agreed that Wendy’s has a “solid offering” with its food. The chain recently relaunched its chicken tenders to  capitalize on the trend  for crispy chicken, and he complimented the  revamped Frosty  offerings to establish it as a “unique Wendy’s asset.”\n \n\n   \n  He said that the brand’s plan of “focusing and skimming down the number of promotions or limited-time offers is a positive (move),” especially after the variety of deals in the “100 Days of Summer” promotion proved to be  too complex  for customers to understand.\n \n\n   \n  Additional details of Wendy’s plan will be revealed during its November 7 earnings call.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/americas/rescue-efforts-storm-melissa-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"07:38:00-04:00","title":"Caribbean islands reel from Hurricane Melissa’s devastating impact as storm heads north","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, one of the most powerful Atlantic storms in over 150 years, devastated the Caribbean, with Jamaica suffering the worst damage as a Category 5 storm that caused complete destruction in coastal areas like Black River, resulting in over 50 deaths and widespread power outages.

Caribbean islands reel from Hurricane Melissa’s devastating impact as storm heads north \n       \n  By Sophie Tanno, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:38 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Rescue efforts are underway across the Caribbean after  Hurricane Melissa  tore through the region as one of the most powerful Atlantic storms in more than 150 years.\n \n\n   \n  Torrential downpours and forceful winds have  already unleashed  widespread destruction along the storm’s path in Jamaica, Cuba and the Bahamas.\n \n\n   \n  Melissa lashed Bermuda as a Category 1 storm overnight Thursday into Friday as the storm passed the islands, bringing quick-hitting bursts of strong wind and rain. The storm is expected to weaken and become post-tropical as it races south of Newfoundland into cooler Atlantic water.\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of the storm, authorities in Bermuda closed the Causeway – a transport link connecting the main island with the smaller St. David’s Island. All schools will be shut and ferries canceled on Friday, among other measures, out of an “abundance of caution,” said Michael Weeks, Bermuda’s national security minister, according to Reuters.\n \n\n   \n  The storm has damaged homes, caused severe flooding and widespread power outages, and forced the evacuation of hundreds of thousands across the Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n  At least 49 people are known to have died, Reuters reported, though the full toll of the catastrophic storm may take days or weeks to be determined.\n \n\n   \n  Emergency officials have begun to pick up the pieces, clearing roads to reach isolated communities in need of relief, as several international efforts have also been launched.\n \n\n   \n  The regional Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART), activated by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on October 29, has deployed and will be on the ground today.\n \n\n   \n    Jamaica hardest hit\n \n\n   \n  Jamaica took the  heaviest battering . Melissa made landfall there as a  Category 5 storm , with estimated maximum sustained winds of 185 mph (295 kph).\n \n\n   \n  “Complete and utter destruction” is how CNN’s Derek Van Dam described the streets of Jamaica’s hard-hit coastal town of Black River on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  People gathering around the Black River Bridge searched for water, food and news about their loved ones. The Jamaican Defense Forces have landed in the area by helicopter, but desperation is setting in for residents, Van Dam reported. Many are trying to leave the area with their personal items by car, motorbike or on foot.\n \n\n   \n  Black River is dealing with the aftermath of over 15 feet of storm surge from Hurricane Melissa, which devastated the infrastructure of the town in the southwestern part of the island.\n \n\n   \n  The heat and humidity are complicating recovery efforts. There is a makeshift refugee camp of people who rode out the storm, but nothing remains standing.\n \n\n   \n  “Everything is gone,” one Black River resident, Britney Samms, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Looting was reported in the area. Van Dam described it as “a matter of survival.”\n \n\n   \n  “What once was paradise is now hell on earth,” he said of the town, first established in the 17 th  century and lately known as a center for environmental tourism.\n \n\n   \n  But the CNN team also witnessed signs of hope. Amid the chaos, there were moments of laughter and exchanges of hugs, as loved ones reunited after the storm.\n \n\n   \n  In Montego Bay on Jamaica’s northwestern coast, Alfred Hines, 77, told how he waded barefoot through mud to escape rising floodwaters. Speaking to Reuters on Wednesday, he said: “At one stage, I see the water at my waist and (after) about 10 minutes’ time, I see it around my neck here and I make my escape.”\n \n\n   \n  Authorities in Jamaica have recovered at least four bodies in the badly hit St. Elizabeth Parish, a source in the government told CNN on Wednesday. The Jamaica Constabulary Force confirmed eight more deaths on Thursday in Westmoreland, Hanover and St. James.\n \n\n   \n  Three people also died during storm preparations.\n \n\n   \n  Around 25,000 tourists remained in Jamaica as the country emerged from the storm, education minister Dana Morris Dixon said in a Tuesday  statement .\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, more than 13,000 residents were still in shelters, while 72% of the island was without power,  Jamaican government officials  said.\n \n\n   \n  Overall, the country’s infrastructure has taken a battering, leaving it “severely compromised,” according to Desmond McKenzie, minister for local government and community development.\n \n\n   \n  A CNN crew observed residents and military personnel pushing more than a dozen ambulances past storm debris in the town of Santa Cruz as the medical convoy headed to a coastal area in western Jamaica, which was hit hard.\n \n\n   \n  Schools around the capital Kingston on the eastern side of the island are expected to reopen Monday, Dixon, the education minister, said in a news conference Thursday.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Extensive damage’ in Cuba\n \n\n   \n  Cuba was also hit hard after the hurricane made landfall there as a Category 3 storm on Wednesday. The country sustained “extensive damage,” according to President Miguel Díaz-Canel.\n \n\n   \n  This included flooding, mudslides, property destruction and infrastructure damage, particularly in Cuba’s eastern regions, where hundreds of rural communities were left isolated.\n \n\n   \n  As many as 140,000 people were cut off due to rising rivers as the storm passed, according to  the Red Cross . In the province of Santiago, at least 241 communities were cut off due to the storm, Reuters reported.\n \n\n   \n  More than 735,000 people were evacuated in Cuba as Melissa approached.\n \n\n   \n  Cuba’s foreign ministry said it is in touch with the US State Department to get clarity on how the United States would be willing to help with recovery.\n \n\n   \n  Rubio  announced  earlier Thursday that the US is “prepared to provide immediate humanitarian assistance” to the Cuban people – both directly and through local partners.\n \n\n   \n  The administration of President Donald Trump has historically taken a hard-line stance against the communist-ruled island. In June, the president signed a  memorandum  that the White House said would increase pressure on the Cuban government and support the long-running US economic embargo of the island.\n \n\n   \n  Rubio said Thursday that US law includes exemptions that authorize private donations of food, medicine and other humanitarian goods to Cuba, as well as disaster response.\n \n\n   \n  Cuban Deputy Foreign Minister Carlos Fernández de Cossío responded to the offer by  saying : “We have been in contact with the State Department and are awaiting clarification on how and in what way they are willing to assist.”\n \n\n   \n  Cuba is already receiving some aid from partners such as China and Venezuela, as well as the United Nations.\n \n\n   \n    High death toll in Haiti\n \n\n   \n  The highest death toll so far has been reported in Haiti, where the hurricane did not make direct landfall but caused significant damage and at least 30 deaths, Reuters said. Twenty of these fatalities, including 10 children, were due to flooding in Petit-Goâve, where a flooded river burst its banks.\n \n\n   \n  Steven Guadard, who lives in Petit-Goâve, told the  Associated Press  the storm killed his entire family.\n \n\n   \n  “I had four children at home: a 1-month-old baby, a 7-year-old, an 8-year-old and another who was about to turn 4,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    International efforts\n \n\n   \n  The United Kingdom said on Wednesday it was  deploying  £2.5 million ($3.3 million) in emergency humanitarian funding. The British government also said it was chartering a limited number of flights to help British nationals leave Jamaica.\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, the UK pledged an additional an additional 5 million pounds ($6.5 million).\n \n\n   \n  China’s ambassador to Cuba shared a video on  social media  on Tuesday showing hundreds of boxes labeled as “family kit” being transported from a warehouse.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/middleeast/iran-rebuilding-ballistic-weapons-program-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"09:07:00-04:00","title":"Western intelligence says Iran is rearming despite UN sanctions, with China’s help","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Iran is reportedly rebuilding its ballistic missile program despite the reinstatement of UN sanctions through the snapback mechanism, with Chinese shipments of 2,000 tons of sodium perchlorate—key to missile propellant—arriving at the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas since September 29, 2025.

9:07 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Iran appears to be stepping up the rebuilding of its ballistic missile program, despite the reintroduction last month of  United Nations sanctions  that ban arms sales to the country and ballistic missile activity.\n \n\n   \n  European intelligence sources say several shipments of sodium perchlorate, the main precursor in the production of the solid propellant that powers Iran’s mid-range conventional missiles, have arrived from China to the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas since the so-called  “snapback” mechanism  was triggered at the end of September.\n \n\n   \n  Those sources say the shipments, which began arriving on September 29, contain 2,000 tons of sodium perchlorate bought by Iran from Chinese suppliers in the wake of its  12-day conflict with Israel in June . The purchases are believed to be part of a determined effort to rebuild the Islamic Republic’s depleted missile stocks. Several of the cargo ships and Chinese entities involved are under sanctions from the United States.\n \n\n   \n  The deliveries come after more-than-a-decade-old UN sanctions were restored by the snapback mechanism – a provision for Iranian breaches of the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) deal to monitor its nuclear program.\n \n\n   \n  Under the sanctions re-imposed on Tehran last month, Iran shall not undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. UN member states must also prevent the provision to Iran of materials that could contribute to the country’s development of a nuclear weapons delivery system, which experts say could include ballistic missiles.\n \n\n   \n  States are also required to prevent the provision to Iran of assistance in the manufacture of arms. China, along with Russia, opposed the reimposition of the sanctions, saying it undermines efforts for a “diplomatic settlement of the Iranian nuclear issue.”\n \n\n   \n  While the shipped substance – sodium perchlorate – is not specifically named in UN documents on materials banned for export to Iran, it is a direct precursor of ammonium perchlorate, a listed and prohibited oxidizer used in ballistic missiles. However, experts say that the sanctions’ failure to explicitly prohibit the chemical may leave China room to argue that it is not in violation of any UN ban.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has followed the journeys of several cargo ships identified by the intelligence sources as being involved in the latest deliveries of sodium perchlorate from Chinese ports to Iran, using ship tracking data and the social media of their crew. Many of those vessels appear to have gone back and forth several times between China and Iran since the end of April. The sources say their crew seem to be employed by the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines and their regular social media posts provide a trail of their stops on the China to Iran journey.\n \n\n   \n  Among them is the MV Basht, already sanctioned by the US, which left the Chinese port of Zhuhai on September 15, arrived in Bandar Abbas on September 29 and since returned to China.\n \n\n   \n  Planet Labs satellite images provided to CNN by the Middlebury Institute of International Studies confirm that the Barzin was being loaded with cargo at Gaolan Port, China, on October 1, before departing for Iran. The images then show the Barzin docked at Rajaei Port in Bandar Abbas, Iran, from October 16 to October 19, where it was being unloaded.\n \n\n   \n  The Elyana left the Chinese port of Changjiangkou on September 18 and arrived in Bandar Abbas on October 12. Finally, the MV Artavand left the Chinese port of Liuheng and arrived in Bandar Abbas on October 12, with its AIS tracking system turned off to deliberately obscure its movements, according to Western intelligence.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not clear if the Chinese government is aware of the shipments. In response to a question from CNN about the transactions, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that, while he was “not familiar with the specific situation,” China has “consistently implemented export controls on dual-use items in accordance with its international obligations and domestic laws and regulations.”\n \n\n   \n  “We want to emphasize that China is committed to peacefully resolving the Iranian nuclear issue through political and diplomatic means and opposes sanctions and pressure,” the spokesperson continued, adding that Beijing viewed the return of sanctions under the snapback mechanism as “unconstructive” and a “serious setback” in efforts to “resolve the Iranian nuclear issue.”\n \n\n   \n  Similar shipments had previously been reported, but their intensification since the 12-day war – when the Israeli military targeted at least a third of the surface-to-surface launchers that fire Iran’s medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs) – suggests a renewed eagerness on the part of the Islamic Republic to arm itself.\n \n\n   \n  “Iran needs much more sodium perchlorate now to replace the missiles expended in the war and to increase production. I would expect large shipments to Iran as it tries to rearm, just as I would expect Israel and the US to race to replace the interceptors and munitions that were expended,” said Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Project at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies.\n \n\n   \n  The best way to consider the current moment, he told CNN, is as a pause in hostilities, as each side seeks to rearm.\n \n\n   \n  “Two thousand tons of sodium perchlorate are only enough for about 500 missiles.  That’s a lot, but Iran was planning on producing something like 200 missiles a month before the war and now must replace all the missiles that either Israel destroyed or it used,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    Long-standing ties\n \n\n   \n  China has long been a  diplomatic and economic ally  for sanctions-hit Iran, decrying “unilateral” US sanctions against the country and buying up most of Iran’s oil exports, despite not reporting purchases of Iranian oil for several years.\n \n\n   \n  That energy trade relies on a network of vessels that filter Iranian oil to independent refineries in coastal China, often through intermediary countries, according to analysts, who note this practice keeps refinement separate from Chinese state-owned enterprises that would be vulnerable to US sanctions. These so-called teapot refineries are known to work with what’s often referred to as a dark fleet of tankers that use concealing tactics to smuggle sanctioned goods.\n \n\n   \n  European security sources believe a similarly opaque system, involving front companies that are little more than fake numbers and billing addresses, has been used to keep the sodium perchlorate flowing to Iran. As have more legitimate companies, including two already sanctioned by the US back in April for their part in a “network procuring ballistic missile propellant ingredients on behalf of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).” Most of the companies involved are based in the northeastern Chinese port city of Dalian, according to information from the intelligence sources.\n \n\n   \n    Earlier shipments\n \n\n   \n  In February, CNN  reported the shipment  of 1,000 tons of sodium perchlorate to Iran from China. By April, the US had slapped sanctions on several Iranian and Chinese entities, including vessels believed to play a role in “a network procuring ballistic missile propellant ingredients on behalf of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).”\n \n\n   \n  Yet the shipments continued, the intelligence sources say, with the IRGC’s Self Sufficiency Jihad Organization acquiring another 1,000 tons of sodium perchlorate which left Taicang in China aboard the Hamouna on May 22 and arrived in Bandar Abbas on June 14 or 15. It set sail for the Iranian port less than a month after a massive explosion there on April 27, believed to have been caused by sodium perchlorate, killed 70 and wounded hundreds.\n \n\n   \n  The latest shipments represent much bigger quantities in a short space of time. The first of the 10 to 12 shipments that European intelligence sources have been tracking arrived in Iran on September 29, two days after the snapback mechanism – triggered in August by Germany, France, and the United Kingdom, the European partners to the JCPOA – restored UN sanctions. The others all left China after the sanctions were in place.\n \n\n   \n  Tong Zhao, a senior fellow with the nuclear policy program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said that China’s position on the legal status of the reimposition of sanctions may be related to how its authorities would view such shipments.\n \n\n   \n  “First and foremost, China – along with Russia and Iran – has denounced the legality of the snapback in a joint letter to the UN issued on October 18, indicating that Beijing likely does not consider itself bound by the reimposed measures,” according to Zhao.\n \n\n   \n  Had the snapback not been triggered, October 18 would have marked the official end of the 10-year JCPOA, at which point the option to reimpose previous UN sanctions and restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program would expire and the Security Council would close Iran’s nuclear file.\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, China joined with Russia in September to push for a six-month extension of the JCPOA, arguing that more time was needed for diplomatic efforts and pointing to what Beijing saw as signs that Iran wanted to engage with the international community on regulating its nuclear program. The UN Security Council  voted down  the China-backed resolution in September, one day before the snapback came into force.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing was one of the six countries – along with France, Germany, Russia, the UK and the US – that signed the JCPOA with Iran in 2015. In a meeting between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian in September, Xi reiterated China’s stance that it “attaches importance to Iran’s repeated pledge that it does not seek to develop nuclear weapons” and “respects Iran’s right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy.”\n \n\n   \n  Zhao also pointed to the fact that the export of sodium perchlorate is not explicitly banned under the pre-JCPOA sanctions regime that is now back in force. What the reinstated UN resolutions do prohibit, he added, is the provision by member states to Tehran of “items, materials, equipment, goods, and technology” which could contribute to Iran’s development of a nuclear weapon delivery system.\n \n\n   \n  So, while sodium perchlorate is not named, it “should fall under the broader catch-all controls on materials used in solid-fuel missile production,” he said, but noted that the fact that it is not explicitly prohibited may leave China and other countries with greater room for interpretation.\n \n\n   \n  “Beijing may be aware that such exports indirectly support Iran’s missile program,” Zhao said, “yet it may also view this as a matter of principle – asserting China’s sovereign right to make independent export-control decisions on items not expressly banned by the UN.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Simone McCarthy contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/style/maurizio-cattelan-america-gold-toilet-sothebys","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"06:33:00-04:00","title":"How much would you pay for an infamous gold toilet?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article recounts the dramatic and controversial history of Maurizio Cattelan’s gold toilet sculpture titled 'America,' which first drew attention in 2016 at the Guggenheim Museum.

Though the perpetrators  were convicted earlier this year , the fully functional, opulent toilet, titled “America,” was never found, believed to be cut up or melted down for the value of the gold itself, worth millions.\n \n\n   \n  But that isn’t the end of the saga for the satirical sculpture, which was once offered to President Donald J. Trump during his first term, in lieu of a Van Gogh painting requested by his administration (the counteroffer was  reportedly ignored) .\n \n\n   \n  Cattelan has previously stated he had made more than one edition of “America,” and now a second edition is making an unexpected, flashy debut on the art market next month.\n \n\n   \n  Sotheby’s in New York will sell the work, which has been in private (and anonymous) hands since 2017, on November 18. That also means the sculpture will be back on public view for a limited time, when the auction house installs it in the fourth-floor bathroom of its brand-new headquarters for 10 days leading up to the sale. This time, however, visitors will not be able to use it, per Sotheby’s. Officially that’s for security reasons, though one can guess why else.\n \n\n   \n  “The door will remain open,” said David Galperin, Sotheby’s head of contemporary art, laughing.\n \n\n   \n  Auctions typically have a set starting bid, informed by a number of market factors, as well as low and high sales numbers, estimated ahead of time. But the sale for this “America” will be worth its weight in gold — quite literally — as the starting figure will be its inherent value, fluctuating with the gold market right up until bidding begins. That will be somewhere in the $10 million range, according to the current value (with the price of gold lately  setting record highs ), plus whatever collectors deem its ascribed value to be.\n \n\n   \n  “The starting bid in accordance with the price of gold was really a way to lean into the very essence of the conceptual basis behind the artwork, which is largely to draw attention to the difference between a work’s artistic value, and a work’s inherent material value,” Galperin explained.\n \n\n   \n  It’s a “perfect foil” to Cattelan’s other equally infamous banana-on-a-wall, “Comedian,” which  sold for $6.24 million at Sotheby’s last fall , Galperin added. The duct-taped banana, worthless without Cattelan’s association, first debuted at Art Basel Miami on a bare white wall, originally priced at $120,000.  It has been eaten more than once .\n \n\n   \n  “If ‘Comedian’ was all about the intangibility of value and how we ascribe value to works of art, ‘America’ challenges that a step further by being in so many ways, intrinsically valuable, in a manner that so many works of art are not.”\n \n\n   \n  “America” is many things: a wry comment on the art world and the United States, as well as an object of torment for arts publicists and their lofty press statements. (The Guggenheim once described it as an opportunity for “unprecedented intimacy with a work of art.”) And this edition may actually be the only physical one in existence, according to Sotheby’s. Though the work is an edition of three, the auction house does not believe the third has been fabricated.\n \n\n   \n  Beyond the sculpture’s dramatic history, Galperin said “America” is an important 21st-century artwork, one with a direct lineage to landmark Modern art (see: Marcel Duchamp’s 1917 upside-down urinal “Fountain”), but with critical relevance to today.\n \n\n   \n  “Cattelan, for his entire career, has critiqued the system,” Galperin said, “whether it’s the viewers’ experience seeing art in a museum, the way that works of art move through the system, the way that they’re valued, the way that they change hands.\n \n\n   \n  “All of these concepts are things that artworks so rarely confront head on. His ability to do that and do it in such a legible way and impactful way is part of its success here.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/us/6-7-meme-slang-explained-cec","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"07:38:00-04:00","title":"The ‘6-7’ meme can be annoying.

But kids are shouting it for good reason \n       \n  By Scottie Andrew, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:38 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Not since 69 has a number caused this much disruption.\n \n\n   \n  “6-7,” pronounced “ six-seveeeeen ,” is haunting school halls across the country (including  South Park Elementary ), making it the Gen Alpha nonsense phrase of the moment. Kids are shouting it in classrooms when a teacher turns to page 67, when lunchtime is 6 to 7 minutes away or for no reason at all. It’s become  so  ubiquitous that Dictionary.com  named  it the word of the year.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s like a plague — a virus that has taken over these kids’ minds,” said Gabe Dannenbring, a seventh-grade science teacher in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. “You can’t say any iteration of the numbers 6 or 7 without having at least 15 kids yell, ‘6-7!’”\n \n\n   \n  It’s a joke without a punchline (or a setup, for that matter). 6-7 means nothing, but using it can make a student feel like a member of a bigger, cooler group of their peers.\n \n\n   \n  “It becomes a language game to them that, it would seem, only folks in their group know how to play,” said Gail Fairhurst, a University of Cincinnati professor who teaches leadership communication (and Gen Alpha speak).\n \n\n   \n   Skibidi toilets  and  rizzes  come and go. 6-7 is likely destined for the slang graveyard soon, now that adults are talking about it so much. But there’s something almost profound about its infinite interpretations, its refusal to be defined.\n \n\n   \n  “I think that’s part of what upsets people about it, and I think that’s part of what people like about it,” said Taylor Jones, a  linguist  and social scientist.\n \n\n   \n    An attempt at explaining 6-7 (but don’t worry, no one knows what it means)\n \n\n   \n  There may be no coherent explanation for 6-7, but here goes anyway: The number appears in the chorus of “Doot Doot (6 7),” a viral  song  by the Philadelphia rapper Skrilla. (In Skrilla’s case, according to Jones, 6-7 is likely a reference to the 10-67 police code, which is often used to report a death.)\n \n\n   \n  In December 2024, around the same time “Doot Doot” started taking off, high school basketball phenom Taylen Kinney appeared to create a gesture to accompany the phrase. In a  clip  shared by his Overtime Elite team, Kinney’s teammate asks him to rate a Starbucks drink out of 10.\n \n\n   \n  “Like a 6 … 6 … 6-7,” he says, adding an indecisive gesture, as though he were weighing two options in his palms.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly thereafter, Kinney started incorporating the song and gesture into his  TikToks , where he has over 1 million followers.\n \n\n   \n  The song started appearing in  sports highlight reels , including those for Charlotte Hornets point guard LaMelo Ball. (He stands at  6 feet, 7 inches , natch.) Ball  doesn’t seem annoyed  by the memes yet, but the NBA season hasn’t officially started, so there’s still time.\n \n\n   \n  A face of 6-7 emerged in March, when a  video  caught a young, overexcited spectator at an amateur basketball game shouting “6-7!” with the accompanying hand gesture. He became the embodiment of that annoying classmate who can’t stop spouting nonsense phrases. Somehow, the internet decided this stereotype’s name was Mason — and thus, Mason 67 has become another inside joke. (This “Mason” character has since become an icon of online analog horror,  per  Know Your Meme, but that’s another story.)\n \n\n   \n  So, if a kid uses any of the above explanations when you ask what the heck 6-7 is, they’re probably right. But most kids don’t even know where it came from, Dannenbring said.\n \n\n   \n  “Nobody knows what it means,” he said. “And that’s kind of the funny thing about it.”\n \n\n   \n  Its meaninglessness is partly due to what Jones calls “semantic bleaching,” where a phrase is divorced from its original context and comes to mean something entirely different (or, in this case, nothing).\n \n\n   \n  Using 6-7 comes down to a willingness to have fun, Jones said: “Do you have a little bit of whimsy? Or are you a party pooper?”\n \n\n   \n    Kids scream ‘6-7’ to belong (and that’s cool)\n \n\n   \n  Sure, it’s nonsense, but 6-7 serves a critical social function. It’s a shibboleth, or a phrase that signifies that one belongs to an “in” group, Jones said. People who don’t say it or get it are on the outs. And what kid doesn’t want to belong?\n \n\n   \n  “Language is a way for people to form community,” said Fairhurst. “Even if it’s a nonsense term, if they seem to know what it means, that can be a unifying force. And if somebody isn’t understanding the term, it can exclude people from that community, as well.”\n \n\n   \n  6-7 has also survived longer than other internet nonsense words — even that pesky “skibidi” — likely because “grown-ups are so angry about it,” Jones said.\n \n\n   \n  “The fact that you can get a big reaction from somebody for something just totally meaningless — that might give it longer longevity than it might otherwise have,” Jones said.\n \n\n   \n  Fed-up teachers are banning it from their classrooms or making exasperated TikToks about the number of times they’ve heard it in a single school day (for Dannenbring, the  record is 75 ). Shouting “6-7!” after it’s forbidden becomes a “way to show resistance,” said Fairhurst.\n \n\n   \n  Teachers are now playing defense by using 6-7 themselves. A Michigan middle school choir teacher successfully staved away cries of “6-7” by  incorporating  it into a warmup song that also includes “slay,” “Ohio” and “ rizz .”\n \n\n   \n  “Don’t scream at me … even though you get excited,” the teacher begs her class before they begin chanting “6-7, 6-7, 6-7, skibidi,” a chorus of little cringe cherubs.\n \n\n   \n  When instructing his students to open their textbooks to page 67, Dannenbring will suddenly adopt the timbre of his enthusiastic seventh graders, who immediately protest their teacher using a phrase that does not belong to him. (At 27, Dannenbring is an elder member of Gen Z. But a young teacher is still a teacher, and, therefore, too old to play.)\n \n\n   \n  “If you don’t play into it, yeah, it’s super disruptive,” Dannenbring said. “If you acknowledge it, then it gets over with in about 15 seconds.”\n \n\n   \n  And if  that  doesn’t shut down the conversation, he said he uses it incorrectly on purpose: “‘That’s so 6-7 of you.’”\n \n\n   \n  “The easiest way to kill it is for teachers to say that it’s cool,” Jones said.\n \n\n   \n  Comedian Josh Pray has started using it in front of his kids, working it into his  videos , desperate to reclaim a formerly innocuous number.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m trying to take our numbers back!” he said. “I’ll be 67 before they know it, and I don’t want to hear that specific tone all around me as a taunt to my age!”\n \n\n   \n    Maybe ‘6-7’ isn’t brainrot after all (you were a dumb kid, too)\n \n\n   \n  Fear not, parents — incessantly screaming “6-7!” is not enough to prove that your children are “ brainrotting .” Concerns about literacy falling and critical thinking skills diminishing are legitimate, but they’re being “projected onto normal, youthful behavior,” Jones said.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re rewriting our own history,” Jones said. “This is not anywhere near being a new phenomenon.”\n \n\n   \n  Every generation invents its own slang, and language evolves in ways most of us will never consciously perceive, Jones said. Kids will always come up with cool new phrases (like  “cool”! ), and adults will be left scratching their heads in confusion.\n \n\n   \n  Nonsense phrases like this aren’t inherently harmful, and 6-7 certainly isn’t going to bring about the end of the English language, Fairhurst said. But its popularity  could  be a benign symptom of our “post-truth” society, she said, where the meaning and specificity of communication matters less than people’s interpretation of it.\n \n\n   \n  “It seems like it’s sort of a relative of that kind of phenomenon, where we’re just using language to use language, and not because we see something particularly meaningful or particularly real about it,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps 6-7 is already on its way out — it’s survived for nearly a year, essentially a century in TikTok time. Some of Dannenbring’s students are starting to roll their eyes when they hear their classmates yelling it. Middle school teacher and comedian Philip Lindsay said he’s already hearing potential replacements in his classroom — “41,” for one, another similarly meaningless number that makes kids inexplicably giggle.\n \n\n   \n  “41 was started to try and dethrone 6-7,” Lindsay said. “6-7 just happened. 41 was pushed.”\n \n\n   \n  The way Dannenbring sees it, slang can get a lot worse than 6-7. Past trends have inspired students to stick pencils into their school-issued laptops to set them on fire or rip sinks straight off the walls of their school bathrooms.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve had those words before, like Skibidi toilet,” he said. “This one is  significantly  less annoying.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/trump-nuclear-weapons-testing-experts-russia","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-04:00","title":"Trump says he wants to resume nuclear testing.

testing. Here’s why experts are confused \n       \n  By Tom Foreman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A ghost of the Cold War is rising between the world’s superpowers, just in time for Halloween.\n \n\n   \n  In the wake of Russian President Vladimir Putin bragging about his country testing both a nuclear-powered torpedo and a new cruise missile, the president of the United States, Donald Trump, has fired back. In a lengthy post on his  Truth Social platform , Trump announced, “Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis. That process will begin immediately.”\n \n\n   \n  Now ,  nuclear watchdogs worldwide are wondering  what might come of Trump’s pronouncement  — and what he even means since the US hasn’t conducted a nuclear weapons test in decades.\n \n\n   \n  “First of all, every statement in that post is wrong,” said Matthew Bunn, a nuclear weapons expert at Harvard University. “It’s not true the United States has the world’s most nuclear weapons. It’s not true that other states are carrying out nuclear tests. (Trump) seems to think it’s the Department of Defense that carries out nuclear tests. It’s not. It’s the Department of Energy.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s own nominee to head the US Strategic Command seemed unclear of the president’s intent as he faced the Senate Armed Service Committee in a confirmation hearing Thursday. “Neither China nor Russia has conducted a nuclear explosive test,” Navy Vice Adm. Richard Correll said, “so I’m not reading anything into it or reading anything out.”\n \n\n   \n  The Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation defines nuclear tests as “generally controlled explosions of nuclear devise, such as bombs or warheads,” and Russia’s missile and torpedo tests do not meet that strict definition. \n \n\n   \n  What’s more, Jon Wolfsthal, who advised both Joe Biden and Barack Obama on nuclear matters, notes other nations are already conducting similar tests – along with the US. “Russia, the United States, China are all investing tens of billions of dollars on new nuclear delivery platforms – missiles, bombers, submarines,” Wolfsthal said. “We have returned to the arms race dynamics of the Cold War where each side believes nuclear weapons are important.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, if Trump truly wants to resume nuclear weapons testing, analysts say the complications are deep and wide. For starters, almost every nuclear-capable country in the world has voluntarily agreed to avoid such tests for decades. Russia ran its last test in 1990, the US in 1992 and China in 1996. North Korea is the only nation to conduct nuclear blasts this century, and that has contributed to Pyongyang’s status as an international pariah.\n \n\n   \n  Beyond the diplomatic risk of standing up a fresh set of tests in the US, there are technical challenges. Federal studies have shown staging such a test safely would likely require several years of preparation, and even then, it might yield little useful information. The US routinely tests nuclear weapons components so thoroughly that America is widely seen as holding a treasure trove of nuclear knowledge unmatched by any other country.\n \n\n   \n  Critics say if Trump ushers in a new era of testing, that will only open the door for any other nation with nuclear dreams to start catching up.\n \n\n   \n  “The country that would benefit the most would be China,” Bunn said.\n \n\n   \n  “It makes no sense from a strategic point of view for the United States,” said former Democratic congressman John Tierney, who now heads the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation.\n \n\n   \n  Nuclear weapons experts note that both Russia and China have stepped up their nuclear aspirations already. Some political analysts speculate that Trump is hoping to back them down with tough talk, a notion he seems to echo. “I’d like to see a denuclearization,” the president said. “We’re actually talking to Russia about that, and China would be added to that if we do something.”\n \n\n   \n  Neither the Defense Department nor the White House has offered a more complete explanation of the plan as of yet.\n \n\n   \n  But Tierney finds the president’s constantly shifting talk troublesome, to say the least. He fears in an already tense international environment, Trump is injecting more instability – which can prove explosive in its own way.\n \n\n   \n  “One day he wants everyone to get rid of their nukes,” Tierney says. “The next day he wants to start testing? It’s dangerous.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/entertainment/antoni-porowski-sexual-health","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"06:00:00-04:00","title":"Antoni Porowski Says Conversations Around Sexual Health Don’t Have to Be Awkward","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Antoni Porowski, best known as a member of the 'Queer Eye' team, shares his personal journey of early exposure to sexual health topics through his medically literate family, particularly his physician father.

says that conversations around sexual health don’t have to be awkward \n       \n  By Dan Heching, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:00 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Many years before he became the resident foodie and one fifth of the makeover dream team on “ Queer Eye ,” Antoni Porowski already had no problem having important and frank conversations.\n \n\n   \n  “I learned about STIs probably before I hit puberty,” he told CNN in a recent interview.\n \n\n   \n  When Porowski later called out his physician father   for broaching the subject of sexually transmitted infections when he was quite young, his dad’s response was, “Well you know what, you had to know and you were going to find out at some point anyway.”\n \n\n   \n  Porowski – whose mother, sister and grandfather also have medical backgrounds – grew up around science and having conversations about health, sexual and otherwise, and he says he feels privileged to have had that access to helpful information early on. It’s one of the reasons he’s partnering with pharmaceutical company Gilead to promote HIV prevention and having open discussions about sexual health.\n \n\n   \n  “The more you talk about it, anything that’s uncomfortable, the less precious it becomes. It loses its power,” Porowski said.\n \n\n   \n  Porowski’s involvement in the  campaign  comes at a time of  unprecedented  cutbacks on DEI programs, which among many other things contain efforts designed to help people realize and achieve sexual wellness through access to pre-exposure prophylaxis (or PrEP, drugs that prevents HIV infections, which are produced by companies including Gilead) and other information. Analysis of federal data by the  New York Times  in May found that Donald Trump’s administration had scrapped more than $800 million worth of research into the health of LGBTQ+ people.\n \n\n   \n  “With all of these unfortunate initiatives, I think it pushes us more towards stigmatization, because it helps fuel the taboo and negative understandings and perceptions of a lot of things,” Porowski said.\n \n\n   \n  “Often as we’re seeing in culture right now and in politics, the things that a lot of certain people are afraid of, they end up turning (it) into anger, and it then flips to taking away or minimizing rights because they just don’t get it,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  For Porwoski, the current political landscape and its challenges present an opportunity to “keep talking about this even more than we did.”\n \n\n   \n  “Because as much progress as we’ve made – progress isn’t linear, as I’m learning with a lot of things, especially politically,” he said. “The key for anything that is misunderstood or misperceived, I think it’s an opportunity to have a conversation about it.”\n \n\n   \n  Part of his understanding comes from his involvement on “ Queer Eye ,” which will soon premiere its tenth and final season. The show has long focused on the ongoing conversations between queer and non-queer people, and their efforts to understand one another.\n \n\n   \n  “People who we’ve met on the show who definitely leaned more on the conservative side knew us as concepts, before meeting us,” he said. “They have their ideas of what it’s like to be queer and that was it.”\n \n\n   \n  The way past that, he said, was to help them “realize that we’re someone’s kid.”\n \n\n   \n  To “get to know the person as an individual and not a concept” is “a good blanket statement for any type of intolerance or lack of embracing of diversity in our culture,” Porowski said.\n \n\n   \n  Making connections and having meaningful conversations is ultimately what Porowski comes back to, for both learning the value of tolerance and arming oneself with information for better health by having those meaningful conversations with a doctor.\n \n\n   \n  “Talk to a physician, ask the questions, that’s literally what they’re there for,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Porowski says that while he had the “great gift of being raised around science and trusting it,” he knows there are others who weren’t and don’t.\n \n\n   \n  He urges those people “who sit on the other end of the spectrum, of not trusting it” to “just shut up and put your curiosity hat on and ask questions.”\n \n\n   \n  “Ask things that you’re genuinely curious about, so that you can educate yourself,” he said. “I think we all have a responsibility to educate ourselves.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/poll-closing-times-election-results","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"06:10:00-04:00","title":"When polls close in Tuesday’s elections and when to expect results","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article outlines the timing of vote reporting in four key U.S. state races on Tuesday, October 31, 2025: Virginia (7 PM), New Jersey (8 PM), New York City (9 PM), and California (11 PM).

to lead Ravens to big win over Dolphins \n       \n  By Ben Morse, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:57 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Lamar Jackson made an emphatic return to  NFL  action on Thursday Night Football, throwing four touchdown passes to lead his Baltimore Ravens to a 28-6 win over the Miami Dolphins.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson had missed the past three Ravens games with a hamstring injury, with Baltimore struggling in his absence.\n \n\n   \n  But with the two-time NFL MVP back in the lineup, the Ravens looked much more like themselves, piling up 338 yards of offense, 229 coming in the second half.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson connected on touchdown passes to Rashod Bateman, Charlie Kolar and twice to Mark Andrews.\n \n\n   \n  And while he didn’t look as explosive when he chose to run the ball, the 28-year-old’s return seemed to open up the running game in general, with the team racking up 150 yards on the ground, including 119 for Derrick Henry on 19 carries.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s awesome,” Jackson afterwards. “It’s great to be back and get a dub.”\n \n\n   \n  It was the Dolphins, coming off a big win last week against the Atlanta Falcons, who took the lead in the first quarter with a field goal before Jackson capitalized on a fumble by Tahj Washington, connecting with Andrews for their first touchdown of the game.\n \n\n   \n  Baltimore extended its lead in the second quarter with Andrews’ second touchdown reception of the game, capping off an eight-play, 75-yard scoring drive.\n \n\n   \n  A Miami field goal just before halftime did reduce the deficit but the Dolphins failed to make any further inroads on offense after halftime, with Baltimore adding 14 points in the third quarter to ease to victory.\n \n\n   \n  “I just felt a little comfortable and our guys were ready to score,” Jackson – who finished with 204 yards on 18-of-23 passing – said. “Shoutout to the offensive line. They did great.\n \n\n   \n  “All phases, all skill positions, and our running backs, those guys were just locked in and wanted to put points on the board because we only scored twice in the first half.”\n \n\n   \n  In what was Jackson’s first action since September 28, he continued his excellent record against the Dolphins. The Florida native now has 1,405 passing yards, 18 passing touchdowns, one interception and a 142.9 passer rating in five starts against Miami, the highest by any single player (minimum 100 attempts) vs. a single opponent in history,  per NFL Research .\n \n\n   \n  His return to the field is timely for Baltimore which has now won two in a row to keep its season alive, improving to 3-5 on the year.\n \n\n   \n  The Ravens still face an uphill battle to make it to the postseason, but with Jackson back at the helm, that journey seems a little easier.\n \n\n   \n   According to the NFL , only four teams since the 1970 merger have made the playoffs after starting a season 1-5. But, since 1990, 21 teams have made the postseason with a 3-5 opening.\n \n\n   \n  For the Dolphins, it was another crushing defeat as they slip to 2-7 and the pressure ramps back up on head coach Mike McDaniel after their big win over Atlanta last time out.\n \n\n   \n  Like many of their games this season, the loss to the Ravens was punctuated by self-inflicted errors – Washington’s first-quarter fumble gave excellent field position to Baltimore, a false start by Larry Borom on fourth-and-1 ended a promising drive, Riley Patterson missed a close field goal and Malik Washington also fumbled in the fourth quarter.\n \n\n   \n  Miami produced its best performance of the season in Week 8 against the Falcons but Thursday’s outing will do nothing to quiet the talk around McDaniel’s future.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/americas/jamaica-hurricane-melissa-black-river-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"05:35:00-04:00","title":"'Hell on Earth': Ravaged by Hurricane Melissa, this once-vibrant Jamaican town is now in desperate need of help","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following Hurricane Melissa in October 2025, the once-vibrant coastal town of Black River, Jamaica, has been reduced to rubble, with a storm surge of up to 16 feet flooding the area and killing at least two people.

A storm surge of up to 16 feet flooded parts of the community as the hurricane barreled through. At least two people died here – their bodies discovered floating in the water after the storm had cleared, St. Elizabeth Police Superintendent Coleridge Minto said Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Across the Caribbean, at least 49 people are known to have died, Reuters reported, though the full toll of the catastrophic storm may take days or weeks to be determined.\n \n\n   \n  In Black river, hundreds of survivors are now walking through the streets in shock, trying to process the harrowing situation they face.\n \n\n   \n  Many have lost their homes and are wondering where they will go for shelter.\n \n\n   \n  “We live in a board house.

This delayed the authorities’ ability to deliver much-needed aid.\n \n\n   \n  Dozens of residents were seen clearing out the shelves of a damaged supermarket out of desperation, taking basic needs such as food and water.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s no looting,” a resident said to CNN. “This is trying to survive. It’s a survival thing right now.” He said the police were also at the scene – not to deter them but to help.\n \n\n   \n  Getting aid from the outside has been a challenge as many roads remain blocked by debris, downed trees and floodwaters.\n \n\n   \n  Emergency crews and defense forces are gradually arriving to help where they can.

Designed by Pritzker Prize–winning architect  Renzo Piano , the flat-roofed, single-story gallery in Riehen is gently nestled among centuries-old trees and mossy lily ponds, surrounded by green fields and vineyards, at the edge of Germany’s Black Forest.\n \n\n   \n  Since opening nearly 30 years ago, the Fondation Beyeler has hosted many site-specific artworks that engaged directly with its natural environment. In 1998, the late artist  Christo  wrapped 178 trees on the property in fabric, and, more recently,  Olafur Eliasson  removed part of the building’s facade to effectively bring one of the outdoor ponds into the gallery itself. The Icelandic artist used a non-toxic dye to give the water a neon glow, describing the work as a “model for a future landscape where human and non-humans can live together” more harmoniously.\n \n\n   \n  This week, the institution is announcing a groundbreaking new role. In what is believed to be the first of its kind at a major art museum, the Fondation Beyeler has appointed Swiss academic Rahel Kesselring as its inaugural botanical curator. Her role will focus on the preservation of the site’s flora and fauna and on developing public programming within its gardens.\n \n\n   \n  The position — officially, the Chanel botanical curator — is supported by the Chanel Culture Fund, a philanthropic arm of the French luxury house that backs innovative cultural projects and initiatives around the world.\n \n\n   \n  Kesselring explained that her mission is to strengthen the dialogue between art and nature. “Plants are enormously important for our culture,” she said in a video interview. “They sustain us…we live in a world that has been fully built by plants. We have a deep connection to them, physically, culturally and historically.”\n \n\n   \n  Museum director Sam Keller called the appointment a reflection of the institution’s ethos. “Nature is not a backdrop to our work, but a living part of it,” he said in a statement. “This role affirms our commitment to caring for the whole ecology of this place with the same depth, imagination and responsibility we bring to everything we do.”\n \n\n   \n  Kesselring’s appointment  presents a new model for arts institutions — expanding the idea of curatorial expertise beyond the white walls of a gallery and into the living landscape.\n \n\n   \n  With the symptoms of climate crisis increasingly felt by people and businesses, including those within the art world, the Fondation Beyeler is making a statement by putting ecological stewardship on par with artistic curation. Kesselring hopes it will inspire broader change or, at least, more public engagement. “We need to rewrite our understanding of our relationship with nature,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Yana Peel, the president of arts, culture and heritage at Chanel, said during a video call that with no brick-and-mortar cultural institutions of its own (as is common for many luxury brands), the company has focused on contributing to others — seeking out ways to create impact on a project-by-project basis.\n \n\n   \n  “We have specifically not been sponsoring galas or parties or short-term projects,” she said, explaining that they want to focus on “transformational” work that is entirely non-transactional and not aimed at selling Chanel products. The initiative is about “wanting to have a positive impact on the world,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Chanel did not confirm how long it would be funding Kesselring’s role at the foundation but it’s understood to be a multi-year partnership, in keeping with the fund’s wider mission to focus on longer-term projects.\n \n\n   \n  Established five years ago, the Chanel Culture Fund has invested in 50 projects across 15 countries. Chanel is working with the Power Station of Art in Shanghai to support a significant renovation of the institution’s third-floor gallery, including the addition of the first contemporary art library in China, with the capacity to house 50,000 books. In Brazil, the fund partnered with the Pinacoteca de São Paulo on a new annual residency program to support women artists. And in the US, the organization is funding the Chanel Center for Artists and Technology at CalArts in Southern California.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/world/sudan-massacres-rsf-rebels-darfur-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"06:06:00Z","title":"Rebels Accused of Massacring Hundreds in Sudanese City as Videos and Satellite Evidence Emerge","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In October 2025, videos and satellite imagery have revealed widespread atrocities in El Fasher, Sudan, where the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) are accused of mass killings, including at the Saudi Hospital and El Fasher University’s medical school.

Sudanese city \n       \n  By Ivana Kottasová, Vasco Cotovio, Nada Bashir, Gianluca Mezzofiore, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:26 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  An elderly man sits on the floor, dozens of bodies lying around him, before a Sudanese rebel fighter approaches and shoots him.\n \n\n   \n  The apparent killing – captured on video shared online by the rebels themselves – took place at a university medical school in El Fasher in Sudan’s western Darfur region after the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF)  took over the city  on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has identified the location of the massacre as El Fasher University’s School of Medical Laboratory Science, just across the street from the Saudi Hospital where, according to reports cited by the World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday, more than 460 people were also killed.\n \n\n   \n  The Sudan Doctors Network, a professional organization, said the RSF “cold-bloodedly killed everyone they found inside the Saudi Hospital, including patients, their companions, and anyone else present in the wards.”\n \n\n   \n  Satellite images of the Saudi Hospital show signs of a massacre, with apparent clusters of bodies and blood-stained ground clearly visible.\n \n\n   \n  Reports of RSF fighters committing large-scale massacres began to emerge within hours of the Sudanese military’s  withdrawal from El Fasher  earlier this week.\n \n\n   \n  Those accounts have been corroborated by mounting evidence that includes videos and photos from the ground, survivor testimonies and satellite images.\n \n\n   \n  RSF chief Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, also known as Hemedti, acknowledged Wednesday that there had been “violations” in El Fasher, and said an investigative committee would be launched to investigate and “hold accountable any soldier or any officer who committed a crime.”\n \n\n   \n  In a separate statement, the RSF denied claims of killings at the hospital, describing them as “fabricated narratives with no connection to reality,” despite mounting evidence of atrocities.\n \n\n   \n  The grisly events in El Fasher come over two and a half years into a brutal civil war that has claimed the lives of more than 150,000 people.\n \n\n   \n  On one side is Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the country’s military ruler and the head of the Sudanese armed forces (SAF); on the other is Hemedti, the RSF chief and onetime al-Burhan deputy. The two men launched a coup together in 2021 before a power struggle between them descended into all-out war in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  The United Nations and the United States have both said the RSF and the SAF have committed war crimes and have faced western sanctions.\n \n\n   \n  The UN told CNN it believes about 120,000 people, half of them children, were trapped in El Fasher, which was the Sudanese army’s last stronghold in Darfur and had been under siege by the RSF for 18 months.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, then US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, during the Biden administration,  accused the RSF of committing genocide  against non-Arab ethnic groups in Darfur, saying there was evidence the group systematically murdered “men and boys – even infants – on an ethnic basis” and that it “deliberately targeted women and girls from certain ethnic groups for rape and other forms of brutal sexual violence.”\n \n\n   \n  Few eyewitness testimonies have emerged from El Fasher since its fall to the RSF. But humanitarian workers who’ve spoken to survivors fleeing the city related stories of summary executions and rapes, streets strewn with bodies and men and boys being prevented from leaving.\n \n\n   \n  Multiple videos shared online over the past three days show RSF fighters rounding up and killing large numbers of unarmed people. CNN was able to match the insignia worn by the fighters in several of the videos to the one used by the RSF.\n \n\n   \n  Most of the videos appear to have been filmed and shared by the rebels themselves.\n \n\n   \n  One video shows an unarmed man in civilian clothes on the ground, pleading for his life before a man addressed as commander.\n \n\n   \n  The fighter is seen shooting him multiple times. Dozens more bodies are clearly visible in the video.\n \n\n   \n  Another video shows at least eight men dressed in civilian clothes sitting on the ground next to each other before being killed in a quick succession.\n \n\n   \n  Several videos show executions and RSF fighters celebrating next to bodies by a berm, a raised bank of earth that was built around El Fasher during the siege to trap people inside the city.\n \n\n   \n  Other videos show armed RSF fighters driving through large swaths of land, apparently hunting civilians who are attempting to flee. In one video, the rebels are heard saying “catch the girls.”\n \n\n   \n  Conflict-related sexual violence has been reported by human rights groups as a major problem in Sudan and multiple humanitarian workers have told CNN that women and girls who have managed to escape El Fasher in recent days were victims of sexual violence and rape.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has geolocated several of the videos showing jubilant RSF forces inside El Fasher. Satellite images analyzed by the Humanitarian Research Lab at Yale School of Public Health and verified by CNN show clear evidence of the atrocities in El Fasher.\n \n\n   \n  Groups of bodies appear to be visible in satellite images of areas where RSF killings have been reported in recent days.\n \n\n   \n  The Yale researchers also say they have identified reddish patches on the ground consistent with blood in several locations, including outside the Saudi Hospital and near the berm around the city.\n \n\n   \n  The bodies and the reddish stains are only visible in the satellite images taken on Monday and Tuesday, after the RSF takeover.\n \n\n   \n  “The Rapid Support Forces have surrounded this city in an earth wall called a berm that’s as high as nine feet,” said Nathaniel Raymond, executive director of the Research Lab.\n \n\n   \n  “So the context here is these people are inside what we call a Kill Box. They have been walled in to be killed systematically, and right now the Rapid Support Forces are doing that,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Survivors fleeing the violence have told aid groups of summary executions and mass killings.\n \n\n   \n  Adam Rojal, the spokesperson for the General Coordination for Displaced Persons and Refugees in Darfur, told CNN he left the besieged city two weeks ago. He said that civilians are currently not allowed to leave and that the situation is “appalling.”\n \n\n   \n  “(People who fled) tell horrific stories about the suffering and abuses they have subjected to. The property of citizens has been confiscated, there are floggings, and attacks. I have seen the execution videos,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Manal bint Abi Suleiman, who fled El Fasher after the RSF takeover, said the attack on the area where she was sheltering started on Saturday. “The Rapid Support Forces entered and destroyed everything in front of them,” she said in a video testimony filmed by a volunteer helping refugees.\n \n\n   \n  “On the way, they harassed the people and beat some of them. They separated the young men from the women, and I don’t know where they took the men. God knows where they are now,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  In videos shared online, several other survivors have also referenced killings of both men and women and bodies lying in the streets.\n \n\n   \n  Save the Children’s deputy country director for Sudan, Francesco Lanino, told CNN that survivors who reached a refugee camp in Tawila in southern Darfur described the extreme danger they faced as they fled.\n \n\n   \n  “All the areas surrounding El Fasher are controlled by different militias, or different armed groups that are related to RSF or somehow part of RSF,” Lanino said.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not only RSF who are looking for civilians, looking for people to (rob), to abuse or kill,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The RSF has been supported by Arab groups and militias from across the Sahel region as well as the  Russian paramilitary group Wagner .\n \n\n   \n  The Sudanese government has also accused the United Arab Emirates of arming the group. The UAE has repeatedly denied the accusation, despite an expert panel appointed by the UN Security Council finding in a January 2024 report that the allegations were “credible.”\n \n\n   \n    Fears for the missing men\n \n\n   \n  The UN’s humanitarian team in Sudan said on Tuesday it has received “credible reports of widespread violations, including summary executions, attacks on civilians along escape routes, house-to-house raids and obstacles preventing civilians from reaching safety,” adding that “sexual violence, particularly against women and girls, continues to be reported.”\n \n\n   \n  Arjan Hehenkamp, the Darfur crisis lead for the International Rescue Committee, told CNN that many of the people fleeing El Fasher are in a “deplorable state.”\n \n\n   \n  “Many of them are sick and wounded… there’s many women, many elderly, but a big gap in terms of young men and adult men,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Hehenkamp spent several weeks at Tawila, providing help to people fleeing.\n \n\n   \n  “The big concern that we have right now is, where is the rest of the population of El Fasher? We haven’t seen the big numbers that we were expecting so far. So that is very disturbing,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Lanino told CNN that some 5,000 people managed to reach his team in Tawila in recent days.\n \n\n   \n  “The majority of these people coming from El Fasher are women and children. And according to their stories, the men are kidnapped or were killed on the way coming to Tawila because of their ethnic group, because they were men, and they were somehow stopped and targeted,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Sheldon Yett, UNICEF’s lead in Sudan, told CNN that violence has soared in the days following the RSF’s takeover.\n \n\n   \n  He said he’d spoken to women who fled El Fasher who said their male relatives were all either killed or detained by RSF.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking to CNN from the eastern city of Port Sudan after returning from an area near Darfur where people are seeking safety, Yett said the stories shared by survivors were “blood-curdling.” There were groups of women arriving alone, saying their male relatives have been killed or detained, he added.\n \n\n   \n  “(Fighters are) going house to house, raids, people being dragged out, just the most horrific stories. People are being held (to) ransom. They’re being told, basically, you pay or you die, call your relatives, get the money together,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The Sudan Doctors Network said that six medical staff, including four doctors, a pharmacist and a nurse, have been kidnapped by RSF fighters who are now demanding 100 million Sudanese pounds ($166,000) for each of them.\n \n\n   \n  The group has appealed to international organizations, including WHO, to intervene and “exert maximum pressure on RSF to release” the abductees.\n \n\n   \n  As more reports of alleged atrocities pour in, multiple international organizations, world leaders and human rights groups have called for an immediate ceasefire and quick independent investigations into the killings.\n \n\n   \n  Yett said that the fact that the fighters are filming themselves killing civilians and posting these videos online shows “a feeling of lack of accountability.”\n \n\n   \n  “We need to ensure there’s clear accountabilities here. I mean all violations of international law need to be investigated. We need to hold people accountable,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/business/k-shaped-economy","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00+00:00","title":"This burrito is everything you need to know about America’s economy","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. economy is experiencing a 'K-shaped' divergence, where wealthier consumers continue to spend freely due to strong stock market performance, home appreciation, and job security, while lower-income consumers—especially those earning under $100,000 annually and young workers aged 25–34—are cutting back on spending, skipping premium items like guac at Chipotle, and shifting to cheaper food and products.

People in households that bring in less than $100,000 a year drive about 40% of Chipotle’s sales.\n \n\n   \n  Another problem: 25- to 34-year-olds, who make up 25% of Chipotle’s sales, “pulled back meaningfully.”\n \n\n   \n  “I think there’s a component of a more discerning consumer, and I think most of it – the majority of it – is this massive pullback,” Boatwright said. “That household under $100,000 a year is pulling back.”\n \n\n   \n  At the same time, some consumers are spending like they’re from a completely different universe.\n \n\n   \n  Crocs CEO Andrew Rees noted that bifurcation on a call with analysts Thursday: “There is a portion of our North American consumers that are highly affluent. They’re buying Crocs, they’re buying other high-end brands and they are in great financial shape,” Rees said. “But there is a large portion of consumers who are nervous, they are in less-good financial shape and are being super cautious about their spending and certainly spending closer to need.”\n \n\n   \n  Or take Coke (to wash down your burrito). Coca-Cola’s Chief Operating Officer Henrique Braun on a call last week with analysts said Coke’s earnings were boosted by strong demand for the company’s premium brands: Topo Chico, Smartwater and Fairlife.\n \n\n   \n  But Braun highlighted a successful two-pronged corporate strategy, noting the tough environment for lower-income consumers hasn’t changed – despite the growth in its high-end brands. That’s why Coke is also cutting sizes (and prices) on the lower end to drive sales – to “really tackle not only affordability but premiumization as well,” Braun said.\n \n\n   \n  “When we look from a consumer point of view, we continue to see divergency in spending between the income groups,” Braun said. “The pressure on middle- and low-end income consumers is still there.”\n \n\n   \n    The ‘K-shaped’ economy\n \n\n   \n  Economists call that phenomenon a “ K-shaped ” economy: Wealthier people are spending like nothing’s wrong. Lower-income people are making significant changes to preserve their finances.\n \n\n   \n  Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell  addressed that concept  Wednesday in a media briefing.\n \n\n   \n  “On the K-shaped economy … if you listen to the earnings calls or the reports of big public consumer-facing companies, many, many of them are saying there is a bifurcated economy there and that consumers at the lower end are struggling and buying less and shifting to lower-cost products,” Powell said. “But at the top, people are spending, at the higher income and wealth.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s not all anecdotal: Last month, Moody’s Analytics reported that the country’s top earners  are accounting for a growing share of overall spending .\n \n\n   \n  What’s causing that divide?\n \n\n   \n  Wealthier Americans are generally invested in the surging stock market, which has gained 17% this year. They have more job security than lower-income workers. And they own homes, which  keep appreciating  in the tight-supply market.\n \n\n   \n  By contrast, less-affluent Americans are living paycheck to paycheck, and their wages aren’t keeping up with inflation. If they lose their jobs, the cruddy labor market is preventing them from finding a new one – the number of Americans on unemployment insurance for multiple weeks recently surged to a  four-year high . And rents, until recently, had jumped as demand for rentals explodes – because so few homes have been on the market.\n \n\n   \n    What happens next?\n \n\n   \n  A K-shaped economy can be difficult to repair. America’s economy has been increasingly bifurcated for quite some time – with the exception of a few years following the pandemic.\n \n\n   \n  During those post-pandemic years, government support for workers gave lower-income Americans a leg up. For the first time in a generation, the wealth gap narrowed.  Wages outpaced inflation , especially for lower-income workers. Interest rates were low, and homeowners refinanced like crazy to lock in historically low mortgage costs.\n \n\n   \n  But it was short-lived. The sugar rush of government stimulus checks wore off, and the economy resumed its previous trajectory. Mortgage rates rose to multi-decade highs. And, concerning for people who are getting left behind, the US government began pushing safety-net programs in the opposite direction, reducing benefits and increasing hurdles to access support.\n \n\n   \n  Those actions could widen that “K” in the future. Wider than you have to open your mouth to eat a Chipotle burrito.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/top-election-campaign-ads","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"The Top 10 Fall Campaign Ads of the 2025 Elections","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During the final weeks of the 2025 off-year election cycle, voters in key states such as California, Virginia, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania were flooded with targeted campaign ads.

\n        5:00 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Voters in Virginia, New Jersey, California and Pennsylvania have been inundated with campaign ads this year, with each state hosting critical off-year elections that offer a preview of the issues and arguments both parties are grappling with ahead of next year’s midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  Here are the ads getting the most spending during the critical final weeks of the off-year campaigns.\n \n\n   \n   (Note: Ads are ranked by committee spending between September 1 and October 27. CNN limited the list below to one advertisement per committee.) \n \n\n   \n    1. ‘Threatens,’ from opponents of California Democrats’ redistricting\n \n\n   \n  The top ad of the fall campaign season comes from the leading group opposing California Democrats’ redistricting push, “No on Prop 50: Stop Sacramento’s Power Grab.” Funded largely by Charles Munger Jr.,  a longtime supporter  of nonpartisan redistricting and heir of legendary investor Charles Munger, the group’s ad urges Californians to “protect your vote and democracy” and “vote No on Prop 50.” About $5 million has been spent on the ad so far, according to media tracking firm AdImpact. Opponents of the redistricting push have been splintered and  many are increasingly pessimistic  about Tuesday’s election.\n \n\n   \n    2. ‘Texts’ from Jason Miyares, Virginia’s Republican attorney general\n \n\n   \n   Violent text messages  sent by Jay Jones, the Democratic nominee for attorney general in Virginia, emerged as a lightning rod in Virginia’s off- campaigns, as Republicans have leaned into sharp criticism of Jones and linked him to other Democrats. “Can you trust Jay Jones to protect your children?” asks one ad from incumbent Attorney General Jason Miyares, Jones’ Republican opponent.\n \n\n   \n    3. ‘Obama,’ from Gavin Newsom’s allied group for California redistricting\n \n\n   \n  Newsom, who has  staked significant political capital  on his state’s redistricting fight,  called in the 44th president  to help. “California, the whole nation is counting on you,” Barack Obama says in the ad.\n \n\n   \n    4. ‘Stick it to Trump,’ from Tom Steyer, backing California Democrats\n \n\n   \n  Financier Tom Steyer, a liberal mega-donor  who ran for president in 2020  and is eyeing California’s 2026 governor race,  waded into his state’s redistricting fight  earlier this month with a $12 million ad buy.  “You want to stick it to Trump? Vote yes on Prop 50,” one of his ads says. Steyer gave a boost to Democrats’ messaging campaign while also raising his profile ahead of a potential statewide run next year.\n \n\n   \n    5. ‘Predators,’ from supporters of Mikie Sherrill, Democrat running for New Jersey governor\n \n\n   \n  Sherrill’s allies are running a spot accusing GOP nominee Jack Ciattarelli of “voting against legislation that would protect children and young adults in cases of domestic and sexual violence,” according to a review of his record while serving in the state assembly compiled by  the New Jersey Independent . The ad warns, “Jack Ciattarelli should never be governor of New Jersey.” Ciattarelli’s campaign did not respond to requests for comment on the ad.\n \n\n   \n    6. ‘Day One,’ from Sherrill’s gubernatorial campaign\n \n\n   \n  One of Sherrill’s top campaign ads highlights her pledge to declare a state of emergency on utility costs on day one. Energy bills have  been a top issue  for New Jersey voters this year, with spiking utility rates and soaring demand on an aging grid. In New Jersey, residential rates have climbed by up to 20%, and the tri-state Regional Plan Association  found  that “increased demand from data centers is attributed to about two-thirds of the increased prices.”\n \n\n   \n    7. ‘Same But Worse,’ from Sherrill opponents\n \n\n   \n  Republicans, too, have honed in on energy bills as a key issue in the New Jersey’s gubernatorial race. Ciattarelli has argued Sherrill would continue policies from the outgoing administration of Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy that he says contribute to the crunch. “More of the same, but worse,” Ciattarelli’s ad argues.\n \n\n   \n    8. ‘Protect Your Rights,’ from Democrats in Pennsylvania’s state supreme court vote\n \n\n   \n  It’s been 20 years since a Pennsylvania Supreme Court justice lost a retention election. This fall,  three of the state’s liberal justices  are on the ballot. and Republicans are pressing for the chance to potentially flip the ideological balance of the battleground state high court. An ad from a Democratic group supporting the justices links the retention elections to abortion, saying the state Supreme Court is “our last line of defense.”\n \n\n   \n    9. ‘Speaking,’ from Abigail Spanberger, Democrat running for Virginia governor\n \n\n   \n  Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic nominee for governor of Virginia, has plastered voters’ screens with versions of an attack ad seizing on an unflattering moment from her rival, GOP nominee Winsome Earle-Sears. The ad splices clips of Earle-Sears declaring to a booing crowd, “I am speaking,” with criticism of Republican policies. “Winsome Earle-Sears is so far right, she’s wrong for Virginia,” the ad closes, echoing a Spanberger campaign refrain. (Earle-Sears  recently aired an ad  nodding to the “I am speaking” moment in which she says to the camera, “They pick your worst day.”)\n \n\n   \n    10. ‘Extreme Silence,’ from Spanberger opponents\n \n\n   \n  Earle-Sears and her Republican allies in the Virginia governor race have made transgender policies a focal point of their attack ads, criticizing Spanberger over her support for the Equality Act and pressing her for answers on youth sports and school bathrooms. An ad from one of the groups, Restoration of America PAC, claims Spanberger “is as extreme as it gets.” Spanberger has argued local school districts should decide their own youth participation policies.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/china/xi-trump-us-china-deal-analysis-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"04:50:00-04:50","title":"After Trump Trade Meeting, It’s Advantage Xi","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following a brief but significant meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump at Gimhae International Airport in South Korea, China secured key concessions including a 10% reduction in tariffs, a pause on a sweeping U.S. tech export blacklist rule, and a commitment to buy 25 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans annually.

Analysis by Simone McCarthy, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:50 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As the dust begins to clear around a  less-than-two hour meeting  between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and President Donald Trump at an airbase in South Korea on Thursday, it’s clear that China’s leaders have stacked up another win for their hardball strategy with the United States.\n \n\n   \n  The meeting did not secure a broad trade deal, but rather a return to an uneasy truce built on a handful of agreements meant to keep the relationship steady as the two sides move toward one.\n \n\n   \n  Xi walked away with a 10% reduction in 30% tariffs newly imposed by Trump on Chinese goods this year – in exchange for   ramping up efforts to control its role in the US fentanyl crisis. He also secured US agreement to put on hold a new rule that would have vastly expanded the number of Chinese companies blacklisted from buying sensitive American tech.\n \n\n   \n  Trump averted Beijing imposing an expanded set of restrictions that could have hamstrung global industries reliant on China’s rare earths minerals. China will also ramp up purchases of US soybeans and other agricultural products, US officials said. Both sides also paused port fees targeting each other’s shipping sectors and will extend a truce on more elevated tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  On paper, it looks like a reasonable exchange – and one that delivers, at least for now, what both leaders (and the wider global economy) wanted: stability after a tumultuous year of sparring between the world’s economic heavyweights.\n \n\n   \n  But for Beijing, the agreements – which came with a side of effusive praise from Trump for Xi – are also a clear confirmation of the success of its strategy in how to handle Trump 2.0.\n \n\n   \n  That’s because Beijing has been able to win valuable concessions on tariffs and export controls, while primarily conceding measures they only put out as retaliation against those from the US in the first place.\n \n\n   \n  Take soybeans, a key American export that saw Chinese purchases plunge this year over trade frictions.\n \n\n   \n  China agreed to purchase a minimum of 25 million metric tons of American soybeans annually for the next three years, US agricultural secretary Brooke Rollins  said  after the talks.\n \n\n   \n  But that baseline is still 1.8 million metric tons less than China’s soybean purchases last year, before the tensions, according to  US data .\n \n\n   \n  China’s highly nationalistic and censor-curated internet clocked all this on Friday, when social media commenters praised how “China really nailed this tariff war,” and observed that “Trump finally dealt with the mess Trump created.”\n \n\n   \n    China’s game plan\n \n\n   \n  The outlook is not all rosy for China.\n \n\n   \n  Even as tariffs from this year’s US trade spat have been whittled down to 20%, Chinese exporters still face what on average amounts to nearly 50% duties on their goods, with pre-existing duties factored in. That rate remains among the highest imposed on any country by the US. Washington meanwhile has seen  real progress  on its goal to narrow their trade deficit.\n \n\n   \n  And, while the deal has yet to be inked, Beijing may have made some true concessions on the fate of the social media app TikTok, after changing its tune on staunch opposition to a US law requiring the app’s Chinese owner ByteDance to sell its US business.\n \n\n   \n  China also remains blocked from accessing the highest-end US chips, a key weapon in the high-stakes AI race playing out between the two countries.\n \n\n   \n  But on the tech front, Beijing’s ability to push back by at least a year the new US rule which would have vastly expanded the number of Chinese companies blacklisted from buying sensitive American technologies, is a major boon for Chinese firms.\n \n\n   \n  The now-suspended US effort to close loopholes could have ensnared some 20,000 more companies than are already on the list, according to  an analysis  by business intelligence firm WireScreen.\n \n\n   \n  That’s another win for Beijing’s strategy of using its near-total grip on the global rare earths supply chain as leverage against the US – a tactic it also deployed during a tariff escalation earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  And on China’s side, agreeing to defer for at least a year its expanded export control regime on rare earth minerals, which it announced as retaliation for the US blacklist expansion, is unlikely to be seen as a major setback in Beijing.\n \n\n   \n  As one Chinese scholar, foreign policy analyst Shen Dingli, told CNN earlier this month, those measures were a “nuclear” option that Beijing knew wasn’t symmetrical – “but if China doesn’t use this weapon, China has little left to bargain with.”\n \n\n   \n  Whether Xi and Trump can manage to keep the detente as they work toward a broader deal and expected visits to each other’s countries in 2026 is the next big question.\n \n\n   \n  Canada, after all, knows first-hand that a trade truce struck with Trump  can quickly collapse. \n \n\n   \n  A range of pitfalls, both foreseeable and unexpected, in the US and China’s expansive rivalry could derail the newly-reached stabilty – and whatever deal is ultimately reached is  unlikely to address the deep-seated, structural issues between the two. \n \n\n   \n  But as Trump took off from South Korea’s Gimhae International Airport on Thursday, to return to a US stuck in the quagmire of a frozen government,   Xi stayed on  to join an international summit and tout China as a beacon for globalization, it’s clear the balance of power between them has shifted.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/economy/us-government-shutdown-economy-snowball","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"05:30:00-04:00","title":"As the shutdown drags on, here’s how it can drag down the economy","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The federal government shutdown, now the longest on record, is causing significant and growing economic damage.

2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The  federal government shutdown  has lasted all month and is on pace to become the longest on record.\n \n\n   \n  While history has shown that the economy typically rebounds from a shutdown within a couple of months, each day it drags on brings   a greater risk that the economy  won’t just bend but will start to break — and rupture livelihoods in the process, economists say.\n \n\n   \n  “The economy is fragile and, therefore, something like a government shutdown could become a bigger problem a lot faster than people might think,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics.\n \n\n   \n  Congressional Budget Office estimates released Wednesday projected that the shutdown has permanently sapped at least $7 billion in output from the economy.\n \n\n   \n  The negative effects start to build on themselves very rapidly and the collateral damage becomes more widespread, said Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s kind of like a snowball rolling down a hill, gathering momentum and mass,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Predicting something that has becoming increasingly unpredictable is an impossible task, but here’s a look at how the shutdown could ripple through critical avenues of everyday life.\n \n\n   \n    Jobs\n \n\n   \n  Prior to the shutdown, the US job market  was already on its back .\n \n\n   \n  It’s been a  low-hire, low-fire, low-churn environment . Employers, frozen by high economic and policy uncertainty, have held off making investments and adding workers. Some businesses have used this period to test the waters on  artificial intelligence  and other technologies – in turn putting to the test that “low-fire” descriptor by announcing mass layoffs in recent weeks.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re not creating any jobs of consequence, really,” Zandi said.\n \n\n   \n  Considering that backdrop, the tepid job gains can potentially turn into deeper job losses if safety nets become frayed, more paychecks are missed by federal workers and contractors, and spending pullbacks reverberate through the private sector, causing businesses to lay off workers or shut down, he said.\n \n\n   \n  A US Chamber of Commerce analysis released this week estimated that 65,500 small business contractors have billions of dollars in payments at risk because of the shutdown — $12 billion in payments for the month alone.\n \n\n   \n  Rate cuts and some greater clarity around trade deals and tariffs were supposed to fuel a rebound in hiring heading into 2026, noted Nicole Bachaud, labor economist at employment site ZipRecruiter.\n \n\n   \n  “However, tariffs are projected to dampen consumer spending before year’s end, and a prolonged shutdown could further erode consumer confidence,” she wrote in a note earlier this month. “This would delay hiring plans that might otherwise materialize, keeping the labor market stuck in place.”\n \n\n   \n  US consumer confidence during October dipped to its lowest level since April, when President Donald Trump announced a massive suite of steep tariffs on imported goods, according to The Conference Board’s latest index released this week.\n \n\n   \n    Health care and the care economy\n \n\n   \n  The expiration of the enhanced premium subsidies for Affordable Care Act coverage is at the  crux of the Congressional stalemate  to fund the federal government and end the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats are demanding that a short-term funding package include an extension of the enhanced assistance, while  Republicans say they won’t negotiate  until the government reopens.\n \n\n   \n  Open enrollment starts on November 1, and the more than 22 million Americans who use the federal health insurance marketplace are  expected to see their monthly premium leap  by 26% on average, according to a KFF analysis.\n \n\n   \n  Also on November 1, more than 65,000 children and families in 41 states and Puerto Rico are at risk of  losing access to Head Start programs , which provide early education and child development resources to low-income households.\n \n\n   \n  Any center closures could quickly increase financial hardship for lower-earnings families. Child care disruptions have been shown to  negatively impact labor force participation  (particularly  for women ), productivity growth and overall economic growth.\n \n\n   \n    Spending\n \n\n   \n  The lengthier the shutdown, the higher the probability for a greater drag on overall economic activity, said Joe Brusuelas, RSM US chief economist.\n \n\n   \n  “And this isn’t economic activity that is just deferred or delayed, you’re now creating a condition of economic activity that just simply doesn’t happen,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  There’s the job that doesn’t get filled, the trip that doesn’t get taken and the holiday spending that doesn’t occur.\n \n\n   \n  “At some point, things start to break because they’re just not getting done,” added Zandi, of Moody’s Analytics. “When this thing really metastasizes and takes out the broader economy is when it starts to affect confidence – consumer, business, investor confidence – the stock market takes notice and instead of going straight up, it starts to wobble and starts going down.”\n \n\n   \n  If the shutdown continues past Thanksgiving, “there’s no coming back from that quickly,” he said, adding that once it passes that “point of no return,” it will cause “damage that’s longer-lasting.”\n \n\n   \n  Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of US economic activity. It has remained  largely resilient , despite massive uncertainty and persistently high inflation.\n \n\n   \n  However, it’s likely done so because of an increasingly bifurcated, or  “K-shaped” economy . Wealthy consumers, buoyed in part by strong market gains, are driving more of the spending while lower- and middle-income households are facing increased strain.\n \n\n   \n    Prices and interest rates\n \n\n   \n  A drawn-out shutdown could inject further “crosscurrents” into an already  choppy price environment , Zandi said.\n \n\n   \n  On one hand, disruptions to government services and funding could affect trade and supply chains, driving up prices. On the other hand, a weakened economy would mean it’s harder for companies to raise prices, which could help keep overall inflation in check.\n \n\n   \n  “The net of all that, I think, is hard to know,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Still, the shutdown and its economic fallout could give the Federal Reserve one more reason to  continue cutting interest rates , he added.\n \n\n   \n  “The Fed’s putting a higher weight at this point on the weak job market than they are on inflation or financial conditions,” he said. “This [shutdown] would weaken the already fragile job market more.”\n \n\n   \n    The human impact\n \n\n   \n  The shutdown could very well exacerbate those struggles for many Americans, especially people on the margins.\n \n\n   \n  Most Americans are “not taking any solace from the fact that AI stocks are going stratospheric; they’re focused on having to make their credit card payment or the student loan monthly payment,” Zandi said. “The economy is fragile and, therefore, something like a government shutdown could become a bigger problem a lot faster than people might think so.”\n \n\n   \n  A lack of funding for safety net programs,  particularly the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program , could not only exacerbate hunger and hardship for tens of millions of Americans, but also threatens to destabilize local economies, especially in rural areas.\n \n\n   \n  “It just adds insult to injury on an economy that was already showing some cracks,” KPMG economist Swonk said. “Low- and middle-income households are really struggling, and inequality tends to stoke political divisions as well as political backlash. So, this is just feeding in to already a not very comfortable situation that we are in.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s hard when you see the struggles we’re already facing, but this is a man-made problem,” she added.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/middleeast/israel-receives-remains-hostages-gaza-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"13:02:00-04:00","title":"Israel receives remains of two deceased hostages held in Gaza","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israel received the remains of two deceased hostages, Amiram Cooper and Sahar Baruch, from Gaza via the Red Cross, marking a significant, though fragile, step forward in the ongoing efforts to return hostages under the US-brokered ceasefire.

 Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Israel received the remains two deceased hostages held in Gaza on Thursday afternoon. The remains were transferred to Israel via the Red Cross and taken to the country’s national forensics laboratory for identification.\n \n\n   \n  The deceased hostages were identified as Amiram Cooper and Sahar Baruch, according to a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office.\n \n\n   \n  Cooper, 84, was one of the founder of Kibbutz Nir Oz near the border with Gaza. He was kidnapped by Hamas on October 7, 2023. His family was notified in June 2024 that he was killed in captivity. The circumstances of his death remain unclear, but the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said he was was killed in captivity around February of last year.\n \n\n   \n  Cooper was the last remaining hostage from Nir Oz, one of the communities hardest hit during the initial attack two years ago, whose body had not been returned. “We will always remember Amiram as a man of people and of words, a pioneer with values, a person of initiative and ideas who so deeply loved the kibbutz and its members,” the kibbutz said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Baruch, 25, was also taken hostage during the October 7 attack from his mother’s home in Kibbutz Be’eri. Baruch’s brother and grandmother were killed in the attack. Two months later, Baruch was killed in Gaza during a failed rescue attempt. “In this difficult and painful moment, we hope the family can find a measure of comfort in the closing of a horrific circle of 755 days and nights,” the kibbutz said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Thursday’s transfer leaves the bodies of 11 deceased hostages remaining in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  “The effort to bring back our hostages continues uninterrupted and will not cease until the return of the last hostage,” the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  The transfer of the remains comes just two days after Israel carried out punishing strikes in Gaza in response to the Hamas killing of an Israeli soldier in Rafah on Tuesday afternoon. The Israeli strikes killed more than 100 Palestinians, including at least 46 children, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, marking by far the deadliest day in Gaza since the ceasefire went into effect nearly three weeks ago.\n \n\n   \n  Even so, Hamas and Israel said they were still committed to the US-brokered ceasefire agreement. The transfer of two more sets of remains from Hamas to Israel on Thursday marked the strongest indication yet that the deal had not collapsed, despite the severe test it faced just days earlier.\n \n\n   \n  US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that “nothing’s going to jeopardize” the Gaza ceasefire. He threatened to “take out Hamas very easily.”\n \n\n   \n  The latest transfer appeared to proceed without the issues that have plagued recent attempts to return the remaining deceased hostages to Gaza. Hamas announced on Tuesday it was set to hand over one set of remains before saying under Israeli bombardment hours later that it would not transfer the remains.\n \n\n   \n  On Monday evening, Hamas handed over remains of deceased hostage Ofir Tzarfati, whose body had been recovered by Israel in Gaza two years earlier. Tzarfati was not among the remaining deceased hostages to be returned under the ceasefire, prompting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to accuse Hamas of a “clear violation” of the deal.\n \n\n   \n  The IDF then released video it said showed Hamas staging the discovery of the remains in Gaza City and turning over the remains to the Red Cross. In a statement, the Red Cross said, “It is unacceptable that a fake recovery was staged, when so much depends on this agreement being upheld and when so many families are still anxiously awaiting news of their loved ones.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional development.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/style/oakland-california-museum-theft","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"11:45:00.000-04:00","title":"Over 1,000 Items Stolen from California Museum’s Collection in Early Morning Heist","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Over 1,000 items, including Native American baskets, campaign pins, athletic trophies, and jewelry by artist Florence Resnikoff, were stolen from the Oakland Museum of California during a burglary at an off-site storage facility on October 15, 2025.

\n\n   \n  “We think the thieves found a way to enter the building, and they grabbed what they could easily find and snatch and get out of the building with,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Stolen items include neckpieces by the late artist and metalsmith Florence Resnikoff, a pair of scrimshaw walrus tusks and Native American baskets. But she said much of it was historical memorabilia from the 20th century such as campaign pins and athletic awards.\n \n\n   \n  The mission of the Oakland Museum of California is to document the art, history and natural environment of California, and its collection includes works by California artists from the late 18th century to the present, a well as artifacts, photographs, natural specimens and sound recordings. The museum has mounted shows dedicated to the Black Power movement and student activism.\n \n\n   \n  John Romero, a retired Los Angeles Police Department captain who led the department’s commercial crimes unit, told the  Los Angeles Times  that the items may already have been sold since the burglary occurred two weeks ago. He expects detectives are looking at resale platforms such as Craigslist and Ebay, and networks that specialize in historic or collectible antiques.\n \n\n   \n  “These people are interested in fast cash, not the full appraisal value,” he told the Times. “They need to get rid of it quickly.”\n \n\n   \n  In January 2013, an Oakland man broke into the museum itself and got away with a California Gold Rush-era jewelry box. Fogarty said the the item was traced to a pawn shop with help from the public, and she hopes the community can help again.\n \n\n   \n  The Oakland Police Department declined to provide further details, but said in its news release that police are working with a unit of the Federal Bureau of Investigation that specializes in art crime, including theft, forgery or antiquities and cultural property trafficking.\n \n\n   \n  The theft occurred four days before thieves made off with  priceless Napoleonic jewels  from the world’s most-visited museum, the Louvre, in broad daylight. Authorities have  made arrests  but the jewels have not been recovered.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/polls-election-major-races","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"What Do the Polls Say About the Key Races in This Election?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article analyzes recent polling data from four key off-year races in 2025: Virginia’s governor and attorney general races, New Jersey’s gubernatorial race, New York City’s mayoral race, and California’s Proposition 50.

races this election? \n       \n  By Ariel Edwards-Levy, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  We’re just days away from 2025’s off-year elections. Beyond how the races themselves turn out, the contests will be a valuable source of data to analyze – and perhaps overanalyze – ahead of next year’s midterms.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s an overview of what the polls suggest about the four big races we’re watching this year.\n \n\n   \n  A note: Polls are a valuable tool for understanding the electorate, but they’re most useful when they’re treated as estimates rather than attempts to predict the future with pinpoint precision. Often, what they tell us about the broader political environment is more valuable than the exact margin that any specific survey finds for a race.\n \n\n   \n    Virginia statewide races\n \n\n   \n   Virginia’s election for governor  takes place in the shadow of an unpopular GOP administration in Washington, DC.  A Washington Post-Schar School poll  asked voters to describe the most important issue in the race. The share who responded with negative comments about President Donald Trump or Republicans came second only to concerns about economic issues and the cost of living.\n \n\n   \n  The Post-Schar poll, which found Democrat Abigail Spanberger with a 12-point lead over Republican Winsome Earle-Sears among likely voters, joins  other recent   surveys  in the state that show Spanberger with a stable advantage in the race. There’s much more uncertainty in the other statewide races, particularly the campaign for attorney general, where polls show support for Democrat Jay Jones facing some erosion after  the publication of text messages  in which he fantasized about killing a legislative colleague.\n \n\n   \n    New Jersey governor\n \n\n   \n   New Jersey’s gubernatorial race  is a tale of two incumbents: Trump is unpopular there as well, but the state’s outgoing Democratic governor, Phil Murphy, also draws closely divided ratings for his time in office. Many recent surveys of the race, including polls from  Quinnipiac University ,  F ox News,   Fairleigh Dickinson University  and the  Rutgers-Eagleton Poll , have found Democrat Mikie Sherrill with an edge among likely voters, hovering around the 50% mark, while her opponent, Republican Jack Ciattarelli, stands closer to 45%.\n \n\n   \n  Quinnipiac’s latest poll, like several others, found that Ciattarelli’s supporters were more likely than Sherrill’s to express strong enthusiasm about their chosen candidate, although Sherrill’s favorability ratings remained higher overall.\n \n\n   \n    New York City mayor\n \n\n   \n   New York City’s multi-candidate mayoral race  poses a unique challenge for pollsters. Surveys of likely voters, however, have been largely consistent in showing Democrat Zohran Mamdani with a double-digit lead over his nearest rival, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, with Republican Curtis Sliwa in third. They differ on the precise scope of Mamdani’s advantage, although most have found him shy of clearing a majority of support in the race.\n \n\n   \n  In polls released Thursday by  Marist College  and  Fox News , Mamdani was buoyed by positive favorability ratings and broad support among younger voters, while older voters broke for Cuomo.\n \n\n   \n    California redistricting\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps nowhere is the role of national politics as clear as in California, where  voters are weighing Proposition 50 , a ballot measure to temporarily enact a new congressional map drawn by Democrats in response to Republican-driven redistricting in other states.\n \n\n   \n  A mid-October poll from  CBS/YouGov  found 62% of likely voters in support of Proposition 50, while  an October Public Policy Institute of California poll  put that support at 56%. It’s worth noting that  past research has found  that polling sometimes overshoots support for initiatives that implement new changes – whether liberal or conservative – because some voters default to preferring the status quo.\n \n\n   \n  Half of likely voters said in the CBS/YouGov poll that their decision had more to do with national issues and politics than with state or local issues. Broad majorities of likely voters supporting Proposition 50 said their choice was driven by the desire to oppose Trump, to oppose national Republicans and to support national Democrats.\n \n\n   \n    A note on the state of polling\n \n\n   \n  How have polls been performing lately? A  new postmortem report on 2024 election polling , released Wednesday by the American Association for Public Opinion Research, found that polling in last year’s election was significantly more accurate than it was in 2020 or 2016 even as it continued to underestimate Republican vote shares for the third straight presidential cycle. (Polls in the 2022 and 2018 midterms both saw smaller directional errors.)\n \n\n   \n  As the report also noted, polls last year weren’t always able to estimate the ways that turnout changed between 2020 and 2024. That bears mentioning because all of these surveys reflect pollsters’ best estimations about who’s likely to end up voting in an off-year election – and how much that might differ from four years ago, at the start of former President Joe Biden’s administration.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/fbi-fires-agent-trump-investigations","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"12:05:00-04:00","title":"FBI fires special agent who helped oversee Trump investigation, sources say","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The FBI has fired Aaron Tapp, a special agent who previously oversaw investigations into former President Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election, including the Arctic Frost probe targeting fake electors.

\n  Aaron Tapp, the special agent in charge of the FBI’s San Antonio office, was previously the deputy assistant director of the Criminal Investigative Division at FBI headquarters.

A strike or lockout didn’t really make sense for either side to do.\n \n\n   \n  Players have already been paid for the past season and they have health insurance through April 30, 2026. There are no major events for the league on the immediate horizon until an expansion draft for new teams Portland and Toronto. The expansion draft for Golden State took place last December.\n \n\n   \n  The players exercised their right to opt out of the current CBA last year with hopes of getting, among other things, increased revenue sharing, higher salaries, improved benefits and a softer salary cap.\n \n\n   \n  The WNBA’s offers to this point have clearly not been to the players’ liking, although it is unclear how far apart the sides are in terms of salary parameters. WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert said during the WNBA Finals that the league — like the players — wants a “transformative deal” done with significant increases to salary and benefits.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/zohran-mamdani-nypd-idf-video","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"20:42:00-20:42","title":"Mamdani Clarifies Statement on NYPD Boots and IDF Training","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Zohran Mamdani, a Democratic mayoral nominee for New York City, faced significant backlash over a 2023 statement in which he claimed the NYPD’s boots were laced by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), suggesting a link between U.S. and Israeli law enforcement in oppression.

Anderson Cooper why he said the IDF had laced the NYPD’s boots \n       \n  By David Wright, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:42 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   Zohran Mamdani  on Tuesday responded to a widely shared 2023 clip in which he suggested that the New York Police Department and Israeli army were linked in oppression, the latest example of the Democratic mayoral nominee  facing questions about his past record  of anti-police and anti-Israel statements.\n \n\n   \n  “We have to make clear that when the boot of the NYPD is on your neck, it’s been laced by the IDF,” Mamdani says in the clip, from a Democratic Socialists of America convention held that year. The Israel Defense Forces, or IDF, are the armed forces of Israel.\n \n\n   \n  “We have to make, not specifically that example all the time, but just to say that for working-class people who have very little time, who have so many stresses, who are under so many pressures, there isn’t that much time for symbolism,” he then said. “We have to make it materially connected to their life.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN’s Anderson Cooper played that clip Tuesday and asked Mamdani what he meant.\n \n\n   \n  “It was a reference to training exercises that have taken place between the NYPD and the IDF,” Mamdani said.\n \n\n   \n  “So do you still believe that the NYPD is basically working hand in glove with the IDF?” Cooper asked.\n \n\n   \n  “No, what I’ve made very clear is those are training exercises that are of concern to me,” Mamdani replied. “And what my focus is, is on working with the NYPD to actually deliver public safety for New Yorkers across the five boroughs.”\n \n\n   \n  It wasn’t immediately clear whether Mamdani would seek as mayor to end any training exercises or other cooperation between the NYPD and Israel. But the clip – and Mamdani’s explanation of it – became the latest instance during the mayoral campaign where the Democratic nominee had to answer for his past criticisms of both Israel and the police.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani has apologized for some of his comments about law enforcement, including social media posts in which he called the police racist, wicked and corrupt. Seeking to reassure voters concerned about public safety, he has said he would seek to retain NYPD Commissioner  Jessica Tisch , though he acknowledged in an earlier interview with CNN’s Gloria Pazmino that he hadn’t spoken to Tisch about staying on.\n \n\n   \n  But he has not backed down on his criticisms of Israel, referring to its war in Gaza after Hamas’ October 7 attacks as a genocide. He has said that as mayor, he would seek to carry out an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n \n\n   \n  While Americans are  increasingly skeptical  of Israel’s actions in Gaza, Mamdani’s criticisms have caused anger within parts of New York’s Jewish community, the largest outside Israel. He has  sought to reassure  Jewish voters that he would fight antisemitism and provide requested security at synagogues.\n \n\n   \n  While the NYPD does not have international posts in the traditional sense, the department runs an “International Liaison Program” that stations detectives across more than a dozen countries around the globe with the purpose of developing contacts with local law enforcement and engaging in counterterrorism exercises, according to the New York City police foundation that helps fund the program.\n \n\n   \n  The program, which critics say has expanded for years with little oversight, was started after 9/11 as law enforcement professionals sought to learn more about overseas terrorism.\n \n\n   \n  Over the years, the NYPD has continued to deploy senior law enforcement officers around the world, including to Israel, where they share in intelligence and training exercises.\n \n\n   \n  The NYPD did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/andrew-cuomo-mamdani-nyc-mayor-race","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"20:54:00-04:00","title":"In his last stand, Andrew Cuomo zigzags between optimism and despair about NYC race","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the final stretch of the 2025 New York City mayoral race, Andrew Cuomo, after a primary loss, relaunched his campaign emphasizing his 11-year experience as governor, including crisis management during Hurricane Sandy and pandemic response.

zigzags between optimism and despair about NYC race \n       \n  By Gloria Pazmino, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:54 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Through the final days of this year’s campaign for New York City mayor, Andrew Cuomo has at times lived up to the nickname he earned in the early days of his political career: the prince of darkness.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo  relaunched his mayoral campaign  after his shocking Democratic primary loss, telling New Yorkers he was in it to win it in a video he filmed standing on a tree-lined sidewalk under the July sun. He would acknowledge he needed to embrace social media and address voter concerns about affordability.\n \n\n   \n  Over the four months that followed, Cuomo zigzagged between optimism about his candidacy and despair about the  possible mayoralty of Zohran Mamdani . He has described his run as the last chance New Yorkers will have to save the city from Mamdani’s  democratic socialism , once referring in a debate to the 34-year-old Mamdani as a “kid” and warning that his ideas were radical and unrealistic.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo’s final general election ad leans on his executive experience and also questions whether Mamdani has enough.\n \n\n   \n  “Life in New York is tough right now,” he says in the ad. “Candidates who need on-the-job training can’t fix it.”\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of Tuesday’s election, early voting numbers were up dramatically ahead of the same point in 2021, reflecting the interest New Yorkers have in a mayoral race unlike any in recent memory. The latest Quinnipiac University poll had 43% of likely voters backing Mamdani versus 33% for Cuomo and 14% for Republican Curtis Sliwa.\n \n\n   \n  And in a  new Marist Poll of likely New York City voters  released Thursday, Mamdani had 48% support over Cuomo’s 32% and Sliwa’s 16%. Indeed, every major poll on the race has found Mamdani with a double-digit lead over Cuomo, though the vast majority have found Mamdani below 50% support, according to Jennifer Agiesta, CNN Director of Polling and Analytics.\n \n\n   \n  With the exception of Fox’s survey earlier this month, every high-quality poll on the contest conducted since the Democratic primary has found Mamdani’s support landing between 43 and 48 percent. While Cuomo has made up some ground over that time, with his support rising from the mid-20s in early polls to consistent low-30s support, he continues to lag well behind the frontrunner.\n \n\n   \n  Yet in the past week, aides to Cuomo have pointed to the early voting surge as evidence that his standing in the polls is not as bad as it seems.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo suggested on Wednesday that New Yorkers were just tuning into the race.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve been focusing on it, but people have been living their lives. You now get down to the last week, they’re starting to focus,” Cuomo said. “You’re talking about a general election where many normal New Yorkers are going to vote and I think there’s gonna be a big turnout because (Mamdani) frightens New Yorkers.”\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani’s backers remain far more enthusiastic about their choice than are Cuomo’s supporters, according to the Quinnipiac poll.\n \n\n   \n  The survey also found a rise in how many New Yorkers have an unfavorable view of Mamdani (45% favorable to 41% unfavorable versus earlier in October when those figures stood at 43% favorable to 35% unfavorable).\n \n\n   \n  Still, 54% of New Yorkers had unfavorable views of Cuomo versus just 34% favorable.\n \n\n   \n  In the final stretch of the campaign, Democrats who previously supported Cuomo, political observers and even former aides of the governor were astounded after he  laughed with a radio host  who suggested Mamdani would “cheer” another 9/11. Cuomo  later said  he believed the host’s comments were offensive as Mamdani accused him of playing to Islamophobia.\n \n\n   \n  Days later, during an appearance on Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show,” host Jon Stewart joked with Mamdani about their back-and-forth.\n \n\n   \n  “You are clearly in the front-runner position right now – I can tell because they have gone 9/11 on you,” Stewart said eliciting laughter from the crowd.\n \n\n   \n  “The closing argument,” Mamdani responded.\n \n\n   \n    Cuomo reframes his legacy\n \n\n   \n  With every post and campaign stop, Cuomo tried a new media strategy while leaning into the legacy items of his 11 years as governor, including  legalizing same-sex marriage  and  raising the minimum wage . In doing so, Cuomo argued that he is the mayoral race’s original progressive.\n \n\n   \n  “I was a crazy liberal,” Cuomo said during an appearance on SiriusXM’s “Andy Cohen Live” show. “Now, the party’s moved so far left, they call me a moderate.”\n \n\n   \n   Cuomo resigned  in 2021 amid an investigation into sexual harassment allegations that he has denied and questions about how he handled Covid-19 in nursing homes.\n \n\n   \n  He won an endorsement Wednesday from US Rep. Tom Suozzi, a Long Island Democrat whose district includes parts of Queens.\n \n\n   \n  “I cannot back a declared socialist with a thin resume to run the most complex city in America,” Suozzi  wrote on X . “We need leaders who will fight crime, not undermine the police. Who will create jobs, not harm the economy. Who will keep taxes down, not make it more expensive for middle class families to live here.”\n \n\n   \n    Embracing his inner influencer\n \n\n   \n  As his campaign apparatus tried to catch up on social media, Cuomo was dismissing its significance in public.\n \n\n   \n  Standing on the debate stage, Cuomo poked fun of Mamdani’s social media fluency, holding his hands up in the air, rocking side to side while moving his hands in a talking motion.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a TikTok dance,” Cuomo said.\n \n\n   \n  Even as he mocked the videos that helped propel his opponent, Cuomo admitted they were effective. He has started posting videos of him meeting with New Yorkers that some Mamdani allies think are copying the Democratic nominee’s style.\n \n\n   \n  “He was very effective on it. His mother’s a film director, filmmaker. He’s an actor slash rapper. They did highly produced videos that were very effective. And that’s his sweet spot,” Cuomo said on Cohen’s show.\n \n\n   \n  He appeared recently at a “Cool Girls for Capitalism” event held in a swanky Tribeca members-only club known as Maxwell Social, where hosts doled out pink T-shirts and stickers emblazoned with the group name.\n \n\n   \n  At a “Young Professionals For Cuomo” fundraiser hosted by the independent candidate’s daughters, attendants got a chance to secure T-shirts showing a cartoon Cuomo surrounded by friendly iconography – a Statue of Liberty, the Star of David, a cross, a pretzel and a smiling apple.\n \n\n   \n    Experience, experience, experience\n \n\n   \n  Much like he did in the primary, Cuomo continued to lean on his experience, trying to draw a contrast between himself and Mamdani, who has served three terms in the State Assembly.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo focused on public safety, appealing to fears that  Mamdani’s police reform agenda  would lead to an increase in crime and demoralize police officers.\n \n\n   \n  The former governor has proposed hiring more officers and argued homeless people should be moved off the streets. A former housing secretary under President Bill Clinton, Cuomo said the city had suffered through years of inept governments who could not get projects off the ground.\n \n\n   \n  On the day of Hurricane Sandy’s anniversary in New York City, Cuomo was once again on the trail reminding voters of his experience and what he believed is at stake.\n \n\n   \n  “You need experience. You need the ability. You need the wisdom to know what to do because literally lives depend on you,” Cuomo said.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, Cuomo got the endorsement of former Mayor Michael Bloomberg who was in office on the day Hurricane Sandy devastated the city.\n \n\n   \n  Bloomberg, who also endorsed Cuomo in the primary and donated millions to a Cuomo Super PAC, reiterated his support for the governor and highlighted his experience.\n \n\n   \n  “Being Mayor of New York City is the second toughest job in America, and the next mayor will face immense challenges,” Bloomberg wrote in a post on X. “Andrew Cuomo has the experience and toughness to stand up for New Yorkers and get things done.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s David Wright contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/uk/salem-britain-witches-pardon-campaign-scli-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"12:01:00.000Z","title":"Salem’s witches were pardoned, but Britain’s weren’t.

There’s now a movement to change that \n       \n  By James Frater, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:01 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  While the women accused in the infamous  Salem witch  trials in colonial America have long since been pardoned, the convictions of hundreds of British women executed under similar laws officially still stand. Now, one local authority in southern England is campaigning to change that.\n \n\n   \n  Decades before Salem, hysteria over witchcraft was already sweeping through England – and perhaps nowhere more fervently than in the southeast, such as in the neighboring counties of Kent and Essex, which border London.\n \n\n   \n  Between 1560 and 1700, more than 500 women were tried for witchcraft in the southeast region, according to UK Parliament estimates. Of those, 112 were executed.\n \n\n   \n  But one trial in Maidstone, Kent, in 1652 stands out for its scale and public fascination.\n \n\n   \n  On July 30 that year, a court convened near where Maidstone Town Hall stands today. Thirty-two people faced charges ranging from theft and murder to witchcraft, Claire Kehily, councillor for Maidstone Borough Council, told CNN. Six women, accused of bewitching to death a 10-day-old infant, her mother, and a 3-year-old child, became the focus of the town’s attention, she said.\n \n\n   \n  In the summer of 1652, the town was “abuzz with excitement,” Kehily explained.  “People came down from London to witness what was going on. It was the biggest thing we’d had here for a long time.”\n \n\n   \n  The accused were held in a small, dark jail that once stood on the ground floor of the courthouse, now tucked away in the attic of the rebuilt Town Hall.\n \n\n   \n  The trial’s notoriety was such that a special pamphlet was published shortly after, titled “A Prodigious and Tragic History of the Arraignment, Trial, Confession, and Condemnation of Six Witches,” of which Maidstone Council has a rare replica.\n \n\n   \n  The document describes bizarre and unverified claims – including one woman swelling “into a monstrous and vast bigness” before the court and another allegedly bearing “a visible teat under her tongue.”\n \n\n   \n  Three women were convicted after failing a crude test: a pin thrust into their arms. The court account said the women “did not feel it, neither did it draw blood.”\n \n\n   \n  Two others confessed to being impregnated “not by any man, but by the devil,” according to the document.\n \n\n   \n  All six were convicted of “the execrable and diabolical crime of witchcraft” and sentenced to death.\n \n\n   \n    Spectacle of execution\n \n\n   \n  Their execution took place at Penenden Heath, now a tranquil park with soccer fields and woodland.\n \n\n   \n  “They were dragged on hurdles – basically carts – to the heath,” Tony Harwood, a councillor for Maidstone Borough Council, told CNN. “Thousands came to watch. Public executions were entertainment, but also a tool of control.”\n \n\n   \n  “These were women of all ages,” Harwood continued. “Very vulnerable individuals who had no idea what was going on or why they had been put into this situation. You just have to understand the absolute terror of these events – and that is partly what’s behind it. The powers that be wanted to instil terror.”\n \n\n   \n  Harwood described the horror and spectacle of the scene. “Public executions – they were public participation events. Thousands of people would attend. There were crime waves around them: pickpocketing, thefts, lots of complaints. That’s why the execution spot at Penenden Heath was moved several times – because of the impact from the many thousands of sightseers who came to watch,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “There would have been people who were just there for the show. There would have been people who were appalled by what was going on. There would have been people who were excited by it.”\n \n\n   \n  After the executions, the bodies were discarded without ceremony. “When roads were widened or housing built, human remains have often been found,” Harwood added.\n \n\n   \n  A small stone plaque on the edge of Penenden Heath that commemorates these women – alongside the plaques for the many other people executed at this site – is the only mark of the atrocities that took place.\n \n\n   \n    Seeking justice, centuries later\n \n\n   \n  Though the frenzy surrounding witchcraft in England faded in the decades following the Maidstone trial, and all laws criminalizing witchcraft have long since been repealed, the convictions of those women – and hundreds like them – still stand.\n \n\n   \n  Now, nearly 400 years later, Maidstone Borough Council is calling for change.\n \n\n   \n  Stuart Jeffery, leader of the council, has written to Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood, urging the British government to introduce legislation that would grant a general pardon to those executed under the Witchcraft Act of 1562, including the women hanged at Penenden Heath in 1652.\n \n\n   \n  “Justice is timeless,” said Harwood. “These terrible wrongs carried out between 1542 and the mid-18th century echo through the ages. They cannot just be painted over.”\n \n\n   \n  “We need to set the record straight. These were innocent, vulnerable individuals who were brutally judicially murdered – often for political or personal gain. That injustice will echo down the ages.”\n \n\n   \n  Kehily said that the trials were “a very early form of violence against women and girls. It still happens. They were scapegoats.”\n \n\n   \n  “By highlighting it, we remind people that this has happened – and we need to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  “To address a wrong that has been made,” Kehily said, “is to try and get it right, to learn from history, and to bring it to the fore. This hasn’t gone away.”\n \n\n   \n    Precedents for pardon\n \n\n   \n  Maidstone’s campaign follows similar efforts elsewhere in the United Kingdom to confront historical injustices.\n \n\n   \n  In Scotland, then-First Minister Nicola Sturgeon issued a formal apology in 2022 to the thousands of people – mostly women – who were accused and executed under the country’s Witchcraft Act between the 16th and 18th centuries. The apology came after a sustained campaign by historians and activists who argued that the victims were persecuted for being poor, vulnerable, or simply different.\n \n\n   \n  There is also precedent for legislative pardons.\n \n\n   \n  In 2013, Queen Elizabeth II posthumously pardoned Alan Turing, the World War II codebreaker convicted under laws criminalizing homosexuality, and in 2017 the UK government extended the pardon to thousands of other gay and bisexual men convicted under similar statutes. Known as the “Turing Law,” it marked a significant step in acknowledging the injustice of discriminatory legislation.\n \n\n   \n  Councillors in Maidstone hope that a similar approach can be taken to address the legacy of the Witchcraft Act.\n \n\n   \n  “This is about justice,” Harwood said. “We’ve seen the government take steps to right past wrongs. Now it’s time to do the same for the women who were judicially murdered under the guise of witchcraft.”\n \n\n   \n  A Home Office spokesperson told CNN the government would respond to the council’s letter “in due course.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/tech/amazon-layoffs-andy-jassy-ai-culture","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"19:33:00Z","title":"Amazon says it didn’t cut 14,000 people because of money.

Previous studies have suggested that male fetal brains are more susceptible to maternal immune responses, according to the authors of the new study, and the third trimester is a “critical window for brain development.”\n \n\n   \n  The most common diagnoses included disorders in speech and motor function development and autism. About 2.7% of children born to mothers who had Covid-19 while pregnant were diagnosed with autism, compared with about 1.1% of others, according to the study, published Thursday in the journal Obstetrics and Gynecology.\n \n\n   \n  The new findings are “particularly notable in light of their biological plausibility,” the researchers wrote. They build on previous research that identified potential pathways for a maternal Covid-19 infection to affect the developing fetal brain even without direct transmission.\n \n\n   \n  “Parental awareness of the potential for adverse child neurodevelopmental outcomes after COVID-19 in pregnancy is key. By understanding the risks, parents can appropriately advocate for their children to have proper evaluation and support,” Dr. Lydia Shook, maternal-fetal medicine specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital and lead author of the study, said in  a news release .\n \n\n   \n  About 1 in 31 children in the US was diagnosed with autism by age 8 in 2022, according to a  report  published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that was published in April. The increase — up from 1 in 36 children in 2020 — continues a long-term trend that experts have largely attributed to better understanding of and screening for the condition.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, the US Department of Health and Human Services launched a “massive testing and research effort” to determine “what has  caused the autism epidemic .”\n \n\n   \n  In a news conference in September on the “ cause of autism ,” President Donald Trump — flanked by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other federal health leaders – said that use of  Tylenol during pregnancy  can be associated with a “very increased risk of autism,” despite decades of evidence that it is safe.\n \n\n   \n  Kennedy also has a history of comments linking autism and vaccines, despite strong evidence that the two are not connected.\n \n\n   \n  The timeframe of the new study – early in the pandemic, before vaccines were widely available – meant that ​the researchers were able to “isolate the association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and offspring neurodevelopment in an unvaccinated population.” About 93% of the mothers included in the assessment had not received any doses of Covid-19 vaccine. Strong infection-control policies at that time also helped reduce the potential for unreported or undetected Covid-19 cases, the researchers said.\n \n\n   \n  “These findings highlight that COVID-19, like many other infections in pregnancy, may pose risks not only to the mother, but to fetal brain development,” Dr. Andrea Edlow, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at Mass General Brigham and senior author of the new study, said in a news release. “They also support the importance of trying to prevent COVID-19 infection in pregnancy and are particularly relevant when public trust in vaccines – including the COVID-19 vaccine – is being eroded.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/health/listeria-outbreak-prepared-meals","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"19:19:00-04:00","title":"More illnesses, deaths reported in listeria outbreak tied to recalled pasta salads, meals sold nationwide","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A listeria outbreak linked to contaminated precooked pasta from Nate’s Fine Foods Inc. has resulted in 27 illnesses, 25 hospitalizations, six deaths, and one fetal loss across 18 states.

Kathy Hochul in 2026.\n \n\n   \n  The New York Republican has told allies that she plans on formally entering the race shortly after New York City’s mayoral election on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Axios was  first to report  on Stefanik’s plans.\n \n\n   \n  With more than a combined $13 million cash on hand, Stefanik has tapped a number of former Trump advisers and longtime aides who worked in finance, communications and operations roles to help launch her campaign.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s 2024 campaign strategist, Tony Fabrizio, will be Stefanik’s pollster; the senior adviser who ran a key pro-Trump super PAC, Chris Grant, will serve as an adviser for Stefanik; and another Trump 2024 campaign official, Tim Sale, will also join the campaign, the source told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Stefanik’s longtime adviser Alex deGrasse will serve as the campaign’s chief strategist and CFO while Stefanik’s chief of staff, Patrick Hester, will also be involved, the source added.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, the Trump administration  pulled  Stefanik’s nomination to be US ambassador to the United Nations amid concerns over slim margins in the US House of Representatives.\n \n\n   \n  Fellow New York GOP Rep. Mike Lawler had been weighing a gubernatorial bid as well but ultimately  announced  his plans to remain in the House after Trump had  made it clear  that he would prefer for the two-term congressman to remain in the narrowly divided House rather than risk losing his competitive GOP seat.\n \n\n   \n  As she has prepared for a gubernatorial bid, Stefanik has positioned herself to take on Hochul on multiple fronts, from her views on immigrants to her endorsement of Zohran Mamdani for mayor of New York City. In a congressional hearing in  June , the pair clashed over Trump’s deployment of the National Guard to California.\n \n\n   \n  Stefanik questioned Hochul over New York’s sanctuary policies for undocumented immigrants, providing a potential preview of next year’s gubernatorial race in the Empire State.\n \n\n   \n  In May during a CNN interview when asked about a potential match up against Stefanik, Hochul  said , “I look forward to that fight. No matter who it is, it’s not settled yet, but I say bring it on.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/us/release-chicago-immigration-daughter-cancer","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"17:46:00Z","title":"Chicago father of child fighting cancer released on bond by immigration judge","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 40-year-old Chicago man, Ruben Torres Maldonado, was detained in October 2025 during a federal immigration enforcement operation known as Operation Midway Blitz.

John Fetterman was exasperated with his colleagues Thursday, as the Senate heads home in the stalemate’s fifth week and millions of Americans are due to lose federal food assistance this weekend.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s an absolute failure what occurred here for the last month, and now things are really going to land, and imagine being a parent with a couple kids, and how you’re going to fill their refrigerator and pack their lunches and get on with their lives when the things that they’ve depended on now is gone, because we can’t even agree to just open things up,” the Pennsylvania Democrat told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Fetterman said his wife helps distribute free food to the community and has already witnessed longer lines. He lamented that when he returns home this weekend, he’ll have to tell constituents who have lost their SNAP benefits, “I don’t have an explanation for them.”\n \n\n   \n  The Democrat, who  has been outspoken  against shutting down the government in any form, has been one of just three in his caucus to routinely break from the party and vote with Republicans more than a dozen times to reopen the government.\n \n\n   \n  The Senate left town on Thursday for the weekend with no measurable progress toward a deal to reopen the government, with impatience inside the US Capitol skyrocketing and  critical social safety net programs at risk  in the coming days. Senators will not return until Monday, which will mark day 34 of the shutdown – just two days shy of setting a new record for longest shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Key senators of both parties took part in some private meetings Thursday to discuss potential off-ramps, including how to get both parties to support a deal on long-term appropriations bills. But lawmakers involved in those talks offered no more clarity about whether it could indeed end the standoff.\n \n\n   \n  Asked about the effort by some Senate Democrats to pass a bill to temporarily extend SNAP benefits, Fetterman questioned why Congress couldn’t also pay Capitol police officers, saying that “the world’s biggest lethal military in the world has relied on a donor to pay our service members last week. I mean, that’s a disgrace.”\n \n\n   \n  “We have to find a way forward,” the senator said. He added that while he “fundamentally” believes there will be an effort to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits, as his fellow Democrats are demanding, his party must also consider those who receive other important benefits from the government.\n \n\n   \n  “You have 2 million people on SNAP in my state, and over 400,000 are receiving those kind of tax credits,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “For a Democrat, I can’t imagine a more sacred part of who we fight for is people that, that depend on SNAP to feed themselves,” he said, later adding, “Our party has bigger problems than I thought we might have already. It’s like that’s not controversial. Pay everybody.”\n \n\n   \n  “We can’t even get our shit together and just open up our government,” he lamented.\n \n\n   \n  Responding to Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer’s prior suggestion that each day of the shutdown plays better politically for Democrats, Fetterman responded, “Ask the hungry people on Saturday.”\n \n\n   \n  “Americans are not leverage.

downpours and forceful winds unleashed widespread destruction along the storm’s path in Jamaica, Cuba and the Bahamas. At least 30 people have died, though the full toll of the catastrophic storm may take days or weeks to be determined.\n \n\n   \n  As the hurricane headed toward Bermuda early Thursday, emergency officials in countries along Melissa’s path have begun to pick up the pieces – clearing roads to reach isolated communities in need of relief.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew Holness, the prime minister of Jamaica, traveled to some of the hardest-hit areas of the island nation Wednesday to survey the significant damage caused by punishing winds and widespread flooding.\n \n\n   \n  “Despite the difficulties, the Jamaican spirit shines through as a strong reminder that we are a resilient nation with the capacity to triumph over adversity,” he wrote  on social media .\n \n\n   \n    Path of destruction\n \n\n   \n  In the Caribbean, hotter-than-average waters paired with minimally disruptive winds higher in the atmosphere to create the perfect fuel and prime conditions for Melissa to strengthen.\n \n\n   \n  Melissa rapidly  intensified , jumping from a 70 mph tropical storm on Saturday morning to a 140 mph Category 4 hurricane Sunday morning.\n \n\n   \n  By Tuesday, Melissa had morphed into a high-end Category 5 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 185 mph, tying it with  four other hurricanes  as the second-strongest storm recorded in the Atlantic since records began in 1851.\n \n\n   \n  As it headed toward Jamaica, where it slammed into the coast as a Category 5 storm on Tuesday, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) warned it expected the situation to be “catastrophic.”\n \n\n   \n  “For Jamaica, it will be the storm of the century for sure,” WMO tropical cyclone specialist Anne-Claire Fontan said.\n \n\n   \n  Overnight Tuesday into Wednesday, it crossed into eastern Cuba, still a formidable Category 3 hurricane by the time it made landfall in the province of Santiago de Cuba.\n \n\n   \n  By the time it reached the Bahamas on Wednesday, Hurricane Melissa had been downgraded to a Category 1, but its broad wind field continued to drive torrential flooding rain, damaging winds and dangerous storm surge at the coast.\n \n\n   \n  More than 735,000 people were  evacuated in Cuba  as Melissa approached, according to President Miguel Díaz-Canel, while in the Bahamas, preliminary estimates show 1,485 residents were evacuated before all flights were suspended ahead of the approaching storm.\n \n\n   \n  Evacuation orders were also issued for six islands in the Bahamas.\n \n\n   \n  Other countries, including the Dominican Republic and Haiti, also felt the cataclysmic impacts of Melissa.\n \n\n   \n    Devastation left behind\n \n\n   \n  Across the Caribbean, officials painted a consistent picture of the destruction Melissa left behind.\n \n\n   \n  “The conditions here are devastating. ‘Catastrophic’ is a mild term based on what we are observing here,” Richard Solomon, the mayor of the southwest Jamaican city of Black River, where Hurricane Melissa made landfall, said in a  video  posted by the Jamaica Constabulary Force.\n \n\n   \n  Around 140,000 people were cut off as the storm pummeled the island, the government has said.\n \n\n   \n  A CNN crew observed residents and military personnel push more than a dozen ambulances past storm debris in the town of Santa Cruz as the medical convoy headed to a coastal area in western Jamaica, which was hit hard.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities in Jamaica have recovered at least four bodies in the badly hit St. Elizabeth Parish in the aftermath of Hurricane Melissa, a source in the government told CNN on Wednesday. The Jamaica Constabulary Force confirmed eight more deaths on Thursday in Westmoreland, Hanover and St. James.\n \n\n   \n  Three people also died during storm preparations.\n \n\n   \n  Holness  declared  the country a disaster area   Tuesday, as he sought to deter price gouging.\n \n\n   \n  “We must… continue to proactively maintain stability, protect consumers, and prevent any exploitation at a time when citizens are securing food, water, and supplies,” Holness said.\n \n\n   \n  Around 77% of the country was  left  without electricity after Melissa crossed, a spokesperson said. The country’s infrastructure has taken a battering, leaving it “severely compromised,” according to Desmond McKenzie, Jamaica’s minister of local government and community development.\n \n\n   \n  Around 25,000 tourists remained in Jamaica as the country emerged from the storm, Dana Morris Dixon, minister of education, skills, youth and information, said in a  statement .\n \n\n   \n  In the already  beleaguered  country of Haiti, 23 people have died and 13 are missing, the country’s Civil Protection Agency said Wednesday. Twenty of the deaths, including 10 children, happened when a flooded river in Petit-Goâve burst its banks, the agency said, revising an earlier death toll of 25 reported by the mayor.\n \n\n   \n  Steven Guadard, who lives in Petit-Goâve, told the  Associated Press  the storm killed his entire family.\n \n\n   \n  “I had four children at home: a 1-month-old baby, a 7-year-old, an 8-year-old and another who was about to turn 4,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel said Hurricane Melissa had wrought “significant” damage on the island.\n \n\n   \n  “It has been a highly complex night, with significant damage reported,” Díaz-Canel wrote on X. “I urge our people to remain vigilant, to uphold discipline, and to continue taking all necessary precautions.”\n \n\n   \n    Recovery efforts\n \n\n   \n  Several international efforts have already been launched to aid in the recovery efforts.\n \n\n   \n  The United Kingdom said on Wednesday it was  deploying  £2.5 million ($3.3 million) in emergency humanitarian funding.\n \n\n   \n  China’s ambassador to Cuba shared a video on  social media  showing hundreds of boxes labeled as “family kit” being transported from a warehouse.\n \n\n   \n  US President Donald Trump on Wednesday authorized “an immediate US response” to mobilize support for affected communities in the Caribbean, according to a  statement  released by the State Department.\n \n\n   \n  Within hours, Secretary of State Marco Rubio “deployed a regional Disaster Assistance Response Team, including urban search-and-rescue teams, to assess needs and provide search and recovery assistance,” the statement read.\n \n\n   \n  “The State Department is collaborating with UN agencies, NGOs, and host governments to deliver food, water, medical supplies, hygiene kits, temporary shelter, and search and rescue support.”\n \n\n   \n  The Jamaican government launched an  official website  for relief and recovery efforts, where users can access updates on flooding locations or blocked roads and locate shelters.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/shutdown-snap-trump-asia","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"19:47:00-04:00","title":"Trump returns to confront deepening duel of pain as shutdown drags on","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A prolonged government shutdown under President Donald Trump has deepened into a national crisis, with millions of Americans facing soaring health care premiums and potential loss of food assistance through SNAP.

confront deepening duel of pain as shutdown drags on \n       \n  Analysis by Stephen Collinson, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:47 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump had his fun, with red carpet welcomes, impromptu dances, the  gift of a golden crown  and a yet another  Nobel Peace Prize nomination .\n \n\n   \n  But the trophies from  his Asia tour  won’t count for much when he arrives home Thursday just as the monthlong government shutdown takes its bitterest turn yet amid the worst domestic political crisis of his second term.\n \n\n   \n  His return and a confluence of suddenly harsher  consequences for millions of Americans  mean the next few days may represent the only way out of the increasingly damaging impasse before the run-up to Thanksgiving.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re pretending that everything is OK,” Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski said this week, berating her colleagues in both parties for failing to act. “We’re pretending that people are not being impacted by this shutdown.”\n \n\n   \n  Senate Democrats triggered the showdown, withholding support for a temporary government funding bill last month in an attempt to force Republicans to guarantee extensions for  expanded subsidies  for millions of  Affordable Care Act health plans .\n \n\n   \n  “They are completely and totally uninterested in solving or addressing, decisively, the Republican health care crisis that they’ve created,” House Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on “The Source” Wednesday night.\n \n\n   \n  “On November 1, when open enrollment begins, it’s going to be crystal clear to tens of millions of Americans, across the country, that their premiums, copays and deductibles are about to dramatically increase,” Jeffries said.\n \n\n   \n  But Republican leaders are standing firm. They’re offering to discuss extending the credits, but only when Democrats agree to open the government.\n \n\n   \n  A pitiful lack of trust between the parties, the unwillingness of either side to accept the political cost of a climbdown and Trump’s stunning indifference to his own shuttered government led to this stalemate.\n \n\n   \n  And the ramifications of the shutdown are getting quickly worse as the political duel becomes a test of which unfortunate Americans can bear the most pain.\n \n\n   \n  In one of the most critical developments, tens of millions of Americans, including children, elderly citizens and those with a disability are set to lose vital food assistance under the  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). \n \n\n   \n  The blow of soaring health care premiums is also being laid bare. Millions are getting notices showing Obamacare costs shooting up by an average of 26% and in some cases much higher, in the absence of the expiring enhanced subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  “Which pain point is the worst?” Collins asked Jeffries, referring to Americans hit by rising Obamacare premiums and those facing the potential loss of SNAP benefits. “None of this pain that Republicans have inflicted on the American people is acceptable,” Jeffries replied.\n \n\n   \n  The pressure on government workers — those forced to work without pay and colleagues who are locked out of their jobs — is also worsening.\n \n\n   \n  Flight disruptions are mounting as staff shortages emerge among air traffic controllers, who already operate  under acute stress . The controllers’ mental and emotional challenges are rising since they are  working without pay  — but still face housing, transport and childcare costs.\n \n\n   \n  A new crisis speed bump looms over paying military personnel. Trump accepted a  $130 million donation  from a fellow billionaire to fill the gap left by drained federal funds after reallocating Pentagon funds to meet a first wave of salary payments. But the gift won’t come close to paying wages for 1.3 million military members.\n \n\n   \n  Federal employees, who are spread throughout the 50 states, are getting increasingly desperate. Their financial obligations don’t just go on hold because the government can’t pay them.\n \n\n   \n    Will the misery being inflicted on Americans change political calculations?\n \n\n   \n  Conditions are therefore dropping into place for the spiking of pain that normally translates into political pressure that causes one party to flinch.\n \n\n   \n  The food stamps expiration could be a catalyst. Democrats accuse the administration of refusing to divert available funding to meet the shortfall. But the Agriculture Department insists it can’t tap a $6 billion contingency fund to pay the benefits.\n \n\n   \n  The disagreement set up a callous scenario as lawmakers squabble over what is more important — feeding the nation’s neediest people or ensuring that millions of families can continue to get health care. It’s a shameful spectacle that epitomizes a political system rendered inoperable by years of polarization and cynicism in both parties and a government that fails in its basic function to help citizens.\n \n\n   \n  As misery multiplies, the question becomes which party changes its calculus first.\n \n\n   \n  ► Will Democrats, who have stayed remarkably united during the drama, begin to see cracks, especially among moderate lawmakers, those who have competitive reelection races, or others who are retiring and can buck their party’s activists?\n \n\n   \n  ► Can Republican leaders keep their lawmakers, especially the often-fractious House GOP conference, in line? Will they risk political fallout from all this misery inflicted on voters already hit by rising inflation and grocery prices, given they have a monopoly on power in Washington?\n \n\n   \n  ► And will Trump, who has managed to defray some of the traditional pressure points during a shutdown, finally discover a political or moral imperative to end it?\n \n\n   \n    A hint of hope as senators talk\n \n\n   \n  A glimmer of hope shone late on Wednesday when details emerged of a  dual-track negotiation between frustrated Democratic and Republican senators . One goal would be to resolve the health-care impasse and reopen the government for a few weeks. The group also hopes to reach a separate long-term agreement to fund certain key departments — including the Department of Agriculture, which funds food stamps — through next year.\n \n\n   \n  Disagreements in Congress often end with creative fudges and concurrent steps that allow both sides to argue they didn’t fold. But there is no guarantee this approach will work. Senate Majority Leader John Thune’s office told CNN he remains unwilling to discuss Obamacare policy changes until the government is open.\n \n\n   \n  A few weeks ago, the closure of the federal government lacked the sweeping impact that helped earlier shutdowns seize the nation’s attention. But that’s beginning to change. The normally unruffled Thune erupted on the Senate floor Wednesday at Democratic Sen. Ben Ray Luján, who complained about SNAP benefits potentially expiring. “This isn’t a political game,” Thune snapped. “These are real people’s lives that we’re talking about. And you all just figured out, 29 days in, that, oh, there might be some consequences.”\n \n\n   \n  Democratic rhetoric is just as harsh.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer tried Wednesday to exact a political price from Trump. “Every single president was not so cruel and heartless to hold those hungry children, hungry elderly, and hungry veterans as hostages,” Schumer said. “Donald Trump is picking politics over the lives of hungry kids. He is weaponizing hunger.”\n \n\n   \n  The vitriol may offer an opening for the president because the shutdown — now just a week out from a new record — won’t end until he gets involved. He could turn his absence for most of the last week to his advantage by inserting himself into the bitterness between Democrats and Republicans to broker a resolution. After all, Trump is often more tempted more by the chance to make a deal and declare victory than by any rigid ideology. And he’s already signaled willingness to talk about expiring health-care subsidies. He could pose as the president who fed the hungry, paid the troops and made the skies safe again. This, however, would mean breaking with some of the harder-line elements in his own administration and offering Democrats a face-saving off-ramp.\n \n\n   \n  The conundrum for Democrats is how they engineer a way out of the crisis that they can present as a victory to base voters desperate to hit back at Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Early in the shutdown, the party succeeded in making Obamacare subsidies a national issue. And after nearly a year of internal mourning over the disastrous 2024 congressional and presidential elections, they found surprising unity in the shutdown. Sometimes, just picking a fight can give a party definition.\n \n\n   \n  But as the pain for millions of Americans mounted, the political clarity over health care blurred. And competing claims emerged. Everett Kelley, the president of the  American Federation of Government Employees  union that represents a wide swath of federal workers, who always opposed a shutdown, warned that it was time for the government to reopen. “I think that it’s vitally important to have health care for everyone … However, I don’t think that this should be built on the backs of federal employees,” he told CNN’s Jake Tapper.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats are also increasingly wrestling with the possibility that blame for the shutdown could blow back against them. After all, when they held the power in government, they faulted Republicans for using federal funding as a political lever. CNN’s Kasie Hunt pointed out the inconsistency to Democratic Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona on Tuesday. “That’s an easy answer. It’s Donald Trump. You’re talking about norms in the time of Donald Trump. It’s also normal not to tear down the East Wing,” Gallego said. He added: “It’s all out the window. When you’re dealing time with Donald Trump, this is the man that is extorting people. … We’re not going to go back and play by the norms when we know what’s on the line.”\n \n\n   \n  Republicans face their own risks.\n \n\n   \n  House Speaker Mike Johnson’s refusal to bring the House back to Washington looks like weakness. And he hasn’t been able to silence dissent in his conference, including from  Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene , who keeps accusing her party of negligence over the health care issue. The political equation could shift for Republicans next week if Trump is rebuked in  bellwether elections in Virginia and New Jersey .\n \n\n   \n  And leaving kids hungry could be a disaster. That’s one reason  Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley introduced a bill to fund SNAP benefits  until the end of the shutdown. Schumer said his party would vote for it. But Republican leaders will be loath to make a move that could alleviate pressure on Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  If millions of Americans going hungry doesn’t break open the deadlock, the shutdown could drag on even longer. The next potential off-ramp may come in the weeks leading up to Thanksgiving with the horrible prospect of an air travel nightmare at the busiest time of the year.\n \n\n   \n   This article has been updated with new reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/justice-department-black-lives-matter","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"18:15:00Z","title":"Justice Department Investigating Fraud Allegations in Black Lives Matter Movement, AP Sources Say","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Justice Department is investigating alleged fraud within the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, which received over $90 million in donations following the 2020 murder of George Floyd.

PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Justice Department is investigating whether leaders in the Black Lives Matter movement defrauded donors who contributed tens of millions of dollars during racial justice protests in 2020, according to multiple people familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks, federal law enforcement officials have issued subpoenas and at least one search warrant as part of an investigation into the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, Inc. and other Black-led organizations that helped spark a national reckoning on systemic racism, said the people, who were not authorized to discuss an ongoing criminal probe by name and spoke on condition of anonymity to The Associated Press.\n \n\n   \n  It was not clear if the investigation would result in criminal charges, but its mere existence invites fresh scrutiny to a movement that in recent years has faced criticism about its public accounting of donations received. The recent burst of investigative activity is also unfolding at a time when civil rights groups have raised concerns about the potential for the Trump administration to target a broad variety of progressive and left-leaning groups that have been critical of him, including those affiliated with BLM, the transgender rights movement and anti-ICE protesters.\n \n\n   \n  Spokespeople for the Justice Department declined to comment on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  One of the people said the investigation had been initiated during the Biden administration but is getting renewed attention during the Trump administration. A second person confirmed that allegations were examined in the Biden administration.\n \n\n   \n  The foundation said it  took in over $90 million in donations , following the 2020 murder of George Floyd, a Black man whose last breaths under the knee of a White Minneapolis police officer sparked protests across the US and around the world.\n \n\n   \n  Critics of the nonprofit foundation, and of the BLM movement broadly, have accused organizers of not being transparent about how it was spending the donations. That criticism grew louder after BLM foundation leaders in 2022 confirmed they used donations to purchase  a $6 million Los Angeles-area property  that includes a home with six bedrooms and bathrooms.\n \n\n   \n  Leaders previously have denied wrongdoing and publicly released tax documents. No prior investigations into the nonprofit’s finances have yielded proof of impropriety.\n \n\n   \n  Leaders of the foundation have received subpoenas. In a statement emailed to the AP on Thursday, the foundation said it “is not a target of any federal criminal investigation.”\n \n\n   \n  “We remain committed to full transparency, accountability, and the responsible stewardship of resources dedicated to building a better future for Black communities,” the foundation said in the statement.\n \n\n   \n  The Black Lives Matter movement first emerged in 2013 after the acquittal of George Zimmerman, the neighborhood watch volunteer who killed 17-year-old  Trayvon Martin  in Florida. But it was the 2014 death of Michael Brown at the hands of police in Ferguson, Missouri, that made the slogan “Black lives matter” a rallying cry for progressives and a favorite target of derision for conservatives.\n \n\n   \n  Movement founders and organizers pledged to build a decentralized organization governed by the consensus of BLM chapters. But as the movement’s influence grew, so did the number of organizations that became affiliated with BLM. In 2020, a tidal wave of public contributions in the aftermath of protests over Floyd’s murder came mainly to the BLM foundation, although other organizations were resourced from those funds.\n \n\n   \n  Leaders of the foundation  opened up about finances and organizational structure in 2022 , revealing detailed accountings of expenditures. The latest Form 990 filing shows the BLM foundation had $28 million in assets for the fiscal year ending June 2024.\n \n\n   \n  The investigation is being run out of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Central District of California, in Los Angeles. The top prosecutor there, Bill Essayli, was  disqualified from several cases  earlier this week after a federal judge concluded that the Trump appointee has stayed in the temporary job longer than allowed by law. It’s not clear whether Essayli’s disqualification will impact the BLM investigation. He effectively remains the office’s top prosecutor with a different title of First Assistant United States Attorney.\n \n\n   \n  Essayli had previously served as a Republican assemblyman in California, where he took up conservative causes and criticized the state’s Covid-19 restrictions. He has been outspoken against state policies to protect immigrants living in the country illegally, and he has aggressively prosecuted people who protest Trump’s ramped up immigration enforcement across Southern California.\n \n\n   \n  As a private practice attorney, he characterized BLM as a “radical organization” while defending a White couple charged in 2020 with a hate crime after they were videotaped defacing  a BLM mural in Martinez, California .\n \n\n   \n  At the time,  city-sanctioned BLM murals had been painted on roadways  in cities throughout the US in an expression of solidarity with the racial justice movement. Essayli told a San Francisco CBS TV affiliate his clients were simply expressing their political viewpoints and that they disagreed with taxpayer funds being used to “sponsor a radical organization, Black Lives Matters.”\n \n\n   \n  The couple took plea deals to resolve the case in 2022.\n \n\n   \n  At the height of the Floyd-sparked reckoning on racial injustice, some state officials vowed their own investigations in the foundation’s finances, citing their responsibility to protect residents who may have donated to BLM. But most of those probes were resolved without official action.\n \n\n   \n  In 2022, Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita filed a lawsuit against the BLM foundation for failing to comply with an investigation into the organization’s finances. Soon after, a representative of the foundation responded with the necessary information and documentation, a spokesperson for the attorney general’s office said, and the lawsuit was dismissed.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/entertainment/sean-diddy-combs-checks-into-prison","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"16:56:00Z","title":"Sean 'Diddy' Combs checks into Fort Dix to begin prison sentence","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Sean 'Diddy' Combs, the renowned music mogul, has been transferred to Fort Dix, a low-security federal prison in New Jersey, to begin serving the remainder of his 50-month sentence for two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution.

glimpse at how iPhone 17 sales are going \n       \n  By Lisa Eadicicco, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:13 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Apple reported fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday that provided an early glimpse into how the iPhone 17 lineup may be catching on so far.   \n \n\n   \n  Apple’s earnings for the quarter that ended in September met analysts’ expectations on revenue but slightly missed on iPhone sales.   iPhone sales in the fourth quarter were $49 billion, up from $46.2 billion compared to the same period a   year ago but slightly lower than the $50.1 billion Wall Street was expecting. Overall revenue was $102.5 billion, an increase from $94.9 billion a year ago.\n \n\n   \n  Apple says both revenue and iPhone sales   numbers represent a record for the fourth   quarter. Services revenue, another closely watched metric ,  also hit an   all-time record at $28.8 billion, an increase from roughly $25 billion a year ago.\n \n\n   \n  During Apple’s earnings call on Thursday,   CEO Tim Cook said the company expects the December quarter’s revenue “to be the best ever for the company and the best ever for the iPhone,” suggesting strong iPhone 17 sales.\n \n\n   \n  Apple shares were up around 3% in after-hours trading.\n \n\n   \n  Wall Street is looking for assurance that Apple’s biggest revenue driver is still growing despite concerns that the company is behind in the AI race. Analysts had estimated strong demand for the iPhone 17 lineup, which Apple launched in late September.\n \n\n   \n  However, overall sales in China   shrunk compared to a year ago, with the company generating $14.5 billion in revenue in the region. In 2024, Apple earned $15 billion during the same period. Cook said on Thursday that he expects iPhone revenue to return to growth in China in the current quarter based on how the iPhone 17 is being received.\n \n\n   \n  Thursday’s results paint an early picture of iPhone sales since its fourth quarter ended on September 27, eight days after the iPhone 17 launch. Still, it’s possible that sales slowed in the July and August months as consumers waited for the iPhone 17.\n \n\n   \n  The iPhone 17 series outsold its predecessor by 14% in its first 10 days in the United States and China, according to  Counterpoint Research , with the base iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro Max being the most in demand. The iPhone Air, touted as the thinnest iPhone ever, is seeing “muted customer interest” according to UBS, which has been tracking retail wait times for new iPhones.\n \n\n   \n  Apple’s iPhone business is always under a microscope as the company’s largest revenue driver. But the tech industry is particularly paying close attention, prompted by speculation that another AI-powered gadget may eventually supplant the smartphone.\n \n\n   \n  While analysts previously grilled Apple about its AI strategy on recent earnings calls, Wall Street was more interested in the factors driving iPhone demand and the impact of tariffs. Apple said it expects to incur $1.4 billion in tariff-related costs this quarter.\n \n\n   \n  But Cook said he sees “opportunities on the App Store” for AI when asked about whether the rise of chatbots and AI apps will change how consumers use apps. He also said Apple Intelligence — a suite of AI-powered features for the iPhone and the company’s other products — is motivating people to upgrade their iPhones.\n \n\n   \n  “I would say that Apple Intelligence is a factor, and we’re very bullish on it becoming a greater factor, and that’s the way that we look at it,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Apple delayed an update to Siri earlier this year that would have brought it closer to OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini. Rivals like Google, Microsoft and Samsung,   meanwhile, continue to pour billions into their AI infrastructure.\n \n\n   \n  The earnings come in what has been a challenging year for Apple.\n \n\n   \n  The company has been impacted by   President Donald Trump’s trade war and has faced pressure from the Trump administration to make its iPhones domestically. Earlier this year it committed to investing $600 billion toward expanding its US operations. But Thursday’s earnings, along with the company surpassing a $4 trillion market capitalization earlier this week, represent a turnaround.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/january-6-doj-memo-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"17:00:00-04:00","title":"Trump’s push to rewrite the history of January 6 takes an especially brazen turn","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump and his Justice Department are engaging in a systematic effort to rewrite the historical narrative of January 6, 2021, by purging prosecutors involved in the Capitol attack and altering official documents to remove references to rioters.

EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Shortly after the  January 6, 2021, attack  on the US Capitol, the political right spent a lot of time parsing whether the word “insurrection” was an apt description of the day’s events.\n \n\n   \n  Today, President Donald Trump’s Justice Department is apparently  sanctioning its own prosecutors  for calling January 6 a mere “mob of rioters.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s difficult to fully convey just how brazen Trump’s efforts to rewrite the history of the day have become. He’s spent years trying to turn people who launched the worst attack on the US Capitol in two centuries into sympathetic figures. He even pardoned a bunch of people who assaulted police that day, despite  more than 8 in 10 Americans opposing that .\n \n\n   \n  But sometimes something comes along that completely drives the whole thing home.\n \n\n   \n  That’s what happened this week, in the  case of Taylor Taranto .\n \n\n   \n  To recap: Taranto was among those pardoned by Trump for his actions on January 6. But before that pardon, he committed an unrelated crime. In 2023, he was arrested in former President Barack Obama’s Washington, DC, neighborhood with numerous firearms and materials to make explosives. He was convicted in May.\n \n\n   \n  By late Tuesday, a reporter at Politico noted something interesting: Prosecutors in their sentencing memo for Taranto noted his presence in the “mob of rioters” on January 6.\n \n\n   \n  “Taranto was accused of participating in the riot in Washington, D.C., by entering the U.S. Capitol Building,” the  sentencing memo  said. “After the riot, Taranto returned to his home in the State of Washington, where he promoted conspiracy theories about the events of January 6, 2021.”\n \n\n   \n  This wouldn’t normally be surprising, mind you. It’s a factual statement that notes the defendant isn’t a newcomer to legal trouble.\n \n\n   \n  But it  was  notable next to Trump’s own rhetoric about January 6 – and given the Trump DOJ’s efforts to  force out a batch of prosecutors  who tried January 6 cases.\n \n\n   \n  Sure enough, mere hours later the prosecutors on the case – Carlos Valdivia and Samuel White – were  placed on leave . Then their sentencing memo was pulled from the docket and replaced with a new one, signed by different prosecutors, that excised the paragraph on January 6.\n \n\n   \n  And just in case it wasn’t clear that the changes were made to benefit Trump, consider another change to the sentencing memo.\n \n\n   \n  The other interesting aspect of Taranto’s crime is Trump’s proximity to it. In fact, Taranto was apprehended near Obama’s home  shortly after Trump reshared a post that included an alleged address for the former president  to social media. Prosecutors said Taranto began livestreaming in the area shortly after promoting Trump’s post.\n \n\n   \n  The new sentencing memo also removed a reference to that fact.\n \n\n   \n  The US attorney for the District of Columbia, Jeanine Pirro, declined to shed light on why the prosecutors were put on leave.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the papers speak for themselves, and what goes on in this office is not something that I’m going to comment on. Thank you,” Pirro said.\n \n\n   \n  We still have plenty to learn about what happened here. But it’s one of the most glaring examples of the fruits of Trump’s long-running campaign to retcon January 6 – and to turn it into anything other than a tragic day for our country and our democracy.\n \n\n   \n  After the dust settled on that day, Trump and some allies in Congress began suggestively questioning how violent the day was, with one GOP congressman infamously comparing it to a “ normal tourist visit .”\n \n\n   \n  After Trump launched his 2024 campaign, he began featuring a  music video from a choir of January 6 defendants  that effectively lionized them. He began talking about the defendants as if they were ill-treated political “hostages,” often  citing misinformation  in the process.\n \n\n   \n  Then he, on his first day back in office, pardoned nearly all of them – even the worst offenders.\n \n\n   \n  But that was merely the first step.\n \n\n   \n  We’ve also seen a  purge of dozens of prosecutors  who tried January 6 cases, despite them merely enforcing the law. Trump’s Justice Department agreed to  settle a wrongful death suit for $5 million with the family of Ashli Babbitt , who was killed after breaking into a sensitive area of the Capitol, cementing her status as a martyr for some portions of the extreme right. The administration has also  pressured the Smithsonian , which has in some cases  softened its language about the events that day . The president and allies have continued to overhype  relatively minor   disclosures  about the government’s actions vis-a-vis January 6, which took place while Trump was in office, as if they proved a massive conspiracy against Trump and the GOP. The House is now undertaking an investigation that  appears aimed at recasting the narrative  of that day.\n \n\n   \n  Oh, and we recently learned Trump is reportedly  seeking $230 million  from his own government for alleged damages from the January 6 probe and other federal investigations. (Trump was never tried in these cases, which were dropped after he was reelected president, but nor was he acquitted.)\n \n\n   \n  If anything epitomizes Trump’s attempts to turn those who fueled what happened on January 6 into victims, it’s surely that. Even if you don’t think Trump committed a crime, the people who attacked the Capitol were clearly spurred by his lies about voter fraud and the supposedly stolen election.\n \n\n   \n  Trump just keeps pushing the envelope here, and we keep seeing that manifest itself in actions by his Justice Department and his administration.\n \n\n   \n  The question from there is whether he’s able to actually rewrite history in Americans’ minds.\n \n\n   \n  To this point, that’s been  a tough slog . Trump’s pardons of violent January 6 defendants were overwhelmingly unpopular. Strong majorities of Americans still regard that day as an attack against democracy.\n \n\n   \n  But we’ve also seen a steady downgrading of the right’s views on that day.\n \n\n   \n  By mid-2021, a Monmouth University poll showed 62% of Republicans labeled that day a “riot,” and 33% called it an “insurrection.” Two years later, though, those numbers  dropped significantly – to 44% and 15%, respectively .\n \n\n   \n  In that way, the erasure of the “mob of rioters” from the memo reflects how the political right has come to view that day.\n \n\n   \n  But that doesn’t mean it’s a reflection of the truth.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/trump-guard-quick-reaction-force","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"16:53:00-04:00","title":"Trump’s National Guard quick reaction force largely already exists, officials say","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump's August 2025 executive order directed the Pentagon to establish a standing National Guard quick reaction force for domestic emergencies.

exists, officials say \n       \n  By Haley Britzky, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:53 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Pentagon is moving forward on orders from President Donald Trump to build a National Guard quick reaction force in each state for domestic use, though two US officials say the effort is largely making incremental changes to a mission the Guard already undertakes.\n \n\n   \n  Trump ordered that the Pentagon “ensure the availability of a standing National Guard quick reaction force that shall be resourced, trained, and available for rapid nationwide deployment,” in an August  executive order .\n \n\n   \n  But the two officials said those reaction forces already exist.\n \n\n   \n  “This whole thing – we’re already doing it,” one of the US officials said. “This is just updated guidance.”\n \n\n   \n  The officials said that plans are being developed within the Defense Department and National Guard for possible additional training or increase to the number of personnel available for existing units to meet the new requirement.\n \n\n   \n  Internal Pentagon guidance directs that most states have roughly 500 individuals dedicated to the reaction force, one of the officials said, though that number could vary depending on the size of the state.\n \n\n   \n  Some states may have to increase the size of their Guard contingent dedicated to the mission to meet that guidance.\n \n\n   \n  The Guardian was first to report on the guidance, which was issued earlier this month, with the director of operations for the Pentagon’s National Guard bureau outlining troop numbers for the quick reaction forces ordered by Trump including a total of roughly 23,500 troops nationally.\n \n\n   \n  The Guard already has two types of forces that meet this mission – the National Guard Reaction Force and the Homeland Response Force.\n \n\n   \n  The National Guard Reaction Force in each state provides “a rapid response capability focused on incidents requiring defense support of civilian authorities,” a publicly available fact sheet says.\n \n\n   \n  When needed, that force is meant to be able to deploy 25% of its personnel within the first eight hours, 50% of its personnel within 12 hours, and the entire contingent within 24 hours. Their mission, according to the fact sheet, includes civil disturbance control and personnel and site security.\n \n\n   \n  The Homeland Response Force, meanwhile, is meant to be able to assemble within six hours and support emergency response chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high-yield explosive disasters. Within that force, the US official said, is a group of roughly 200 US soldiers whose job is riot and crowd control.\n \n\n   \n  Those forces are organized matching the 10 regions the Federal Emergency Management Agency uses to subdivide US land, the US official said, meaning they are responsible for responding first for a group of states and/or territories. Region 2, for example, includes New Jersey, New York, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.\n \n\n   \n  The Pentagon guidance comes as the Trump administration has repeatedly sought to use the Guard in various states as support to law enforcement and immigration officials. The administration has been caught up in legal disputes over its deployment of the Guard in  Los Angeles ,  Portland , and  Chicago , and CNN reported Wednesday that orders for the National Guard in Washington, DC, have been  extended into 2026 .\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/thanksgiving-travel-shutdown-vance-duffy","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"16:49:00-04:00","title":"Vance and Duffy warn Thanksgiving travel ‘could be a disaster’ if shutdown barrels on","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Vice President JD Vance and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy have issued stark warnings that the ongoing government shutdown could result in a travel disaster for Americans heading home for Thanksgiving, citing the risk of unpaid federal employees—particularly air traffic controllers at the FAA—failing to show up for work.

\n  Vice President JD Vance and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned on Thursday that Americans could face a travel “disaster” as Thanksgiving approaches next month without an end in sight to the  government shutdown .\n \n\n   \n  Their comments came after Vance hosted a roundtable of aviation, travel and union leaders at the White House, during which they aired their concerns with the current state of the industry and worked out potential, temporary solutions to ease the strain on  Federal Aviation Administration employees  who are being forced to work without pay to ensure Americans can fly safely, two White House officials told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “Look it could be a disaster. It really could be, because at that point you’re talking about people have missed three paychecks. They’ve missed four paychecks. How many of them are not going to show up for work?” Vance said.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s going to lead to massive delays. We want people to be able to get home for Thanksgiving. We want people to be able to travel for business,” he continued.\n \n\n   \n  Duffy chimed in adding, “Our traffic will be snarled, but it will be a disaster in aviation.”\n \n\n   \n  American Airlines CEO Robert Isom, United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby, National Air Traffic Controllers Association President Nick Daniels, Teamsters President Sean O’Brien and American Federation of Government Employees President Everett Kelley were among those who attended Thursday’s roundtable, the officials said, in addition to nine other industry leaders.\n \n\n   \n  Behind closed doors, Vance and Duffy listened as O’Brien and Kelley laid out their concerns about the stress on their workforce, the officials told CNN. Meanwhile Isom and Kirby, in addition to a series of other airline association leaders, made clear just how damaging the shutdown was not only to their industry, but also the larger economy.\n \n\n   \n  Duffy told the group that he was working on recruiting more air traffic controllers as a temporary solution, arguing that they are most affected, they said.\n \n\n   \n  The meeting came as air traffic controllers missed their first full paycheck of the shutdown this week. Controllers, employed by the FAA, are among the government employees required to continue working without pay.\n \n\n   \n  During the first Trump administration, controller staffing shortages helped   tip the scales  to end the longest government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  In 2019, the decision by 10 air traffic controllers to call out sick temporarily shut down travel at New York’s LaGuardia Airport and caused delays at other major hubs in New Jersey, Philadelphia and Atlanta, driving President Donald Trump to agree to a temporary government funding measure.\n \n\n   \n  A CNN analysis found that reports of staffing problems at FAA facilities have more than quadrupled compared to the same period a year ago, raising broad concern over the fast-approaching Thanksgiving holiday.\n \n\n   \n  Geoff Freeman, the CEO of the US Travel Association who also attended the meeting, told CNN in a statement: “Sixty percent of Americans are already reconsidering their travel plans during the shutdown. It is costing the travel industry $1 billion a week in economic damage and that is before we get to the most important travel week of the year.”\n \n\n   \n  Despite the issues that were raised on Thursday, Vance maintained the administration’s position that the only way out of this was for Democrats to pass a clean spending bill to reopen the government.\n \n\n   \n  Freeman, as well as O’Brien and Kirby, have all now joined Republicans in calling for Congress to pass the short-term funding measure.\n \n\n   \n  “Congress should pass a clean continuing resolution now,” Freeman told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Vance reiterated that point when addressing reporters after the meeting, acknowledging that the key issue Democrats have fought with the GOP over — healthcare subsidies expiring — are valid, but that those negotiations would not happen “at the barrel of a gun.”\n \n\n   \n  “The Democrats response to that is, give us everything we want, or we’re going to shut down the government and keep it shut down. That is not reasonable behavior,” Vance said.\n \n\n   \n  Vance added that Republicans “can’t reward” Democrats for using the shutdown as a negotiating tool, because if it works, they will continue to use it — a point the officials said he also made during the roundtable.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s how a child behaves. That is not how a responsible governing party behaves in the United States of America,” Vance said.\n \n\n   \n  A White House official told CNN Thursday they have no intention or need to meet with Democrats until the government is reopened.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ll see if things change,” the official said. “Nothing to meet about right now though.”\n \n\n   \n  The full list of attendees at the White House roundtable on Thursday:\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/media/mtg-the-view-marjorie-taylor-greene-abc-disney","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"16:09:00Z","title":"Marjorie Taylor Greene to Appear on 'The View' Amid Pivot from Republicans","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican congresswoman from Georgia known for her fiery rhetoric and clashes with mainstream media, will appear on ABC’s 'The View' next week, marking a significant shift in the show’s approach to conservative voices.

Republicans, will appear on ‘The View’ next week \n       \n  By Liam Reilly, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:09 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The hosts of “The View” have said they want more conservatives to appear on the show. Next week, they’re getting one of the most outspoken: Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n \n\n   \n  The MAGA congresswoman from Georgia, long known for her fiery rhetoric and penchant for political brawling, will appear on the ABC daytime talk show next Tuesday, co-host Whoopi Goldberg announced during Thursday’s broadcast.\n \n\n   \n  After the show briefly discussed Greene as an example of a Republican lawmaker who has begun to break with her party, Goldberg said, “I’m happy to say that she’s going to be here on Tuesday.”\n \n\n   \n  Greene confirmed the news in an  X post , sharing a clip of Goldberg’s announcement and writing, “I look forward to joining the ladies on The View on Tuesday!”\n \n\n   \n  The booking of Greene is remarkable given the congresswoman’s years-long, antagonistic posture towards both “The View” and its owners at Disney. She once  railed against  “the angry, nasty women on The View” and  publicly beefed  with co-host   Joy Behar. Greene has also accused Disney of being “ pro-child predator ” for its opposition to Florida’s “Don’t Say Gay” legislation.\n \n\n   \n  “The View” co-hosts have often criticized Greene’s behavior and rhetoric. In 2023, co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin, a former Trump aide,  mocked Greene for sporting  a fur-collared jacket to a State of the Union address, saying “it looked like she skinned my puppy.”\n \n\n   \n  Greene’s appearance on “The View” will come amid the congresswoman’s apparent pivot into a rogue conservative figure willing to break with Republican leaders, especially over their shutdown strategy. (She is also set to  make her late-night TV debut  this Friday on Bill Maher’s HBO talk show; HBO and CNN share a corporate owner.)\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, “The View”  praised  Greene, calling her “the surprising voice of reason” on the GOP side of the shutdown fight.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a dark day when Marjorie Taylor Greene is the voice of reason, but you know what they say about a blind squirrel,” Farah Griffin said. “They find a nut every now and then.”\n \n\n   \n  “Frankly, we should invite her on,” co-host Ana Navarro said.\n \n\n   \n  A few weeks later, “The View” did just that.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/justice-edited-court-documents-trump-january-6","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"16:15:00Z","title":"Orwellian: Current and former prosecutors alarmed after DOJ scrubs mentions of Trump and January 6 from court records","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Justice Department faced significant criticism when it suspended two prosecutors, Carlos Valdivia and Samuel White, and removed references to former President Donald Trump's post about Barack Obama’s address and Taylor Taranto’s participation in the January 6 Capitol riot from a court sentencing memo.

CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:15 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Justice Department’s decision to sideline two US attorneys and remove mentions of Donald Trump and the US Capitol attack from court papers before the sentencing of a pardoned January 6 rioter is being viewed by former and current career prosecutors as an alarming whitewashing of history.\n \n\n   \n  The events around the case of Taylor Taranto, who was convicted of bringing illegal guns near Barack Obama’s Washington, DC, residence after talking online about violence toward the federal government, has shocked the network of Justice Department employees and alumni, several sources told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Taranto was arrested in June 2023 after claiming on an internet livestream that he had a detonator the day before, law enforcement officials  told CNN at the time,  and was searching for underground tunnels that led inside Obama and others’ homes.\n \n\n   \n  He had also been present at the Capitol riot and charged with related crimes, though he was never convicted because Trump pardoned him before a trial. He has already spent 23 months behind bars and hasn’t been detained since he was pardoned.\n \n\n   \n  Judge Carl Nichols, a 2019 Trump appointee, had found him guilty at trial in May of the gun crimes and for making a false threat to use a car bomb against a federal building.\n \n\n   \n  In a  sentencing memo for Taranto filed Tuesday , prosecutors Carlos Valdivia and Samuel White wrote that after “then-former President Donald Trump published on a social media platform the purported address of former President Barack Obama,” Taranto had re-posted Trump “and thereafter started livestreaming from his van” as he drove through Obama’s neighborhood.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s original post – which included the Obama address – was itself a repost of a blog article.\n \n\n   \n  Politico reporter Kyle Cheney highlighted the filing and mentioned it also included Taranto taking part in the January 6 riot, on the social media platform X late Tuesday night. Within 24 hours, the court filing was no longer available in the court record and the two prosecutors who had signed it were suspended from their jobs.\n \n\n   \n  In the original memo, Valdivia and White wrote that “Taranto was accused of participating in the riot in Washington, D.C., by entering the U.S. Capitol Building” and “after the riot, Taranto returned to his home in the State of Washington, where he promoted conspiracy theories about the events of January 6, 2021.”\n \n\n   \n  Two new prosecutors then  filed an amended version  of the sentencing memo to the court on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  That new memo scrubbed all references to Trump and him posting Obama’s supposed address – which Taranto had reposted – as well as Taranto’s participation and conviction related to the January 6, 2021, US Capitol attack.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s shocking that prosecutors could be put on leave for accurately stating the court record in a sentencing memo, and it’s just as shocking that those truthful statements have been whitewashed in a revised filing,” said Stacey Young, a former Justice Department attorney and now executive director and founder of Justice Connection, which works to represent the viewpoints of former federal prosecutors, especially those who have been fired by the Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n  “These prosecutors did their job and upheld their duty of candor by informing the court of clearly established facts relevant to their case,” Young added.\n \n\n   \n  Jeanine Pirro, the US Attorney in Washington, DC, did not comment on the suspensions and filing changes when asked about it during a news conference Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the papers speak for themselves, and what goes on in this office is not something that I’m going to comment on. Thank you,” Pirro said.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Orwellian’\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, the moves made by the Justice Department had employees reeling within the US Attorney’s Office in DC and the FBI, which had investigated and caught Taranto, believing he was a danger to the public in 2023, people familiar with the office told CNN on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  One source called the sentencing memo change “Orwellian.”\n \n\n   \n  Valdivia had no indication he may have employment issues — especially given that on Tuesday, the day before his suspension, he helped to secure a guilty verdict from a jury in a fraud case where he was on the trial team, according to two people familiar with the US Attorney’s Office.\n \n\n   \n  Separately, White is a supervisor on Superior Court cases and was a US Marine.\n \n\n   \n  A Justice Department spokesperson told CNN on Wednesday following the suspensions: “While we don’t comment on personnel decisions, we want to make very clear that we take violence and threats of violence against law enforcement, current or former government officials extremely seriously. We have and will continue to vigorously pursue justice against those who commit or threaten violence without regard to the political party of the offender or the target.”\n \n\n   \n  The spokesperson declined to clarify if the comments were about Taranto’s 2023 actions toward Obama, or his participation in the Capitol riot in 2021, in which a mob of Trump supporters injured multiple people, including many police protecting the federal building.\n \n\n   \n  The move by Justice Department officials to place the two attorneys on leave and erase all mention of Trump posting Obama’s address or Taranto’s participation in the events of January 6 comes at a time when administration officials have already worked to fire scores of federal prosecutors and officers they see as potential roadblocks in their efforts to use the DOJ against political opponents.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors in the Eastern District of Virginia were recently pushed out of the Justice Department after failing to indict New York Attorney General Letitia James and many prosecutors who worked on January 6 cases were removed from the DC US Attorney’s office earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n    Taranto sentenced to 21 months\n \n\n   \n  When Taranto was initially investigated, one source said, he had been on federal law enforcement radar because he had been at the January 6 riot. But federal authorities focused on him after he livestreamed a video in 2023 where he threatened bombing federal facilities, and law enforcement then arrested him near Obama’s Washington address.\n \n\n   \n  Taranto was arrested that day and law enforcement officials found guns and hundreds of rounds of ammunition in his van. He was later found guilty by Nichols of several gun related charges and making false threats that he would drive a car bomb into a federal building.\n \n\n   \n  The DOJ continued to seek the 27-month sentence originally sought by White and Valdivia, who said in court documents that Taranto has also made threats against former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and Maryland Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin.\n \n\n   \n  Taranto’s attorney asked the court to sentence him to time served in jail already, with no further detention. The defense attorney, Carmen Hernandez, has asked for rehabilitation that the court could order, noting Taranto’s past military service and post-traumatic stress disorder diagnosis, according to a filing on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Typically, a defendant’s history and characteristics become part of court arguments for or against leniency when a judge decides a sentence.\n \n\n   \n  At a hearing Thursday, Nichols sentenced Taranto to 21 months in prison, essentially covered by time served.\n \n\n   \n  Nichols found that Taranto “made troubling statements” in his online livestream but noted he had no criminal history and his conduct “was far from egregious.”\n \n\n   \n  Taranto spoke briefly during Thursday’s hearing, not to apologize for his conduct but to highlight a book on the 1787 constitutional convention and mention that some people questioned the results of the 2020 election.\n \n\n   \n  “I would like to keep people’s minds open,” he concluded.\n \n\n   \n  The judge also said he thought the two prosecutors placed on leave “upheld the highest standard” throughout the case.\n \n\n   \n  “My view is that they did a commendable and exceptional job,” Nichols said of the prosecutors, adding that he felt “they did a truly excellent job in this case.”\n \n\n   \n  White and Valdivia attended Taranto’s sentencing and declined to comment.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Hannah Rabinowitz and Casey Gannon contributed to this report. \n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/politics/gift-tracker-trump-foreign-leaders-vis","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"15:24:00Z","title":"Gold crown, golf clubs and a jet: Tracking Trump’s gifts from foreign leaders this year","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During Donald Trump’s second term in office, foreign leaders from Asia and beyond have sent him a range of unusual and personal gifts, including a gold crown, golf clubs, and a jet, reflecting strategic efforts to demonstrate respect, build goodwill, and strengthen diplomatic ties.

\n       \n  By Annie Grayer, Ellis Kim, Morgan Rimmer, Manu Raju, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:39 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Democrats say the Trump administration still won’t share critical details of  recent US military strikes  on suspected drug boats in the western hemisphere, asserting that Pentagon lawyers were pulled at the last minute Thursday from a briefing on Capitol Hill.\n \n\n   \n  As they emerged from the closed-door session, they railed on the administration for not being transparent and appearing to flout the law. The briefing came a day after  Democrats say they were shut out of another meeting  where administration officials shared information on the strikes with their Republican colleagues.\n \n\n   \n  “Am I leaving satisfied? Absolutely not. And the last word that I gave to the admiral was, ‘I hope you recognize the constitutional peril that you are in and the peril you are putting our troops in’,” Democratic Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts told reporters of the Thursday briefing.\n \n\n   \n  “What I heard here today was a tactical brief. I heard no strategy, no end game, no assessment of how they are going to end the flow of drugs into the United States, which needs to happen, by the way,” Colorado Rep. Jason Crow, who sits on the House Armed Services and the Intelligence committees, said.\n \n\n   \n  Fuming at a separate press conference over his accusation that the White House  cut Democrats out  of a Wednesday briefing, Sen. Mark Warner had an even sharper take: “bullsh*t.”\n \n\n   \n  “Let me be blunt, what the administration did in the last 24 hours is corrosive, not only to our democracy, but downright dangerous for our national security,” Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration in recent weeks has accelerated its attacks against boats they allege are involved in drug trafficking. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have repeatedly criticized the administration for failing to provide them with enough information related to those strikes.\n \n\n   \n  The administration has defended its information sharing with Congress, telling CNN earlier this week it has given  seven separate classified briefings  on the strikes to various committees. But the information that Pentagon officials have offered so far on those attacks during closed-door briefings has largely fueled more questions and concerns from Democrats about the administration’s legal justification for them – especially as only select Republicans have been allowed to see the classified legal opinion detailing that argument.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats said the information provided to them Thursday fell short of what they needed to provide proper congressional checks on the president’s war powers.\n \n\n   \n  “I sit on the Armed Services and the Intelligence Committee. Our job is to oversee the use of lethal force by our military outside of the United States, and I’m walking away without an understanding of how and why they’re making an assessment that the use of lethal force is adequate here,” Crow said.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Rep. Sara Jacobs of California similarly said “the level of transparency was not OK” and added that “there’s nothing that we heard in there that changes my assessment that this is completely illegal, that it is unlawful and even if Congress authorized it, it would still be illegal because there are extrajudicial killings where we have no evidence.”\n \n\n   \n  The briefers, Jacobs said, only cited Article II as the legal justification for the strikes and said they didn’t know the identities of all of the individuals involved in them. They also told lawmakers that cocaine was the only narcotic targeted in the strikes so far and claimed it is a “facilitating drug of fentanyl,” according to the congresswoman. “It was not a satisfactory answer for most of us,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the Pentagon for comment.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to the Democratic ranking members, Republican chairmen of the House Intelligence and Armed Services committees attended the meeting but declined to comment to reporters afterward.\n \n\n   \n  Rep. Mike Rogers, the Armed Services chairman, would only tell CNN he expects an additional briefing.\n \n\n   \n    Republicans defend need for bipartisan briefings\n \n\n   \n  Still, several Senate Republicans said Democrats should have been invited to Wednesday’s briefing on the Caribbean boat strikes, though they insisted their exclusion wasn’t malicious.\n \n\n   \n  “This is an unfortunate situation, and I wish it wouldn’t have happened this way. It did, but I’ve talked to a number of my colleagues already and told them that we still agree that this should be delivered on a bipartisan basis,” Sen. Mike Rounds, who sits on the Senate Intelligence and Armed Services committees, said.\n \n\n   \n  Rounds added that his understanding was that several GOP senators had requested a further briefing on the legality of the strikes, and other Republicans, including him, also asked to be included.\n \n\n   \n  “When I got into the meeting, I realized that there were people from a lot of different committees, but I couldn’t identify the group in particular, but there were no Democrats there,” he said. “And so afterwards, we went back and followed up. The White House called us and said, ‘Yeah, this was a separate meeting. It was asked for by one of your colleagues.’ We just happen to have also been invited to it, and that is consistent with what we saw.”\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Kevin Cramer agreed that his Democratic colleagues should have access to the same briefings as Republicans.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think that any administration should leave out any party from a briefing of that level of importance. And I think their justification — you can argue it, and no doubt people will — but I don’t think that something of that importance shouldn’t be shared. Whether it’s legal justification or if there’s — if there are details about who are on these boats and what these boats are containing, you know, the tactics, I think all of that should be available to people who oversee the Pentagon,” Cramer said.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Democrats didn’t hide their their frustration with the administration.\n \n\n   \n  “It is totally unprecedented in my 15 years of service in the United States Senate that intelligence briefings on a matter of this consequence would be held for one party alone,” said an angry Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal.\n \n\n   \n  “It speaks volumes to this administration concealing the facts and worrying about the law.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/health/credit-scores-medical-debt-kff-health-news","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"15:49:00-04:00","title":"Trump team takes aim at state laws shielding consumers’ credit scores from medical debt","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration, through the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, issued new guidance asserting that federal law prohibits states from shielding medical debt from appearing on credit reports, reversing a prior Biden-era policy that empowered states to protect consumers from such debt.

The aid is tied up in the current budget showdown between congressional Republicans and Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  “You’d be hard-pressed to find a crueler regulatory interpretation,” said Elisabeth Benjamin, a vice president for the Community Service Society of New York. The nonprofit has pushed for medical debt protections in that state.\n \n\n   \n  Lucy Culp, who oversees state lobbying efforts by Blood Cancer United, formerly known as the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, warned that the Trump administration’s guidance could reverberate across the country. “This rule will have a chilling effect on states’ willingness to pass these critical patient protections,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The CFPB did not respond to a request for comment.\n \n\n   \n  The new CFPB guidance might spur more litigation challenging state restrictions on medical debt credit reporting.\n \n\n   \n  Trade groups representing credit reporting agencies and debt collectors went to court early this year challenging  regulations issued by the Biden administration  that would have removed medical debt from credit reports nationwide. They argued that the administration exceeded its authority in issuing the credit reporting restrictions.\n \n\n   \n  The federal restrictions would have helped an estimated 15 million people. But the Trump administration chose not to defend the new regulations, and a federal judge in Texas appointed by Trump ruled that the regulations should be scrapped. They never went into effect.\n \n\n   \n  The Consumer Data Industry Association, which represents credit agencies and has argued that regulating medical debt should be left to the federal government, welcomed the new guidance from the Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n  “There should be one national standard to govern how information is provided to consumer reporting agencies and what information can appear on a consumer’s credit report,” association president Dan Smith said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Broader health insurance protections could prevent more Americans from sinking into debt and depressing their credit scores.\n \n\n   \n  But millions of Americans  are expected  to lose health coverage in the coming years as a result of the tax and spending bill signed by the president in July.\n \n\n   \n  “Millions of Americans are avoiding medical care, putting off needed surgeries, skipping essential treatments,” said Allison Sesso, president and chief executive of Undue Medical Debt, a nonprofit that buys up and retires patients’ debts and advocates for broader patient protections.\n \n\n   \n  “This isn’t just a health care issue,” Sesso added. “It’s an economic crisis that’s keeping families from building wealth and fully participating in the economy.

of their teenage years\n \n\n   \n    Why does Andrew live in Royal Lodge?\n \n\n   \n  The late Queen Elizabeth II granted Andrew, the third of her four children, the right to live in the lodge, which is officially owned by the Crown Estate. The prince paid £1 million for the property in 2003, and under the terms of the 75-year lease, which was due to expire on June 15, 2078, he was expected to pay for any refurbishment work and the maintenance of the surrounding grounds.\n \n\n   \n  He was also required upfront to pay £7.5 million ($10 million) to cover necessary refurbishments that were completed in 2005, according to a  National Audit Office report.  According to the lease, signed on August 8, 2003, rent “if demanded” was only required to be “one peppercorn” per annum.\n \n\n   \n  The property sits in an estate of 40 hectares (99 acres) and features a swimming pool, an aviary, six lodge cottages, a gardener’s cottage and accommodation for police protecting the royals to stay in.\n \n\n   \n  It is situated within Windsor Great Park, close to Windsor Castle, Frogmore Cottage (where the Duke and Duchess of Sussex previously lived) and Forest Lodge, the Windsor residence of the Prince and Princess of Wales.\n \n\n   \n  There had been intense media speculation in recent weeks over Prince Andrew’s continued occupancy of Royal Lodge. Before Thursday’s announcement, Buckingham Palace and the Crown Estate had declined to comment on reports that he was in talks to leave the residence.\n \n\n   \n    Two centuries of royal residents\n \n\n   \n  A house has stood on the site since at least the 1660s, although it has undergone considerable updates and renovations since then. Its first links with the royal family came in the early 19th century when George IV, then the prince regent, converted the rustic-styled cottage into a hunting lodge and then private retreat. By the mid-1820s it had become known as Royal Lodge.\n \n\n   \n  After George died in 1830, much of the structure was pulled down by William IV and it was used as a “grace and favor” residence for most of the rest of the century.\n \n\n   \n  The Royal Chapel was added to the site in 1865, but, though situated within the grounds of the lodge, it does not come under the current lease.\n \n\n   \n  The property was rebuilt during the 1930s around a room remaining from George IV’s original cottage.\n \n\n   \n  Prince Andrew’s late mother, Queen Elizabeth II, lived in the lodge as a child, moving there with her parents — then the Duke and Duchess of York — in 1932. The family remained at Royal Lodge until the duke and duchess were crowned four years later, following the abdication of Edward VIII.\n \n\n   \n  Following her husband’s death in 1952 and the coronation of her daughter, Elizabeth II, the Queen Mother used the Royal Lodge as her Windsor residence until her death in 2002.\n \n\n   \n  After his grandmother died, Prince Andrew approached the Crown Estate about acquiring the leasehold on the property. The property was not offered to the wider market because of its sensitive location in the heart of Windsor Great Park and the need for security, given its proximity to the Royal Chapel.\n \n\n   \n    What changes has Andrew made?\n \n\n   \n  The renovation work that Andrew carried out on the family property included internal alterations to the tiled ceiling, external repainting, new tarmac for the gate entrance and light fittings and cameras for outside the lodge, according to a planning application lodged with the Royal Borough of Windsor & Maidenhead.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier planning applications show that the local authorities granted permission to build a single-story property to accommodate police officers protecting the site in 1990, and permission was given for the construction of a conservatory in 2001.\n \n\n   \n    Queen Elizabeth’s fairy-tale playhouse\n \n\n   \n  Also in the grounds is Y Bwthyn Bach, which translates from Welsh as “little cottage.” The miniature thatched cottage was given by the people of Wales to the late Queen Elizabeth II on her sixth birthday and was where she and her sister, Princess Margaret, played as children — as did their children and grandchildren.\n \n\n   \n  In a 2012 BBC documentary called “The Diamond Queen,” Princess Beatrice said she and her sister had been “lucky enough” to play there together with their cousins as children.\n \n\n   \n  She described it as the “most glamorous Wendy house ever” and said that she spent about a year overseeing its renovation. This, she said, involved new wiring, new curtains and completely rethatching the cottage to give it a “bit of a spruce-up.”   \n \n\n   \n  Viewers got to see the princess take host Andrew Marr inside the miniature property, which was fully furnished and complete with furniture, crockery and glassware and a fridge from the 1930s.\n \n\n   \n  In 2018, Prince Andrew and his former wife hosted the wedding celebrations for their younger daughter, Eugenie, and her husband, Jack Brooksbank, at the lodge following the official ceremony at St. George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle.   \n \n\n   \n  In 2020, Eugenie’s sister, Beatrice, tied the knot on the estate itself, marrying Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi in a small ceremony in the chapel while Covid-19 restrictions were in place.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/science/interstellar-comet-3i-atlas-sun","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"16:20:00Z","title":"Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS just made its closest pass of the sun.

Discover where it’s going next \n       \n  By Ashley Strickland, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:20 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  An interstellar comet that originated outside our solar system just made its closest pass of the sun, setting it on an outgoing path — but it’s not leaving our cosmic neighborhood yet.\n \n\n   \n  The comet, dubbed 3I/ATLAS, came within about   126 million miles (203 million kilometers) of our star, according to  EarthSky . The object is currently behind the sun from the perspective of ground-based telescopes on Earth, but astronomers anticipate being able to view the comet again in a few weeks, said Darryl Seligman, assistant professor in the department of physics and astronomy at Michigan State University.\n \n\n   \n  Stargazers using telescopes should be able to see the object in the predawn sky beginning November 11, according to EarthSky.\n \n\n   \n  Astronomers will have a few more months to observe the comet before it begins heading   out of our solar system, Seligman said.\n \n\n   \n  The comet will make its closest approach of Earth on December 19, coming within about 168 million miles (270 million kilometers) — but it poses no threat to our planet, according to the  European Space Agency .\n \n\n   \n  Astronomers have been observing the comet, only the third known interstellar object to pass through our solar system, since its discovery on July 1.\n \n\n   \n  Each observation is shedding light on this interstellar object and how different it may be from comets that originated in our solar system.\n \n\n   \n    The ingredients of an interstellar comet\n \n\n   \n  Comets are like dirty snowballs left over from the formation of solar systems.\n \n\n   \n  A comet’s nucleus is its solid core, made of ice, dust and rocks. When comets travel near stars such as the sun, heat causes them to release gas and dust, which creates their signature tails.\n \n\n   \n  Astronomers are interested in capturing as many observations of the comet as they can because as it nears the sun, material releasing from the object could reveal more about its composition — and the star system where it originated.\n \n\n   \n  “When it gets closest to the sun, you get the most holistic view of the nucleus possible,” Seligman said. “One of the main things driving most cometary scientists is, what is the composition of the volatiles? It shows you the initial primordial material that it formed from.”\n \n\n   \n  Scientists have used powerful tools, such as the Hubble Space and James Webb Space telescopes, along with a multitude of space-based missions, such as  SPHEREx , to study the comet.\n \n\n   \n  The SPHEREx and Webb observations detected carbon dioxide, water, carbon monoxide,  carbonyl sulphide  and water ice releasing from the comet as it neared the sun, according to the ESA.\n \n\n   \n  Preliminary estimates indicate that the interstellar comet is 3 billion   to 11 billion years old, according to a  study  coauthored by Seligman and Aster Taylor, a doctoral student and Fannie and John Hertz Foundation Fellow at the University of Michigan, in August. For reference, our solar system is estimated to be about 4.6 billion years old.\n \n\n   \n  Carbon dioxide turns directly from a solid into a gas in response to temperature changes much more easily than most elements — which means the comet has likely never been close to another star before its brush with the sun, Seligman said.\n \n\n   \n    All eyes on 3I/ATLAS\n \n\n   \n  The interstellar comet faded from the view of ground-based telescopes in October, but it remained in sight for missions such as  PUNCH , or Polarimeter to Unify the Corona and Heliosphere, and  SOHO , or the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory. The object also made its closest approach of Mars on October 3, coming within 18.6 million miles (30 million kilometers) of the red planet — and the spacecraft orbiting it.\n \n\n   \n  While the government shutdown has prevented data sharing from any NASA missions that have observed the comet since October 1, the ESA’s Mars Express and ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter attempted to capture views of 3I/ATLAS in October.\n \n\n   \n  The cameras aboard those missions are designed to study the relatively close, bright surface of Mars, but ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter managed to observe the comet as a fuzzy white dot.\n \n\n   \n  “This was a very challenging observation for the instrument,” Nick Thomas, principal investigator of the orbiter’s camera, said in a statement, noting the comet is around 10,000 to 100,000 times “fainter than our usual target.”\n \n\n   \n  ESA’s  Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer , or Juice, will also attempt to observe 3I/ATLAS in November using multiple instruments despite the comet being farther from the spacecraft than it was when observed by   the Mars orbiters. But astronomers don’t expect to receive the observations until February due to the rate at which the spacecraft is sending data back to Earth.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve got several more months to observe it,” Seligman said. “And there’s going to be amazing science that comes out.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5589849","dateOfPublication":"2024-04-24","timeOfPublication":"20:30:00.000Z","title":"The Role of Cultural Exchange in Sustainable Development in the Digital Age","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the increasing significance of cultural exchange in today's interconnected world.

Here's what that means across the country \n         By The NPR Network \n        \n           Updated Friday, October 31, 2025 • 7:34 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         The federal government shutdown has dragged into another week, and Republicans and Democrats appear no closer to ending it. Many  federal workers have missed paychecks , including  air traffic controllers , who are working unpaid.  Meanwhile,  uncertainty remains  for  tens of millions of people  who rely on  federal food and nutrition benefits  like Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, previously known as food stamps. The benefits had been set to expire on Saturday due to the government shutdown. Two federal judges on Friday ordered the Trump administration to use emergency funding to provide the benefits. But it was unclear after the rulings how much assistance may be provided or when it might come. Read the latest about the pair of SNAP rulings   and also, learn  how some food banks are bracing for SNAP funding to lapse The  Agriculture Department says  it will reopen about 2,100 county offices despite the government shutdown to  help farmers get access to $3 billion of aid . At the same time  many American farmers  say the Trump administration's trade policies have them on the brink. As the shutdown continues, here's the latest on what we know. Jump to state-specific impacts. Why did the federal government shut down? A  partisan argument  over if and when lawmakers need to act to extend subsidies for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces led to the current shutdown. Some  24 million people  — who don't have insurance through their jobs or a public program like Medicaid — use the system to buy health plans.  Prominent Republican lawmakers have claimed the Democrats are looking to provide tax dollars to help pay for the health care of undocumented immigrants. That is  not true . Democrats in the Senate  refused to vote  for the Republican short-term funding bill that passed the House but did not include an extension of the health care tax credits. Democrats are also hoping to repeal cuts to health care programs that were put in place as part of the GOP  spending and tax bill  that passed over the summer. NPR's Deirdre Walsh reports that some Democrats say Nov. 1 could be a  key date in talks to loosen the current gridlock . That date marks the beginning of open enrollment for people getting coverage through the ACA, when subscribers could  see big premium increases  unless the subsidies that have been helping people pay for coverage since 2021 are extended. Read more about more about the health care fight behind the shutdown here. Plus, why Democrats are casting the government shutdown as  a health care showdown . —  Selena Simmons-Duffin , NPR What about WIC and SNAP benefits ? There are no SNAP food benefits available for millions of people as of Nov. 1. It's the first time the country's largest anti-hunger program has been suspended since it began six decades ago.  On Friday,  two federal judges said this pause is likely unlawful , and the Trump administration must use emergency funds to keep the program going. But it's not clear exactly how or when that may happen. $5.5 billion in emergency funds also falls short of SNAP's November budget, which is $9 billion. That means even if the administration restarts funding, people may not get the full amount of food assistance they are eligible for. Cities and states across the country are tapping emergency funds and ramping up food donations to help the 42 million SNAP recipients. A separate nutrition program is also at risk. The Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) provides nutrition education, breastfeeding support, and other healthcare screenings for 7 million people. Last month the Trump administration shifted $300 million to keep WIC going a few more weeks. Some states are now using emergency funds to keep clinics open and benefits available, but the National WIC Association says those funds are  running out quickly . —  Jennifer Ludden , NPR Read more on the impact of this potential lapse across the country, here.  — and you can  read more here about how food banks are bracing for it   What about Head Start? Beginning Nov. 1,  more than 65,000 children will be at risk of losing access to Head Start , the federal early-learning program for low-income families. That's because federal funding for individual Head Start programs cannot be disbursed while the government is shut down. Among the states  hit hardest  by this Nov. 1 deadline: Florida, Georgia, Missouri and Ohio. Nationally, Head Start serves roughly 750,000 infants, toddlers and preschool-age children, providing not just childcare and early learning but also free meals, health screenings and family support. Local Head Start programs are funded annually, though at different times of the year. Some programs get their money on Oct. 1, others on Nov. 1 and so on. If the shutdown lasts until December, says Tommy Sheridan of the National Head Start Association, still more programs would see their funding run out. Without federal funding, Sheridan says, some programs will have to close immediately. Others have the resources to stay open at least another week, in hopes that politicians in Washington can resolve their differences. —  Cory Turner  and  Kadin Mills , NPR What the shutdown means for federal workers Altogether,  about 1.4 million civilian federal employees  across the country are going without pay,  according to the Bipartisan Policy Center , a think tank in Washington, D.C. Of those, roughly half are furloughed, which means they are not working and not getting paid, but expect to return to work once the federal shutdown is over. The other half have been deemed essential and so are continuing to work. By law federal workers are supposed to get back pay once the shutdown ends, but   the White House has tried to cast doubt on that. The Senate has  failed to advance a pair of competing measures  to pay at least some federal employees during the government shutdown.  The Trump administration has managed to move money around to ensure that some people get paid, including active duty military and law enforcement officers with the Department of Homeland Security. Many other federal workers are also still getting paid as usual during the shutdown. Salaries for some federal employees, including the vast majority of those at the Department of Veterans Affairs, do not come out of appropriations that Congress must approve every year. Are government workers being laid off during the shutdown? The Trump administration has been following through on threats to   further slash the size of government during the shutdown, seeking to layoff roughly 4,000 workers earlier this month. Some unions that represent workers are fighting back in court ;  the federal judge overseeing the case on Tuesday  indefinitely halted  the Trump administration's shutdown layoffs, noting human toll. The order applies to federal employees in programs or offices where the plaintiff unions have members or bargaining units. How is the shutdown impacting active duty military?  The White House has identified additional funding for the latest round of military paychecks despite the shutdown, according to a spokesperson for the Office of Management and Budget. The spokesperson says that the agency is using around $5 billion from a military housing fund, a military research and development fund and a Defense Department account used for building ships. NPR asked if part of the money is also coming from a $130 million donation made by a billionaire Trump ally, but the OMB did not respond. The Trump administration  earlier this month found unused research and development funds to pay many active military members  so they wouldn't miss a full paycheck earlier this month, according to a Pentagon official not authorized to speak publicly.  Military families are already seeking additional assistance from food banks and other groups to help with paying bills. USPS is 'open for business as usual' \"U.S. Postal Service operations will not be interrupted,\" according to a  statement by USPS . The postal service is primarily self-funded and doesn't depend on the appropriations process to continue running as usual. IRS furloughs nearly half its staff A  contingency plan  from the Treasury Department says that slightly more than half of the IRS' approximately 74,000 workers remain on the job and will continue to work for the foreseeable future. Some IRS employees  were issued  reduction in force, or RIF, notices  on Friday and posted screenshots of those notices informing them of their last day, Dec. 9. The contingency plan says nearly all of those employees who continue to work will be paid using sources other than annual appropriations, which are on hold during the shutdown. Tasks will include completing and testing systems to handle next year's tax-filing season, and maintaining computers to prevent the loss of data. —  Scott Horsley ,  Andrea Hsu  and  Stephen Fowler , NPR National Nuclear Security Administration furloughs 1,400 employees On Oct. 20, the National Nuclear Security Administration, which oversees the nation's nuclear weapons, said it is furloughing approximately 1,400 employees. The agency is responsible for overseeing thousands of warheads that are not currently deployed on missiles, bombers and submarines. According to an Energy Department spokesperson, the furloughs are due to the \"Democrat shutdown.\" Roughly 400 employees remain on the job providing security and safety oversight. And the office responsible for moving nuclear weapons around the country remains funded until next week. —  Geoff Brumfiel , NPR In addition, Nevada Public Radio is reporting  more than 1,000 nuclear contractors in Nevada  could receive notices by the end of the month, because their work relies on the federal government remaining open. Teachers and schools won't be directly impacted, but federal education functions might Eighty-seven percent of Department of Education employees  have been temporary furloughed , as detailed in agency shutdown contingency plans. At the same time, the administration is trying to use a new round of layoffs to gut multiple offices inside the department, including the Office for Civil Rights and the office responsible for overseeing special education, according to multiple sources within the department. This latest reduction-in-force (RIF) cut at least 121 staffers responsible for overseeing roughly  $15 billion  in special education funding and for making sure states provide special education services to the nation's more than 7.5 million children with disabilities. The courts  have halted  those layoffs. If they're ultimately allowed to go through, multiple sources told NPR the special education office would be left with just a handful of top executives and support staff. In addition, many Department of Education employees who were furloughed  were surprised to see  a message blaming Democrats for the government shutdown inserted into their out-of-office replies. A federal workers union is  suing the Trump administration  for inserting the language into employees' out-of-office email messages. —  Shannon Bond  and  Cory Turner , NPR The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) for 2026 went live as scheduled at the start of October. As WPR's  Corrinne Hess  reports, the U.S. Department of Education says that  student financial aid programs will continue , despite the shutdown. National Parks are a mixed bag Across the country, the National Park Service (NPS) have  brought their operations to a halt . That includes the National Zoo and other Smithsonian facilities. NPR's Alana Wise  reports that the Smithsonian assured the public  that animals would still be cared for during the zoo's closure.  Animal cams  are considered nonessential and will be turned off for the remainder of the shutdown. As  KQED's Sarah Wright and Carly Severn reported , a contingency plan for the NPS says that park roads, lookouts and trails \"will generally remain accessible to visitors\" for the duration of the shutdown, but other services such as regular road and trail condition updates would not be provided. Concerns have also been raised about the safety and responsibility of keeping parks open without having a robust number of employees available to conduct critical services. The Salem, Mass. visitor center will be open through Halloween thanks to community support WBUR's Andrea Shea reports  that local leaders in Salem, Mass., learned a National Park Service visitor center and its bathrooms would be closed during their busiest tourist season so they took action on a plan to keep them open. Shea reports that  NPS agreed to let Salem reopen the center if the community covered costs  through Halloween weekend. Annie Harris — CEO of the non-profit Essex Heritage that helps staff and run the facility — sent out a flurry of emails including to the mayor. Within 48 hours businesses and non-profits raised $18,000 — keeping the center open until Nov. 2. Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security benefits will continue Social Security,   VA  and other benefits will continue. But employees at Social Security field offices earlier this month said the  government shutdown  has left them  unable to carry out an important service for some recipients . As NPR's Ashley Lopez reports, workers say they are unable to provide benefit verification letters to people calling in to request them. These  official letters  act as a sort of income verification and are therefore key to obtaining aid like housing assistance, fuel assistance and help from nonprofits. In an Oct. 21 email to users answering commonly asked questions about how shutdown impacts, SSA noted the online portal can still be used to access benefit verification letters. Some furloughed employees at the Labor Department were brought back to work, in order to complete the September inflation report, which is a key ingredient used to calculate the cost of living adjustment that Social Security recipients will receive next year. Last week,  the SSA said the payments to recipients will increase by 2.8% next year , or an increase of about $56 per month starting in January.

trail becomes popular stop for Democrats with eyes on 2028 \n       \n  By Arlette Saenz, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:43 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The  2025 campaign trail  has become a popular stop for potential 2028 presidential hopefuls looking to help the Democratic Party’s candidates for governor.\n \n\n   \n  Pete Buttigieg joined Democratic nominee Rep. Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey Thursday morning to criticize President Donald Trump’s threats to cancel a major commuter rail project connecting her state and New York City. In Virginia, Democratic Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona appeared with the party’s nominee Abigail Spanberger to rally Latino voters before holding a similar event with Sherrill in her state this weekend.\n \n\n   \n  Buttigieg and Gallego’s appearances come as the off-year and midterm elections have turned into an early testing ground for 2028 presidential hopefuls – giving them a chance to sharpen their campaign skills outside of their home states and help elevate fellow Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  Most of the high-profile Democratic surrogate work has played out in the gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  But the New York City mayoral race has drawn the progressive star power of hometown Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, an ardent backer of Democratic nominee  Zohran Mamdani . And in California,  Gov. Gavin Newsom’s Prop 50 campaign  to push through mid-decade redistricting in his state has further propelled him into the national conversation.\n \n\n   \n  “If you’re thinking about future campaigns, it’s smart to have a strategy that’s not just about going to the primary states but also showing that you’re a team player in the Democratic Party and that your message can help turn voters out,” said Jared Leopold, a Democratic strategist who previously worked for the Democratic Governors Association.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, Buttigieg, a former transportation secretary, touted his work with Sherrill to secure funding for the Gateway Tunnel project, a rail project between New Jersey and New York City that Trump said he had “terminated” earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  Buttigieg described the move as “mob boss politics” and criticized Sherrill’s  Republican opponent Jack Ciattarelli  for not having “the backbone” to push back on the president.\n \n\n   \n  “This state needs a governor who can think for herself, and someone who will put the best interest of the state first. And there’s only one candidate who will do that,” Buttigieg said at an event with Sherrill at a Westfield, NJ, train station.\n \n\n   \n  Buttigieg was slated later Thursday to help turn out voters in Red Bank and raise money for the New Jersey Democratic State Committee. His appearances with Sherrill came one week after he headlined an event with Spanberger and Bill Nye, “The Science Guy,” in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of his stop with Sherrill this week, Buttigieg sent an e-mail to his fundraising list saying he was “back on the campaign trail” to help candidates across the country.\n \n\n   \n  Gallego, who has said the Democratic Party needs to do more to win back Latino voters, is tapped this week with taking that pitch to Latino communities in Virginia and New Jersey, a state where the  Latino vote could be key  to picking the next governor.\n \n\n   \n  “Every day, all we want is to have a chance at the American Dream, to be able to build a family here, to have a chance to continue to grow this country and the beautiful vision that everyone has,” Gallego said Thursday at a “Latinos for Spanberger” event in Alexandria, Virginia. “And this is why we as Latinos have to come out and vote today and all the way until Tuesday, because the only way we get that dream is when we have friends that care about us.”\n \n\n   \n    Big names out on the campaign trail for Democrats\n \n\n   \n  Several sitting Democratic governors potentially eyeing higher office have descended on New Jersey and Virginia to give a boost to the women they hope will join their ranks next year. That includes Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear; Maryland Gov. Wes Moore; Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker; Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro; and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.\n \n\n   \n  “The big names you’re hearing in the Democratic Party are more and more governors,” said Leopold. “It’s especially helpful if you’re running for governor to have a governor campaign with you to show the executive experience and show what a governor can do.”\n \n\n   \n   New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker  has been a frequent surrogate for Sherrill in his home state. Other high-profile Democratic surrogates who have hit the campaign trail in New Jersey or Virginia this year include Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly; Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar; California Rep. Ro Khanna and former US Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel, who is now a CNN commentator.\n \n\n   \n  “These are the type of leaders that are focused on the everyday problems, the everyday concerns of Americans, and that can be the type of leaders that re-earn the faith of the American people,” Beshear, vice chair of the Democratic Governors Association, said of Sherrill and Spanberger during a virtual event with the Democratic National Committee Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats also have helped raise money for the off-year candidates. Newsom, who has said he will make a  decision about 2028  after the midterms, participated in a virtual fundraiser with Sherrill for New Jersey’s Democratic campaigns and state committee, a source familiar with the event said. Meanwhile, Pritzker has donated six-figures across the New Jersey and Virginia races, a source familiar with the matter said.\n \n\n   \n  While 2028 hopefuls on the Democratic side have eagerly stumped during this year’s off-year elections, the Republican side has not drawn as much attention from presidential aspirants.\n \n\n   \n  Texas Sen. Ted Cruz joined Virginia’s Republican gubernatorial nominee  Winsome Earle-Sears  last week for a fundraiser. New Jersey’s GOP gubernatorial nominee Ciattarelli has recently campaigned with Rep.

NPR's series  Population Shift: How Smaller Families Are Changing the World  explores the causes and implications of this trend. At an indoor play center in Cheyenne, Wyo., a sea of toddlers throw around colorful blocks and balls. Grace Moreno, who is 21, is there with her 11-month-old son, who is dressed in pajamas with little firetrucks on them. \"It's the only free place, so it's worth it,\" she said. Finances are tight for Moreno and her husband. They moved to Wyoming from Texas, while pregnant, so her husband could work a higher-paying electrician job. But now that they are parents, paychecks seem to disappear. \"Our rent in Texas was like $800,\" Moreno said. \"Here, it's like $1,775.\" Rent is their biggest cost. They spend $300 a week on groceries and $100 on formula. The couple also have car payments, and they're paying bills for their son's delivery. \"I remember sitting there looking at a stack of mail, probably like maybe 3 inches tall … hospital bills, ER bills,\" Moreno recalled.  \"And I looked at my husband. I was like, 'I don't ever want to do this again.'\" Just too expensive to have kids Months earlier, she thought she'd have multiple kids. But just six weeks after giving birth, Moreno decided to have her tubes tied. \"I was kind of like, 'Oh my gosh, my mom was right. This is too expensive.'\" Having only one kid means Moreno's family can save a couple of hundred dollars a month for a mortgage, so their son can someday have a backyard. \"Not only are homes more expensive, but then add, you know, a 7% [mortgage interest] rate on top of that,\" said Emily Harris, senior demographer at the Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute at the University of Utah. She said the  rate  at which women are having babies in Wyoming is just above the national average but still too low to replace the state's population. The same is true for all other states in the Mountain West, which have seen some of the  largest drops  in fertility rates nationwide in the past two decades. Meanwhile, the region's population is still growing. A lot of people are moving here to escape bigger cities and for an outdoor lifestyle, which is driving up home costs. Harris said things like child care costs and generational values also play into people's childbearing decisions and that they're definitely changing. \"We have this idea of, like, the nuclear family,\" Harris said. \"You need to get married, and then you buy a home and then you have children …  and really over the last decade or two, that kind of timeline has been halted and kind of rearranged.\" Some states are passing laws aimed at  easing housing costs  for young families. But  not Wyoming. \"The biggest barrier to addressing this housing crisis is really convincing my colleagues that the government has a role to play,\" said state Rep. Trey Sherwood, a member of the Democratic minority. Progressives have pushed for a state fund to help build more affordable housing. But members of the Republican supermajority, like Sen. Bob Ide, say the government should stay out of it. \"Fiddling with housing, you know, it gums up the wheels of the free market,\" Ide said. He pointed to laws the Wyoming Legislature passed to  restrict abortion access , allow nannies  to care for more children  and  ease property taxes  as examples of family-friendly policies. But Wyoming couples like Reesie Lane and Sean Thornton say it's still just too expensive to have kids now. \"Sean and I started dating and he said, 'I don't know, I think I want to have like six or seven kids,'\" Lane said, as Thornton laughed. \"[But] as we went through more and more financial struggles I guess, eventually it came to like, 'Yeah, I think we can have like one or two,'\" she added. Lane and Thornton both work in the state university system. They spent their 20s struggling to pay rent in tiny apartments, and then around age 30, they finally bought a house. \"I think that's when we started to realize it might be too late,\" said Lane, who also has an ovarian syndrome that makes it hard to conceive. \" I'm not sure that we're going to be able to have children.\" Lane said it's heartbreaking to not have enough money to give even one kid a full life, but that it's also freeing. For now, they're content with their fur babies, a Pomeranian and a shih tzu mix that were dressed in matching bandanas with fall leaves. \"They're a hundred percent little babies,\" Lane said, holding up the well-dressed pups, Huckleberry and Finn. \"They're so spoiled.\" \n         \n         Transcript \n         SCOTT DETROW, HOST:   Families around the world are having fewer children as people make different decisions about their lives. That is a story we have been covering all week in NPR's Population Shift series. There's been an especially steep drop in fertility rates in western U.S. states, where communities have also seen a big jump in the cost of housing. The Mountain West News Bureau's Hanna Merzbach reports from Wyoming. UNIDENTIFIED TODDLER: No (ph). HANNA MERZBACH, BYLINE: A sea of toddlers throw around colorful blocks and balls at an indoor play center in the Wyoming state capital of Cheyenne. Twenty-one-year-old Grace Moreno is here with her 11-month-old, who's dressed in pajamas with little fire trucks on them. GRACE MORENO: It's the only free place, so it's worth it. MERZBACH: Finances are tight for Moreno and her husband. They moved here from Texas while pregnant so her husband could work a higher-paying electrician job. But now with their baby boy, paychecks seem to disappear. MORENO: Our rent in Texas was like 800. Here, it's, like, 1,775. MERZBACH: Rent is their biggest cost. Then $300 a week on groceries, 100 on formula, car payments and paying for their son's delivery. MORENO: I remember sitting there looking at, like, a stack of mail, probably, like, maybe 3 inches tall - hospital bills, ER bills. I looked at my husband, and I was like, I don't ever want to do this again. MERZBACH: Just six weeks after giving birth, Moreno decided to get her tubes tied. She once thought she'd have multiple kids. MORENO: I was kind of like, oh, my gosh, my mom was right. Like, this is too expensive. MERZBACH: Only having one kid means Moreno's family can save a couple hundred dollars a month for a mortgage, so their son can someday have a backyard. At the moment, though, interest rates are still relatively high. EMILY HARRIS: Like, it's - not only are homes more expensive, but then add, you know, a 7% rate on top of that. MERZBACH: Emily Harris, a demographer at the University of Utah, says Wyoming's fertility rate is just above the national average but still too low to replace the state's population. But like many western states, Wyoming's population is growing. Lots of people are moving to the region to escape bigger cities and for an outdoorsy equality of life, which is driving up home costs. Harris says things like child care costs and generational values also play into people's childbearing decisions and that they're definitely changing. HARRIS: We have this idea of, like, the nuclear family, and, you know, you need to get married, and then you buy a home, and then you have children. And really, over the last decade or two, that kind of timeline has been halted and kind of rearranged. MERZBACH: Some states are passing laws aimed at easing housing costs for young families, but not Wyoming. Trey Sherwood is a Democratic state lawmaker here. TREY SHERWOOD: The biggest barrier to addressing this housing crisis is really convincing my colleagues that the government has a role to play. MERZBACH: Progressives have pushed for a state fund to help build more affordable housing. The Republican supermajority says that would just gum up the wheels of the free market. They say bills they pass to restrict abortion access, allow nannies to care for more children and ease property taxes are family-friendly policies. But Wyoming couples like Reesie Lane and Sean Thornton say it's just too expensive to have kids now. REESIE LANE: Sean and I started dating, and he said, I don't know, I think I want to have, like, six or seven kids. SEAN THORNTON: (Laughter) But as we went through, like, more and more financial struggles, I guess, eventually, it came to, like, yeah, I think we can have, like, one or two. MERZBACH: The state university employees spent their 20s struggling to pay rent in tiny apartments. At age 30, they finally bought this house. LANE: I think that's when we started to realize it might be too late. I'm not sure that they're - we're going to be able to have children. MERZBACH: Lane says it's heartbreaking to not have enough money to give even one kid a full life, but also freeing. (SOUNDBITE OF DOG BARKING) MERZBACH: For now, they're focused on their fur babies, a Pomeranian and a Shih tzu mix who are dressed in matching bandanas with fall leaves. LANE: They're 100% little babies. They're so spoiled.

to make two fanbases happy.\n \n\n   \n  Horror and sci-fi fans (and those who like both) got treated – not tricked – with the release of the trailers for “Scream 7” and “Stranger Things 5” on the same day, also known as Halloween eve.\n \n\n   \n  The latest in the “Scream” franchise reunites stars Neve Campbell and Courteney Cox as part of a cast which also includes several others, including Isabel May, Jasmin Savoy Brown, Joel McHale, Mckenna Grace and Mark Consuelos. Campbell sat out the last round, so this  marks her return  to the slasher franchise. Joining her are other returning stars including some who were previously believed to be killed off, like David Arquette,  Matthew Lillard  and Scott Foley.\n \n\n   \n  “When a new Ghostface killer emerges in the quiet town where Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) has built a new life, her darkest fears are realized as her daughter (Isabel May) becomes the next target,” according to the film’s synopsis. “Determined to protect her family, Sidney must face the horrors of her past to put an end to the bloodshed once and for all.”\n \n\n   \n  Kevin Williamson created the characters from the slasher franchise and directs the latest film. “Scream VI” came out in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the Hawkins crew has reunited for the  final season of the hit Netflix series “Stranger Things.” \n \n\n   \n  In Season 5, it is the fall of 1987, the town has been quarantined by the military and everything has been turned Upside Down. The Queen song “Who Wants to Live Forever” underscores the drama in the trailer.\n \n\n   \n  “I think what’s unique about this season is that it starts a little bit in chaos because our heroes ultimately lost at the end of Season 4,” series co-creator Ross Duffer  told Tudum.  “We usually set up their normal life and how they’re going about school, and then we introduce the supernatural element. But in this case, this season is sprinting from the start.”\n \n\n   \n  The last season of “Stranger Things” premiered in 2022.\n \n\n   \n  Volume 1 of “Stranger Things 5” starts streaming November 26, with subsequent volumes coming around Christmas and New Year’s.\n \n\n   \n  “Scream 7” hits theaters on Feb 27, 2026.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/ed-martin-doj-trump-political-prosecutions","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"15:00:00Z","title":"The Weapon of Justice: Ed Martin’s Influence at DOJ","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ed Martin, a former U.S. Attorney for Washington, D.C., has emerged as a powerful and politically active figure within the Trump Justice Department despite failing Senate confirmation.

       3:00 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Failing to win Senate approval as US Attorney for Washington, DC, has made Ed Martin a more formidable force inside the Trump Justice Department.\n \n\n   \n  After three chaotic months as interim US attorney earlier this year, Justice Department officials placed Martin in the department’s headquarters in a traditionally more supervised position. Unconfirmable and intent on rewriting the consequences of the January 6 prosecutions, Martin was, as one Trump ally said, being put under more “adult supervision.”\n \n\n   \n  That move, though, didn’t appear to hold him back. Martin now wields a surprising amount of political power and four titles: Associate Deputy Attorney General, Pardon Attorney, director of the Weaponization Working Group and Special Attorney for Mortgage Fraud. He’s also become the chief enforcer of using the Justice Department to exact President Donald Trump’s personal agenda — including by playing a role behind the scenes in the recent indictments of Trump foes  James Comey  and  Letitia James,  delving into so-called “weaponization” within the federal government and Biden-era pardons, and continuing to bear down on others Trump wants to see investigated.\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, Martin told the Republican-led House Oversight Committee that he was working on an “ongoing investigation” of pardons and commutations during Joe Biden’s presidency.\n \n\n   \n  The effort, which adds fuel to Trump’s attacks of presidential clemency given to members of the House Select Committee that investigated January 6 and others before they faced charges, recasts the traditional role of a pardon attorney in the extreme. Previously the job focused on reviewing and making recommendations to the president after prisoners petitioned for clemency. Under Martin, it’s become a much more active, politicized approach, where he is now critiquing past presidents’ clemency, a Constitutional power that has few limitations.\n \n\n   \n  “My ongoing investigation has revealed abuses of the pardon and commutation process by political actors in the Biden Administration. The use of AutoPen at the direction of staff and perhaps others is troubling,” Martin wrote to committee chairman James Comer, according to an email to obtained by CNN’s Jake Tapper. The Justice Department has previously said a president’s use of an autopen is legally sound.\n \n\n   \n  Martin’s influence also has become evident in cases where career prosecutors have balked at charging Trump political opponents and which his bosses, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, had reservations about before bringing.\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks, prosecutions of Comey and  James  have moved ahead over the protests of career prosecutors and even some Trump political appointees. Firings and resignations by experienced prosecutors have followed, and Martin has been in close contact with  Lindsey Halligan , whom Trump placed as the lead US Attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia, who initiated those indictments, sources tell CNN.\n \n\n   \n  More recently, Martin has turned his focus toward building his connections to other US Attorneys’ Offices, including in Atlanta, St. Louis and upstate New York, according to sources familiar with Martin’s efforts. Some of that effort may include known probes around Lisa Cook, the Federal Reserve governor whom Trump has tried to fire, on mortgage fraud allegations.\n \n\n   \n  “Ed Martin is one of the most dangerous people in the Justice Department. He’s not a serious lawyer, but he has serious power,” said Liz Oyer, a former career Justice Department official who preceded Martin as pardon attorney. “He seemingly has the power to open criminal investigations, which is serious business. Being subject to a criminal investigation can ruin someone’s life.”\n \n\n   \n  Oyer noted that investigating Trump’s political opponents and holding the pardon post gives Martin especially unusual influence — as a political force who can both punish Trump’s enemies and reward his friends.\n \n\n   \n  His willingness to use the Justice Department to advance MAGA movement politics stands in contrast with the Justice Department norms since the Richard Nixon era. Reforms after the Watergate crisis led to a tradition under Republican and Democratic administrations to distance prosecution decisions from the White House.\n \n\n   \n  Even in the first Trump administration, attorneys general generally enforced rules limiting contact between White House officials and Justice Department employees.\n \n\n   \n  Martin has no such qualms and is known to maintain regular contact with White House officials, according to people briefed on the matter.\n \n\n   \n  A Missouri Republican, Martin burnished his MAGA credentials following the 2021 Capital attack, becoming a vocal defender of Trump vote fraud claims in the 2020 election and of January 6 rioters — some of whom he represented as an attorney.\n \n\n   \n  As part of his so-called weaponization probe, Martin brought onto his staff former FBI agent Jared Wise, who was prosecuted for allegedly urging January 6 rioters to attack law enforcement officers, calling the officers “Nazis” and the “Gestapo.”\n \n\n   \n  Martin maintains at least two offices at the Justice Department – one in a complex north of the US Capitol where the pardon attorney office is located, the other inside the Justice Department headquarters.\n \n\n   \n  His active social media presence including a Substack blog and his support for January 6 rioters caused wary Senate Republicans to tank his nomination to lead the federal prosecutors’ office in Washington, DC, which prosecuted more than 1,000 January 6 riot defendants, in May.\n \n\n   \n  But Martin appears undaunted despite receiving cautions from top Justice officials about some of his public comments.\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks, Martin has been posting nearly every day on social media photos of people he meets with, including right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, the comedian Russel Brand, US Attorneys from outside of DC, and Trump supporters in politics from around the country.\n \n\n   \n  He also has been lobbying prosecutors in Maryland to pursue mortgage fraud allegations around Democratic California Sen.  Adam Schiff,  another one of Trump’s political opponents, who helped lead congressional investigations of him, sources say.\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department and Martin didn’t comment for this story.\n \n\n   \n  Martin sought to flex his influence earlier this month as former New York Rep. George Santos won a sentence commutation from the president, after serving in a minimal-security federal prison camp only three months of his seven-year sentence for fraud.\n \n\n   \n  Santos for months had sought the help of intermediaries to get Trump’s attention for a pardon and Martin tried to help behind the scenes, according to a person briefed on the matter.\n \n\n   \n  After the president granted the commutation, Martin said in a post on X: “I was honored as U.S. Pardon Attorney to have played a small role” in the clemency grant, and he thanks the president for “making clemency great again.”\n \n\n   \n  “Martin has made it known that his intent with pardons is to use them to benefit people with MAGA affiliations,” Oyer said. “For Martin to have both of those roles,” of pardon attorney and prosecutor, “it shows how this department is operating a system of both punishment and reward.”\n \n\n   \n    Catching Trump’s attention\n \n\n   \n  Some of Martin’s recent campaigns have been channeled into the president’s own social media feed. For instance, with Martin as the mortgage fraud investigator, Trump lashed out at Bondi, demanding in a  remarkable Truth Social  post for the prosecution of his political enemies.\n \n\n   \n  “We can’t delay any longer, it’s killing our reputation and credibility,” Trump wrote. “They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!), OVER NOTHING. JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!”\n \n\n   \n  Blanche has sought to bring a measure of control to Martin’s efforts, according to people briefed on the matter.\n \n\n   \n  The tension between Blanche and Martin spilled out into the public in late September, after Martin sent a letter to an FBI agent who had responded to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012. Martin, in his letter, disclosed what he said was an investigation of the agent, after the agent had testified about being smeared in a conspiracy theory pushed by Jones, who gained notoriety with claims that the Sand Hook attack was staged by the FBI. The agent was awarded nearly $100 million in a case against Jones.\n \n\n   \n  Jones made Martin’s letter public, demanding responses from the FBI agent, until Blanche demanded Martin retract his requests.\n \n\n   \n  Martin then wrote to the agent’s lawyer, “I write to inform you that there is no investigation of you or your client. Because of this, I hereby withdraw my request for information from you or your former client.”\n \n\n   \n    An ally in Virginia\n \n\n   \n  But Martin’s power has accrued alongside the arrival of another former Trump adviser, Halligan, who Trump installed to run the powerful US Attorney’s Office in Alexandria, Virginia, in late September.\n \n\n   \n  While career prosecutors and top Justice officials viewed cases against Comey and James to be duds, Halligan managed to deliver the two indictments Trump publicly called for.\n \n\n   \n  Halligan replaced Erik Seibert after attorneys in the office objected to charging Comey with lying to Congress.\n \n\n   \n  Both Comey and James have pleaded not guilty and are challenging the prosecutors’ handling of the cases.\n \n\n   \n  In the James investigation before she was charged, Martin took several steps that fall outside the norms of prosecutorial conduct.\n \n\n   \n  Martin this summer sent a letter to James’ attorney, Abbe Lowell, suggesting that James should resign as attorney general. And he paid a visit to James’ Brooklyn  home  in August, posing for photos outside it wearing a long trench coat, accompanied by an assistant who acts as an unofficial spokesperson, unusual for a person in Martin’s position to have at the Justice Department.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to go to the very bottom of the facts, and if somebody did something wrong, we’re not only going to hold them accountable. We’re also going to look at everything else that they’ve been doing. Because when you’re a liar, you lie not just on one thing,” Martin said on Fox News in August when asked about the mortgage investigations.\n \n\n   \n  Some senior DOJ officials were frustrated by the stunt, one source said, as they had no idea Martin would be traveling to New York.\n \n\n   \n    Attention in Maryland\n \n\n   \n  Apparently emboldened by the charging successes in Virginia, Martin’s fast-moving advocacy turned in recent weeks to Maryland’s US Attorney’s Office.\n \n\n   \n  The office’s US Attorney Kelly Hayes, a respected career prosecutor who worked for years out of Greenbelt, recently secured the indictment of former Trump national security adviser  John Bolton , another Trump political foe. Prosecutors accuse Bolton of keeping national security secrets in unsecured personal accounts and on printed paper after he left the government.\n \n\n   \n  Hayes’ approach, and the Bolton case itself, are viewed more seriously than the indictments and investigations of other political figures who have faced charges at Trump’s urging, several sources familiar with the case and the office have told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  But the Maryland office still has a prosecutor looking into the financial records of Schiff, another Trump target, and Martin continues to push Hayes to bring an indictment against him.\n \n\n   \n  Last week after it became known Hayes’ team had doubts about the case, sources said the investigation was continuing and the Deputy Attorney General’s office may be working with Hayes, in a vote of confidence for the US Attorney in a precarious moment.\n \n\n   \n  Yet because of Martin’s pushes for prosecution in Maryland and Virginia, the districts are now buzzing with speculation Martin could end up as a prosecutor in one of the offices.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5592366","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"18:43:00-20:00","title":"Federal judges order administration to pay SNAP benefits but what's next remains unclear","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Two federal judges, Indira Talwani in Boston and John J.

But it was unclear hours after the rulings Friday afternoon how much assistance may be provided or when it might come. U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani in Boston ruled the Trump administration has until Monday to decide whether to pay at least partial SNAP food benefits. She declined to issue a temporary restraining order to force the administration to act before the funds run out tomorrow, finding that resuming payments at some point can still avoid irreparable harm to SNAP recipients. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In Rhode Island, U.S. District Chief Judge John J. McConnell Jr. granted a temporary restraining order while saying ending SNAP payments would harm not only people, but also local economies. The judge said the Trump administration \"must distribute\" aid from emergency reserves as soon as possible. He also said it must submit a plan on how it would comply with his order, or \"at least an update,\" by noon on Monday,  Ocean State Media reported. It is not yet clear how the two court orders would impact the flow of benefits, which are set to run out Saturday. Hours after the rulings, President Trump posted on social media that he has directed government lawyers to find a way to pay SNAP benefits. \"If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding, just like I did with Military and Law Enforcement Pay,\" he wrote. However, it's not clear what sort of legal direction the administration was seeking. The Trump administration had said it did not have enough money to pay November's SNAP benefits because of the government shutdown and that it lacked legal authority to use contingency funds set aside for emergencies. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Talwani acknowledged her order would leave millions of people without assistance starting Saturday. She issued her decision in a case filed by two dozen Democratic-led states that sued over the administration's decision to suspend the nation's largest anti-hunger program for the first time in its history. The judge said the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers SNAP, must use emergency funds to keep SNAP going. She also said other money is legally available but left the decision of how much benefits to distribute up to the administration. In Rhode Island, McConnell issued his decision in a lawsuit filed by eight cities and nonprofit and business groups. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps, helps 1 in 8 U.S. residents, who get an average of $186 a month. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/1234569831","dateOfPublication":"2024-02-28","timeOfPublication":"14:20:00-05:00","title":"Tiny Desk Carousel: Featured Concerts","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A collection of featured Tiny Desk Concerts is presented on the Home Page Tiny Desk Carousel, offering a curated selection of live performances from the Tiny Desk Concerts series.","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":["Tiny Desk Concerts","featured performances","live music","NPR"],"content":"\n         Home Page Tiny Desk Carousel \n         \n        \n           Wednesday, February 28, 2024 • 2:20 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         A collection of featured Tiny Desk Concerts. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-95763","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"05:01:00+00:00","title":"What has 11 questions and makes you feel smart?

Dictionary.com's 2025 word of the year has no definition \n         By Rachel Treisman \n        \n           Friday, October 31, 2025 • 1:43 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Dictionary.com has crowned a set of numbers as its 2025 word of the year. It  says it reserves  that distinction for a word that reflects \"social trends and global events that defined that year\" and \"reveals the stories we tell about ourselves and how we've changed over the year.\" The word of the year is both viral vernacular and a linguistic time capsule (last year's, for example, was \" demure \"). \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       This year, that honor goes to \"67\" — pronounced \"six seven\" — a slang term that's been delighting kids,  exasperating teachers  and befuddling adults for months. It has its roots in the song  \"Doot Doot (6 7)\" , which Philadelphia-based rapper Skrilla released last December. \"The way that switch brrt, I know he dyin' … 6-7, I just bipped right on the highway,\" Skrilla says, using a verb that in hip-hop can describe anything from a  car smash-and-grab  to smooth driving to  general swag. But it was the phrase \"67\" that   took off. It was popularized online largely through viral TikToks of basketball highlights  including of LaMelo Ball , the Charlotte Hornets point guard who happens to stand 6 feet, 7 inches tall. Then other big-name basketball players, including  LeBron James  and  Paige Bueckers , started using the term in interviews. It spread to  other sports  and, before long, schools across the country.   Gen Alpha typically delivers it in a slow drawl with an accompanying hand motion: raising one upturned palm at a time for each number, as if weighing two items. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"Now it is something that you're just trying to use to get somebody to reference the number 67   like … 'How tall are you?'… 'what time is it?' … 'what's that?'\" middle school teacher and comedian Philip Lindsay, who  first posted  about the trend back in February, said in an  August Instagram video . \"There is literally no circumstance where a kid might not say 67.\" Dictionary.com says searches for 67 surged over the summer, increasing \"more than sixfold\" since June with no signs of stopping. The term has inspired  musical mashups , a recent  South Park  plotline  and plenty of (somewhat cringe)  Halloween costumes . \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"67 shows the speed at which a new word can rocket around the world as a rising generation enters the global conversation,\" its announcement reads. Lindsay approves of the choice, telling NPR over email that 67 is \"definitely THE word of 2025.\" He says that while kids tend to lose interest in memes over time, especially as they move across generations, this one has held staying power for nearly the entire year — though its new accolade could potentially change that.  \"I would imagine after this designation and more people using it, that it is going to start to become cringe to the younger generation,\" he wrote. \"However, I do think that because they are numbers that are seen everywhere, it is going to live on for quite some time in classrooms and in the minds of Gen Alpha.\"  But what does it actually mean? Depends on who you ask  Dictionary.com says: \"Perhaps the most defining feature of 67 is that it's impossible to define.\" \"It's meaningless, ubiquitous, and nonsensical,\" it adds. \"It's the logical endpoint of being perpetually online, scrolling endlessly, consuming content fed to users by algorithms trained by other algorithms.\" In other words, the defining world of the year has no real meaning or definition. Even Skrilla, the rapper who coined the term,  told  XXL  magazine  this week that he left it intentionally vague, though it initially had a negative connotation. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"67 changed from a negative thing to a positive,\" he said. \"[It's] millions of other things for other people. Everybody got they own meaning to it, 'cause I never put a real meaning on it.\" Ball, the 6-foot-7 basketball player, similarly struggled to define it when asked in a  September TikTok . \"It's really nothing though, for real,\" the 24-year-old said. \"Just six seven.\" Still, as Dictionary.com says, the term's meaning lies in the connection it fosters. It's basically one big inside joke, at least for participants of a certain age. \"67 is meaningless in content, but it's not meaningless in feeling,\" parenting expert Becky Kennedy said in an  Instagram video  earlier this month. \"Think about when you were a kid. What's more powerful than feeling like you belong?\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Evidently, that feeling is powerful enough to propel 67 to the word of the year — beating out a shortlist of contenders including  broligarchy ,  clanker ,  tradwife  and  tariff . Lindsay says he's gotten \"countless\" messages from parents who have connected with their kids \"over a 6-7 and have been able to have meaningful conversations as a result.\" He hopes others will embrace it similarly.  \"Every trending meme or word is a connection point between adults and the adolescents in their life,\" he adds. \"My advice is always, know what is going on and use it to bridge gaps with the kids in your life.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-96140","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"13:19:00Z","title":"Dodgers force World Series to decisive Game 7 by holding off Blue Jays 3-1","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a dramatic World Series game, the Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Toronto Blue Jays 3-1, forcing a decisive Game 7.

Rookie relievers Justin Wrobleski and Roki Sasaki combined for six outs before starter Tyler Glasnow came out of the bullpen to escape a ninth-inning jam and rescue the Dodgers. Glasnow needed only three pitches to do it. With runners on second and third and nobody out, he got Ernie Clement to pop up his first delivery on the infield for an easy out. Andrés Giménez then hit a line drive to left field that Kiké Hernández turned into a game-ending double play. Hernández caught the ball on the run in shallow left-center and fired to second base, where Miguel Rojas made a tough pick of a one-hop throw to double off Addison Barger. \"I was playing a little more shallow than the card wanted me to. But given the situation, really fast guy at second base, I was like, you know what? I'm going to play really, really shallow. If he hits it over my head, kudos to him. I feel like his pop is more to the pull side,\" Hernández said. \"Somehow I was able to hear that the bat broke even with that crowd. The crazy thing is I had no idea where the ball was because it was in the lights the whole time. But given the situation in the game, the World Series on the line and how good I was hitting tonight, I was like, it's going to hit me in the face — but I'm not stopping. I'm not pulling up. And at the very end, the ball came out of the lights and went into my glove.\" It was the first 7-4 game-ending double play in postseason history, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. \"I gave him a really hard throw to catch. I think it was a better pick than it was a play on my end,\" Hernández said. Sasaki plunked Alejandro Kirk with an 0-2 pitch to begin the inning, and Barger hit a ground-rule double to left-center that got wedged at the bottom of the wall. That's when Dodgers manager Dave Roberts summoned Glasnow. \"I just felt right there, Roki wasn't as sharp and I felt right there, Glas is a guy who has swing-and-miss stuff and I just wanted to bet on him,\" Roberts said. \"He's been chomping at the bit to make an impact.\" Max Scherzer will start Game 7 on Saturday night for the Blue Jays. The three-time Cy Young Award winner also started the last World Series Game 7, getting a no-decision when Washington won the 2019 title over Houston. \"These guys are really good at kind of just turning the page,\" Toronto manager John Schneider said. \"That will take a while to kind of unpack. That's a wild ending. I love the way we played.\" Glasnow had been lined up to potentially start for the Dodgers, seeking to become the first team to win consecutive titles since the New York Yankees won three straight from 1998-2000. Two-way star Shohei Ohtani also could be used as an opener. \"I think right now, there's no wrong answer,\" Roberts said. \"He's certainly going to be a part of the pitching plan, and with Shohei, it could be two innings, but it could be four innings. So I'm not sure where we're going to slot him. We're going to have to talk to him first on where he feels most comfortable.\" Los Angeles kept alive its bid for a third title in six seasons and its hopes to be recognized as a dynasty. \"Man, we live for Game 7, so here we go,\" Roberts said. Yamamoto, a 27-year-old right-hander in his second season with the Dodgers after winning three MVP awards in Japan, was coming off the first consecutive postseason complete games since 2001. He allowed one run and five hits with six strikeouts and a walk, stranding two runners in the sixth when he struck out Daulton Varsho with a splitter on his 96th and final pitch. Yamamoto is 4-1 with a 1.56 ERA in five postseason starts and has a 1.20 ERA in his two Series outings. Kevin Gausman lost to Yamamoto for the second time despite matching a Series record by striking out eight in the first three innings behind a dominant splitter. Tommy Edman doubled with one out in the third for the Dodgers' first hit. Ohtani was intentionally walked for the fifth time in the Series and Will Smith hit an RBI double off the left-field wall on a high splitter. Freddie Freeman walked, bringing up Betts. The three-time World Series champion entered just 3 for 23 in the Series and had been dropped from second to third in the lineup for Game 5. He was moved down another slot to cleanup Friday, his lowest in the batting order since 2017. Behind 1-2 in the count, Betts fouled off two pitches and laced Gausman's third straight fastball between shortstop and third for a 3-0 lead. That ended an 0-for-13 stretch with the bases loaded for the Dodgers that dated to the Division Series. \"Honestly, man, I know it hasn't been great for me,\" Betts said. \"But this year really hasn't been great. I just want to be there to help the boys. I came up in a big spot. ... I just was able to find a way to lock in.\" Seeking their first World Series title since 1993, the Blue Jays wore powder blue uniforms at home for the first time since September after getting wins with them in Games 4 and 5 in LA. Toronto scored when Barger doubled to start the third and came around on Springer's two-out single. Gausman gave up three runs and six hits in six innings, getting 15 swings and misses with his splitter. Sasaki, a starter turned reliever as the Dodgers tried to shore up their bullpen, escaped a two-on, one-out jam in the eighth by retiring Bo Bichette on a foulout and Varsho on a groundout. Up next Scherzer and Glasnow started Game 3, won by the Dodgers 6-5 in 18 innings. A 41-year-old right-hander, Scherzer will become the fourth pitcher to start multiple World Series winner-take-all Game 7s after Bob Gibson (1964, '67, '68), Lew Burdette and Don Larsen (both 1957 and '58). Scherzer allowed two runs over five innings for Washington against Houston in 2019, and the Nationals rallied for a 6-2 win. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5592332","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"17:07:00-04:00","title":"Photos: Food banks scramble to get ready as SNAP funding deadline looms","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the U.S. government shutdown continues, SNAP EBT card funds are set to expire on November 1, threatening food access for 42 million people.

No tricks, just treats. Weapons  Available to stream on HBO Max and rent on demand.  \n       \n       Youtube Video \n       Weapons  begins with something that seems impossible: One night, in the suburb of Maybrook, every student (save one) from Justine Gandy's third-grade classroom gets up at 2:17 a.m., goes downstairs, walks out of the house, and silently runs off into the night. They are gone, 17 of them. They are caught on doorbell cameras or security cameras, disappearing into the woods or just into the darkness. Suspicion falls on Justine (Julia Garner), for the simple reason that nobody can figure out how these kids could disappear unless something was happening in that classroom, on her watch. In large part, not unlike HBO's 2014 series  The Leftovers  and the novel that inspired it,  Weapons  is a story about a community recovering from an inexplicable trauma that arrives like a natural disaster, wreaks havoc, and then cannot be reversed, only survived. But there is another thing, another Whole Thing going on in this story, which I would not spoil for anything, because it is simply too wonderfully scary and strange.  – Linda Holmes Read the full review here.  Good Boy  In limited theaters; available to rent on demand.  \n       \n       Youtube Video \n       No harm befalls the deeply sympathetic canine protagonist of  Good Boy , a low-budget horror film   based on those eerie moments when pets seem to have a heightened sense of a presence humans can't detect. The dog in question, named Indy,  is the director's dog in real life , and we experience the events of the film through his soulful eyes. The film features indie horror auteur Larry Fessenden in a surprise supporting role, and in some ways, it belongs to his lineage of scary movies that explore humanity's rapacious relationship with nature. While some horror fans have expressed disappointment over  Good Boy's  deliberate pace and absence of jump scares, critics have celebrated the film's emotional, innovative storytelling from the point of view of a very good boy.  — Neda Ulaby  Sinners  Available to stream on HBO Max and rent on demand.  This trailer includes an instance of vulgar language.  \n       \n       Youtube Video \n       It's 1932 in Clarksdale, Miss., and enterprising twin brothers Smoke and Stack, both played by Coogler's longtime muse Michael B. Jordan, have returned to town after some years away in Chicago. What the siblings got into while up North in all likelihood wasn't on the up-and-up; think robbing, stealing, and doing business with Irish and Italian gangsters. But now back home, they're flush with cash and booze and eager to set up a new venture: a juke joint. It's possible you're aware that  Sinners  involves vampires, and it does. In a straightforward metaphor for all the ways Black culture has been co-opted by whiteness, the raucous pleasures and sonic beauty of the juke joint attract the interest of a trio of demons led by Remmick (Jack O'Connell); they wish to literally leech off of the talents and energy of Black folks. And — this is not a spoiler — some of those Black people make it pretty easy for Remmick and his ilk to taste blood.  – Aisha Harris  Read the full review here.  28 Years Later  Available to stream on Netflix and rent on demand.  \n       \n       Youtube Video \n       The apocalyptic horror film  28 Years Later  takes place in the same world as the 2002 film  28 Days Later , where a deadly virus transformed the citizens of England into rabid, blood-spewing creatures with really impressive lung capacity. Seriously, those zombies were just as good at wind sprints as they were at cross-country. This year's film picks up almost three decades later on a small island connected to the mainland by a causeway, where a group of survivors eke out a modest existence. A desperate expedition to the mainland reveals new allies and new horrors — because the infected have evolved.  — Glen Weldon Listen to the Pop Culture Happy Hour panel discuss the movie . Presence Available to stream on Hulu and rent on demand.  \n       \n       Youtube Video \n       The haunted-house thriller  Presence  has a formal conceit so clever, I'm surprised it hasn't ever been done or attempted before. Maybe another movie  has  done it that I'm not aware of. This is a ghost story told entirely from the ghost's point of view: We see what the ghost sees. The ghost cannot leave the house, and so the movie never leaves the house, either. You could say that the ghost is played by the director,  Steven Soderbergh , who serves as his own cinematographer, as usual, working under the pseudonym of Peter Andrews. That's Soderbergh holding the camera as it glides up and down the stairs, following the characters from room to room, and hovering over them as they try to figure out what's going on.  Soderbergh's camera movements are so delicate and expressive, he can convey empathy with a mere twitch or shudder, or rage with a sudden, violent lurch. Before long, we realize that the ghost isn't trying to scare this family; it's trying to warn them. —  Justin Chang Read the full review here . Frankenstein  In theaters; on Netflix Nov. 7.  \n       \n       Youtube Video \n       Guillermo del Toro has made several monster movies of a particular bent — soulful, swoony, feverish films about grotesque-looking creatures who prove themselves more deeply human than the humans who reject them. Which is why  Frankenstein  seems like the perfect match between story and muse; certainly  del Toro's been talking about  making his own version of the tale for decades, calling it his \"lifelong dream.\" That dream is now realized, and while the resulting film captures the tone and spirit of the original novel in all its breathless zeal and hie-me-to-yon-fainting-couch deliriousness, the many narrative tweaks del Toro has made — some of which work, some of which don't — ensure that you'd never mistake his  Frankenstein  for anyone else's.  – Glen Weldon Read the full review here.  A House of Dynamite  Available in limited theaters and streaming on Netflix.  This trailer includes instances of vulgar language.  \n       \n       Youtube Video \n       An entirely plausible nuclear horror story from the Oscar-winning director of  The Hurt Locker , this nerve-jangling thriller begins with a ballistic missile headed toward the continental U.S. Origin unknown, but consequences cataclysmic, the missile plays into doomsday fears so primal, most of us bury them. Nuclear war is unthinkable, we tell ourselves, because mutually assured destruction means no government would ever start one. But suppose, as director Kathryn Bigelow and screenwriter Noah Oppenheim have, that a seemingly rogue threat can't quickly be traced, that a missile will strike a major American city in just 19 minutes, and that fallible, increasingly frantic civilian and military leaders haven't a clue how to finesse the possible obliteration of humankind. This explosive scenario, played for farce in  Dr. Strangelove , leads here into white knuckle territory.  – Bob Mondello  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5591404","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Shopping for ACA health plans this open enrollment?

Here's what to know \n         By Michelle Andrews \n        \n           Friday, October 31, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         This year's Obamacare open enrollment period, which starts Saturday in most states, is full of uncertainty and confusion for the more than  24 million people  who buy health insurance through the federal and state Affordable Care Act marketplaces. The fate of the enhanced premium tax credits that make coverage more affordable for  92% of enrollees  remains up in the air, with the prospect of significantly  higher premiums looming . But there are steps marketplace shoppers can take to ensure they make the right choices for the upcoming plan year. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       1. Understand how we got here In 2021, as part of a COVID-era relief package, the ACA premium tax credits were enhanced to lower costs for previously eligible people and expand eligibility to people with incomes over 400% of the federal poverty level (which amounts to  about $63,000  for one person in 2025). But those enhancements, which were extended in 2022,  will expire  at the end of 2025 unless Congress acts. The debate over whether to extend them again has been at the center of a political battle of wills between Republicans and Democrats in Congress, a fight at the heart of the now month-old  government shutdown. The financial implications for many marketplace enrollees are huge. Average out-of-pocket premium payments for subsidized enrollees are projected to more than double if the enhanced tax credits expire, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. \"The longer this goes on, the more damage is done,\" said  Cynthia Cox , a vice president and the director of the Program on the ACA at KFF. \"If someone logs on Nov. 1 and sees their premium doubling, they might just walk away.\" That would be a mistake, marketplace experts agree. What is clear, though, is that buyers need to beware and be informed. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       2. Follow the news It can be frustrating to track day-to-day Capitol Hill machinations. But that may be your best source for up-to-date information. Congress could make a deal to extend the enhanced subsidies anytime during the next few days, weeks or months -- or not. Either way, it could affect your enrollment decision. So, pay attention. Don't count on the marketplace or your insurer to notify you about what you should expect to pay. \"Many state marketplaces have hit delay\" on sending consumers notices of net premiums, which take premium tax credits into account, said  Sabrina Corlette , a co-director of Georgetown University's Center on Health Insurance Reforms. The federal government doesn't send enrollees notices about plan premiums for the coming year for the  28 federally facilitated  marketplaces. For 2026, it has said that health plans can also  opt not  to. 3. Update your account information and don't auto-enroll Log in to your marketplace account and update your income, household size, and any other details that have changed. This year, it's particularly important to provide an accurate estimate of your anticipated income for 2026. A provision in HR 1, sometimes called the  One Big Beautiful Bill Act ,  eliminated the caps  on what many people were required to repay if they underestimated their projected income and received more premium assistance than they should have. Next year, people will have to repay the entire excess amount. In the past few years, it's been possible to put your ACA insurance on auto-pilot with  automatic reenrollment  in your current or a similar plan. Given the uncertainty around premiums, this is not a good year to do that, enrollment specialists say. This is especially true for people who, without a deal in Congress, will no longer qualify for subsidies next year, specifically those whose incomes are over 400% of the federal poverty level. 4. Shop based on sticker prices When people see their projected premiums, assuming Congress hasn't reached a deal to extend the enhanced credits, many will be shocked. Health insurance premiums on the marketplaces are expected to increase, on average, 26% next year,  according to KFF . That's the largest rate increase since 2018. Until now, people have largely been shielded from those increases by the enhanced premium tax subsidies that nearly all enrollees receive. Here's how it works: Most people with ACA marketplace plans are responsible for paying a portion of their premium based on a sliding income scale, and the government pays the rest. According to an analysis by KFF, if the enhanced credits are not renewed, a family of four with $75,000 in income, for example,  will be responsible  for paying $5,865 in annual premiums for a benchmark silver plan in 2026 — more than double the $2,498 it'll pay if they are renewed. When evaluating a plan, focus on the listed price. If it's not affordable without the enhanced tax credits, it's not a good buy. \"People need to make a decision based on what is in front of them,\" Cox said. If you can't afford the sticker price without the enhanced credits, consider enrolling in a less generous plan with a lower premium but a higher deductible, Cox said. Bronze plans must provide comprehensive coverage, including covering preventive care at no cost, and may cover some doctor visits before the deductible. \"In most cases, it makes more sense to have a bronze plan than to be uninsured,\" she said. The Trump administration has been promoting  catastrophic plans  as a more affordable option for people who face financial hardship, including those who don't qualify for subsidies because their incomes are either less than 100% or more than 400% of the federal poverty level. Similar to bronze plans, catastrophic plans cover a set of essential health benefits, provide free preventive care, and must cover at least three doctor visits before people reach their deductible. But catastrophic plan deductibles are the highest of any type of marketplace plan: $10,600 for individuals and $21,200 for families in 2026. \"They are expensive relative to what they cover,\" said  Jennifer Sullivan , director of health coverage access at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, noting premiums can cost several hundred dollars. 5. Come back, check, and recheck If you're dismayed at premium prices on your first pass, \"don't slam the computer shut and decide that there are no options for you,\" Sullivan said. \"Congress might still act and things might change radically.\" Lawmakers could restore the enhanced premium tax credits right up to the end of the year, or later. In a majority of states, including the 28 that use the federal government's centralized marketplace, open enrollment lasts until Jan. 15. There are also other key dates to remember. In most states, people  must enroll  by Dec. 15 for coverage starting Jan. 1, and by Jan. 15 for coverage starting Feb. 1, though some states have later deadlines. 6. Wait to pay your premium Premium payments are generally due before the plan takes effect, although marketplaces and insurers have flexibility to extend deadlines, Corlette said. They might allow people extra time to make a first payment, for example. \"We've seen that in the past. State officials and insurance companies have gotten creative to try and keep people in coverage,\" she said. But if there is a last-minute deal and someone has already paid their premium for January coverage and received a lower tax credit than the deal provides, they should still be able to receive the higher credit. \"There are ways to make people whole,\" Corlette said, although how that might happen this enrollment period is unclear.

Gen Z and millennial Americans are feeling increasingly demoralized about their economic prospects, and some say their concerns have gone unaddressed by elected officials. In communities of all kinds, voters in their 20s and 30s are confronting a financial reality of rising costs, mounting debt and minimal wage growth. But how is this changing their political views? It's a question that NPR  put to readers . We received more than 1,100 submissions from across the political spectrum from almost every state in the U.S. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Many described a similar reality — one where economic worries loom large over their everyday lives and erode their faith in the ability of those in power. Taken together, their responses paint a portrait of a generation of voters discouraged by what they see in Washington and who increasingly feel as if they have no political home. It is important to note that the responses are not from a representative sample of all young voters. But what readers shared helps highlight a steep challenge facing Democrats and Republicans alike as they work to win over these voters, who are collectively expected to make up  more than half the electorate in 2028 . Here is a snapshot of what readers shared.  These responses have been edited for clarity and length. Young voters are united in disappointment  Many young Americans feel a collective sense of disillusionment in the political system, and respondents told NPR that their financial struggles are exacerbating that pain. Recent polling seems to underscore the frustrations many shared with NPR. Just a fraction of young voters feel confident in government institutions, with less than 2 in 10 of those 18 to 29 years old saying they trust the federal government to do the right thing most or all of the time, according to the latest  Harvard Youth Poll , from this spring. Similarly, only 16% of those under 30 believe democracy is working well for them,  according to a report  from the young voter research organization, CIRCLE. Their life goals are on hold — for some indefinitely  Young people shared that one of the biggest drivers feeding into their sense of political frustration is the struggle to get ahead financially or even just stay afloat. When asked what economic success looks like for them, respondents didn't want lavish mansions or high-priced sports cars. Instead, their ambitions were more modest, often centering on the need for financial stability. Yet even that felt out of reach for many. Young Americans said goals like owning a home, starting a family or pursuing a dream job feel increasingly like a luxury rather than an achievable milestone. Financial concerns are forcing them to reframe what's possible and sometimes choose one goal over another. Financial roadblocks standing in the way  Many are navigating a unique economic moment where both median home and rental prices, for example, have  risen at a faster pace than wages  for roughly two decades. People are also waiting longer to buy homes. The median age of a first-time homebuyer in 2024 stood at 38, 10 years older than in the early 1990s,  according to the National Association of Realtors . Debt is also a barrier. Despite collectively making up the  largest share of the labor force  and being on track to surpass older generations in  educational attainment , Generation Z and millennials have  higher rates of student loan debt  and more  mortgage debt . Family planning looks different as well. People are deciding to have  fewer children  or not start a family. Last year, the U.S. fertility rate hit a  record low , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They watched their parents succeed, but struggle themselves In the face of financial challenges, respondents say they're struggling to reach or build upon the lifestyle achieved by their parents and grandparents, making some feel less hopeful about the future. Even with hard work and a degree, many readers said they have accomplished less than their parents had by the same age. This has led many to feel disillusioned with, even betrayed by, the very system that promised to set them up for success and stability. Despite losing faith in most politicians, populism resonates Young Americans see very few politicians actively addressing their concerns around affordability, leading some to lose faith in the effectiveness of either major political party. \"Over time, I've come to see our two-party system as two wings on the same bird,\" explained 27-year-old respondent Sophie Howard, from Davenport, Iowa. When asked which politicians are speaking to their concerns, liberal-leaning respondents frequently highlighted progressives like Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Zohran Mamdani, the Democrats' nominee for mayor in New York City. Readers on the conservative side often coalesced around President Trump and Vice President Vance. Many respondents returned to the same point: that they're most inspired by populist-style leaders who focus on disrupting the status quo. It's a message that young people say goes past political labels, pushing some to opposite poles on the ideological spectrum and leaving others feeling stuck in the middle. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5585063","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"08:00:00-04:00","title":"I Love LA: A Self-Aware Comedy on Social Media, Fame, and Los Angeles","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"I Love LA is a self-aware comedy series on HBO created by Rachel Sennott, portraying a group of young professionals in Los Angeles as they navigate fame, friendship, and identity in a city that functions as a powerful, self-reflective character.

Unlike its peers, the new HBO series   is less interested in the dynamics of the friend group itself and more concerned with the far-reaching tentacles of a city that has the power to make you as quickly as it can eat you alive — all while documenting your rise and fall on the internet.  I Love LA  revolves around a 20-something talent manager named Maia, played by Rachel Sennott, who decides to take on her former best friend and rising social media star, Tallulah (Odessa A'zion), as a client. Their circle is comprised of Charlie (Jordan Firstman), an insecure stylist who desperately cares about climbing LA's social ladder, and Alani (True Whitaker), the show's (and real life) nepo baby. Each character seems to represent a modern Los Angeles stereotype, with the exception of Dylan (Josh Hutcherson), who plays the voice of reason as the supportive, lowkey boyfriend to an ambitious, extraverted Maia. With a cast including cameos from former vine star Quenlin Blackwell,  I Love LA  intentionally taps those who have come up online in one way or another, many alongside Sennott, who was initially known for her Twitter comedy and went viral in 2019 for mocking LA in  an Instagram video set to Azealia Banks' \"212.\" The show begins with Tallulah coming back to Maia's life after a lengthy falling out. When Tallulah shows up unexpectedly at Maia's apartment with a Balenciaga bag and thousands of Instagram followers under her belt, the show's primary conflict seems to be between the two of them, because:  is being the manager of your former best friend really the best idea?  But as the season unfolds and Maia gets increasingly wrapped up in their careers, it becomes clear that the real tension isn't entirely interpersonal, but rather lies between each character and a city that is trying to break them under the warmth of its sun-kissed glow.  For many people who grew up on the internet, LA has a reputation of being a theme park for social media influencers, nepo babies and washed up YouTubers. And to that,  I Love LA  says, you're right. The show understands that in order for viewers to take it seriously, it cannot do the same. When Maia finds out on her 27th birthday that Tallulah was in the Marc Jacobs' Heaven campaign without her, a nod to the designer's collection popular amongst Gen-Z, Alani responds with an astrological explanation: \"27 is the start of your Saturn return, so everything that feels bad right now is actually good.\" References to star signs, famous private schools in LA and internet celebrities might sound gibberish to those who didn't grow up in the area, in a certain zip code, or on social media, but that's the point:  I Love LA  doesn't just walk into traps around internet culture and the massive industry that has spawned from it    — it lays them out for you.  The 30-minute, episodic format of  I Love LA , Sennott's first credit as a creator, plays to the actor's comedic strengths of witty one-liners and creating characters that feel relatable. (The series also includes Sennott's directing debut.) Over the last few years, the NYU graduate has made a career from embodying Gen-Z and millennial cringe — from starring in Comedy Central miniseries  Ayo and Rachel are Single  to her breakthrough lead role in indie favorite  Shiva Baby  to 2023's  Bottoms  alongside Ayo Edebiri. In  I Love LA , there's a reason that despite each character's obvious flaws, most of which are driven by ego and insecurities, you still find yourself rooting for them. The show is shrouded in a self-awareness around the fact that, in LA, making popular 30-second videos on TikTok can get you cozy with A-listers. Buying into the glitz and the glam is part of the ridiculousness of a city dubbed \"la-la-land\" for a reason. It's a perspective that someone like Sennott is apt to bring as an LA outsider who grew up on the East Coast. I Love LA  is the culmination of Sennott's career thus far — a show for anyone who grew up \"chronically online\" and for whom \"making it\" means waking up and asking \"how did I get here?\" before putting on a mini-skirt and stilettos to meet with a micro-celebrity they pretend to like. \"Hustle until your idols become your rivals,\" Maia says to hype herself up in the mirror. Because isn't that part of the fun? \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5591999","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"05:25:00-04:00","title":"5 Key Takeaways from Trump's Week in Asia","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During his first trip to Asia in his second term, President Donald Trump engaged in high-stakes diplomacy with China, achieving a notable stabilization in U.S.-China trade relations through a mutual agreement to lower tariffs, resume soybean purchases, and ease rare earth export restrictions.

He attended the ASEAN summit in Kuala Lumpur, addressed U.S. troops in Japan and met with China's President Xi Jinping in South Korea. Here are five takeaways from the president's first visit to the region in his second term. 1. U.S.-China trade relations have mostly stabilized … On the flight back to Washington after his meeting with Xi on Thursday, Trump said the tariff rate on Chinese exports would be lowered from 57% to 47%. The 10-point drop comes because Xi committed to trying to decrease the amount of fentanyl coming into the U.S. That issue has been a priority for Trump, who months ago put an extra 20% tariff on China because of fentanyl. Trump also said that China would resume buying soybeans from the U.S., which has been a major issue for American farmers since China had halted those purchases. China also agreed to back off the extra limits it had put on rare earths exports, in exchange for the U.S. scaling back some of its own export restrictions. That agreement will hold for a year. Those minerals are critical for the U.S. and other countries because they are used in military equipment and other technology. 2. But a finalized deal isn't done \"It was an outstanding group of decisions I think that was made,\" Trump told reporters after his meeting with Xi. \"There wasn't too much left out there.\" But he wasn't specific about what exactly is left for China and the U.S. to discuss. Trump said he is scheduled to visit China next April, which will be followed by another meeting with Xi in either Washington or in Florida. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Dennis Wilder, a former national security official and a professor at Georgetown University, said the meeting between Trump and Xi gave \"momentum\" for trade talks between the two countries to continue. \"Both sides have not given up their trade weapons but merely have agreed to stop firing as long as both sides hold to the agreements,\" Wilder said. 3. Diplomacy = flattery A charm offensive was on full display in Malaysia, Japan and Korea as leaders tried to cater to Trump ahead of trade talks and other negotiations. Trump's style of foreign relations is often rooted in personal relationships; heads of state, when visiting Washington, have tried to appease Trump to have a smoother relationship with the president. That strategy came forward in Asia, too. Nearly 100 dancers in Malaysia greeted Trump on the red carpet at his first stop. In Japan, Trump was gifted late Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's golf clubs and the newly elected prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, announced that she was going to nominate Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize. Trump's arrival in South Korea was also full of fanfare — \"YMCA,\" a song that's played at Trump's rallies for nearly a decade, was performed on the tarmac in Busan when Air Force One landed. President Lee Jae Myung gave Trump a replica of a golden crown significant to Korea's history. Trump also got a gold medal and was awarded Korea's highest civilian honor. 4. Trump wants to be seen as a peacemaker Trump has renamed the Department of Defense as the Department of War, he's deployed National Guard troops around different U.S. cities and in recent weeks, he has ordered strikes on a number of boats in the eastern Pacific allegedly carrying drugs. But on this trip in Asia, Trump wanted to emphasize his role as a peacemaker. His first stop in Malaysia at the ASEAN summit included presiding over the signing of a peace agreement between Cambodia and Thailand. A border dispute reignited between the two countries earlier this year, and Trump helped broker a ceasefire by threatening to increase tariffs. In his remarks in Kuala Lumpur, Trump said he was in Scotland playing golf when he got on the phone with the leaders from Cambodia and Thailand, and Malaysia, who also helped broker peace. \"You caused me very good entertainment. I could've had a lot of fun, but this is much more fun for me than anything,\" Trump said. Even before the trip, Trump had been claiming his administration has ended eight global conflicts. Russia's war in Ukraine hasn't been one of them, which has frustrated Trump. But it's possible he adds another conflict to solve to his peacemaking list. Though he didn't meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un while in Asia, Trump left the door open for a future meeting and said his administration would work on tensions between North and South Korea, which never formally ended their war. 5. Trump's making deals abroad, but Congress is still at a standstill Despite the dealmaking and peacemaking on the world's stage, Trump came home to a federal government that's still shut down, federal workers who aren't getting paid and critical programs like SNAP running out of funding. The president hasn't shown the same interest in making deals across the aisle with Democrats to reopen the government. Instead, he returned to Washington on Thursday night and mused on Truth Social about using the \"nuclear option,\" which he said would be to get rid of the filibuster. That would allow Senate Republicans to pass a funding agreement with a simple majority, not a 60-vote majority that would require support from Democrats. \"We are in power and if we did what we should be doing, it would IMMEDIATELY end this ridiculous, Country destroying 'SHUT DOWN',\" Trump said, adding that ending the filibuster   would \"take advantage\" of Democrats. Democrats have refused to vote in favor of the agreement to temporarily fund the government unless it includes a measure that would extend the tax credit that lowers the cost of health insurance premiums, which is set to expire at the end of the year. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5591978","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"20:59:00-04:00","title":"Trump says Senate should scrap the filibuster to end the government shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump is urging the Senate to eliminate the filibuster to allow Republican lawmakers to bypass Democratic opposition and reopen the federal government, which has been shut down since October 1, 2025.

should scrap the filibuster to end the government shutdown \n         By The Associated Press \n        \n           Friday, October 31, 2025 • 2:59 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump is calling on the Senate to scrap the filibuster, so that the Republican majority can bypass Democrats and reopen the federal government. \"THE CHOICE IS CLEAR — INITIATE THE 'NUCLEAR OPTION,' GET RID OF THE FILIBUSTER,\" Trump posted Thursday night on his social media site, Truth Social. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The filibuster is a long-standing tactic in the Senate to delay or block votes on legislation by keeping the debate running. It requires 60 votes in a full Senate to overcome a filibuster, giving Democrats a check on the 53-seat Republican majority that led to the start of the Oct. 1 shutdown when the new fiscal year began. Trump's call to terminate the filibuster could alter the ways the Senate and congressional dealmaking operate, with the president saying in his post that he gave a \"great deal\" of thought to the choice on his flight back from Asia on Thursday. Trump spent the past week with foreign leaders in Malaysia, Japan and South Korea, finishing his tour by meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. The president declared the trip a success because of a trade truce with China and foreign investment planned for American industries, but he said one question kept coming up during his time there about why did \"powerful Republicans allow\" the Democrats to shut down parts of the government. His call to end the filibuster came at a moment when certain senators and House Speaker Mike Johnson believed it was time for the government shutdown to come to an end. It's unclear if lawmakers will follow Trump's lead, rather than finding ways to negotiate with Democrats. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       From coast to coast, fallout from the dysfunction of a shuttered federal government is hitting home: Alaskans are stockpiling moose, caribou and fish for winter, even before SNAP food aid is scheduled to shut off. Mainers are filling up their home-heating oil tanks, but waiting on the federal subsidies that are nowhere in sight. Flights are being delayed with holiday travel around the corner. Workers are going without paychecks. And Americans are getting a first glimpse of the skyrocketing health care insurance costs that are at the center of the stalemate on Capitol Hill. \"People are stressing,\" said Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, as food options in her state grow scarce. \"We are well past time to have this behind us.\" While quiet talks are underway, particularly among bipartisan senators, the shutdown is not expected to end before Saturday's deadline when Americans' deep food insecurity — one in eight people depend on the government to have enough to eat — could become starkly apparent if federal SNAP funds run dry. Money for military, but not food aid The White House has moved money around to ensure the military is paid, but refuses to tap funds for food aid. In fact, Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" signed into law this summer, delivered the most substantial cut ever to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, projected to result in some 2.4 million people off the program. At the same time, many Americans who purchase their own health insurance through the federal and state marketplaces, with open enrollment also beginning Saturday, are experiencing sticker shock as premium prices jump. \"We are holding food over the heads of poor people so that we can take away their health care,\" said Rev. Ryan Stoess, during a prayer with religious leaders at the U.S. Capitol. \"God help us,\" he said, \"when the cruelty is the point.\" Deadlines shift to next week The House remains closed down under Johnson for the past month. Senators are preparing to depart Thursday for the long weekend. Trump returns late Thursday after a whirlwind tour of Asia. That means the shutdown, in its 30th day, appears likely to stretch into another week if the filibuster remains. If the shutdown continues, it could become the longest in history, surpassing the 35-day lapse that ended in 2019, during Trump's first term, over his demands to build the U.S.-Mexico border wall. The next inflection point comes after Tuesday's off-year elections — the New York City mayor's race, as well as elections in Virginia and New Jersey that will determine those states' governors. Many expect that once those winners and losers are declared, and the Democrats and Republicans assess their political standing with the voters, they might be ready to hunker down for a deal. \"I hope that it frees people up to move forward with opening the government,\" said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D. GOP cut SNAP in Trump's big bill The Republicans, who have majority control of Congress, find themselves in an unusual position, defending the furloughed federal workers and shuttered programs they have long sought to cut — including most recently with nearly $1 trillion in reductions in Trump's big tax breaks and spending bill. Medicaid, the health care program, and SNAP food aid, suffered sizable blows this summer, in part by imposing new work requirements. For SNAP recipients, many of whom were already required to work, the new requirements extend to older Americans up to age 64 and parents of older school-age children. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Republicans now \"have the nerve\" to suggest it's a political strategy to withhold food aid. \"We are trying to lift up the quality of life for the American people,\" Jeffries of New York said about his party. \"The American people understand that there's a Republican health care crisis,\" he said. \"The American people understand Republicans enacted the largest cut to nutritional assistance in American history when they cut $186 billion from their one, big, ugly bill.\" During the summer debate over Trump's big bill, Johnson and other Republicans railed against what they characterized as lazy Americans, riding what the House speaker calls the \"gravy train\" of government benefits. The speaker spoke about able-bodied young men playing video games while receiving Medicaid health care benefits and insisted the new work requirements for the aid programs would weed out what they called \"waste, fraud and abuse.\" \"What we're talking about, again, is able-bodied workers, many of whom are refusing to work because they're gaming the system,\" Johnson said in spring on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\" \"And when we make them work, it'll be better for everybody, a win-win-win for all,\" he said. What remains out of reach, for now, is any relief from the new health care prices, posted this week, that are expected to put insurance out of reach for many Americans when federal subsidies that help offset those costs are set to expire at the end of the year. Democrats have been holding out for negotiations with Trump and the Republicans to keep those subsidies in place. Republicans say they can address the issue later, once the government reopens. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-95419","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-04:00","title":"The Trump Administration Move to Study Aluminum in Vaccines Worries Scientists","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration has initiated a study on the safety of aluminum salts in vaccines, prompting widespread concern among public health experts. While aluminum has been used for nearly a century as an adjuvant to enhance immune response in vaccines against diseases like diphtheria, tetanus, and flu, critics including Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Dr. Christopher Exley question its safety, citing possible links to asthma, autism, or ADHD. However, major scientific evidence—including a large Danish study of over 1.2 million children—finds no connection between aluminum and serious illness.

Coming after other recent  changes to vaccine policy ,  many public health experts worry that the administration may now try to remove the ingredient.  \"We want no aluminum in the vaccine,\" President Trump said recently at a White House briefing.  For almost a century, some important vaccines, including shots that protect against diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis and the flu, have included aluminum salts, compounds that contain small amounts of  aluminum . They are used as adjuvants to give the immune system an extra kick necessary to make the shots protective. \"Aluminum is added to some vaccines because it's a very safe, but also effective, stimulant of the immune system,\" says Dr.  Jesse Goodman , a vaccine expert at Georgetown University who used to regulate vaccines at the Food and Drug Administration. \"It basically stimulates your cells to make more antibodies and a stronger immune response overall.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       But Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime vaccine critic, has questioned the safety of aluminum in vaccines for years. And a special working group is now studying the \"safety of ingredients that are present in multiple different vaccines,\" including aluminum, for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's influential Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. One question the working group is considering is \"do either of the two different aluminum adjuvants increase the risk of asthma?\" according to a  document  outlining the group's mandate. Most public health experts say there's no good evidence that aluminum is unsafe and ample evidence that it poses no real concern. In fact, a  large Danish study  recently debunked any danger. \"We do not see any evidence that aluminum is a cause of serious illness in childhood,\" says  Anders Hviid , a professor of epidemiology at the Statens Serum Institut in Denmark who led the study involving more than 1.2 million Danish children. \"There is no scientific reason to take aluminum out of childhood vaccines. There's no science that supports that it's dangerous.\" But some researchers welcome the move. \"I really believe that aluminum in vaccines is inherently bad. Full stop,\" says  Christopher Exley , a longtime critic of aluminum in vaccines who recently retired from Keele University in the U.K. \"And so any suggestion that we're going to remove it, I think, is absolutely marvelous, not only for making America healthy again but for making the world healthy again.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In addition to concerns over asthma, Exley thinks aluminum can  also increase the risk for other  health problems , including autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.  Hviid and others say trying to remove aluminum would cause significant problems for protecting people against serious diseases. Most importantly, the vaccines that contain aluminum would be rendered ineffective. \"To simply remove aluminum — in effect destroying or limiting the effectiveness of vaccines — is incredibly stupid,\" says Dr.  Stanley Plotkin , a leading authority on vaccine science at the University of Pennsylvania. People are exposed to far more aluminum in the environment than from vaccines, Plotkin notes.  And if federal regulators deem aluminum unsafe as a vaccine ingredient, vaccine makers would have to develop and test alternatives, a process that could take years. Such a move could undermine public trust in existing vaccines.  \"And what has happened with measles will happen with other diseases — that is, coming back to this country,\" Plotkin says. \"So, do we want that? Well, apparently some people do.\"  Federal health officials have not stated that they would pull existing vaccines with aluminum salts from the market, or that they want any diseases to return.  HHS press secretary Emily G. Hilliard declined to respond to specific questions about the safety of aluminum adjuvants or the practicality of removing them, but said in an emailed statement that \"ACIP is reviewing the body of science related to aluminum and other possible contaminants in childhood vaccine.\" And some scientists are open to at least studying the question of removing aluminum salts.  \"It's human nature to try to make things even better, right?\" says Dr.  Ofer Levy,  a pediatrician who runs the Precision Vaccines Program at Boston Children's Hospital. \"So with all of the sophisticated science we have in the year 2025, probably there's room for improvement.\" But Levy stresses that any changes should only be made if unbiased, well-conducted studies support that. In the meantime, Levy and others say that no one should hesitate about getting a vaccine containing aluminum. \"The question becomes: How do we give voice to legitimate concerns about vaccines without throwing the baby out with the bathwater?\" Levy says. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/fda-recall-prazosin-teva-blood-cancer-ce6338047a5f628300cc95e0eeb89b0b","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"06:59:43+00:00","title":"FDA Recalls Over 580,000 Bottles of Prazosin Due to Potential Cancer-Causing Impurities","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has ordered a nationwide recall of over 580,000 bottles of prazosin hydrochloride, a blood pressure and PTSD-related sleep disorder medication, due to potential contamination with cancer-causing nitrosamine impurities.

doing about it) \n         By Camila Domonoske \n        \n           Thursday, October 30, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         NPR's series  Cost of Living: The Price We Pay  is examining what's driving price increases and how people are coping after years of stubborn inflation. How are higher prices changing the way you live? Fill out  this form  to share your story with NPR. What's the item? Car insurance How has the price changed since before the pandemic? On average, premiums are up 55% since February 2020, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. (Almost all of that increase came between 2022 and 2024.) Why has the price gone up? Cars  are more expensive;  parts and repairs  are more expensive;  medical bills  following auto accidents are more expensive. Modern cars are packed with pricey electronics, pushing up the cost of fixing even minor fender benders, while empty streets during the pandemic encouraged speeding and led to more severe (and more expensive) crashes. All those things cost insurers money. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Patty Kuderer is the insurance commissioner for the state of Washington; when insurance companies want to raise premiums, they need to ask her office for approval. \"The claims paid really drive the cost of the premiums,\" she says. And when companies bring her proof of the higher amounts they're paying out — like they have in recent years — she's required by law to approve those increases. But those price hikes may finally be about to top out. \"The good news is that, largely, the industry is caught up on premiums, and we're now starting to see companies reduce costs and compete for business,\" says Bob Passmore, a vice president at the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, the trade group that represents insurers. Insurance companies had strong profits last year, and price hikes have stabilized. \"We may have seen the worst of it,\" he says. With one caveat: There's a six-to-12-month delay between when the insurance companies get hit by higher costs and when they're passed along to consumers, as companies assess their actual costs and get approval from regulators like Kuderer. Price hikes in the near term — caused by tariffs or other factors — could push up premiums again in the future. What are people doing about it? Shopping around, for one thing: Data analytics company LexisNexis reports that drivers are shopping around for policies at the highest rate since 2020, when the company started tracking. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Another thing they're doing: suffering. In  a recent survey  by LendingTree, more than 58% of drivers said their car insurance is a financial burden; more than half said they have cut back on other expenses to be able to afford their premium; more than a third said they avoid filing claims to keep their premium low. And more than a third of respondents said they have driven at some point  without  car insurance — which is illegal in every state except New Hampshire. The percentage of drivers on the road without insurance rose from 12.4% to 15.4% between 2018 and 2023, according to the  Insurance Research Council. \"I just couldn't afford it\": Driving uninsured  Zoe, a pastry chef in Pennsylvania, understands the importance of car insurance better than most. A few years ago, she had only the bare minimum insurance on her Toyota when an accident financially devastated her. Without insurance that would replace her undrivable vehicle, she was left carless, with an hourlong commute. Her savings were entirely wiped out. When she was able to replace her vehicle, she made sure to get full-coverage insurance at $230 a month. But it was a tight squeeze to cover it, and then her rent increased by $400. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       We're only using Zoe's first name because, for a short time after that, she became one of those people driving without insurance. \"I fully didn't pay my car insurance bill for about four weeks just because I couldn't afford it,\" Zoe says. \"We have to eat every week. You have to pay the power and the water bill and the rent, and the rent keeps going higher, and milk's $4 a gallon.\" Zoe was acutely aware of the risks she was taking if she were to get in a crash or pulled over. \"I slow down at every single intersection, regardless of whether the light was green or not,\" she recalls with a heavy sigh. \"I'm careful at every turn. I get worried.\" She ultimately scraped together the funds to get her coverage back. But it costs extra to reinstate coverage after it lapses, one reason among many why insurance advisers strongly advise against letting that happen. \"The upfront costs of buying insurance in the first place are very, very high,\" says Rob Bhatt, an auto insurance expert with LendingTree. \"But then the cost of not having insurance potentially can be a lot higher. It's a really tough thing to balance.\" Cutting back and paring down ... Experts are increasingly recommending that drivers price out insurance costs before they purchase new vehicles. Otherwise, the sticker shock can be painful. Brandy Levene, in Yakima, Wash., replaced her older vehicle with a 2018 Acura RDX and was stunned to see her insurance bill clock in at $500 a month. She had to cut back elsewhere to pay the bill. \"Normally, especially during the summer, we've gone to stay in a hotel and go out of town, maybe go to another state for a couple of days,\" she says. That all got put on hold. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Then she shopped around. By switching providers, she managed to bring that bill down to $190 a month. That's still more than $2,000 a year. She remembers when her car insurance cost less than she spent on gasoline. Now, she says, insurance is more than gas and car maintenance put together. And, she says with frustration, \"I'm not benefiting anything from it because I don't ever file a claim. So it's like I'm just paying this $190, I guess, to prevent from getting a ticket?\" Shannon Martin, an insurance expert with Bankrate, says that, to make matters worse, the rising costs of repairs mean that many people are likely now  under insured, meaning their insurance might not pay out as much as they'd need if they were in an accident. \"There's a feeling that you're paying more and you're getting less. And that's because you honestly are,\" Martin says. In fact, while she knows it's unwelcome advice, Martin says it would probably be a good idea to pay a little extra to  increase  the limits on a plan that was set up a few years ago, to make sure that any potential future payouts can keep up with your real expenses. … and postponing teenage driving Martin has a few tips on saving on insurance. Shop around, of course. For married couples, whoever has better credit should set up the policy. And, she says, \"if you have kids in the household, that means you're going to have teen drivers at some point. We don't have to give kids driver's licenses when they turn 16. That's our choice.\" That choice recently struck home for Levene. Her 17-year-old son, Josiah, has his license, and a family member has a car they'd be willing to pass down to him. But … \"I went through the process to see what it would cost to add him, and they told me it would be $350 a month,\" Levene says. \"And I'm like, 'Oh, I can't do this … that's so much money.'\" Levene would like it if she didn't have to drive her son to school — and Josiah would certainly love to have a set of wheels. \"Just to go somewhere outside of Yakima,\" he says wistfully. \"Just not being in this cycle where I'm just stuck in this town, stuck with the same life, stuck in the same living situation.\" But until he can get a job to cover that insurance bill himself, stuck is exactly what he is. \n         \n         Transcript \n         AILSA CHANG, HOST:   Since the pandemic, car insurance premiums have risen twice as fast as inflation overall. The NPR series Cost of Living: The Price We Pay has been looking at how people are coping with inflation. And today, NPR's Camila Domonoske digs into car insurance, which is a line item that's required for American drivers. CAMILA DOMONOSKE, BYLINE: Zoe is a pastry chef in Pennsylvania. We're only using her first name because she briefly drove without insurance, which is technically illegal. And let's just be clear - Zoe understands the importance of car insurance. A few years ago, she had the bare minimum insurance on her car, and an accident financially devastated her. ZOE: The mental anguish and the $7,000. DOMONOSKE: Her Toyota was undrivable and it was hard to be carless with an hour-long commute. ZOE: Have you ever tried to take a lift from the suburbs of Philadelphia to Wilmington, Delaware? DOMONOSKE: That's an expensive ride. The accident wiped out her savings. So when she was able to replace her damaged Toyota, she made sure to get full-coverage insurance. ZOE: It's about $230 a month. DOMONOSKE: She could pay it, barely, until her rent went up by 400 a month. ZOE: I fully didn't pay my car insurance bill for about four weeks just 'cause I couldn't afford it. Like, we have to eat every week, pay the power and the water bill. And the rent keeps going higher, and milk's $4 a gallon. DOMONOSKE: But she had to keep working, so she had to keep driving. Driving without insurance is against the law in almost every state. It's risky and it's expensive because you pay extra to restart insurance. Zoe has since scraped together the funds to get her car insurance back. But she was far from alone. From 2018 to 2023, the percentage of motorists driving without insurance rose from 12% to 15%, according to the Insurance Research Council. Bob Passmore, who's with the trade group that speaks for the big insurers, says the increase in uninsured drivers is not exactly mysterious. BOB PASSMORE: That tends to go with the cost of insurance. DOMONOSKE: Higher premiums are just harder to pay, and premiums have soared. Passmore points to the rising costs of medical bills and car repairs. Plus, empty streets during COVID led to more speeding and more severe crashes. That's all expensive for insurance companies, he says. PASSMORE: If their prices aren't keeping up with the cost of claims, then they're losing money, and they're not going to be able to continue operating. DOMONOSKE: So companies raised premiums. And last year, their profits were good. Passmore says the industry needs good years to cover for bad ones. Meanwhile, tariffs are pushing up the prices for metal and car parts, making repairs even more expensive, which could be felt in future premiums. In a recent survey, more than half of drivers told LendingTree they've cut back elsewhere to pay for car insurance. That's the first thing Brandy Levene did. Last year, her 2018 Acura cost $500 a month to insure. BRANDY LEVENE: I had one speeding ticket on there. I don't have any accidents. DOMONOSKE: So she cut back on travel. No more trips with her kids out of town. They live in Yakima, Washington. Then Levene shopped around and found a cheaper plan. Insurance experts told NPR that's their top recommendation for coping with these rising costs. Meanwhile, more than a third of drivers also told LendingTree they avoid filing claims to keep their premiums lower. That's frustrating in its own way. As Levene puts it... B LEVENE: I'm not benefiting anything from it because I don't ever file a claim. DOMONOSKE: Levene has one more strategy for keeping her insurance costs down. Her 17-year-old son, Josiah, just got his license, but... B LEVENE: I went through the process to see what it would cost to add him, and they told me it would be $350 a month, and I'm like, oh, I can't do this. Like, that's so much money. DOMONOSKE: Levene would like it if Josiah could drive himself to school. And Josiah, he'd love to have a set of keys. JOSIAH LEVENE: Just to go somewhere outside of Yakima. Like, just not being in this cycle where I'm just stuck in this town, stuck with the same life, stuck in the same living situation. DOMONOSKE: But until he gets a job to pay that insurance bill himself, stuck is exactly what he is. Camila Domonoske, NPR News.

Here's what to know \n         By Betsy Joles \n        \n           Friday, October 31, 2025 • 3:17 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — After five days of on-and-off talks in Istanbul to resolve hostilities that flared in the first half of October, Pakistan and Afghanistan agreed to continue a ceasefire they arrived at earlier this month, Turkey's Foreign Ministry  announced Thursday .  In a statement, the ministry said the next round of talks would take place on Nov. 6: \"All parties have agreed to put in place a monitoring and verification mechanism that will ensure maintenance of peace and imposing penalty on the violating party.\"   The ceasefire came after more than a week of cross-border gunfire and targeted strikes inside Afghanistan killed dozens on both sides, including civilians. The agreement put a pause on the most intense fighting between the two countries in years. Trade between Pakistan and Afghanistan has ground to a halt as major border crossings remain closed. Analysts warn that the conflict, which has deep roots, could reignite and destabilize the region. Here's what to know. What's at stake? The main issue between the neighboring countries is rising militancy in Pakistan's mountainous borderlands, where the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, also known as the Pakistani Taliban, has ramped up attacks in the years since the Taliban took over Afghanistan in 2021, following the withdrawal of U.S. forces. The TTP is closely aligned with the Afghan Taliban, and Pakistan accuses Afghanistan's Taliban rulers of providing them a base and failing to rein them in when they orchestrate deadly attacks in Pakistan — all of which Afghanistan's Taliban denies. Each country blamed the other for a breakdown in talks earlier this week. In a post on X, Pakistan's Information Minister Ataullah Tarar  said  Afghanistan's Taliban \"have always remained indifferent to Pakistan's losses. ... Pakistan's patience has run its course.\" Afghan state broadcaster RTA accused Pakistan of \"irrational demands.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Pakistan's increasingly bold military actions inside Afghanistan reflect its hardening stance toward cross-border militant groups, says Muhammad Amir Rana, director of Islamabad's Pak Institute for Peace Studies, an independent think tank. \"This is signaling to the [Afghan] Taliban that if you haven't changed your attitudes or policies supporting the TTP and other terrorist organizations inside Pakistan, Pakistan can retaliate,\" he says. What sparked this month's fighting? The conflict began after TTP militants  ambushed  a Pakistani army convoy on Oct. 8, killing 11 soldiers near the Afghan border. The TTP  aims to overthrow the Pakistani government  and impose hardline Islamic rule, as the Taliban did in Afghanistan. Afghanistan then  blamed Pakistan  for multiple strikes inside its territory on Oct. 9, including in its capital, Kabul. Pakistan has neither officially confirmed nor denied carrying out the strikes. Two nights later, Afghan forces fired at Pakistan's border posts in retaliation, leading to back-and-forth gunfire along the border. Cross-border fighting flared up again days later, before both sides agreed to an initial truce, which was later extended in Doha, Qatar, on Oct. 19.   Before ceasefire talks began in Doha, Pakistan also launched what security officials called targeted strikes against militants in Afghanistan's eastern province of Paktika. Up to now, talks with the Taliban about the TTP have yielded little for Pakistan, analysts say. \"Pakistani attempts to talk to the Taliban to convince them to do something against the TTP have failed,\" says Abdul Basit, senior associate fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Islamabad has also tried to pressure the Taliban by deporting Afghan refugees. Who are the Pakistani Taliban? The TTP emerged in 2007 in response to Pakistan's military support of the U.S. fight against the Taliban in Afghanistan. It has primarily targeted Pakistani security personnel in recent years, but also has claimed responsibility for horrific attacks on civilians, including   one in 2014  that killed more than 100 Pakistani schoolchildren. Its fighters share close ideological ties and battlefield experience with Afghanistan's Taliban. The group has seen a revival in the past four years, after counterterrorism campaigns significantly weakened it around a decade ago.  An independent conflict monitor found the TTP was behind   600 attacks  against Pakistani security forces in the past year alone. That's compared to an estimated   67 attacks  the year before the Taliban took power in Afghanistan, according to the Pak Institute for Peace Studies. Pakistan has been  closely connected to the Taliban  since it cultivated the Afghan group in the 1990s. It was accused of covertly supporting the Taliban through the U.S. war in Afghanistan, something Islamabad denies. How might this play out? President Trump said earlier this week on the sidelines of a regional summit in Malaysia that the conflict would be an easy fix. \"I heard that Pakistan and Afghanistan have started up, but I'll get that solved very quickly,\" he said.  In a post on X, Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid  said Thursday  that Afghanistan, \"like other neighboring countries, also desires positive relations with Pakistan and it adheres to the principles of mutual respect, non-interference in internal affairs, and not posing a threat to anyone.\" Earlier this year, Pakistan and Afghanistan held a trilateral meeting with China to discuss issues including counterterrorism and trade, raising hopes of better relations. But ties are meanwhile growing between Afghanistan and India, Pakistan's eastern neighbor and rival.  Asif, Pakistan's defense minister,  said this week  that \"Kabul is a tool for Delhi.\" This month's Pakistan-Afghanistan fighting coincided with the Taliban foreign minister's  first official visit  to India. \"It's not for a lack of diplomacy or dialogue that we are where we are right now,\" says Asfandyar Mir, senior fellow for South Asia at the Stimson Center in Washington, D.C. The current ceasefire, he says, suggests that for now, Pakistan has been able to corner the Taliban with its military escalation. But he expects the Taliban to continue tacitly supporting the TTP by stalling on Pakistani requests to act against the group in Afghanistan. He says the Afghan Taliban's support for the TTP is a continued source of regional instability that could lead to more attacks by the group in Pakistan and more intense military action by Pakistan inside Afghanistan. Basit, from Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, puts it starkly: \"Border tensions will play out at a new level,\" he warns. \"If they were simmering, now they will be boiling.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5589172","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"13:04:00Z","title":"Scientists Thought This Fossil Was a Teen T. rex.

Turns out it's a new tyrannosaur \n         By Ari Daniel \n        \n           Thursday, October 30, 2025 • 1:04 PM EDT \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         It's known as the \"Dueling Dinosaurs\" fossil: A triceratops and a tyrannosaur, skeletons entangled, locked in apparent combat right up until the moment of their mutual demise. Even in the Hell Creek Formation in eastern Montana, a spot known for great finds, this specimen was, in a word, \"fantabulous,\" says  Clayton Phipps , a self-described rancher, cowboy and dinosaur hunter. That discovery in 2006 now appears to have overturned decades of dinosaur dogma about  Tyrannosaurus rex , the fearsome giant long thought to be the sole top predator stalking the late Cretaceous. In a paper in the journal  Nature , paleontologists  Lindsay Zanno  and  James Napoli  conclude that some of the bones from that specimen belong not to a teenage  T. rex , but to a fully grown individual of a different tyrannosaur species —  Nanotyrannus lancensis . \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The majority of paleontologists, after some debate, had dismissed the idea that any other tyrannosaurs existed besides  T. rex . And yet, the sands of Montana seem to have disgorged a second one. In a broader analysis of other fossils, the two researchers also uncovered what they say is a third tyrannosaur species, formerly presumed to be a juvenile  T. rex . \"We knew the specimen was exceptional,\" says Zanno. \"We did not realize it would turn decades of research about  T. rex  on its head.\" \"Just insanely good\"   The Montana dig began on a breezy summer day when Phipps' friend, Mark Eatman, found an exposed pelvis and femur at the bottom of a canyon. Phipps thought maybe there was half a dinosaur hidden below. But after two weeks of digging, Phipps and his older cousin revealed that those bones belonged to a stunning triceratops. \"It was crazier than any site I've ever done before or since because every bone is in place,\" he says. \"The skeleton was just all together — just insanely good.\" Then, while excavating the light yellow sand from around the specimen, Phipps spotted something the color of chocolate. It was a claw. But triceratops didn't have claws. \"I'm like, 'What?' I start brushing and all of a sudden this arm starts to appear and part of the leg,\" he recalls. \"Oh man, my hat went in the air about 200 feet. I was like, 'No way — there's another dinosaur in here.'\" This was a bipedal,  carnivorous  dinosaur, entwined with the triceratops. \"Just laying like they died,\" says Phipps. The scientific consensus pegged this second dinosaur as a teenage  Tyrannosaurus rex  — a conclusion that would soon be overturned. Teenage angst A few years ago, the nonprofit  Friends of the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences  acquired the fossils and rock they were encased in (some 30,000 pounds) from Phipps and donated them to the museum. \"They were a Christmas present waiting to be unwrapped,\" he says. Zanno, who is head of paleontology at the museum, was thrilled. \"It's one of the most incredible specimens from the late Cretaceous in North America I've ever seen,\" she says. She and the museum built  an entire wing around the dueling dinosaurs  to house a live-action research experience. \"It's the only place in the world where you get to enter the working paleo-lab without a barrier and talk to the scientific team that's working on the fossils,\" says Zanno. When that work began, Zanno also figured the carnivorous dinosaur was the world's most complete juvenile  T. rex  ever found. \"But as soon as we started actually studying this specimen, we realized there were a lot of red flags,\" she says. For context, paleontologists had previously debated whether small-bodied tyrannosaurs were teenage  T. rexes  or a different species altogether. The existence of a two-legged tyrannosaur species that lived alongside  T. rex  was proposed back in the 1940s, but had long since fallen out of favor. The consensus converged on juvenile  T. rex , \"meaning it would have been the only major predator in end-Cretaceous ecosystems right before the asteroid impact,\" says Zanno. Most researchers believed that  T. rex  — which could be  12 feet high , 40 feet long and weigh around 15,000 pounds — had outcompeted all other meat-eating dinosaurs. The completeness of the new skeleton provided Zanno with the ideal specimen to test these long-standing conclusions. \"This is such a controversial topic,\" she says. \"And we don't want to write another paper that just stirs the pot. We want to write the paper that ends the debate.\" The dueling dinosaurs settle a duel One of the first of those red flags in the new specimen was the arm bones. They looked completely different than  T. rex 's puny appendages. \"We never had a complete arm of this animal,\" says Zanno. \"These are powerful arms with large claws, large hands. They were using them for prey capture.\" Contrast that with  T. rex , \"an animal that's a mouth on legs.\" There were additional clues. The animal had fewer tail vertebrae and more teeth than  T. rex . Zanno and Napoli considered other lines of evidence. They created 3D models of numerous purported  T. rex es against which they compared their specimen. They looked at the growth stages of the cranial nerves and sinuses of close living relatives of dinosaurs, features that were visible in the fossilized skeleton. \"But maybe the most important and damning thing that we did was we were able to figure out that our animal is not a juvenile at all,\" she says. This conclusion was based on slicing through the fossil's limb bones to examine the growth rings. That work demonstrated that this animal was mature and done growing when it died around the age of 20. \"That means it's half the size and a tenth of the mass of a full grown  Tyrannosaurus rex ,\" says Zanno. All of the results point to one conclusion, according to Zanno and Napoli. This was no teen  T. rex . This was a fully grown  Nanotyrannus lancensis  — the same species first identified in the 1940s and later largely dismissed by the paleontological community. It was \"a small, slender pursuit predator that could run under the legs of a  T. rex ,\" explains Zanno. In addition, while making models of all those other alleged  T. rex  skeletons, Zanno says they identified another new species of tyrannosaur, one they're calling  Nanotyrannus lethaeus . \"The name comes from Greco-Roman mythology for the [Lethe] River where souls used to drink and forget their prior lives and be reincarnated,\" she says. \"That's a reference to this animal having been under our nose and not recognized for what it was.\" For years, most researchers believed there was just one tyrannosaur —  rex . But now the king has been de-throned. There were at least two other tyrannosaurs holding court. \"It tells us that these end-Cretaceous ecosystems right before the asteroid hit were flourishing,\" says Zanno. \"They had an abundance of different predators. And refutes this idea that dinosaurs were in decline before the asteroid struck.\" Loving being wrong Thomas Holtz , a paleontologist at the University of Maryland who wasn't involved in the research, welcomes the broader picture of tyrannosaur diversity proposed by the new study. \"I always said with sufficient evidence, I'd be happy to embrace it,\" he says. \"And now I can because there's sufficient evidence. I think they've made a very strong case.\" Though, he adds, \"We'll see if it lasts. As I like to point out, taxonomy is not permanent,\" referring to the study of how organisms are classified (and, sometimes, re-classified). Holtz argues that one consequence of the study is that paleontologists no longer know what a juvenile  T. rex  looked like — because previously assumed \"teenagers\" were likely  Nanotyrannus . That's an arena of future research and discovery, along with fleshing out the varied biologies and behaviors of this growing group of tyrannosaurs. Zanno agrees that there remains much to understand. She believes there's likely to be additional dinosaur species that have been hidden in plain sight in museums and collections across the world. \"This is why I love science,\" says Zanno. \"I have the only job in the world where my job is to second-guess myself every day and everything I think I know.\" \"When it comes to shedding doubt on research on Earth's most famous dinosaur,\" she says, referring to  T. rex , \"that's an intimidating endeavor. But this is how we grow as a profession and how we grow as scientists.\" Zanno believes this study will pave the way for paleontologists to look for more complex patterns in this and other prehistoric ecosystems. \"From here forward,\" Zanno adds, \"what I'm most thrilled about is how much we stand to learn by recognizing that we got it wrong the first time.\" \n         \n         Transcript \n         JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:   Think of Tyrannosaurus rex, a fearsome dinosaur and the top predator stalking the late Cretaceous.

DANIEL: ...Whose friend had found an exposed pelvis and femur at the bottom of a canyon in eastern Montana. The bones belong to a stunning triceratops. Then after excavating for about two weeks, there in the dug-up sand, Phipps spotted something the color of chocolate - a claw. But triceratops didn't have claws. PHIPPS: I'm like, what? I start brushing, and all of a sudden this arm starts to appear and part of the leg. Oh, man, my hat went in the air about 200 feet (laughter) 'cause I was like, no way. There's another dinosaur in here. DANIEL: This was a bipedal, carnivorous tyrannosaur entwined with the triceratops. PHIPPS: Just laying like they died. DANIEL: Phipps sold the fossils to the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences, where Lindsay Zanno is head of paleontology. LINDSAY ZANNO: It's one of the most incredible specimens from the late Cretaceous in North America I've ever seen. DANIEL: Zanno and the museum built an entire wing around the dueling dinosaurs to house a live-action research experience. ZANNO: It's the only place in the world where you get to enter the working paleo lab and talk to the scientific team. DANIEL: Like many of her colleagues, Zanno started out thinking the carnivorous dinosaur was a juvenile T. rex, perhaps the most complete teenage tyrannosaur ever found. ZANNO: But as soon as we started actually studying this specimen, we realized there were a lot of red flags. DANIEL: One red flag was the arm bones, which were unlike T. rex's puny appendages. ZANNO: These are powerful arms with large claws, large hands. DANIEL: The animal had fewer tail vertebrae than T. rex and more teeth. ZANNO: But maybe the most damning thing that we did was we were able to figure out that our animal is not a juvenile at all. DANIEL: By slicing through the limb bones to examine the growth rings, Zanno and her colleagues found this animal was done growing when it died. It all pointed to one conclusion, she says. This was no teen T. rex. This was a different tyrannosaur species whose existence was long dismissed by most paleontologists. This was a fully grown Nanotyrannus lancensis. ZANNO: A small, slender pursuit predator that could run under the legs of a T. rex. This is an animal that's using its arms to hunt prey. Tyrannosaurus rex is an animal that's a mouth on legs. DANIEL: For years, most researchers believe there was just one tyrannosaur, rex. This work dethrones the king. There were other tyrannosaurs holding court. ZANNO: It tells us that these end Cretaceous ecosystems were flourishing before the asteroid struck. DANIEL: The findings appear in the journal Nature. Thomas Holtz is a paleontologist at the University of Maryland who wasn't involved in the study. He welcomes the broader picture of tyrannosaur diversity. THOMAS HOLTZ: I always said, with sufficient evidence, I'd be happy to embrace it. And now I can. But we'll see if it lasts. As I like to point out, taxonomy is not permanent. DANIEL: The study opens up numerous research avenues about the varied biologies (ph) and behaviors of what appears to be a growing group of tyrannosaurs. Lindsay Zanno again. ZANNO: This is why I love science. What I'm most thrilled about is how much we stand to learn by recognizing that we got it wrong the first time. DANIEL: For NPR News, I'm Ari Daniel.

registration form cannot be enforced, a federal judge ruled Friday. U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly in Washington, D.C., sided with Democratic and civil rights groups that sued the Trump administration over his executive order to overhaul U.S. elections. She ruled that the proof-of-citizenship directive is an unconstitutional violation of the separation of powers, dealing a blow to the administration and its allies who have argued that such a mandate is necessary to restore public confidence that only Americans are voting in U.S. elections. “Because our Constitution assigns responsibility for election regulation to the States and to Congress, this Court holds that the President lacks the authority to direct such changes,” Kollar-Kotelly wrote in her opinion. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); She further emphasized that on matters related to setting qualifications for voting and regulating federal election procedures “the Constitution assigns no direct role to the President in either domain.” Related Stories A Vermont cycling apparel company is trying to survive Trump’s tariffs.

The ruling grants the plaintiffs a partial summary judgment that prohibits the proof-of-citizenship requirement from going into effect. It says the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, which has been considering adding the requirement to the federal voter form, is permanently barred from taking action to do so. In a statement, Sophia Lin Lakin of the ACLU, one of the plaintiffs in the case, called the ruling “a clear victory for our democracy. President Trump’s attempt to impose a documentary proof of citizenship requirement on the federal voter registration form is an unconstitutional power grab.” The White House disagreed with the judge’s ruling in a statement late Friday. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); “President Trump has exercised his lawful authority to ensure only American citizens are casting ballots in American elections,” said Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson. “This is so commonsense that only the Democrat Party would file a lawsuit against it. We expect to be vindicated by a higher court.” While a top priority for Republicans, attempts to implement documentary proof-of-citizenship requirements for voting have been fraught. The U.S. House passed a citizenship mandate last spring that has stalled in the Senate, and several attempts to pass similar legislation in the states have proved equally difficult. Such requirements have created problems and confusion for voters when they have taken effect at the state level. It presents particular hurdles for married women who have changed their name, since they might need to show birth certificates and marriage certificates as well as state IDs. Those complications arose earlier this year when a proof-of-citizenship requirement took effect for the first time during local elections in New Hampshire . In Kansas, a proof-of-citizenship requirement that was in effect for three years created chaos before it was overturned in federal court. Some 30,000 otherwise eligible people were prevented from registering to vote. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Voting by noncitizens also has been shown to be rare . The lawsuit brought by the DNC and various civil rights groups will continue to play out to allow the judge to consider other challenges to Trump’s order. That includes a requirement that all mailed ballots be received, rather than just postmarked, by Election Day . Other lawsuits against Trump’s election executive order are ongoing. In early April, 19 Democratic state attorneys general asked a separate federal court to reject Trump’s executive order. Washington and Oregon, where virtually all voting is done with mailed ballots, followed with their own lawsuit against the order. ___ Riccardi reported from Denver."},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5581424","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Automakers take a hit from tariffs, but some still see strong earnings","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Despite facing significant financial burdens from high tariffs — totaling $30 billion across the industry — and supply chain disruptions such as a fire at an aluminum plant and semiconductor shortages, major U.S. automakers like General Motors and Ford are reporting strong quarterly profits.

see strong earnings \n         By Camila Domonoske \n        \n           Friday, October 31, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Morning Edition \n        \n      \n\n         Automakers have been footing a hefty tariff bill — to the tune of $30 billion across the industry this year, according to a recent analysis from Moody's. The industry is also grappling with a shortage of semiconductors, leaving them without the chips they need to build some vehicles, as well as a  fire at an aluminum plant  that's hurting the supply chain for Ford and Stellantis. Despite those headwinds, quarterly earnings reports from automakers are so far showing resilience. General Motors reported $3.4 billion in profits last quarter and Ford brought in $2.6 billion, both beating expectations. Stellantis, the maker of Jeep, Dodge, Chrysler and Ram, increased its revenues by 13% year over year. Hyundai, despite seeing a 29% decline in profits compared to the same quarter last year, still plans to meet its targets for the year. Volkswagen Group, on the other hand, reported a more than billion-dollar loss, as it faced the combined costs of tariffs and Porsche's pivot from electric vehicles back to gasoline. Part of the reason for automakers' positive reports is that Trump lowered tariffs on goods from  Japan  and  Europe  from 25% to 15%, and just recently announced a similar deal with  Korea . While a 15% tariff is still substantial, the changes were welcomed by automakers. Meanwhile, a  recent policy change  eased the burden of tariffs on imported parts that go into U.S.-built cars. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Automakers' bottom lines are also getting a boost from  rising car prices . Companies have been cautious about  passing tariff costs along  to consumers, in part because cars are already so expensive — over $50,000 on average, according to Kelley Blue Book. There are real questions about how much more consumers are willing or able to pay. But gradual increases are now visible. Across the industry, prices are up about .5% this year, Ford says. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Meanwhile, the Trump administration's  rollback of environmental rules  is benefitting some automakers substantially — in particular, changes to  emissions requirements  that used to penalize automakers if they made too many high-polluting vehicles. Suddenly, automakers do not have to manufacture electric vehicles, which they have struggled to make profitably. And they can build as many large pickup trucks as they can sell — which are both more polluting and more profitable. That's been a boost to companies like GM, Stellantis and Ford, offsetting the costs of tariffs. Of course, that same policy change is a setback for all-electric automakers like Tesla and Rivian. Under the previous rules, automakers that wanted to make gas guzzlers could pay EV manufacturers for \"regulatory credits,\" allowing them to borrow their rivals' green halos — and comply with federal rules. Now, that revenue stream for EV makers is being eliminated. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Tesla had strong sales last quarter, helped by  the rush to buy EVs  as consumers tried to take advantage of the now-eliminated consumer EV tax credit. But profits fell. (On Tesla's quarterly call with investors, Musk,  as   usual , was less interested in talking about those EV sales and much more interested in talking about the humanoid robots that he plans to sell.) Rivian is expected to report earnings next week. Those policy changes are slowing the transition to electric vehicles. GM is ending production of its electric commercial van, and Stellantis is  leaning heavily  into inefficient Hemi engines, as a new CEO pivots away from a  previous focus on electrification . But executives are also consistently saying they still plan to invest in electric vehicles. \"EVs remain our North Star,\" said Mary Barra, explaining that GM will continue to work on  improved EV batteries . \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Partly, that's because of competitive pressure, as Chinese automakers make increasingly  attractive and affordable electric vehicles . But automakers also know that just as the Trump administration did a U-turn on EVs, a future administration might once again make climate change and air pollution major priorities. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"We expect adoption will increase over time and the market [will] continue to evolve — and maybe even regulations evolve,\" Ford CEO Jim Farley told investors. So Ford still plans to move forward with  a $30,000 electric pickup , despite the lack of federal tax credits or regulations that would encourage it. \"We think this product is literally at the center of the future of the EV market in the U.S.,\" Farley said. \n         \n         Transcript \n         LEILA FADEL, HOST:   Automakers have been paying billions of dollars in tariffs on imported cars, parts and materials. That's cut into their profits, but GM and Ford recently told investors they're doing quite well, actually. NPR's Camila Domonoske has been tuning in - or should I say tuning up? - on these conversations between auto execs and Wall Street. Good morning, Camila. CAMILA DOMONOSKE, BYLINE: Good morning, Leila. FADEL: So what's the impact of the tariffs been? DOMONOSKE: I mean, it is - it's significant, right? FADEL: Right. DOMONOSKE: It's cutting into profits. We've seen big automakers - Hyundai just reported its profits fell. Volkswagen posted a loss due partly to these tariffs. But the tariffs on many countries that export a lot of cars have been reduced. Most recently, a deal struck with Korea, right? And a recent change has eased the tariffs that automakers that build cars in the U.S. pay on imported car parts. And both of those things have helped reduce the tariff burden on companies. Meanwhile, I will note that the industry is also dealing with a shortage of semiconductors, the computer chips that go into cars. You might remember there was a similar shortage just a few years ago that was triggered by the pandemic. This one is tied to trade wars. FADEL: OK. DOMONOSKE: And so companies are having to deal with costs tied to that, too. FADEL: OK. So those are challenges. What's working in automakers' favor? DOMONOSKE: Well, for one thing, slightly higher prices, which is good for the bottom line of companies. Car prices have been so high overall for several years now. The average is over $50,000, according to Kelley Blue Book, right? FADEL: Wow. DOMONOSKE: And as a result, companies have been this year a little reluctant to pass along the full cost of tariffs to shoppers because of questions about how high prices can actually go. But we are seeing prices just starting to rise now, which - not great news if you're trying to buy a car but helpful to these companies, right? Also, separately, the Trump administration has rolled back some major environmental rules, including very important regulations around vehicle emissions, and that has been a real boost to some companies' bottom lines. They don't have to make as many electric vehicles, which many of them were struggling to make profitably, and they can sell as many big pickup trucks, which are more polluting and also more profitable, as they can. And so that has been helpful to companies like Ford, GM and Stellantis, who really lean into those big pickup trucks in their business, and it's helping offset the costs of tariffs for those companies. FADEL: But what does that mean for the future of EVs then? DOMONOSKE: Yeah. Well, the transition to electric vehicles is clearly moving slower than it was moving or than it was expected to move. One thing that has been interesting in these earnings calls is that executives are still saying that they are planning on investing in EVs and that they are the future. One reason for that is competitive pressure, right? We know that China is making very... FADEL: Yeah. DOMONOSKE: ...Good and very affordable electric vehicles right now. Another is something that Ford's CEO nodded to, which is that regulations might evolve. Administrations change, and companies have to be ready for the possibility that the U.S. government in the future might once again prioritize climate or air pollution, even if it's not right now.

economic cooperation, just days after the presidents of the United States and China agreed to dial down their trade war. After two days of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in the South Korean city of Gyeongju, APEC leaders issued a joint statement pledging greater cooperation to overcome shared challenges in a global economy hit hard by trade tensions between the U.S. and China, the world’s two largest economies. On Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump and China’s Xi Jinping — who met on the sidelines of the APEC summit — dialed back earlier steps and agreed to de-escalate trade tensions. Trump, known for his dismissal of multilateralism, quickly left South Korea after the agreement with Xi, allowing the Chinese president to steal the limelight at the summit.

In written remarks sent to a CEO summit held in conjunction with APEC, Xi said that “investing in China is investing in the future.” Xi also met with his Japanese, Canadian and Thai counterparts bilaterally on Friday and was to meet South Korean President Lee Jae Myung on Saturday for one-on-one talks that Seoul officials said would touch on efforts to achieve denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. That agenda has apparently angered North Korea, a non-APEC member. North Korea’s Vice Foreign Minister Pak Myong Ho on Saturday slammed South Korea for talking about “its daydream” of realizing North Korea’s denuclearization. He said North Korea will show how such a push is “a pipedream” that can never be realized. Park’s statement was seen as applying pressure ahead of the Xi-Lee meeting. Lee, an advocate of reconciliation with North Korea , said Saturday he would take “more active preemptive steps” to lower military tensions with the North, stressing that peace on the Korean Peninsula is essential to prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Trump earlier repeatedly expressed his desire to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during his visit to South Korea, but North Korea did not respond. Trump and Kim met three times in 2018-19, but their nuclear diplomacy eventually collapsed . North Korea has since vowed not to place its advancing nuclear program on a negotiating table, but experts say the North would aim for winning extensive sanctions relief in return for a partial surrender of its advancing nuclear program. APEC meeting also talks AI and demographic issues While the summit focused on ways to boost trade and investment on Friday, Saturday’s meeting had cooperation in the field of artificial intelligence, demographic challenges and cultural industries on its agenda. APEC leaders also issued two separate statements on Saturday. One called for a coordinated approach to the changes brought on by AI, which they described as a potential economic catalyst that also poses challenges in rapidly evolving digital environments. The other urged for cooperation to address declining birth rates, aging populations and accelerated urbanization. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Established in 1989, APEC champions free and open trade and investment to promote regional economic integration. But the region now faces challenges such as the U.S.-China rivalry , supply chain disruptions, aging populations and the impact of AI on jobs.

The school crossing guard was walking into the crosswalk in front of Washington Township High School in Indianapolis when a car with a young boy and his mom, who was dropping him off at school, suddenly appeared. The mom’s eyes grew wide, and the boy began vigorously hitting on his mother’s chest. “Next thing, it was boom, lights out. That’s all I remember,” Taylor said. He woke up in the hospital hours after undergoing surgery for a fractured pelvis and other broken bones. In many ways, Taylor was lucky. Despite the broken bones and the pins and metal plates to heal his body from that August 2018 collision, he returned to work. Across the country, school crossing guards like Taylor, who stand in the cold, rain or heat to protect children, face the risk of injuries from drivers who may be distracted or in a hurry. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); An investigation by The Associated Press and Cox Media Group Television Stations found that over the past 10 years, hundreds of school crossing guards — many of them of retirement age or older -- have suffered injuries on the job after being hit by a vehicle, and dozens of them have died. A full accounting is impossible. No federal agencies and just two states track how many crossing guards are injured or killed each year . And local police accident reports often have no code to distinguish between school crossing guards and other pedestrians hit near schools.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More “Officers rarely stop to consider whether the injured ‘pedestrian’ was on duty.” said former Cornelius, North Carolina, Police Chief Bence Hoyle. A database compiled by AP and Cox Media Group shows that 230 school crossing guards across 37 states and Washington, DC, were struck by vehicles. Nearly three dozen were killed in these collisions. The cases, compiled from incident and accident reports requested from nearly 200 police departments, represent only a portion of guards injured and killed nationwide. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); The investigation shows that in these cases, drivers who hit or even kill crossing guards rarely face serious consequences. Of the incidents involving 183 crossing guards where an outcome could be determined, nearly half resulted in traffic citations — such as “failure to yield to a pedestrian.” About a quarter of the drivers weren’t ticketed at all, while just over a quarter faced criminal charges. Police said several factors go into whether or not a driver who hits a crossing guard is charged, including things such as weather conditions or negligence by the person operating the vehicle. Taken as a whole, these incidents highlight a largely underreported problem: Crossing guards, tasked with protecting children as they navigate busy streets in front of schools, can be casualties of dangerous roadways. “It’s a huge responsibility to step out in front of a vehicle,” said Dacia Maisonave, a crossing guard trainer in Seminole County, Florida. “It is unfortunate that our crossing guards don’t have a lot of laws. The only thing they really have to protect them is the stop paddle.” KEY FINDINGS FROM AP/COX MEDIA GROUP INVESTIGATION No way to track the total number of crossing guard injuries and deaths across the country: A database compiled by the AP and Cox Media Group shows that at least 230 school crossing guards across 37 states and Washington D.C., were struck by vehicles on the job over the last decade. Three dozen were killed. Drivers who hit crossing guards rarely face criminal charges, even if the injuries to crossing guards result in death: Of the 183 incidents involving crossing guards where an outcome could be determined, nearly half resulted in traffic citations– such as “failure to yield to a pedestrian.” About a quarter of the drivers weren’t ticketed at all, while a quarter faced criminal charges. Federal data analyzed by the AP show that crossing guard is among the most dangerous jobs: Crossing guards and road construction flaggers were in the top fifth for death rates on the job, a rate calculated by the AP based on analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data, on par with power line installers and air transportation workers. ▶ Click here to watch and read the stories produced by the eight Cox Media Group TV stations across the country. AP AUDIO: Crossing guards face life-threatening dangers on the job In part 1 of Disreguarded , AP correspondent Haya Panjwani reports on the dangers crossing guards face on a daily basis when they put themselves in dangers way. ‘Just slow down’ The lack of a system to track injuries and deaths of crossing guards has hampered efforts to develop better safety measures or even assess just how dangerous the job is, experts say. School crossing guard protection remains a patchwork of state and local policies. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes survey data for on-the-job injuries and deaths across most industries, but school crossing guards are included in a job category with road construction flaggers — and the agency does not publish a fatality rate for it. The AP calculated its own fatality rates for nearly 200 job classifications with at least 10,000 workers and 10 deaths in 2023, the most recent year of available records. Crossing guards and flaggers were in the top fifth of deadliest jobs, the AP’s analysis found, on par with power line installers and air transportation workers. It’s the only occupation in that top fifth that interacts with children daily. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Other federal agencies also rarely capture details specific to school crossing guards’ injuries or deaths. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s records on fatal accidents specify whether a school bus was involved or the crash happened within a designated school zone. But no information is captured about whether a victim was a crossing guard. Very few accident reports filed through the Occupational Safety and Health Administration mention school crossing guards. Only two states have made a serious effort to track crossing guard safety: New Jersey and Massachusetts. After examining the deaths of 16 crossing guards struck by motor vehicles and more than 230 injuries between 1993 and 2008, the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development launched a program aimed at crossing guard safety in February. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Officials in New Jersey said they target school zones for recurring safety inspections and have already issued eight serious violations and 30 others to employers for noncompliance. But even this pioneering effort faces limitations. “Since there are no crossing guard standards in New Jersey, there is only so much we can do but to make sure they have appropriate training,” says Assistant State Labor Commissioner Justin Baker. New Jersey state officials said they work with local police to provide training and proper equipment, including reflective vests. Michael Flanagan, director of the Department of Labor Standards in Massachusetts, said his state began tracking school crossing guard injuries and deaths when a guard was fatally struck in 2012. In 2022, he said the state mandated that cities and towns report crossing guard injuries. Labor experts say more can be done to make the job safer. Among possible solutions that remain underused in the U.S, experts say, are installing smart crosswalk systems with flashing LED lights, raised crosswalks, automated speed cameras or requiring all guards to wear high-visibility gear. Flanagan said ultimately the most effective measure for protecting cross guards from injuries and deaths comes from talking to and educating motorists. “Crossing guards are out there, and just slow down and be aware of that and look out for them,” he said. Close calls and deaths School crossing guards are employed by local police departments, school districts or private companies hired by schools. Many of them are older adults or retirees — of the 160 cases where AP and Cox Media Group were able to document ages, more than half were older than 65. In interviews, many guards say they enjoy their jobs. But they also recount almost daily close calls with hurried and distracted drivers who ignore posted warning signs and the guards themselves, even in crosswalks. Travis Callis, a former crossing guard in Martinsburg, West Virginia, said while he’s never been hurt, he’s had several close run-ins, including an instance where a car was so close he could feel its heat on the back of his legs. “I’m holding the sign up and they’re just driving at me,” he said.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More In some cases, collisions can kill. Last year, Stanley Brucker, 61, was working as a crossing guard at Fort Mill Elementary School in South Carolina when he was struck by a car as he was holding a stop sign and directing traffic. Video captured by a passing school bus shows a vehicle hitting Brucker and flipping him over the car as he stands in the crosswalk. He was transported to a nearby hospital but later died. Brucker was the fourth crossing guard to be hit or killed while working for the school district. His death caused many of the district’s crossing guards to refuse to show up for two days after they learned the driver who hit him wouldn’t face charges. “There is no indication that the driver of the vehicle was driving in a dangerous or reckless manner,” local prosecutors in the 16th Circuit Solicitor’s Office said in a statement at the time. Brucker’s family sees it differently and has filed a lawsuit against the school district and the driver who struck him. The lawsuit accuses the Fort Mill School District of choosing locations for crossing guards that were not “reasonably safe,” citing “the actual conditions on the site in the middle of a busy highway and by the numerous past instances of injury to crossing guards.” No trial date has been set for the case to be heard. In response to questions about the lawsuit, a spokesperson for the district wrote: “In light of the pending litigation, in which the actions of traffic guards employed by the company providing guards to the district is an issue, the district, on advice of counsel, is unable to respond further.” The Fort Mill School District and the driver who hit Brucker have both asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit. Before the start of this school year, district officials informed parents that public schools in Fort Mill will not have traffic guards. The district has installed a new traffic system to help improve safety in the absence of traffic guards. Rutledge Young, an attorney in Charleston, South Carolina, representing Brucker’s family, said Brucker was doing what he was told to do. “I believe that Mr. Brucker was doing his job and was killed as a result,” Young said. Across the country, data compiled by AP and Cox Media Group shows similar instances of guards being killed and drivers not facing criminal charges. James Arthur Holland of Lexington, Kentucky, a crossing guard with the local police department, was hit and killed in 2023 by a driver while working outside an elementary school. Police found that the driver did not have insurance or a driver’s license, and the vehicle’s registration had expired. Police said the incident was not a result of speeding or impairment, but environmental conditions. The driver was given various traffic citations, but no criminal charges were filed. Kevin VanFleet, a detective in the Simi Valley Police Department in California, said each collision must be looked at individually. He said several factors go into deciding if a driver is going to be charged, including what police -- who rarely witness the accident -- find during their investigation and whether local prosecutors feel charges are warranted. “Not everybody that is involved in a collision, let’s say, with a pedestrian in a crosswalk, or perhaps a crossing guard in a crosswalk, is going to receive an infraction ticket. It depends on the severity of it,” VanFleet said One common explanation for drivers hitting crossing guards that emerges from a review of traffic and incident reports is the glare of sunlight. “The sun was in my eyes,” appears repeatedly in reports obtained by AP and Cox Media Group. Last year, Patricia Davis, a guard in Monroe County, Georgia, about an hour east of Atlanta, was hit by a truck while helping students cross. The driver told law enforcement that the sun was directly in his eyes, and he didn’t see Davis until his truck struck her. Davis was taken to the hospital after suffering minor injuries. The driver was not charged. Police labeled the collision an accident. Dave Peavy, 76, a crossing guard in Gardner, Kansas, wasn’t as fortunate. Peavy, a Vietnam veteran who wore a Santa hat and passed out candy to kids crossing his intersection, was hit and killed by a car as he stepped out to stop traffic. The driver, who was not charged, told police that sunlight blinded him, and he never saw Peavy. Crossing guards said these cases and dozens more like them highlight how drivers rarely face serious consequences when one of them is severely injured or killed. Beyond distracted drivers and the glare of sunlight, experts point to multiple other factors that compromise crossing guard safety. The higher hoods of today’s SUVs and trucks create larger blind spots that reduce visibility. Many school zones lack adequate traffic-slowing measures like speed bumps or automated enforcement cameras. And many local roads are designed to prioritize vehicle flow over pedestrian safety and have inadequate sight lines and insufficient buffer zones around crosswalks. Still, former Police Chief Hoyle in North Carolina said drivers should be held accountable for injuring or killing crossing guards. He suggests raising speeding tickets in school zones to $1,000 and implementing license plate recognition systems to track down reckless drivers. “The penalties should be much higher, making drivers think twice about speeding through a school zone,” Hoyle said. VanFleet, the Simi Valley Police Department detective in California, said greater police presence in school zones would likely be more effective than fines. “It’s not so much the cost of the infraction it would be that would cause a deterrence,” he said. “It would be having more officers out there doing more enforcement. Not enough is being done Among the incidents where AP and Cox Media Group could determine an outcome, around a quarter resulted in criminal charges. About 40% of those criminal charges occurred when the driver fled the scene. Last year in Uvalde, Texas, elementary school crossing guard George Juarez was hospitalized after a pickup truck hit him and the driver fled the scene. The driver hit the crossing guard after making an illegal left turn as Juarez attempted to redirect the truck that struck him. The driver was charged with driving while intoxicated with an open container, and failure to stop and render aid.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More The driver that hit and killed Steven Winn, a 67-year-old crossing guard in Layton, Utah, just after he helped a group of elementary students cross to school, was also charged with an even more serious offense — negligent homicide. Families who lose loved ones in fatal traffic accidents say the unexpected financial burden can be staggering, since many guards are retirees who work part-time and don’t have benefits. Dozens of current and former guards or their families have set up GoFundMe pages to help cover medical and funeral costs. Those who survive hits can endure a long, painful recovery as well as mounting medical expenses. Ron Ferguson was hit by a truck in 2020 while directing traffic in front of a local high school in Texarkana, Texas. The collision left him with a cracked skull, missing teeth and lingering damage to his left ear. Ferguson spent two weeks sedated while recovering. He couldn’t breathe on his own or get out of bed, and needed nearly a month of grueling rehabilitation. Today, he said, he has mostly recovered, but some scars from the accident remain and he still has trouble with his memory. “There are times I could see people now that I cannot remember their names,” he said.” But I can see the face. And then gradually I’ll start remembering.” Crossing guards say they aren’t just waiting for officials to act to protect them. Many of them have organized on social platforms like TikTok through series like “Crossing Guard Chronicles,” set up by former Atlanta crossing guard Shante Joseph to educate the public about the dangers guards face. Others have joined Facebook groups like the National Association of School Crossing Guards, a platform that allows guards to share experiences and advocate for reform. They are also pushing their employers to provide items they think will make the job safer, such as body cameras, which some have already bought with their own money. The guards said they would also like to see increased police supervision in school zones and license plate recognition systems to help police spot bad drivers. Ultimately, they say they would like to see drivers treat crossing guard safety as seriously as the safety of the children they protect. Still, despite the daily dangers they face, many school crossing guards say they continue to enjoy what they see as an important and much-needed function.

country’s white minority group of Dutch descent. The Trump administration on Thursday announced a ceiling of 7,500 refugees to be admitted to the United States, a sharp decrease from the previous 125,000 spots and said Afrikaners would be given preference over other groups. U.S. President Donald Trump has claimed that there is a “genocide” against Afrikaners in South Africa and that they are facing persecution and discrimination because of the country’s redress policies and the levels of crime in the country. It’s one of the contentious issues that has seen diplomatic relations between South Africa and U.S. hit an all-time low , with Trump suspending all financial aid to South Africa and setting one of the highest tariffs for the country’s exports to the U.S. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); The South African government’s international relations department said Friday that the latest move was concerning as it “still appears to rest on a premise that is factually inaccurate.” “The claim of a ‘white genocide’ in South Africa is widely discredited and unsupported by reliable evidence,” spokesman Chrispin Phiri said.

The U.S. notice, which signifies a huge policy shift toward refugees, mentioned only Afrikaners as a specific group and said the admission of the 7,500 refugees during the 2026 budget year “justified by humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest.” Trump’s asylum offer for Afrikaners has sparked divisive debate in South Africa, but has been largely rejected even by many in the Afrikaner community. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); This week, a group of prominent Afrikaners including politicians, activists, writers and businesspeople penned an open letter rejecting the notion that Afrikaners needed to emigrate from South Africa. “The idea that white South Africans deserve special asylum status because of their race undermines the very principles of the refugee program. Vulnerability — not race — should guide humanitarian policy,” they wrote in the widely publicized letter. However, some Afrikaner groups continue to be very critical of the South African government’s handling of crime and redress policies even though they reject the “white genocide” claim. An Afrikaner lobbyist group, Afriforum, on Thursday said that it doesn’t call the murder of white farmers a genocide, but raised concerns about white people’s safety in South Africa. “This does not mean AfriForum rejects or scoffs at Trump’s refugee status offer — there will be Afrikaners that apply and they should have the option, especially those who have been victims of horrific farm attacks or the South African government’s many racially discriminatory policies,” AfriForum spokesman Ernst van Zyl said. While it’s unclear how many white South Africans have applied for refugee status in the U.S., a group of 59 white South Africans were granted asylum and were received with much fanfare in May."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/chicago-ice-immigration-broadview-lawsuit-4d9b14a2ed8e28d7a4b75e42bdd7ca8a","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"12:38:35+00:00","title":"Appeals Court Blocks Judge’s Request for Border Patrol Updates; Civil Rights Groups Slam ICE Conditions at Chicago Facility","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"An appeals court in Chicago blocked a federal judge, Sara Ellis, from requiring daily updates from a Border Patrol official, Greg Bovino, over concerns that the order violated the separation of powers by making the judge an inquisitor.

the Trump administration Friday and stopped a judge from trying to get daily updates from a Border Patrol official about the government’s immigration crackdown in the Chicago area. The court said the order from U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis put her “in position of an inquisitor rather than that of a neutral adjudicator” and would have turned her into a supervisor of Greg Bovino, a violation of the separation of powers. Ellis, concerned about allegations of excessive force and the use of tear gas against protesters, wanted daily updates from Bovino, starting Wednesday. But the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals intervened that day and suspended the order before further freezing it Friday. Meanwhile, Illinois advocates in a different case Friday sued federal authorities for what they described as “inhumane” conditions at a Chicago-area immigration facility . freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Attorneys with the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois and the MacArthur Justice Center say U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have denied people being held at the Broadview facility private calls with attorneys and have blocked members of Congress, faith leaders and journalists from entering the building , creating a “black box” they say has allowed authorities to act “with impunity.” Related Stories Illinois lawmakers approve ban on immigration arrests near courthouses 2 MIN READ Down but not out, the Ravens eye a second-half resurgence after Lamar Jackson’s return 3 MIN READ The Latest: Trump administration must fund SNAP payments during the shutdown, judges rule 14 MIN READ Agents have also allegedly coerced people held at the processing center to sign paperwork they don’t understand, leading them to unknowingly relinquish their rights and face deportation , according to the lawsuit.

She said people are held only briefly before being transferred to detention facilities. “Any claims there are subprime conditions at the Broadview ICE facility are false. All detainees are provided with 3 meals a day, water, and have access to phones to communicate with their family members and lawyers,” the statement said. “No one is denied access to proper medical care.

Several people said they were detained at the processing center for durations ranging from a couple days to three weeks. Advocates have for months raised concerns about conditions at the facility, which has drawn scrutiny from members of Congress, political candidates and activist groups. Lawyers and relatives of people held there have called it a de facto detention center, saying up to 200 people have been held at a time without access to legal counsel. The Broadview center has also drawn demonstrations, which have led to the arrests of numerous protesters.

(AP) — Emergency crews responded Friday to an explosion at an oil refinery in New Mexico as thick smoke emerged from the plant and drifted across parts of the city of Artesia before crews were able to extinguish the flames. Navajo Refinery operator HF Sinclair said that the fire had been extinguished and that three people were transported off-site for medical attention. No other injuries were reported. Air monitoring on the perimeter of the refinery and in a nearby community showed no risk to public safety, said Corinn Smith, a spokesperson of HF Sinclair. It was unclear whether refinery production was affected. Artesia Police Commander Pete Quiñones said that police and other first responders scrambled to the site before the fire was contained. Authorities said the smoke had dissipated by Friday afternoon and roads were reopened. The New Mexico Environment Department said it was sending a team to Artesia to assess conditions and monitor air quality. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); The refinery sits adjacent to Artesia’s main intersection, which serves as an artery from the Permian Basin in the southeastern corner of the state to the rest of New Mexico. The company’s website notes that the facility has a crude oil capacity of 100,000 barrels per day, making it the largest in New Mexico, but it wasn’t immediately clear how full the plant was at the time of the incident. The plant serves markets in the southwestern United States by processing oil acquired from the basin, which is one of the busiest in the world. It operates alongside a refining facility in Lovington, about 65 miles (105 km) away.

(AP) — A man on death row in South Carolina who taunted investigators with messages written with a victim’s blood chose Friday to die by firing squad.

Investigators said he burned Willard “TJ” Tietjen’s eyes with cigarettes after shooting him and painting “catch me if u can” on the wall with the victim’s blood.

Attorneys for the second and most recent man shot to death said the shooters nearly missed Mikal Mahdi’s heart. They suggested Mahdi was in agonizing pain for three or four times longer than experts say he would have been if his heart had been hit directly. They released photos from the autopsy and questioned why there only appeared to be two bullet entrance wounds when three people fired.

Since 1977, only three other prisoners in the U.S. have been executed by firing squad. All were in Utah, most recently Ronnie Lee Gardner in 2010. Bryant’s execution will be the seventh in South Carolina since executions restarted in September 2024. All the others have chosen execution by lethal injection. The state also has an electric chair. Investigators say Bryant terrorized Sumter County in 2004 Bryant admitted to killing Willard “TJ” Tietjen after stopping by his secluded home in rural Sumter County and saying he had car trouble. Tietjen was shot several times. Candles were lit around his body. Someone took a potholder made by his daughter when she was child, dipped the corner in blood and wrote “victem 4 in 2 weeks. catch me if u can” on the wall, authorities said. Tietjen’s daughter called him several times, getting more worried when he didn’t answer. On the sixth call, she testified a strange voice answered and said he had killed Tietjen. Prosecutors said Bryant also killed two men — one before and one after Tietjen. He gave the men rides and when they got out to urinate on the side of lonely, rural roads he shot them in the back. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Bryant’s lawyers said he was troubled in the months before the killing, begging a probation agent and his aunt to get him help because he couldn’t stop thinking about being sexually abused by four male relatives when he was a child. Bryant tried to help himself through the pain by using meth and smoking joints he sprayed with bug killer, his defense attorneys said. A total of 41 men have died by court-ordered execution in the U.S. this year, and at least 18 more are scheduled to be put to death during the remainder of 2025 and next year. Bryant’s death will be the 50th execution in South Carolina since the death penalty was reinstated 40 years ago."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/filibuster-government-shutdown-trump-4febb133c572caac8ba11b1e4ec7fc76","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"13:45:51+00:00","title":"Trump Pushes to End Filibuster Amid Government Shutdown, Sparking GOP Resistance","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has called on the Senate to eliminate the filibuster, urging a 'nuclear option' to end the 31-day government shutdown, a move rejected by Republican leaders who view the rule as essential to Senate integrity.

Trump pushed his Republican Party to get rid of the Senate rule that requires 60 votes to overcome objections and gives the minority Democrats a check on GOP power. In the chamber that’s currently split, 53-47, Democrats have had enough votes to keep the government closed while they demand an extension of health care subsidies. Neither party has seriously wanted to nuke the rule. “THE CHOICE IS CLEAR — INITIATE THE ‘NUCLEAR OPTION,’ GET RID OF THE FILIBUSTER,” Trump said in a late night social media post Thursday. Trump’s sudden decision to assert himself into the shutdown now in its 31st day — with his highly charged demand to end the filibuster — is certain to set the Senate on edge.

Government shutdown The AP has journalists around the country covering the shutdown of the federal government. What questions do you have for them? The leader’s “position on the importance of the legislative filibuster is unchanged,” Thune spokesman Ryan Wrasse said Friday. A spokeswoman for Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, the No. 2 Republican, said his position opposing a filibuster change also remains unchanged. And former GOP leader Mitch McConnell, who firmly opposed Trump’s filibuster pleas in his first term, remains in the Senate. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); House Speaker Mike Johnson also defended the filibuster Friday, while conceding “it’s not my call,” from his chamber across the Capitol. “The safeguard in the Senate has always been the filibuster,” Johnson said, adding that Trump’s comments are “the president’s anger at the situation.” Broad GOP support for filibuster Even if Thune wanted to change the filibuster, he would not currently have the votes to do so in the divided Senate. “The filibuster forces us to find common ground in the Senate,” Republican Sen. John Curtis of Utah posted on X Friday morning, responding to Trump’s comments and echoing the sentiments of many of his Senate Republican colleagues. “Power changes hands, but principles shouldn’t. I’m a firm no on eliminating it.” Debate has swirled around the legislative filibuster for years. Many Democrats pushed to eliminate it when they had full power in Washington, as the Republicans do now, four years ago. But ultimately, enough Democratic senators opposed the move, predicting such an action would come back to haunt them. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Little progress on shutdown Trump’s demand comes as he has declined to engage with Democratic leaders on ways to end the shutdown, on track to become the longest in history . He said in his post that he gave a “great deal” of thought to his choice on his flight home from Asia and that one question that kept coming up during his trip was why “powerful Republicans allow” the Democrats to shut down parts of the government. But later Friday, he did not mention the filibuster again as he spoke to reporters departing Washington and arriving in Florida for a weekend at his Mar-a-Lago home. While quiet talks are underway, particularly among bipartisan senators, Trump has not been seriously involved. Democrats refuse to vote to reopen the government until Republicans negotiate an extension to the health care subsidies. The Republicans say they won’t negotiate until the government is reopened. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said on CNN that Trump needs to start negotiating with Democrats, arguing the president has spent more time with global leaders than dealing with the shutdown back home. From coast to coast, fallout from the dysfunction of the shuttered federal government is hitting home. SNAP food aid is scheduled to shut off . Flights are being delayed . Workers are going without paychecks. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); And Americans are getting a first glimpse of the skyrocketing health care insurance costs that are at the center of the stalemate. “People are stressing,” said Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, as food options in her state grow scarce. “We are well past time to have this behind us.” Money for military, but not food aid The White House has moved money around to ensure the military is paid, but refuses to tap funds for food aid. In fact, Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” signed into law this summer, delivered the most substantial cut ever to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program , known as SNAP, projected to result in some 2.4 million people off the program. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said Friday the agency cannot release contingency funds to keep SNAP running, but two judges ruled nearly simultaneously Friday that the administration must continue to fund the food aid program. How quickly that might happen remains to be seen, as further consultation with the courts is expected on Monday. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Trump, in a social media post, said administration lawyers will be asking the courts “to clarify how we can legally fund SNAP as soon as possible.” “If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding,” Trump said. “We are holding food over the heads of poor people so that we can take away their health care,” said Rev. Ryan Stoess during a prayer with religious leaders earlier this week at the U.S. Capitol. “God help us,” he said, “when the cruelty is the point.” Deadlines shift to next week The House remains closed under Johnson with no plans to resume the session, and senators left for the weekend and are due back Monday. The next inflection point comes after Tuesday’s off-year elections — the New York City mayor’s race , as well as elections in Virginia and New Jersey that will determine those states’ governors. Many expect that once those winners and losers are declared, and the Democrats and Republicans assess their political standing with the voters, they might be ready to hunker down for a deal. If the shutdown continues into next week, it could surpass the 35-day lapse that ended in 2019, during Trump’s first term, over his demands to build the U.S.-Mexico border wall. ___ Associated Press writers Matt Brown and Josh Boak in Tokyo contributed to this report."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/19/pakistan-launches-its-first-hyperspectral-satellite","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"10:16:08+00:00","title":"Pakistan launches its first hyperspectral satellite","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pakistan has successfully launched its first hyperspectral satellite, H1, from China’s Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre, marking a major advancement in its space programme.

Pregnant women are advised to consult a doctor before taking the medication.\n\nThe World Health Organization reiterated the point in September, noting that “no consistent association has been established” between the medication and autism, despite “extensive research”.\n\nBut claims to the contrary have already prompted efforts to limit the availability of Tylenol, a popular brand of acetaminophen, a fever- and pain-reducing medication.\n\nOn Tuesday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton launched a lawsuit accusing Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue, the companies behind the over-the-counter pain reliever, of deceptive practices.\n\nIn doing so, he reiterated misinformation shared by President Donald Trump and government officials like Kennedy.\n\n“By holding Big Pharma accountable for poisoning our people, we will help Make America Healthy Again,” Paxton said in a statement, giving a nod to Kennedy’s MAHA slogan.\n\nThe suit alleges that Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue violated Texas consumer protection laws by having “deceptively marketed Tylenol as the only safe painkiller for pregnant women”.\n\nIt was the latest instance of scientific misinformation being perpetuated by top officials. Both Trump and Kennedy have repeatedly spread scientific misinformation throughout their political careers.\n\nTrump linked autism and the painkiller during a news conference in September, without providing reputable scientific findings to back the claim.\n\n“[Using] acetaminophen – is that OK? – which is basically, commonly known as Tylenol, during pregnancy can be associated with a very increased risk of autism,” Trump said on September 22. “So taking Tylenol is not good. I’ll say it. It’s not good.”\n\nKennedy has offered his own sweeping statements about Tylenol and its alleged risks, despite having no professional medical background.\n\n“Anyone who takes this stuff during pregnancy, unless they have to, is irresponsible,” he said in a cabinet meeting on October 9.\n\nKennedy also mischaracterised studies on male circumcision earlier this month. He  falsely  said the studies showed an increase in autism among children who were “circumcised early”.\n\n“It’s highly likely because they’re given Tylenol,” he added.\n\nKenvue stressed in a statement on Tuesday that acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women, noting that high fevers and pain are potential risks to pregnancies if left untreated.\n\n“We stand firmly with the global medical community that acknowledges the safety of acetaminophen and believe we will continue to be successful in litigation as these claims lack legal merit and scientific support,” Kenvue said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/25/tropical-storm-melissa-soon-a-hurricane-brings-death-floods-to-caribbean","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"07:03:42+00:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa rapidly intensifies, threatening major Caribbean flooding","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, which intensified from a tropical storm to a major hurricane with sustained winds of 120 km/h, is now threatening several Caribbean nations including Jamaica, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic.

Hurricane Melissa rapidly intensifies, threatening major Caribbean flooding\n\nTropical Storm Melissa has strengthened into a  hurricane , the United States-based National Hurricane Center (NHC) says, as people across several Caribbean countries braced for heavy rainfall and dangerous flooding.\n\nHurricane Melissa was located about 380km (235 miles) southwest of the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince, packing maximum sustained winds of 120 kilometres (75 miles) per hour, the NHC said in its latest advisory on Saturday afternoon.\n\nA hurricane warning was in place for Jamaica as the NHC said life-threatening and catastrophic flash flooding and landslides were expected in portions of southern Hispaniola island – shared by Haiti and the Dominican Republic – and Jamaica into early next week.\n\nThe centre of Melissa was expected to move near or over Jamaica during the weekend and early next week, the NHC said, adding that it could be near or over eastern Cuba by the middle of next week.\n\nA hurricane watch was also in effect for the southwestern peninsula of Haiti, from Port-au-Prince to the border with the Dominican Republic, according to the NHC advisory.\n\nAlready, three people have died in Haiti, including two killed in a landslide in the capital Port-au-Prince and another struck by a falling tree in Marigot, officials said.\n\nA fourth person was killed in the Dominican Republic, where another remains missing.\n\nJamaica’s Meteorological Service principal director Evan Thompson told The Gleaner that residents should brace for a “double effect” as the hurricane’s eye passes over the island, with the strongest winds hitting from opposite directions on either side of the centre.\n\nThe forecast marks a significant shift from earlier in the week, when landfall was considered only a “slim chance”.\n\nAuthorities have readied more than 650 emergency shelters across Jamaica and said airports will close once a hurricane warning is declared. Prime Minister Andrew Holness warned the public to treat the approaching storm as a serious threat. “Take all measures to protect yourself,” he said.\n\nThe storm has already wrought havoc in the Dominican Republic, where nearly 200 homes have been damaged and more than half a million people left without water.\n\nIn the Los Rios neighbourhood of the capital, Santo Domingo, families were forced to flee rising floodwaters on Thursday evening after surrounding streams burst their banks, according to the Listin Diario daily newspaper.\n\nMore than two dozen Dominican communities remain cut off by floodwaters, prompting mandatory evacuations and nationwide school closures.\n\nThe situation is particularly dire for thousands displaced by gang violence in Port-au-Prince, now living in makeshift shelters with scant protection.\n\n“I’m dealing with two storms: the gangs and the weather,” Nephtali Johnson Pierre told The Associated Press news agency.\n\nMelissa is also forecast to strike eastern Cuba as a major hurricane on Wednesday."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/28/record-rains-drive-flooding-in-vietnam-submerging-ancient-city","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"14:12:41+00:00","title":"Record rains drive flooding in Vietnam, submerging ancient city","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In October 2025, Vietnam experienced record-breaking rainfall, with over 1,000 millimetres of rain falling in just 24 hours in central regions, especially in the historic cities of Hue and Hoi An.

2025-10-27T07:34:31+00:00\n\nTitle: Could COVID-19 mRNA vaccines also fight cancer?\n\nThe mass-produced COVID-19 vaccines built using the mRNA model – which were rapidly manufactured during the global pandemic – could also help the immune system recognise and attack cancer tumours, new studies have shown.\n\nStudies in mice and an analysis of medical records of cancer patients – who received mRNA shots for COVID-19 before starting immunotherapy for cancer treatment – revealed a startling pattern: the vaccinated patients lived significantly longer than those who had not received the shots.\n\nA team of researchers from the University of Florida and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center presented the results this week at the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress in Berlin and  published  in the peer-reviewed journal, Nature.\n\nThe results, they say, reveal that the mRNA vaccines do not just prevent infection – they also “wake up” and prompt the body’s immune system to fight tumours.\n\nThe discovery has come at a time when US President Donald Trump’s administration has  slashed funding  for mRNA research.\n\nSo, why is this being touted as groundbreaking? What does it mean for cancer patients? And how did the COVID-19 pandemic become the medium for this unlikely discovery?\n\nUnlike traditional vaccines, which used weakened or inactive parts of a virus to trigger the immune system to build a defence, mRNA vaccines deliver a small strand of genetic code known as “messenger RNA” directly into the body’s cells.\n\nThe cell reads this blueprint as an instruction to manufacture a spike protein which mimics that of the virus, and display it on its surface, effectively waving a red flag that alerts the immune system to build a defence.\n\nThe body then creates antibodies and memory cells trained to recognise and attack that protein spike if it ever appears again.\n\nThis is an area of research which has been going on for some years, most notably by paediatric oncologist Elias Sayour, the Stop Children’s Cancer/Bonnie R Freeman Professor for Pediatric Oncology Research at the University of Florida, in the United States.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic presented a particular opportunity to study the implications of mRNA for cancer treatment as the world moved en masse to vaccinate the population.\n\nWhen Sayour’s former student, oncologist Adam Grippin, examined clinical data of more than 1,000 patients treated between August 2019 and August 2023 at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, he found a striking pattern.\n\nPeople who had received a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine within 100 days of starting immunotherapy lived significantly longer than those who received the same medical treatment but did not have the vaccine.\n\nFor patients with advanced lung cancer, the median survival rate nearly doubled if they had the vaccine, rising from 20.6 months to 37.3.\n\nMore strikingly, the survival improvements were most pronounced in patients with immunologically “cold” tumours – meaning that the mRNA vaccine appeared to “wake up” the immune system in patients with these harder-to-treat cancers – turning “cold” tumours into ones the immune system could more easily recognise and attack.\n\nThe researchers noted that their findings were consistent across varying factors, such as different vaccine manufacturers, doses and time of vaccination.\n\nThe researchers also compared the survival rates in a smaller group of patients receiving immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma, the most advanced stage of a type of skin cancer. In the study, 43 patients had an mRNA COVID vaccine and 167 did not.\n\nPatients who did not receive the vaccine had a median survival of just more than two years. By contrast, those who were vaccinated before starting treatment had not yet reached their median survival point more than three years into follow-up, the research found.\n\nThe researchers discovered that mRNA vaccines work like an alarm for the body’s defence system.\n\nWhen the vaccine is given, it puts the immune system on alert, making it more likely to notice cancer cells that it might have ignored before. Once the immune system is activated, it begins to attack these cells.\n\nBut cancer cells fight back. They produce a protein called PD-L1, which works as a shield that “hides” them from the immune system. However, there are drugs known as immune checkpoint inhibitors that can block this shield.\n\nWhen both the vaccine and these drugs are used, it creates the ideal situation – the immune system is active and alert, and the cancer’s defences are down, Grippin explained.\n\nWhile the researchers said that they do not yet fully understand the mechanisms, the findings suggest that mRNA vaccines can be used to re-programme immune responses to cancer.\n\nThese findings are preliminary. If, however, the study is validated in clinical trials, it could have huge implications for the treatment of cancer.\n\n“These vaccines produce powerful anti-tumour immune responses that are associated with massive improvements in survival for patients with cancer,” Grippin said.\n\n“The implications are extraordinary – this could revolutionise the entire field of oncologic care,” said Sayour. “We could design an even better nonspecific vaccine to mobilise and reset the immune response, in a way that could essentially be a universal, off-the-shelf cancer vaccine for all cancer patients.”\n\nGrippen, who co-led the study with Steven Lin, professor of radiation oncology, said his team is launching a Phase 3 clinical trial to confirm the initial results and investigate whether COVID mRNA vaccines should be made part of the standard of care for patients.\n\nIn the mouse experiments, researchers found that injecting an mRNA COVID vaccine directly into a tumour made dendritic cells – a type of white blood cell – more alert.\n\nOnce the dendritic cells picked up on presence of the tumour, they sent out signals that attracted T cells to come and attack it. In some mice, this helped slow the growth of the cancer.\n\nBut there’s a big catch. Not everyone naturally has T cells that are capable of killing cancer cells. For some people, their immune system can tell that a tumour is dangerous, but their specific T cells do not know how to destroy it.\n\nThat’s one reason why immunotherapies – treatments that boost the immune system to fight cancer – work for some patients but not for others.\n\nHaving an mRNA COVID vaccine will not make your body produce new tumour-fighting T cells. What it might do, based on this early research, is make dendritic cells more likely to notice a tumour and effectively deploy the T cells."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/27/ngos-note-28-new-carbon-bomb-projects-since-2021","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-27","timeOfPublication":"12:50:39Z","title":"NGOs note 28 new ‘carbon bomb’ projects since 2021","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A report by four environmental nonprofits—Lingo, Data for Good, Reclaim Finance, and Eclaircies—reveals that 28 new 'carbon bomb' fossil fuel projects have been launched globally between 2021 and 2024.

“carbon bomb” projects have launched across the globe over the past five years, according to a report issued by NGOs.\n\nDespite global efforts to phase out the use of fossil fuels, known to have  catastrophic climate effects , the report, published on Monday by a quartet of environmental nonprofits, details that dozens of new fossil fuel extraction projects that will pump out enormous emissions have been started since 2021.\n\nCarbon bombs were defined in a 2022 research article as oil, gas or coal facilities capable of generating more than a billion tonnes of CO2 over their lifetime.\n\nAt that time, the NGOs Lingo, Data for Good, Reclaim Finance, and Eclaircies counted 425 such projects worldwide.\n\nThe report said some 365 projects are still producing more than one billion tonnes each, with the fall from the 2021 total due to operations that have either cut their output or been re-evaluated.\n\nThat is despite the International Energy Agency having said in 2021 that launching new oil and gas projects was incompatible with reaching climate targets set out in the Paris Agreement.\n\nThe landmark agreement reached in 2015 included the aim of keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) compared with the pre-industrial era.\n\nTwo years later, at COP28, countries around the world agreed to begin a phase-out of fossil fuels.\n\nDespite that, between 2021 and 2024, the world’s 65 largest banks financed more than $1.6 trillion to the companies involved in the projects pinpointed in the report.\n\nBarclays Bank is the most involved in supporting companies behind carbon bombs, providing $33.7bn to 62 companies, including Eni, ExxonMobil and TotalEnergies.\n\n“Major global banks are exacerbating climate change and future emissions by continuing to give carte blanche to these fossil fuel companies that are destroying the planet,” said Louis-Maxence Delaporte, energy research manager at Reclaim Finance, one of

2025-10-21T02:23:04+00:00\n\nTitle: What caused Amazon’s AWS outage, and why did so many major apps go offline?\n\nA  major outage  at the Amazon Web Services (AWS) on Monday disrupted a large portion of the internet, taking down apps, websites and online tools used by millions of people around the world, before services were eventually restored.\n\nThe hours-long  breakdown  of the cloud system that supports a portion of the internet revealed just how much of modern-life depends on the infrastructure – from banking apps and airlines to smart home devices and gaming platforms.\n\nHere is what we know:\n\nAt about 07:11 GMT, Amazon’s cloud service experienced a major outage, meaning some of its systems stopped working, which disrupted many popular apps and websites, including banks, gaming platforms and entertainment services.\n\nThe problem started in one of AWS’s main data centres in Virginia, its oldest and biggest site, after a technical update to the API – a connection between different computer programmes – of DynamoDB, a key cloud database service that stores user information and other important data for many online platforms.\n\nThe root cause appears to have been an error in the update that affected the Domain Name System (DNS), which helps apps find the correct server addresses. A DNS works like the internet’s phone book, turning website names into the numeric IP addresses that computers use to connect to servers.\n\nBecause of the DNS issue, apps could not find the IP address for DynamoDB’s API and were unable to connect.\n\nAs DynamoDB went down, other AWS services also began to fail. In total, 113 services were affected by the outage. By 10:11 GMT, Amazon said that all AWS returned to normal operations, but there was a backlog “of messages that they will finish processing over the next few hours”.\n\nAt the time of publication, Downdetector, a website that tracks internet outages based on user reports, was still showing problems with platforms such as OpenAI, ESPN and Apple Music.\n\nUpdated look at the total impact of the AWS Outage up to this point! https://t.co/Bgpm1fFGtf   pic.twitter.com/TAAxjagNl6\n\n— Downdetector (@downdetector)  October 20, 2025\n\nA cloud is a way of storing and using data or programmes over the internet instead of on your computer or other physical storage devices.\n\nWhen people say something is “in the cloud”, it means the files, apps or systems are running on powerful computers (called servers) in data centres owned by companies like Amazon (AWS), Google or Microsoft, not on your personal device.\n\nIn this case, AWS allows companies to rent computing power and storage. It supplies the technology that runs websites, apps and many online services behind the scenes.\n\nOne of AWS’s core services is DynamoDB, a database that stores important information for companies, such as customer records. On Monday, Amazon reported that customers were unable to access their DynamoDB data.\n\nAWS is the biggest cloud service provider in the world.\n\nCloud outages are not rare, but they have become more noticeable as more companies rely on these services every day.\n\n“The fallout impacted people across a number of different spheres,” Joshua Mahony, the chief market analyst at Scope Markets, told Al Jazeera. [But] of course this kind of comes with the territory with tech companies; the key is they can resolve it quickly, and it doesn’t cost them a lot of money.”\n\nHe said Amazon would likely weather the storm from the incident.\n\n“You’re looking at something that is relatively contained,” he said. “Amazon Web Services has cornered 30 percent of the market alone. Their users are not going to suddenly jump ship. Their businesses are deeply ingrained.”\n\nThe outage affected dozens of websites, including Snapchat, Pinterest and Apple TV, according to Downdetector.\n\nOther communication apps were also affected including: WhatsApp, Signal, Zoom and Slack; gaming services such as Roblox, Fortnite and Xbox; and places like Starbucks. Etsy also experienced issues.\n\nIn the United States, people were having issues with financial apps too, including Venmo.\n\nSome users said their Ring doorbells and Alexa speakers stopped working, while others could not access the Amazon website or download books on their Kindles.\n\nThe language app Duolingo and creative tool Canva were among those reporting errors on their websites, and several media organisations were hit, including the Associated Press news agency, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal.\n\nBanks, the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, and AI firm Perplexity also reported issues, along with US airlines Delta and United.\n\nWhen AWS had its outage, it was not just Amazon’s tools that were affected.

Trump has announced that Nigeria will be placed on a watchlist for religious freedom, based on  vague claims  that Christians in the country are being “slaughtered” by Muslims.\n\nIn a social media  post  on Friday, Trump explained that the African nation would be added to a Department of State list of “Countries of Particular Concern”.\n\n“Christianity is facing an existential threat in Nigeria,” Trump wrote. “Thousands of Christians are being killed. Radical Islamists are responsible for this mass slaughter. I am hereby making Nigeria a ‘COUNTRY OF PARTICULAR CONCERN’.”\n\nThe Nigerian government has denied such allegations in the past. But critics warn that designating Nigeria a “country of particular concern” could pave the way for future sanctions.\n\nTrump also appears to have bypassed the normal procedure for such matters.\n\nThe 1998 International Religious Freedom Act created the category of “country of particular concern” in order to help monitor religious persecution and advocate for its end.\n\nBut that label is usually assigned at the recommendation of the US Commission on International Religious Freedom – a bipartisan group established by Congress – and specialists in the State Department.\n\nIn Friday’s post, Trump explained that he had asked the House Appropriations Committee and two congressmen, Representatives Riley Moore and Tom Cole, to “immediately look into this matter”. Both are Republican.\n\nTrump’s claims appear to mirror language pushed by right-wing lawmakers, which frames fractious and sometimes violent disputes in  Nigeria  as a case of radical Islamists attacking Christians.\n\nExperts, however, have called that framing largely inaccurate, explaining that strife in the country is not explained simply by religious differences.\n\nNigeria is divided between a majority-Muslim north and a largely Christian south. The country has struggled with violent attacks from the group Boko Haram, which has created turmoil and  displacement  for more than a decade.\n\nDisputes over resources such as water have also exacerbated tensions and sometimes led to  violent clashes  between largely Christian farmers and largely Muslim shepherds. Nigeria has denied, however, that such clashes are primarily motivated by religious affiliation.\n\nStill, Representative Moore echoed Trump’s assessment in a statement after Friday’s announcement.\n\n“I have been calling for this designation since my first floor speech in April, where I highlighted the plight of Christians in Muslim majority countries,” Moore  said .\n\nHe added that he planned to “ensure that Nigeria receives the international attention, pressure, and accountability it urgently needs”.\n\nSenator Ted Cruz of Texas, another Republican, also applauded Trump’s decision. “I am deeply gratified to President Trump for making this determination,” he said in a news release. “I have fought for years to counter the slaughter and persecution of Christians in Nigeria.”\n\nSince returning to office for a second term in January, Trump has sought to bolster his base among the Christian right in the US.\n\nAt a prayer breakfast in February, he  announced  his administration was establishing a task force to root out anti-Christian bias in the federal government.\n\nLater, in July, his administration  issued a memo  allowing federal employees to evangelise in their workplaces.\n\nWhile Trump denounced alleged anti-Christian violence in Friday’s post, his administration has also been recently criticised for its policy towards refugees: people fleeing persecution or violence in their homelands.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump announced the  lowest-ever cap  on refugee admissions in the US, limiting entry to just 7,500 people for all of fiscal year 2026.\n\nIn a notice posted to the Federal Register’s website, he explained that most of those spots would “primarily be allocated among Afrikaners from South Africa” and “other victims of illegal or unjust discrimination”.\n\nCritics were quick to point out that refugee status is awarded for fear of systematic persecution, not discrimination.\n\nStill, Trump has continued to ratchet up diplomatic tensions with South Africa, falsely claiming that white Afrikaners are subjected to a “genocide”, an allegation frequently pushed by figures on the far right."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/30/jamaica-haiti-and-cuba-take-stock-after-hurricane-melissa-destruction","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"07:33:17+00:00","title":"Jamaica, Haiti and Cuba take stock after Hurricane Melissa destruction","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, a powerful Category 5 storm, devastated Jamaica, Haiti, and Cuba in early October 2025, causing at least 34 deaths and widespread destruction.

as dozens of deaths are reported in Jamaica, Cuba and Haiti.\n\nThe hurricane – at Category 5, the  strongest  on record to hit Jamaica directly – ripped across the Caribbean islands on Tuesday and Wednesday, killing at least 25 people in Haiti, eight in Jamaica and one in the Dominican Republic.\n\nThe United States-based National Hurricane Center said early on Thursday that Melissa’s eye was expected to move away from the southeastern and central Bahamas before passing west of Bermuda.\n\nAlthough the storm was downgraded to Category 1, the lowest strength on the Saffir-Simpson scale, it was still packing winds of 155km/h (100mph) with even higher gusts, the NHC reported.\n\nIn Haiti, where roughly 12,000 people remained in emergency shelters, families grappled with the rising death toll. Twenty people were reported dead in the southern coastal town of Petit-Goave alone, where a river burst its banks and collapsed dozens of homes.\n\nResident Steven Guadard told The Associated Press news agency that Melissa killed his entire family: “I had four children at home: a one-month-old baby, a seven-year-old, an eight-year-old and another who was about to turn four.”\n\nAlthough no deaths were tallied in Cuba, more than 735,000 evacuated residents slowly returned home as the military helped to rescue people in isolated communities.\n\nRecovery efforts were rolling out across Jamaica’s western parishes, where Melissa ripped roofs from homes, felled trees, flooded hospitals, and cut off electricity and water.\n\nYet even as Prime Minister Andrew Holness pledged a “credible and strong” recovery strategy, residents pleaded for help.\n\nSylvester Guthrie, a resident of the hard-hit parish of St Elizabeth, was left with only his bicycle.\n\n“I don’t have a house now,” Guthrie told the AP.

sentences lawyer and Saied critic to five years in prison\n\nA Tunisian court has sentenced Ahmed Souab, a lawyer and fierce critic of President Kais Saied, to five years in prison, his lawyer said, in a case that rights groups say marks a deepening crackdown on dissent in the North African country.\n\nDefence lawyer Yosr Hamid said on Friday that her client had received an additional three-year sentence of “administrative supervision” after he was  arrested in April  following criticism of the legal process in a trial of prominent figures, including opposition leaders.\n\nSouab’s trial on “anti-terror” charges lasted just seven minutes, according to Hamid, who voiced fears it sets a troubling legal precedent.\n\nHundreds of opposition figures, lawyers, journalists, trade unionists and humanitarian workers in Tunisia are being prosecuted for “conspiracy” or in connection with a “fake news” decree by authorities.\n\nThat legislation, Decree Law 54, has been criticised by rights activists, who are concerned over its broad interpretation by some courts.\n\nSouab, 68, was not allowed to appear in court on Friday, declining to testify via videolink, according to Hamid. His legal team refused to enter a plea under the conditions.\n\nSouab faces around a dozen charges related to the presidential decree on false information.\n\n“The hearing lasted only seven minutes” before the judge retired to deliberate, Hamid told the AFP news agency on Friday.\n\nHe said there was a “lack of fundamental grounds for a fair trial” and that the decision to sentence after a one-day trial set “a precedent”.\n\nMongi Souab, the defendant’s brother, said authorities “prevented family members from entering” the court, criticising the brevity of the trial.\n\nSouab was arrested in April after criticising the trial process for about 40 prominent figures, including opposition leaders, in a case related to “conspiracy against state security”.\n\nAmong those targeted in that case are figures from what was once the biggest party, Ennahdha, such as the leader and former Speaker of Parliament  Rached Ghannouchi , former Prime Minister Hichem Mechichi, former Minister of Justice Noureddine Bhiri, and Said Ferjani, a member of the party’s political executive.\n\nSouab was one of the principal defence lawyers.\n\nAfter a trial involving just three hearings, without closing arguments or defence pleas, Souab accused authorities of putting “a knife to the throat of the judge who was to deliver the verdict”.\n\nAn anti-terrorism court interpreted the comment as a threat to the judges, and he was detained over it, but Souab’s lawyers said it was a reference to the huge political pressure on judges.\n\nHeavy prison sentences of up to 74 years were handed down to those accused in the “conspiracy” mega-trial. The appeal related to that trial is scheduled to take place on November 17.\n\nSeveral dozen people demonstrated outside the court on Friday, brandishing photos of Souab and chanting that the country was “under repression and tyranny”.\n\nSeveral Tunisian and foreign NGOs have decried a rollback of rights and freedoms since Saied seized full powers in 2021 in what critics have called a coup.\n\nSeparately on Friday, Tunisian authorities ordered the suspension of the Nawaat journalists’ group, which runs one of the country’s leading independent investigative media outlets, as part of a widening crackdown.\n\nThe one-month suspension follows similar actions against prominent civil society groups such as the Tunisian Forum for Economic and Social Rights and the Association of Democratic Women, both known for defending civil liberties.\n\nAuthorities cited financial audits linked to foreign funding as justification, but rights advocates said the real aim was to silence dissenting voices.\n\nThe National Union of Tunisian Journalists condemned the suspension as “a dangerous escalation in efforts to muzzle independent journalism under an administrative guise”.\n\nFounded in 2004, Nawaat carried out investigations on corruption and human rights abuses before and after the revolution. In a statement, it said it would not be “intimidated by the current political climate or campaigns of defamation”."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/27/jamaica-braces-as-hurricane-melissa-strengthens-offshore","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-27","timeOfPublication":"06:45:50+00:00","title":"Officials warn Hurricane Melissa could be ‘catastrophic’ for Jamaica","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, a Category 5 storm with sustained winds exceeding 250km/h, is approaching Jamaica, with its slow movement and heavy rainfall posing a catastrophic risk to coastal and low-lying communities.

as  Hurricane Melissa  continues to strengthen offshore, with heavy rains and tropical storm-strength winds already hitting parts of the island.\n\nThe hurricane, which has intensified to a Category 5 storm, was about 160km (100 miles) south of Jamaica on Monday and on course to hit the western flanks of the island early Tuesday. Moving at just 7km/h (4mph), the storm could cut a particularly punishing path, bringing landslides and storm surges as it crawls across the country, officials warned.\n\nStill, on Monday, Evan Thompson, the principal director of the Meteorological Service of Jamaica, said a slight chance remained that the storm could miss the island.\n\n“Of course, all of us are hoping for that and praying for that,” Thompson said. “But at the same time, we have to be practical. Right now, the projected path takes it to the southwestern part of Jamaica, impacting either eastern Westmoreland or extreme western Saint Elizabeth.”\n\nCurrently, the storm is projected to travel northeast across the island, exiting along the coast of Saint Anne Parish, Thompson said.\n\nCategory 5 is the highest on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, with sustained winds exceeding 250km/h (157mph). Up to about one metre (40 inches) of rainfall could hit parts of Jamaica as the storm passes directly over the island, threatening flash flooding and landslides.\n\n“I don’t want to encourage fear or worry, but I do expect you to become concerned about what is taking place,” Thompson said.\n\n“If you think that you are free from [the worst of the storm], think again, because the heavy rains will affect you, the strong winds reaching tropical storm force could still continue to affect you as we go through the day on Tuesday.”\n\nIn an earlier webcast, US National Hurricane Center (NHC) Deputy Director Jamie Rhome said the potential for extreme rain, coupled with the slow speed of the storm, could “create a catastrophic event” in Jamaica.\n\n“You need to just be wherever you’re going to be and be ready to ride this out for several days,” Rhome said.\n\nJamaica’s government ordered mandatory evacuations late on Sunday for Port Royal in Kingston; Portland Cottage and Rocky Point in Clarendon; Old Harbour Bay in Saint Catherine; and Taylor Land, Bull Bay, New Haven and Riverton City in Saint Andrew.\n\n“Many of these communities will not survive this flooding,” Desmond McKenzie, minister of local government, said at a news conference. “Kingston is low, extremely low … No community in Kingston is immune from flooding.\n\n“There is nothing more we can do as a government but to beg and beseech persons to heed the warning. And if it will help, I will go on my knees,” he said.\n\n“This is one bet you cannot win. You cannot bet against Melissa,” McKenzie warned, advising that people could go to more than 650 shelters that are open across the country.\n\nThe AFP news agency spoke with Winston Moxam as he hurried to prepare his home for the approaching storm.\n\n“I lose my roof, I lose a whole lot of things,” Maxim said, adding that he was particularly worried by warnings that the storm could be worse than 1988’s Hurricane Gilbert, which left more than 40 dead in Jamaica and killed hundreds more around the Caribbean and in Mexico.\n\nJamaica’s two main airports, the Norman Manley International Airport and Sangster International Airport in Montego Bay, as well as seaports, were closed.\n\nAfter passing over Jamaica, the storm is forecast to head north and cross over eastern Cuba on Tuesday night, while continuing to bring rains and heavy winds to Haiti and the Dominican Republic.\n\nMelissa has already been blamed for at least four deaths in Haiti and the Dominican Republic this week, as its outer bands brought heavy rains and landslides.\n\nThe Dominican Republic’s emergency operations centre has placed nine of 31 provinces on red alert due to a risk of flash floods, rising rivers and landslides.\n\nThe Cuban government issued a hurricane warning for the provinces of Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guantanamo, and Holguin. It also sent a tropical storm warning to the province of Las Tunas.\n\nAlthough Jamaica is used to hurricanes,  climate change  is making tropical storms more frequent and severe, including by causing heavier rainfall and slower-moving storms, due to warming oceans and air temperatures.\n\nWith a population of less than three million people, Jamaica is responsible for just 0.02 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to data from the World Resources Institute. But as an island nation, it is expected to continue to bear the brunt of worsening climate effects.\n\nSpeaking at the United Nations General Assembly in September, Jamaica’s Prime Minister Andrew Holness urged wealthy countries to increase climate financing to assist countries like Jamaica with adapting.\n\n“Climate change is not a distant threat or an academic consideration. It is a daily reality for small island developing states like Jamaica,” he said.\n\nMelissa is the 13th named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from early June to late November.\n\nThe last major hurricane to affect Jamaica was Beryl in early July 2024, which was an abnormally strong storm for the time of year.\n\nBeryl brought downpours and strong winds to Jamaica as it moved past the island’s southern coast, leaving at least four people dead."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/31/houthis-say-arrested-un-staff-will-be-tried-over-israeli-strike","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"21:51:46+00:00","title":"Yemen’s Houthis say arrested UN staff will be tried over Israeli links","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Houthi-run government in Yemen has announced trials for dozens of detained United Nations staff, accusing them of spying for Israel or being involved in an Israeli airstrike that killed the prime minister and nine ministers in Sanaa in August 2023.

detained United Nations staff on trial, alleging that they have spied for Israel or had links to an Israeli air strike that killed the prime minister, according to officials.\n\nAbdulwahid Abu Ras, Yemen’s acting foreign minister, told the Reuters news agency on Friday that a cell within the UN’s World Food Programme was involved in directly targeting the government.\n\nThe Houthi prime minister and nine other ministers were killed in an Israeli strike on the capital Sanaa in August, the first such attack to kill senior officials.\n\nThe UN, which has repeatedly rejected Houthi accusations, said on Friday that a total of 36 UN employees were arrested after Israel’s attack. It says that at least 59 UN personnel are being held by the group.\n\nAbu Ras told Reuters that security agencies were acting “under full judicial supervision” and that public prosecutors were being kept informed “step by step”. It was certain, he said, that the process would lead “to trials and the issuance of judicial rulings”.\n\nSeparately, Nasruddin Amer, a senior Houthi official, told the dpa news agency on Friday that the detained UN workers would be tried on charges of spying for Israel.\n\n“The judiciary will determine the penalty for those accused of spying for Israel in accordance with Yemeni law,” Amer said. “This is not a law we enacted. It is a law that has been in effect and applied in the country by previous regimes.”\n\nThe UN defendants are Yemenis and could face the death penalty under the nation’s laws.\n\nHundreds of UN personnel, including a small number of international staff, remain in parts of Houthi-controlled Yemen, according to Farhan Haq, deputy spokesperson for the UN secretary general.\n\nHouthi security forces entered several UN offices in Sanaa on Sunday. The UN says it is operating under increasingly difficult conditions, hindering its ability to provide assistance to those in need in Yemen.\n\nAmer told dpa: “The trial is not against the organisations, but against those who exploited humanitarian work to carry out espionage against our country and our people.”\n\nAbu Ras claimed that the Houthis are supporting humanitarian provision, and will “assist organisations committed to the principles of humanitarian work, facilitating their activities and work”.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the World Food Programme.\n\nSince Israel launched its  war on Gaza  in October 2023, the Houthis have targeted vessels in the Red Sea and carried out drone and missile attacks against Israel, saying that they are acting in solidarity with Palestinians under fire in Gaza.\n\nIsrael has regularly struck the war-torn country, targeting civilian infrastructure, including residential buildings and the main international airport, while killing dozens at a time.\n\nLast month, Israeli strikes on Sanaa and the northern province of  al-Jawf  killed dozens of people, including journalists and children."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/31/white-house-restricts-press-office-access-citing-sensitive-material","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"23:08:52Z","title":"White House restricts press office access citing sensitive material","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration has restricted access to Room 140 of the White House press office, requiring journalists to obtain prior appointments to visit, citing the need to protect sensitive national security material.

mosquitoes to Iceland?\n\nMosquitoes were detected in Iceland for the first time this month, resulting in the country losing its status as one of the only places in the world without them. The findings were confirmed by the country’s national science institute on Monday.\n\nThis follows record-breaking heat this past summer, which has sped up glacial melting in the country.\n\nOn October 16, insect enthusiast Bjorn Hjaltason posted on a Facebook group  Skordýr og Nytjadýr Á Íslandi  (Insects in Iceland) that he had spotted mosquitoes in Kjos at dusk that day.\n\nHe said he had caught some using a red wine ribbon, a trap using sweetened wine as bait to attract insects. Kjos is a glacial valley 52km (32 miles) northeast of the Icelandic capital, Reykjavik.\n\nHjaltason sent the mosquitoes to the Natural Science Institute of Iceland, where entomologist Matthias Alfredsson confirmed they were indeed mosquitoes.\n\nAlfredsson identified the mosquitoes as belonging to the Culiseta annulata species. This cold-resistant species is native to the Palearctic, which refers to Europe, North Africa and most of Asia north of the Himalayas. The Culiseta annulata are not known to carry disease but are generally considered a nuisance.\n\n“It has adapted to a rather cold climate, surviving the winter as an adult and then staying in shelter, such as outbuildings and basements. The fly stings but is not considered dangerous to humans as it does not carry any known infections in these areas,” a news release published by the Natural Science Institute on Tuesday stated.\n\nMosquito species that are well adapted to cooler conditions and can survive winters as eggs or larvae do not tend to carry disease.\n\n“Their development is slower, their active season shorter and most tropical diseases cannot complete their life cycle before cold weather sets in,” British entomologist Luke Tilley from the Royal Entomological  Society told Al Jazeera. “Cooler regions, therefore, tend to have mosquitoes but with lower disease risk.”\n\nThere are more than 3,500 species of mosquitoes around the globe, and they can be found in most parts of the world, bar a very few, including Antarctica.\n\nMosquitoes breed in shallow, stagnant bodies of water, which Iceland has in abundance. Despite having many marshes and ponds, however, it has never had a native mosquito population.\n\nThis is because mosquitoes are cold-blooded, which means they thrive in warmer environments. Male mosquitoes also feed on flowers, which thrive in warmer temperatures.\n\n“Warmer air and water speed up their growth, feeding and reproduction and also allow disease‑causing organisms inside them to develop more quickly. Longer warm seasons mean more generations of mosquitoes each year, and changes in rainfall can create new pools and puddles for breeding,” Tilley said.\n\nIceland is generally cold throughout the year. Its average temperature varies from minus 1 degree Celsius (30 degrees Fahrenheit) in the winter to 11C (52F) in the warmest months.\n\nMosquitoes lay their eggs during cold weather, and when the water thaws, the larvae hatch from the eggs. In Iceland, however, water typically freezes and thaws several times a year, making the landscape generally inhospitable for mosquitoes.\n\nBefore mosquitoes were spotted this month, the closest they had come to Iceland was in the 1980s when biologist Gisli Mar Gislason spotted one inside his aeroplane that had arrived at Keflavík International Airport from Greenland. The mosquito is preserved at the Icelandic Institute of Natural History.\n\nGislason told Al Jazeera that more mosquito species are in warm climates than cold, and the greatest diversity of mosquitoes is seen in tropical areas.\n\n“There is one species in Greenland, Aedes nigripes. It is a high Arctic species, and their density is controlled by the abundance of hosts, [such as] muskoxen, Arctic foxes, reindeers, polar bears and humans.”\n\nIn a statement, the Natural Science Institute said it is unclear how this particular mosquito species came to be in Iceland. However, it added: “It is likely that it was transported by freight. It is uncertain whether it has settled here permanently, but everything indicates that it can survive in Icelandic conditions.”\n\nA growing number of new insect species are being observed in Iceland due to a warming climate and increased transportation, the institute said.\n\nThe country is warming at an unprecedented rate. In May, Iceland and neighbouring Greenland experienced record-breaking heat due to a persistent weather pattern that brought unusually warm air from the south. In May, temperatures recorded in Iceland were 13 degrees Celsius (23.4 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the 1990-2020 average – 10 times higher than the average warming of 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) across the world as a whole.\n\nThe country’s glaciers have been rapidly melting and are projected to lose about half their volume by 2100, the country’s Vatnajokull National Park website said.\n\nIncreasingly, “cooler climates can support mosquito development and survival. They can adapt to cooler temperatures up to a certain temperature below which they cannot survive. It depends which mosquito species,” Yaw Afrane, a professor of Medical Microbiology at the University of Ghana, told Al Jazeera.\n\nYes. Warming temperatures are changing how mosquitoes behave in many parts of the world.\n\nAs the planet warms, “vector-borne diseases will move to areas that have been free of them as the climate will be more permissive to disease vectors,” Afrane said.\n\nThe World Health Organization has identified an increase in insect-borne disease as one of the biggest health threats to humans associated with climate change.\n\n“Warmer conditions can allow mosquitoes and the pathogens they carry to survive in new regions, extending the potential range of diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and West Nile virus,” Tilley said.\n\n“International travel, trade and changes in land use also play a part. The key is careful monitoring and preparedness to prevent local transmission.”\n\nIn September 2023, the United Kingdom found the eggs of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in the country for the first time near Heathrow Airport. Then in August 2024, four Aedes albopictus eggs were found at a motorway service station in Kent. No further specimens were found on investigation.\n\nThe Aedes aegypti is responsible for the spread of diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika. Aedes albopictus can also transmit diseases such as dengue and chikungunya.\n\nEuropean countries have reported increasing cases of mosquito-borne illnesses recently. Last year, Italy had more than 200 local dengue cases. France and Spain also reported cases of the disease. This year, France has recorded 500 cases of chikungunya.\n\nWarmer countries that already have high rates of mosquito-borne illnesses are seeing a surge in numbers. In September, Bangladesh recorded the largest single-day rise in both deaths and hospital admissions from dengue fever when 12 people died and 740 new people were hospitalised in just 24 hours.\n\nBesides increasing temperatures, heavy rainfall can also allow mosquitoes to thrive. The rain flushes mosquito eggs, larvae and pupae from areas where they breed to new areas. If rainwater does not drain away properly, it leaves pools of shallow, stagnant water, the ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes.\n\nTilley explained that besides the spread of disease, changing mosquito populations can also create shifts in the ecosystem. “More mosquitoes can benefit their predators such as bats, dragonflies and birds, but disease in wildlife may also rise,” he said.\n\n“A mosquito in a new area will be a prey for predators like fish, waterfowl and insect-eating insects. There is, therefore, more diversity of food for these predators,” Gislason told Al Jazeera, adding that it is difficult to predict accurately what will happen if a mosquito enters a new area. He said, however, that major changes in aquatic ecosystems in Iceland have not been observed yet.\n\nTilley said these shifts in mosquito behaviour also allow insect scientists to study climate change patterns, noting, “Insects like mosquitoes are valuable indicators of environmental change, helping insect scientists track how ecosystems respond to a warming climate.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/28/hurricane-melissa-live-category-5-storm-nears-jamaica-strongest-this-year?update=4067201","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"07:34:24+00:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":[],"content":"Published: 2025-10-28T07:34:24+00:00\n\nTitle: Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica\n\nThis live page has now been closed."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/1/apec-leaders-wrap-up-summit-after-trump-and-xi-reach-truce-in-trade-war","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"07:40:05+00:00","title":"APEC leaders wrap up summit after Trump and Xi reach truce in trade war","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"APEC leaders concluded a summit in Gyeongju, South Korea, with a joint declaration emphasizing robust trade and investment to navigate a volatile global environment.

Pacific Rim leaders have pledged their support for trade and investment that “benefits all”, concluding a summit dominated by  an agreement  between the leaders of the United States and China to call a truce in their trade war.\n\nThe declaration by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) leaders on Saturday came after US President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, earlier agreed to lower the temperature in the heated  US-China rivalry  during a high-stakes summit held on the sidelines of the event.\n\nTrump departed South Korea on Thursday after his talks with Xi, their first face-to-face meeting since 2019, leaving the Chinese leader to take centre stage at the two-day economic forum.\n\nXi, who has cast China as a defender of multilateralism and free trade, told the opening of the event on Friday that countries needed to work together as they faced an “increasingly complex and volatile” global environment.\n\nIn their declaration, the APEC leaders said “robust” trade and investment were vital to the region’s growth, and stressed their commitment to “deepening economic cooperation to navigate the evolving global environment”.\n\nAPEC, whose 21 members include the US, China, Japan and South Korea, will advance economic integration that is “market-driven” and enhance “experience sharing, capacity building, business engagement”, the declaration said.\n\nThe leaders also pledged regional cooperation on artificial intelligence and demographic challenges arising from falling birth rates.\n\nSpeaking before the declaration, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, the summit’s host, warned that economies were navigating an era of mounting global uncertainty.\n\n“The free trade system is experiencing strong turbulence, global economic uncertainty is deepening, and momentum for trade and investment is weakening,” Lee said.\n\nSaturday’s statement notably did not directly reference multilateralism or the World Trade Organization, a reminder of the fraying consensus on free trade amid rising populism worldwide.\n\nDeborah Elms, head of trade policy at the Hinrich Foundation in Singapore, said it was “probably a miracle” that the leaders had been able to agree on a joint statement.\n\n“Given the strong positions of some APEC economies, getting any agreed language into a document was a fraught exercise,” Elms told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Normally, these are wrapped up well in advance. This one hung in the balance to the last minute as officials swapped out wording to find an acceptable compromise.”\n\nAfter earlier meetings with his Japanese, Canadian and Thai counterparts, Xi later on Saturday sat down with Lee for talks expected to focus on issues including trade and North Korea’s nuclear programme.\n\nThe meeting is the first between Xi – who lasted visited South Korea in 2014 – and Lee since the South Korean leader’s election in a  snap poll  in June.\n\nLee has pledged to pursue a more balanced policy towards China than his conservative predecessor Yoon Suk Yeol, who was impeached for briefly declaring martial law last year.\n\nSouth Korea, like other countries in the region, has had to walk a fine line between the US, its security guarantor, and China, its biggest trading partner.\n\nThe US stations about 28,500 troops in South Korea and is treaty-bound to come to its defence if it is attacked, a legacy of Washington’s support for the country in its 1950-53 war with North Korea.\n\nSouth Korea sent nearly one-fifth of its exports to China in 2024, with the value of its shipments hitting $133bn.\n\nThe US was the country’s second-largest export destination, with shipments of $127.8bn.\n\nSouth Korea’s relations with China have been tested by a series of disputes in recent years, most notably a spat over the US’s 2017 deployment of a THAAD missile defence system in the country.\n\nLee wants to see South Korea’s most important relationships “remain stable, which means lowering tensions with China, preventing a drastic decline in US relations and capitalising on the diplomatic heavy lifting his predecessor did with Japan”, said Rob York, director for regional affairs at the Hawaii-based Pacific Forum.\n\n“For now, that will mean striking a friendly note with both Chairman Xi and President Trump, even as he takes steps behind the scenes to lessen dependencies on the US for security and to counter PRC hybrid war operations in South Korea related to maritime issues and technology theft,” York told Al Jazeera, referring to China’s official name, the People’s Republic of China.\n\n“Initial signs suggest Lee is serious about tackling those issues but will try to do so discreetly – there really isn’t much to be gained right now in having those issues erupt in public.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/1/republicans-push-back-against-trumps-call-to-end-the-senate-filibuster","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"00:13:47+00:00","title":"Republicans push back against Trump’s call to end the Senate filibuster","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has urged the Senate to end the filibuster to end a 31-day government shutdown, claiming that powerful Republicans allow Democrats to shut down government functions.

back against Trump’s call to end the Senate filibuster\n\nPresident Donald Trump has thrown himself into the ongoing debate over the United States government shutdown, calling on the Senate to scrap the filibuster and reopen the government.\n\nBut that idea was swiftly rejected on Friday by Republican leaders who have long opposed such a move.\n\nThe filibuster refers to a Senate rule that requires 60 votes to overcome objections. Currently, that rule gives the minority Democrats a check on Republican power in the Senate.\n\nIn the chamber that’s currently split 53 to 47, Democrats have had enough votes to keep the government closed while they demand an extension of healthcare subsidies. Yet, neither party has seriously wanted to nuke the rule.\n\n“THE CHOICE IS CLEAR – INITIATE THE ‘NUCLEAR OPTION,’ GET RID OF THE FILIBUSTER,” Trump said in a late-night social media  post  Thursday.\n\nTrump’s  sudden decision  to assert himself in the now 31-day-long shutdown – with his highly charged demand to end the filibuster – is certain to set the Senate on edge. It could spur senators towards their own compromise or send the chamber spiralling towards a new sense of crisis. Or, it might be ignored.\n\nRepublican leaders responded quickly, and unequivocally, setting themselves at odds with Trump, a president few have dared to publicly counter.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune has repeatedly said he is not considering changing the rules to end the shutdown, arguing that it is vital to the institution of the Senate and has allowed Republicans to halt Democratic policies when they are in the minority.\n\nThe leader’s “position on the importance of the legislative filibuster is unchanged”, Thune spokesman Ryan Wrasse said Friday.\n\nA spokeswoman for Wyoming Senator John Barrasso, the number-two Republican, said his position opposing a filibuster change also remains unchanged.\n\nAnd former Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who firmly opposed Trump’s filibuster pleas in his first term, remains in the Senate.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson also defended the filibuster Friday, while conceding “it’s not my call” from his chamber across the Capitol.\n\n“The safeguard in the Senate has always been the filibuster,” Johnson said, adding that Trump’s comments are a reflection of “the president’s anger at the situation”.\n\nEven if Thune wanted to change the filibuster, he would not currently have the votes to do so in the divided Senate.\n\n“The filibuster forces us to find common ground in the Senate,” Republican Senator John Curtis of Utah posted on the social media platform X on Friday morning, responding to Trump’s comments. “Power changes hands, but principles shouldn’t. I’m a firm no on eliminating it.”\n\nDebate has swirled around the legislative filibuster for years. Many Democrats pushed to eliminate it when they had full power in Washington, as the Republicans do now, four years ago.\n\nBut ultimately, enough Democratic senators opposed the move, predicting such an action would come back to haunt them.\n\nTrump’s demand comes as he has declined to engage with Democratic leaders on ways to end the shutdown, on track to become the longest in history.\n\nHe said in his post that he gave a “great deal” of thought to his choice on his flight home from Asia, and that one question that kept coming up during his trip was why “powerful Republicans allow” the Democrats to shut down parts of the government.\n\nBut later Friday, he did not mention the filibuster again as he spoke to reporters departing Washington and arriving in Florida for a weekend at his Mar-a-Lago home.\n\nWhile quiet talks are under way, particularly among bipartisan senators, Trump has not been seriously involved.\n\nDemocrats refuse to vote to reopen the government until Republicans negotiate an extension to the healthcare subsidies. The Republicans say they won’t negotiate until the government is reopened.\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said on CNN that Trump needs to start negotiating with Democrats, arguing the president has spent more time with global leaders than dealing with the shutdown back home.\n\nFrom coast to coast, fallout from the dysfunction of the shuttered federal government is hitting home. SNAP food aid is scheduled to shut off. Flights are being delayed. Workers are going without paychecks.\n\nAnd Americans are getting a first glimpse of the skyrocketing healthcare insurance costs that are at the centre of the deadlock.\n\n“People are stressing,” said Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, as food options in her state grow scarce. “We are well past time to have this behind us.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/28/hurricane-melissa-live-category-5-storm-nears-jamaica-strongest-this-year?update=4067270","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"07:34:24+00:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":[],"content":"Published: 2025-10-28T07:34:24+00:00\n\nTitle: Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica\n\nThis live page has now been closed."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/28/hurricane-melissa-live-category-5-storm-nears-jamaica-strongest-this-year?update=4067258","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"07:34:24+00:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa updates: 'Storm of the century' makes landfall in Jamaica","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article titled 'Hurricane Melissa updates: 'Storm of the century' makes landfall in Jamaica' reports on a major hurricane making landfall in Jamaica, but due to the live page being closed and no content being provided, no factual details or entities can be extracted.","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":[],"content":"Published: 2025-10-28T07:34:24+00:00\n\nTitle: Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica\n\nThis live page has now been closed."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/28/hurricane-melissa-live-category-5-storm-nears-jamaica-strongest-this-year?update=4067291","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"07:34:24+00:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":[],"content":"Published: 2025-10-28T07:34:24+00:00\n\nTitle: Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica\n\nThis live page has now been closed."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/1/g7-slams-russian-attacks-on-energy-as-ukraine-decries-nuclear-terrorism","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"02:47:10+00:00","title":"G7 slams Russian attacks on energy, as Ukraine decries ‘nuclear terrorism’","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The G7 energy ministers have issued a joint statement condemning Russia’s repeated attacks on Ukraine’s civilian energy infrastructure, describing them as 'nuclear terrorism' and highlighting the severe risks to public safety, environmental stability, and energy security.

condemning Russia’s attacks on Ukraine’s energy system, after authorities in Kyiv described Moscow’s  most recent barrage  as akin to “nuclear terrorism”.\n\nIn a Friday statement, the G7 energy ministers – representing Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States – said Russia’s attacks “continue to inflict devastating social, environmental, and economic consequences on the Ukrainian people”.\n\n“Russia’s recent attacks on Ukraine’s natural gas infrastructure have created risks to communities and human lives, weakening civilian infrastructure and the energy security of the Ukrainian people,” it said.\n\nThe G7 statement said it continues to support the reconstruction of Ukraine’s energy sector “through direct financial assistance, credit facilities, risk insurance, policy and resource alignment, as well as setting conditions for long-term private sector investment”.\n\nOver recent weeks, Ukraine has accused Russia of repeatedly attacking critical civilian energy infrastructure ahead of the bitterly cold winter months in order to inflict suffering on its population.\n\nMost recently, Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said Moscow’s “goal is to plunge Ukraine into darkness”, after a wave of Russian attacks hit energy facilities in central, western, and southeastern regions of the country on Thursday, killing seven people.\n\n“Russia continues its systematic energy terror – striking at the lives, dignity, and warmth of Ukrainians on the eve of winter,” Svyrydenko said.\n\n“To stop the terror, we need more air defence systems, tougher sanctions, and maximum pressure on the aggressor,” she added.\n\nOn Friday, Ukraine’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs denounced what it said were “targeted strikes” by Russian forces on substations critical to supplying external power for Ukraine’s nuclear power stations.\n\n“Deliberate strikes on civilian energy facilities that directly affect the safe operation of nuclear installations bear the hallmarks of nuclear terrorism and constitute a grave violation of international humanitarian law,” it said.\n\nKyiv announced nationwide limits on electricity supplies to retail and industrial consumers following Thursday’s attacks, while water supplies and heating were also disrupted in some regions.\n\nThe United Nations’ International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) also said three Ukrainian nuclear power plants were forced to reduce output due to the assault.\n\n“The dangers to nuclear safety continue to be very real and ever-present,” IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi warned.\n\n“I once again call for maximum military restraint in the vicinity of nuclear facilities,” he added.\n\nMoscow denies it targets civilians. It claims its strikes are simply a response to Ukraine’s attacks on Russian civilian infrastructure.\n\nMoscow and Kyiv regularly accuse each other of  targeting one another’s energy sites , as well as engaging in military activity that compromises safety at Ukraine’s four working nuclear plants.\n\nThe Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, seized by Russian forces in the early weeks of Moscow’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, has become a  prime concern  for the IAEA as fighting rages nearby.\n\nOn October 23, the Russian-installed administration of Zaporizhia said it had repaired a damaged high-voltage line and restored external power to the plant.\n\nIt had been without external electricity for 30 days and relying on backup diesel generators since September 23, when its last remaining external power line was  severed in attacks  that each side blamed on the other.\n\nEurope’s largest nuclear plant, with six reactors, Zaporizhzhia, currently produces no electricity, but needs external power to cool the nuclear fuel and avoid any catastrophic nuclear incidents."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/31/un-security-council-supports-moroccos-plan-for-western-sahara","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"22:25:19Z","title":"UN Security Council supports Morocco’s plan for Western Sahara","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United Nations Security Council has adopted a resolution endorsing Morocco’s 2007 plan for genuine autonomy in Western Sahara under Moroccan sovereignty, calling for negotiations between Morocco and the Polisario Front.

that genuine autonomy for Western Sahara under Moroccan sovereignty could be the most feasible solution to Rabat’s 50-year conflict with the Algeria-backed Polisario Front.\n\nWestern Sahara, a tract of desert the size of Britain, has been the scene of Africa’s longest-running territorial dispute since colonial power Spain left in 1975 and Morocco annexed the territory.\n\nThe UNSC, in a United States-drafted text, on Friday called for the parties to engage in negotiations based on an autonomy plan first presented by Morocco to the UN in 2007.\n\nMorocco considers the territory its own while the Polisario Front seeks to establish an independent state called the Sahrawi Republic.\n\n“We urge all parties to use the coming weeks to come to the table and engage in serious discussions,” US ambassador to the UN Mike Waltz told the council after the vote on Friday. “We believe regional peace is possible this year, and we will make every effort to facilitate progress.”\n\nRussia, China and Pakistan abstained, while Algeria did not vote. The remaining 11 council members voted in favour of the resolution, which also renewed for one year the mandate of the UN peacekeeping force in Western Sahara, known as the UN Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO).\n\n“The final decision on the future cannot, must not, belong to anyone other than the people under colonial domination,” Algeria’s UN ambassador, Amar Bendjama, told the council after the vote. “This text ignores the proposals of the Polisario Front … They are a party to the conflict, and their opinion must be heard.”\n\nMorocco’s autonomy proposal would establish a local legislative, executive and judicial authority for Western Sahara elected by its residents, while Rabat would retain jurisdiction over defence, foreign affairs and religious matters.\n\nThe Polisario instead wants to hold a referendum with independence as an option.\n\nMorocco is seeking a win-win and “face-saving” solution for all the parties to the conflict, King Mohammed VI of Morocco said after the UN vote. He urged Sahrawi refugees held in the Polisario-run Tindouf camps in southwestern Algeria to endorse autonomy.\n\nThe king also renewed his call for a “brotherly dialogue” with Algeria and said Morocco is committed to the Maghreb Union.\n\n“We are opening a new and victorious chapter in the process of enshrining the Moroccan character of the Sahara, which is intended to bring this issue to a definitive close,” King Mohammed said in a speech in which he expressed his “immense pride”.\n\nThousands gathered in the streets of Morocco’s cities to celebrate the vote, carrying flags and chanting patriotic slogans.\n\nPolisario Front representative Sidi Omar said the resolution does not imply any recognition of Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara. He said the Polisario Front leadership would assess the UN resolution and make an official position public in due course.\n\nThe Security Council resolution also asked UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to provide within six months “a strategic review regarding MINURSO’s future mandate, taking into account the outcome of the negotiations”.\n\nUS President Donald Trump reaffirmed support for Morocco’s sovereignty over Western Sahara in July, saying a Moroccan autonomy plan for the territory was the sole solution. Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff had said the US is working on a peace deal between Algeria and Morocco.\n\nFrance made a similar move, recognising Rabat’s sovereignty over the territory and greenlighting investments there. In June, Britain became the third UNSC member to back autonomy under Moroccan sovereignty. Spain has also backed Rabat’s position, along with an increasing number of European states, signalling a shift in European Union member states’ foreign policy on the issue."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/1/melissa-leaves-50-dead-toll-expected-to-rise-in-jamaica-haiti","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"05:03:28+00:00","title":"Melissa leaves 50 dead, toll expected to rise in Jamaica, Haiti","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, a powerful Category 5 storm, devastated Jamaica, Haiti, and Cuba, killing around 50 people and causing catastrophic damage.

declared the winner of the country’s disputed  presidential election  with nearly 98 percent of the vote, after leading rivals were excluded from the race.\n\nThe final result announced by the electoral commission on Saturday showed Hassan had won 97.66 percent of Wednesday’s vote, dominating every constituency.\n\nState media said a swearing-in ceremony would take place later on Saturday.\n\nThe election for president and parliament set off days of  violent protests  as demonstrators took to the streets of major cities to protest against the barring or prevention of Hassan’s main rivals from running and what they described as widespread repression.\n\nDespite a heavy security presence, election day descended into chaos, with some demonstrators tearing down banners of Hassan and setting fire to government buildings, and police firing tear gas and gunshots, according to reports quoting witnesses.\n\nChadema, the main opposition force which was barred from taking part in the election, told the AFP news agency on Friday that “about 700” people had been killed, based on figures gathered from a network checking hospitals and health clinics.\n\nMeanwhile, the UN human rights office said credible reports indicated at least 10 people were killed in three cities.\n\nForeign Minister Mahmoud Thabit Kombo  told Al Jazeera  on Friday that the authorities have acted appropriately and the election was conducted fairly.\n\n“No excessive force has been used,” he told Al Jazeera, saying the government has “no official figures” on any protesters killed. “I’ve not seen these 700 anywhere.”\n\nHassan, who in 2021 was elevated from vice president on the sudden death of her predecessor, John Magufuli, faced 16 candidates from smaller parties.\n\nChadema leader Tundu Lissu has been jailed for months, charged with treason after he called for electoral reforms that he said were a prerequisite for free and fair elections. He denies the charges. Another opposition figure, Luhaga Mpina of the ACT-Wazalendo group, was barred from running.\n\nRights groups allege Hassan oversaw a “wave of terror” in the country before the vote, including a string of high-profile abductions that escalated in the final days. The government has rejected criticisms of its human rights record.\n\nHassan has not made any public statement since the unrest began.\n\nUnited Nations chief Antonio Guterres is “deeply concerned” about the situation in Tanzania, “including reports of deaths and injuries during the demonstrations”, his spokesman said in a statement."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/11/1/live-israel-continues-attacks-on-gaza-as-palestinians-fear-return-to-war","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"06:24:47+00:00","title":"Deadly Israeli attacks shake Gaza ceasefire as more bodies exchanged","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"This article reports on deadly Israeli attacks in Gaza this week, which have killed over 100 people following the killing of an Israeli soldier.

people at a hotel in a ski resort in northwest Turkiye’s Bolu mountains in January.\n\nAmong those sentenced on Friday were Halit Ergul – the owner of the Grand Kartal Hotel, which sits in the

12-storey hotel, where 238 guests were staying.\n\nThirty-four children were among 78 people killed in the fire, which occurred during the school holidays when many families from Ankara and Istanbul head to the Bolu mountains to ski.\n\nAnother 137 people suffered injuries during the incident, as panicked hotel guests were forced to jump from windows in the middle of the night.\n\nAlso sentenced on Friday were the hotel’s general manager, Emir Aras, as well as the deputy mayor of Bolu, Sedat Gulener, and the director of another hotel, Ahmet Demir, both of whom were reportedly on the board of

It’s unclear when the remaining defendants will appear in court.\n\nIn total, the convicted were handed 34 aggravated life sentences for the 34 children killed in the disaster.

2025-10-23T08:09:33+00:00\n\nTitle: Why has Pakistan’s HPV vaccine campaign faced a backlash?\n\nIn September, Pakistan launched its first-ever national human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine campaign, aiming to immunise more than 13 million girls aged nine to 14 in its first phase.\n\nHPV is the most common cause of cervical cancer, which kills eight Pakistani women every day, according to Dr Dapeng Luo, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) in Pakistan. The United Nations health agency has set a goal of  eradicating cervical cancer  globally by 2030.\n\nBut the vaccine has met resistance in Pakistan, as conspiracy theories about inoculations have circulated.\n\nHere is more about what HPV is, how it causes cervical cancer, and why the vaccine rollout in Pakistan has faced a backlash.\n\nHPV is a common group of viruses that enter the body via skin-to-skin contact, typically through a cut or abrasion.\n\nThere are more than 100 types of HPV, and they are often spread through sexual contact.  Infection can be hard to identify because many people who have contracted an HPV have no symptoms at all, and it can take many years for cancer to develop.\n\nSome types of the virus eventually cause warts on the genitals or other parts of the body. These may appear flat or bumpy.\n\nMore than 95 percent of the 660,000 cervical cancer cases recorded each year worldwide are caused by HPV, according to the WHO. In Pakistan, more than 5,000 new cases of cervical cancer are reported every year, it said.\n\nSome strains of HPV can cause different types of cancer, such as cervical cancer, vulvar cancer or vaginal cancer. However, cervical cancer typically develops 20 years after the onset of the HPV infection.\n\nWhile the body’s immune system can clear away many strains of HPV within two years of infection, certain strains are more persistent. When the body’s immune system is unable to fight off the more persistent HPV strains, the virus interferes with normal cell growth, causing cells to become abnormal and potentially leading to a pre-cancerous state. If this is left untreated, cancer can develop.\n\nSufferers of cervical cancer do not experience symptoms in its early stages. Hence, women aged 30 to 65 are advised to have a pap smear every three years, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nPakistan’s HPV vaccine campaign began on September 15. While the first phase was scheduled to run until September 27, it was later extended to October 1.\n\nSome 49,000 government health workers – all women – have been trained by the WHO to administer the vaccines across the country. The WHO and Pakistan’s government partnered to conduct this training with funding support from GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, a public-private partnership that works to improve access to immunisations.\n\nIn advance of the first phase, vaccine centres were set up in public buildings such as schools. Health workers also went door-to-door to administer the HPV vaccine.\n\nA single dose of Cecolin, an HPV vaccine developed in China, was administered free of charge. While most HPV vaccines require either two or three doses, WHO confirmed in October last year that Cecolin could be used as a single dose.\n\nIn the first phase of the rollout in Pakistan, girls between the ages of nine and 14 from Sindh, Punjab, Pakistan-administered Kashmir and the Islamabad Capital Territory received the single-dose vaccine.\n\nPakistan’s federal health minister, Syed Mustafa Kamal, said at a launch ceremony for the vaccine on September 16 in Islamabad, “I urge all parents to ensure their daughters and sisters are vaccinated. Do not fall prey to negative campaigns. This vaccine is safe, effective and essential for protecting our girls.”\n\nKamal told Al Jazeera that when the vaccine campaign started, there was a lot of criticism and scepticism towards it. “A few unknown people had spread some fake videos and fake information.”\n\nHe said that during the first four days of the campaign, the response to the vaccine was negative. “The refusals were very high, so much so that there are schools which had committed before [to serve as vaccination centres], but refused our workers entry into the school.”\n\nOn the fifth day, Kamal got his own daughter publicly vaccinated during a ceremony at the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) office in Karachi. During the event, Kamal told journalists: “I have never brought my family into the public eye in my 30-year political career. But to put an end to these baseless rumours, I have taken this step.”\n\nHe said that after this, the refusals went down and acceptances went up. He added that this upward trend of acceptance and vaccine administration continued till the end of the campaign.\n\n“It was noticed that after clarifying rumours, people started to get vaccine. Especially, schools were requesting to send teams as parents were agreeing to get their daughters vaccinated,” Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho, the health minister of Sindh province, told Al Jazeera in a written statement.\n\nThe initial reluctance is why, she said, the vaccination campaign was extended by four days.\n\nThe Cecolin vaccine does not contain the live HPV virus. Instead, it contains recombinant L1 capsid proteins, laboratory-made proteins that mimic the outer shell of the virus but do not have any viral DNA and therefore cannot cause infection.\n\nOther countries have used the US-manufactured Gardasil HPV vaccine, which also does not contain the live HPV virus and contains recombinant L1 capsid proteins.\n\nThe government says that this particular age group of girls was selected per the recommendations of the WHO’s National Immunisation Technical Advisory Groups (NITAGs), responsible for providing evidence-based recommendations for immunisation.\n\n“As per WHO, the immune response generated by the body after the vaccine jab is maximum at this age of 9-14 years, and the child gets the best and long-term protection. Hence, this particular age group,” Pechuho said.\n\n“Currently, the vaccine is available free of cost for 9-14-year-old girls only. There have been talks at the federal ministry level to make this vaccine available commercially so others [boys, women and teenage girls, etc] can benefit, as well.”\n\nIn September, Sana Ali Manzoor and her husband – who say they are strongly in favour of vaccinations for their children – took their 11-year-old daughter to be vaccinated at her private school campus in Karachi after school hours. The whole process took about 20 minutes.\n\nManzoor said she heard about the vaccine rollout via a mobile application operated by her daughter’s school, Haque Academy, which is located in the upmarket neighbourhood of Defence Housing Authority. Parents were invited to register on the mobile app and accompany their children for the vaccination.\n\nManzoor, a lactation specialist who supports new mothers, said approximately 30-40 other children were also present when her daughter received her vaccination.\n\n“So we went to school, and there were two or three tables set up. The health workers were there. They first checked if our name was on the list. After that, we went and got the vaccination done. And then right after that, there was a manual card entry filling that was done, then they gave us the card.”\n\nShe described the process as “very organised”. Manzoor says she was encouraged by friends, including a paediatrician and a gynaecologist, to get the HPV vaccine for her daughter. She has also had her children vaccinated against chickenpox, which she travelled to Dubai to get.\n\nThe rollout has not hit its target, authorities say — though they insist that despite this, the campaign counts as a success.\n\n“Around 13 million girls were supposed to be vaccinated in the first phase of the HPV vaccine campaign. So far, 9.2 million have been vaccinated, which is 78 percent of the total target,” Pechuho said.\n\nIn the southern province of Sindh, the estimated target for the HPV campaign was 4,081,279 girls. Sixty-six percent of the total target was reached, with 2,674,210 girls vaccinated.\n\nThe low take-up is down to a general hesitancy towards vaccines in Pakistani society, experts say. Compounding this, specific concerns about the HPV vaccine have been fuelled by misinformation, particularly online.\n\nThe vaccine will eventually roll out to other provinces, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2026, and Balochistan and Gilgit-Baltistan in 2027. The government has not yet announced when the next phase will begin.\n\n“Every age girl will be vaccinated periodically,” Kamal, the federal minister, said. He added that the government hopes to vaccinate boys and men against HPV once girls and women have been vaccinated.\n\nWhile vaccine hesitancy is a global phenomenon, in Pakistan it was aggravated by the CIA’s use of a fake hepatitis B vaccination campaign in Pakistan’s Abbottabad as cover for a manhunt for fugitive al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.\n\nThe vaccine campaign, carried out in collaboration with a local doctor, was used to covertly collect blood samples to find links to bin Laden and his family. The plan was to compare the DNA of any of bin Laden’s children to that of his sister, who had died in Boston in 2010. The al-Qaeda leader was eventually killed in a military operation in Abbottabad by US Marines in 2011.\n\nIt was never revealed whether the CIA obtained any DNA from bin Laden’s family. However, news outlets at the time said that one source suggested the operation had not succeeded. In 2014, the White House promised that the CIA would never again use a false vaccination campaign for espionage. However, mistrust towards vaccines persisted.\n\nThis was apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic, when vaccines were free, but according to a recent study, 30 percent of people in Pakistan did not want to get vaccinated. An opinion piece, co-written by a Pakistani doctor and published on the website of GAVI, said: “Misconceptions that the [COVID] vaccine could lead to infertility, death or be tied into shadowy foreign agendas circulated rapidly through social media and community gossip.”\n\nManzoor said she has herself noticed “anti-vaxxer” sentiment among some of her clients. She recalled advising a young mother not to bring her unvaccinated newborn into her house, explaining that it is not a sterile environment. The young mother responded, “It’s fine, we don’t believe in such things.”\n\nThe HPV vaccine has faced especially heated pushback in Pakistan.\n\nSome argue that, as HPV is a sexually transmitted infection, it is not required in Pakistan, where consensual sex before marriage is not only culturally frowned upon, but is also illegal.\n\nA Pakistani user wrote on X, “Cerv. Cancer is spread via Sexual contact which is NOT IN PAKISTAN for 9-14 year old – only in west.”\n\nAnother user wrote, referring to the vaccine, “its common in societies where women has multiple sex partners!”\n\nManzoor said that she had her daughter vaccinated because, to her, it made sense to ensure that her daughter remains safe from the virus.\n\n“It’s not even about being sexually active, it’s even about, God forbid, molestation. It’s not always consensual,” Manzoor said.\n\nIn 2023, Islamabad-based NGO Sahil reported that, on average, one child was sexually abused every two hours in Pakistan. According to the  World Population Review , 5,867 rape cases were reported in Pakistan in 2023.\n\nAnother conspiracy theory circulating online is that the HPV vaccine causes infertility. There is no evidence to support this claim. Pakistan, with a population in excess of 250 million, is the fifth most populous country in the world, according to World Population Review. While  birthrates  in the country have declined, much like the rest of the world, Pakistan’s current birthrate is 3.32, well above the replacement rate of 2.1 required to maintain current populations.\n\nIn May 2020, a peer-reviewed US study found no evidence of increased infertility among women who received the HPV vaccine. However, this study was conducted in the US, and the sample was inoculated with a different vaccine – Gardasil.\n\nOther rumours, along with pictures and videos, have spread online. A video which attracted more than 340,000 views on X this year shows girls in school uniforms collapsing, with the caption asserting that these girls became sick after “forced vaccinations”.\n\nIn fact, the video was filmed last year and shows a scene in which police are clashing with protesters over electricity taxes in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Tear gas shells fired by the police are what caused the girls at the school to collapse.\n\n“The vaccine has an excellent safety profile. It has been around for almost two decades now. It doesn’t contain any virus, but the active component is the HPV L1 protein,” Pechuho said.\n\nIn an assessment of Cecolin published last year, the WHO said that “the vaccine was safe and showed a good immunogenicity”.\n\nIt can cause a few mild side effects, Pechucho said. “Most common side effects are related to any other vaccine, like fever, pain at the injection site and, rarely, allergic reactions,” he said.\n\nKamal too insisted that the most common side effect is a fever, which subsides in a day or two with the help of over-the-counter medicines.\n\n“People used to die of diseases like polio and tuberculosis. They’re not dying today because we now have vaccines. People are not dying of COVID because we have vaccines. The world has moved to prevention,” Kamal said.\n\n“The point of an effective healthcare system is to prevent people from becoming patients. And people will be safe from becoming patients when they take preventative measures and get their children vaccinated.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/26/hurricane-melissa-now-category-3-threatens-heavy-floods-in-jamaica-haiti","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-26","timeOfPublication":"05:51:09+00:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa, now Category 4, threatens heavy floods in Jamaica, Haiti","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, now a Category 4 storm with potential to reach Category 5, is threatening Jamaica and southern Haiti with extreme rainfall, flooding, and landslides.

hurricane centre said.\n\nAuthorities in Jamaica said on Saturday that the Norman Manley International Airport in Kingston will be closed. They did not say whether they will close the Sangster airport in Montego Bay, on the western side of the island.\n\nMore than 650 shelters were activated in Jamaica. Officials said warehouses across the island were well-stocked and thousands of food packages prepositioned for quick distribution if needed.\n\nMelissa was expected to unleash punishing rains of up to 76 centimetres (30 inches) on Jamaica and southern Hispaniola – Haiti and the Dominican Republic – according to the hurricane centre.\n\nIt should be near or over Cuba by the middle of the week. The Cuban government on Saturday afternoon issued a hurricane watch for the provinces of Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guantanamo and Holguin.\n\nThe erratic and slow-moving storm has killed at least three people in Haiti and a fourth person in the Dominican Republic, where another person remains missing.\n\n“Unfortunately for places along the projected path of this storm, it is increasingly dire,” Jamie Rhome, the centre’s deputy director, said earlier on Saturday. He said the storm will continue to move slowly for up to four days.\n\nIn Haiti, there were also reports of rising river levels, flooding and a bridge destroyed due to breached riverbanks in Sainte-Suzanne, in the northeast.\n\n“The storm is causing a lot of concern with the way it’s moving,” said Ronald Delice, a Haitian department director of civil protection, as local authorities organised lines to distribute food kits. Many residents are still reluctant to leave their homes.\n\nThe storm has damaged nearly 200 homes in the Dominican Republic and knocked out water supply systems, affecting more than half a million customers. It also downed trees and traffic lights, unleashed a couple of small landslides and left more than two dozen communities isolated by floodwaters.\n\nThe Bahamas Department of Meteorology said Melissa could bring tropical storm or hurricane conditions to islands in the Southeast and Central Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands by early next week.\n\nMelissa is the 13th named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to November 30."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0jdd186l0go","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"02:10:13.047+00:00","title":"Desperation in Black River, Jamaica, after Hurricane Melissa","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"After Hurricane Melissa, a powerful Category 5 storm, devastated Black River, Jamaica, residents faced catastrophic loss of life, infrastructure, and essential supplies.

scavenging the wreckage for food. Others jump into damaged stores in the hope of finding bottled water or other supplies.\n\nAs the death toll rises, residents of Black River are still searching for loved ones while they also battle to survive, days after Hurricane Melissa made this Jamaican port city ground zero of the devastation seen across the Caribbean.\n\nResidents here say they have been living in a state of chaos the last three days since Melissa slammed into them as one of the most powerful category five storms ever recorded in the region.\n\nThe fierce winds and storm surge that barrelled through here have decimated nearly everything, leaving roads unusable and a trail of destruction that has them increasingly desperate and isolated with no electricity or running water.\n\nCapsized boats lie kerbside. Brick buildings are split in half. Giant sheets of metal are twisted between tree branches. Vehicles sit in crumbled pieces.\n\nResidents who spoke to the BBC said they have seen no aid trucks in the area so far and described having to eat what food they can find in debris by the roads in the coastal town, nearly 150km (93 miles) west of the capital, Kingston.\n\nOthers made their way inside battered supermarkets, taking what they could for themselves. Some, who climbed on top of one partially destroyed market, tossed food and bottles of water down below, where people gathered with arms outstretched.\n\n\"We have to use whatever we see here, on the street and also in the supermarket,\" Demar Walker explained, sitting in a shaded area down the street from the store to escape the heat and 80% humidity.\n\nHe said he and others had to climb into the market due to its roof caving in and took what they could. They tossed water and items to others also in need.\n\n\"We didn't be selfish, we had to throw food to other people.\"\n\nNearby, others told the BBC of a local pharmacy being looted in Black River, describing anarchy as people ran in and out carrying armfuls of drugs and alcohol.\n\n\"I saw items covered in mud being hauled out,\" Aldwayne Tomlinson told the BBC. \"At first, I thought the place was still open, but then I really got a second glance.\n\n\"I heard a lady say: 'Mi need go get some alcohol.' That's when I knew they were looting the pharmacy as well.\"\n\nJust down the road, a woman standing atop a pile of debris describes the situation there as \"chaos, chaos. Total. No food. No water\".\n\n\"We don't have access to money. We need help. No help has come,\" Chegun Braham continued.\n\nOne couple told the BBC that they owned multiple stores in the area, several of which they said had been looted. They are now standing guard outside one of their stores in the hope of preventing future thefts.\n\nA short walk from the market, Jimmy Esson leaned against a massive metal beam that had been knocked to the ground.\n\n\"I lost everything, all my things,\" he said. \"We need food. We have no food.\"\n\nSurvival is the primary concern on most people's minds here. The other is the rising death toll. Officials in Jamaica said on Thursday that at least 19 people had died in the country, a big jump from the five that had been counted the day before. Another 30 have died in neighbouring Haiti due to the storm.\n\n\"My community, we have dead bodies there,\" Mr Walker said.\n\nHe said he, like many others in the area, still has not heard from family and doesn't know if they made it out of the storm alive. Mr Walker is stuck in Black River, sleeping in whoever's house is still standing that will accept him, he says, while his eight-year-old son is in Westmoreland, the next parish over.\n\nWestmoreland shares Jamaica's western coast, along with Black River in the St Elizabeth parish, and was also severely damaged by Melissa.\n\n\"There's no way of getting to my family to find out if they're OK,\" he said as his eyes began to swell. Along with the unusable roads making travel difficult, there is little to no cell phone service and no electricity or running water in many hard-hit spots.\n\n\"The entire town of Black River is devastated,\" the town's Mayor Richard Solomon has said.\n\nHe noted to local media the desperation of residents who are looting and - while not condoning it - said he understood why it was happening.\n\n\"It is a delicate balance,\" Solomon said of the response to it. \"Persons are seizing the opportunity to pick up what they can off the ground [from damaged stores]. However, you have others being a little bit more forceful, where they are trying to get into people's properties to get all sorts of supplies.\"\n\nLocal officials estimate that 90% of the houses here were destroyed. Much of the town's vital infrastructure has been destroyed too, including the local hospital, police station and fire station.\n\n\"There are entire communities that seem to be marooned and areas that seem to be flattened,\" Information Minister Dana Morris Dixon said.\n\nAid supplies are starting to arrive more rapidly to the main airport in Kingston, but smaller regional airports - some of which are located near where humanitarian assistance is most needed - remain only partly operational.\n\nAid agencies and the military are bringing in the urgently needed supplies from Kingston by land but many roads remain unpassable in places, including in places like Black River.\n\nThe town is about a two-hour drive from Kingston but the main road in is - at various points - flooded, damaged and clogged with cars.\n\nMichael Tharkurdeen, a local medic, was in the town's fire station when the storm hit.\n\n\"We were upstairs, the entire bottom floor was flooded. The water was around maybe four feet going five feet. When the water came in, the seas came in, flooded everywhere,\" he said.\n\n\"Nobody could be on the bottom floor. Trust me, there were waves there about this high,\" he added, pointing to his shoulder.\n\nPeople who did make it to him from the flooded-out buildings nearby arrived in bad condition. They had \"lacerations on their hands, their feet\", he says. \"Kids, elders, everybody.\"\n\nMr Tharkurdee also found a man \"lifeless\" and with \"no pulse\" once the flood waters receded.\n\n\"I'm not a doctor, I'm a medic, so I couldn't pronounce him dead,\" he said. \"All we could have done was document that and cover his body.\"\n\nBy mid-afternoon on Friday, a fleet of military helicopters flew into Black River - with many hoping they came with desperately needed supplies.\n\nArmed officials carrying machine guns descended onto the streets and soon the crowds rummaging the looted pharmacy and grocery store had cleared. A line of cars that had jammed the sole road in the area had been cleared.\n\nA relative quiet replaced the noise and chaos of hundreds of people fighting for their survival.\n\n\"St Elizabeth, we want it to come back again,\" Shawn Morris said of the area's future and his hopes to get aid here.\n\n\"It's not about the money,\" he said. \"We need food and water.\""},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/23/tropical-storm-melissa-takes-aim-at-caribbean-islands-on-alert","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"06:29:43+00:00","title":"Tropical Storm Melissa takes aim at Caribbean, islands on alert","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tropical Storm Melissa, the 13th named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, is threatening the Caribbean with heavy rainfall and flooding, particularly in Jamaica, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Aruba, and Puerto Rico.

the titles and privileges of the former Prince Andrew have been completely removed.\n\nThere are no modern precedents for such a colossal loss of royal status.\n\nUnlike the previous statement on his future, this was from Buckingham Palace rather than Andrew himself.\n\nIt's a ripping off the bandage moment, which the Palace will hope will finally draw a line under the endless oil slick of bad news stories about Andrew.\n\nThe sliver of dignity given to him, that he was voluntarily choosing not to use his titles, has been taken away.\n\nTitles such as Duke of York, the Earl of Inverness and Baron Killyleagh will be forcibly removed.\n\nAll that remains is his place in the line of succession, and new guidance from the House of Commons Library has shown that too could be removed by Parliament, if Commonwealth realms give their consent.\n\nAfter more than a year of pressure, the so-called Siege of Royal Lodge is over, with Andrew losing his independent lease and moving to the King's estate in Sandringham. It's not revealed where exactly, but it's not Wood Farm.\n\nSandringham is privately owned by the King, ending any reliance on a Crown Estate property.\n\nHis ex-wife Sarah Ferguson is said to be making her own separate arrangements, not currently expected to be with Andrew in Norfolk.\n\nIt makes Andrew dependent on the King for his home and his money. And also it has to be said, a duty of care for his brother's welfare.\n\nThis announcement might head off the immediate threat of Parliament taking matters into its own hands and voting to strip Andrew of his titles. MPs had become increasingly vocal about debating the scandal and the Public Accounts Committee had been flexing its muscles over protecting public funding.\n\nBut it's going to be much harder for the Palace to settle an authentic feeling of public outrage. The sense of unchecked privilege surrounding Andrew has genuinely irritated the public and it will take more than taking away his titles to dispel the sense of ugly entitlement.\n\nPolling by YouGov published on Thursday showed Andrew now has the worst ever popularity ratings for a royal, with 91% holding a negative view of him.\n\nAnd the King heard that unhappiness first hand from a heckler in Lichfield this week, who shouted: \"How long have you known about Andrew and Epstein?\"\n\nFor the Palace, there will be questions about why such longstanding problems around Andrew weren't dealt with before now. So much of this has been known for so many years - the unsuitable business links, the unexplained funding, the connections with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The cast list changes - alleged Chinese spies or dictators' wealthy relatives - but the story has remained the same.\n\nThe unsavoury link with Epstein was being widely discussed 14 years ago when Andrew was stripped of his role as trade representative.\n\nAndrew has been losing jobs but continuing to live in a royal style for many years now and it's stretched public patience. It felt arrogant and out of touch.\n\nA few clicks on Google will find decades of stories raising doubts about his suitability, often accompanied by pictures of Andrew in a top hat, like a renegade Monopoly piece.\n\nThere might be some public fatigue around this Andrew story. People might feel they've heard enough and are sick of it. But there was also an angry public mood that expected a clearer sense of accountability.\n\nWhat remains to be seen now is whether a wider can of worms has been opened.\n\nWho knew what and when at the Palace about Andrew and Epstein? Do we need more transparency around royal property and finance? How many houses do they have up their sleeve in Windsor? And what fresh scandals about Andrew could still emerge?\n\nBut this scorched earth approach to Andrew's future might also show an unexpectedly steely side to the King.\n\nWhile other members of the Royal Family were part of the decision, including Prince William, it's understood that it was the King who made this big call on his brother's future. Whatever the grandstanding of pundits, it can't have been an easy decision.\n\nThere seemed to have been an irrevocable change of attitude when  an email from Andrew to Epstein emerged,  showing their continued contact. It seemed to destroy Andrew's promises in the Newsnight interview to have cut ties.\n\nIt no longer seemed tenable that Andrew should have the honour of being a prince and living in some splendour among the royals in Windsor.\n\nInstead the King highlighted the victims of abuse, whose stories lie at the dark heart of Epstein's circle.\n\nIt's not long since Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, was grinning on the Buckingham Palace balcony, waving to the crowds. He'll wake up tomorrow morning for the first time in his life as Mr Mountbatten Windsor, private citizen.\n\nSign up here to get the latest royal stories and analysis  every week with our Royal Watch newsletter.

Cuba after killing dozens in Haiti, Jamaica\n\nHurricane Melissa is pummeling the Caribbean island of Cuba after it first caused devastation in Haiti and Jamaica, leading to the deaths of at least 32 people.\n\nTwenty of the reported deaths on Wednesday came after a river burst its banks in the southern coastal Haitian town of Petit-Goave, flooding and collapsing dozens of homes.\n\nThe mayor of the town, Jean Bertrand Subreme, said that people were still trapped under the rubble of their homes.\n\n“I am overwhelmed by the situation,” Subreme said, as he pleaded for help from the government.\n\nThree other deaths were reported from Melissa in Haiti. Eight people were killed in Jamaica, including a baby killed after a tree fell in the western side of the island, according to State Minister Abka Fitz-Henley. One person was also reported to have been killed in the Dominican Republic.\n\nThe storm was one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record when it hit Jamaica on Tuesday, according to the US National Hurricane Center.\n\nAs it crossed Cuba on Wednesday, it weakened to a Category 2 storm from its previous Category 5 classification. It is projected to move into the Bahamas later on Wednesday, where dozens of people have been evacuated from the south east of the archipelago.\n\nJamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness had declared Jamaica a “disaster area” after Hurricane Melissa barrelled across the island.\n\nThe hurricane ripped off the roofs of homes, inundated Jamaica’s “bread basket”, and felled power lines and trees, leaving most of its 2.8 million people without electricity.\n\n“It’s not going to be an easy road, Jamaica,” said Desmond McKenzie, deputy chairman of Jamaica’s Disaster Risk Management Council. “I know persons … are wondering what their futures are going to be like.”\n\nMelissa took hours to cross over Jamaica, a passage over land that diminished its winds, before it ramped back up as it  continued  towards Cuba.\n\nThe governor of Cuba’s Granma, Yanetsy Terry Gutierrez, said that parts of the province, including in the provincial capital Jiguani, were “under water”.\n\nOfficials in Cuba have also reported collapsed houses, blocked mountain roads, and roofs blown off.\n\nThe Jamaican government had lifted the tropical storm warning by Wednesday, but officials are struggling to assess the damage.\n\n“There’s a total communications blockout on that side,” said Richard Thompson, the acting director general of Jamaica’s Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management, referring to the south and southwest of the island.\n\nMcKenzie said that four hospitals had been damaged and one was left without power, forcing the evacuation of 75 patients.\n\nHeavy damage was also reported in Clarendon, in Jamaica’s south, and Saint Elizabeth, in the southwest, where a landslide blocked main roads in the town of Santa Cruz, and winds ripped off part of the roof of a school used as a shelter.\n\n“I never saw anything like this before in all my years living here,” said one resident of the town, Jennifer Small.\n\n“The entire hillside came down last night,” said another, Robert James.\n\nPrime Minister Holness said on Tuesday that his government was mobilising quickly to start relief and recovery efforts by Wednesday morning.\n\nEven before Melissa slammed into Jamaica, seven deaths – three in Jamaica, three in Haiti and one in the Dominican Republic – were caused by the hurricane.\n\nA roof was completely torn off a building at a section of the Savanna La Mar Public General Hospital due to the passage of Hurricane Melissa.

So many homes, so many people have been displaced,” she said.\n\n“We did prepare, but there wasn’t much that we could have done.”\n\nTrout Hall Rd,  Clarendon #TrackingMelissa   #HurricaneMelissa   #Jamaica   @CVMTV   pic.twitter.com/bTop93pOvp\n\n— Giovanni R. Dennis (@GiovanniRDennis)  October 28, 2025\n\nIn Kingston, Lisa Sangster, a 30-year-old communications specialist, said her home was devastated by the storm.\n\n“My sister … explained that parts of our roof were blown off and other parts caved in and the entire house was flooded,” she told the AFP news agency. “Outside structures like our outdoor kitchen, dog kennel and farm animal pens were also gone, destroyed.”\n\nMathue Tapper, 31, told AFP that those in the capital were “lucky”, but he feared for people in Jamaica’s more rural areas.\n\n“My heart goes out to the folks living on the western end of the island,” he said.\n\nAlthough Jamaica and Cuba are used to hurricanes,  climate change  is making the storms more severe.\n\nBritish-Jamaican climate change activist and author Mikaela Loach said in a video shared on social media that Melissa “gained energy from the extremely and unnaturally  hot seas  in the Caribbean”.\n\n“These sea temperatures are not natural,” Loach said. “They’re extremely hot because of the gases that have resulted from burning fossil fuels.”\n\n“Countries like Jamaica, countries that are most vulnerable to climate disaster, are also countries that have had their wealth and resources stripped away from them through colonial bondage,” Loach added.\n\nSpeaking at the United Nations General Assembly in September, Holness urged wealthy countries to increase climate financing to assist countries like Jamaica with adapting to the effects of a warming world.\n\n“Climate change is not a distant threat or an academic consideration. It is a daily reality for small island developing states like Jamaica,” he said.\n\nJamaica is responsible for just 0.02 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, which cause global warming, according to data from the World Resources Institute.\n\nBut like other tropical islands, it is expected to continue to bear the brunt of worsening climate effects."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyk1nq6v4lo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"01:02:54.391+00:00","title":"Sudan war: A boy's escape from el-Fasher amid accusations of spying","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 12-year-old boy named Abdiwahab escaped the besieged city of el-Fasher in Sudan after fleeing violence from the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), describing being assaulted multiple times and falsely accused of espionage.

as he escaped from the western Sudanese city of el-Fasher.\n\nThe young boy left el-Fasher on Sunday as it fell to the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), the paramilitary group that has been fighting a two-and-a-half-year civil war against the army.\n\nIn a video received by the BBC, his face reflects deep sorrow and fatigue, his voice low as he describes being assaulted \"many times\" by RSF fighters.\n\nFearing reprisal attacks from RSF fighters, Abdiwahab had joined a wave of people - including some of his family - trying to get out.\n\nThe UN estimates that 60,000 have managed to get out of el-Fasher with many narrating horrendous stories of atrocities, including rape.\n\nAfter three days of walking Abdiwahab reached the relative safety of Tawila - an 80km (50-mile) journey - but he arrived on his own.\n\n''I left the city with my father and siblings but because of the chaos we were separated, I came to Tawila alone,\" he says on the video.\n\nHe was assaulted on the way and accused of being involved in espionage.\n\n\"I walked along the road, and on the road, [the RSF] caught me, many times. They beat me and hit me, saying, 'this little boy is a spy'.\"\n\nThis chimes with other accounts of how men and boys are especially at risk as they face arbitrary arrest, violence and summary execution.\n\nAbdiwahab says that RSF fighters had already taken his mother and one of his sisters about a month ago, and he does not know if they are still alive.\n\nAli, not his real name, who is now a volunteer aid worker after fleeing el-Fasher himself a fortnight ago, was the one who filmed Abdiwahab's account.\n\nHe is stationed at the entrance to Tawila where a temporary camp has been established and where new arrivals gather before being relocated to permanent camps inside the town.\n\nIn a voice note to the BBC explaining the context, Ali's words were almost drowned out by the noise and chaos at the camp.\n\n\"[Abdiwahab] keeps asking me about his parents. I decided to take him home until we found them,\" Ali says.\n\nHe noticed how the boy was traumatised, fearing that any light appearing at night was an RSF vehicle coming to get him.\n\n\"He saw a light in the distance and held me tight, screaming. He froze.\"\n\nAli says each new arrival to the camp carries a story of survival and despair.\n\nThere are many unaccompanied minors, including children who lost their parents on the road, coming in every day.\n\n\"Just yesterday, twin children around 10 years old arrived with a woman who said their parents had died on the way,\" the volunteer aid worker says.\n\n\"The situation is terrifying. People continue arriving with many conditions, some with injuries and malnutrition. Those who arrived are begging us to go and save the people on the road, because many are dying trying to come to Tawila,\" Ali says.\n\nSurvivors spoke of \"passing dead bodies scattered along the road and hearing the cries of the wounded calling for help\".\n\nBut even relief work has become deadly.\n\nAli says the organisations operating in Tawila are afraid to leave the town after five Red Crescent volunteers were killed in another state earlier this week.\n\n\"They are waiting for assurances and confirmation that the situation is safe,\" he says.\n\nMany mothers arriving in Tawila are in desperate need of food, water and medical help, according to the charity Save the Children.\n\nSome women reported being attacked by armed men on motorbikes and robbed as they fled.\n\n\"Women who managed to escape with their children as fighting raged made it to Tawila without food or water. They are now entirely dependent on already stretched humanitarian assistance,\" the aid agency said in a statement.\n\nThe UN's refugee agency has said it was struggling to find enough shelter and food for civilians seeking refuge in the town.\n\nBut not everyone is making it out of el-Fasher, where there have been reports of mass killings.\n\nThis week, RSF leader Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo admitted to \"violations\" in the city and said they would be investigated. A senior UN official has said that the RSF had given notice that they had arrested some suspects.\n\nEstimates vary as to how many civilians are still strapped in the city.\n\nSave the Children puts it at more than 260,000 people, including an estimated 130,000 children, who have to contend with famine-like conditions, the collapse of health services and no safe route out.\n\nGo to  BBCAfrica.com  for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter  @BBCAfrica , on Facebook at  BBC Africa  or on Instagram at  bbcafrica"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gpwn5v072o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"04:58:44.661+00:00","title":"Halloween 2025 party: Heidi Klum's party, Demi Lovato and Megan Thee Stallion","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reports on the 2025 Halloween party hosted by Heidi Klum, highlighting the elaborate and diverse costumes worn by celebrities such as Demi Lovato, Megan Thee Stallion, Ice-T, Coco Austin, James Charles, Darren Criss, Ilona Maher, and others.

scariest night of the year and, while everyone in Hollywood and beyond has been showing off their elaborate costumes, there is one party we're all watching.\n\nHeidi Klum has cemented her place as the official Queen of spooky season thanks to her wild, weird and wonderful costumes and her annual bash that attracts celebrities across the globe.\n\nShe had kept fans on their toes all day, dropping snippets of her costume on Instagram in the lead up to her party - despite being one of the last arrivals of the night - and she did not disappoint.\n\nFollowing her notorious worm and peacock costumes in recent years, the Project Runway star took her animal theme to new levels as a bright green, and pretty hideous, Medusa.\n\nShe slithered up the carpet with several moving snakes protruding from her intricate headpiece, sticking her vile tongue out at the waiting photographers.\n\nAlthough she warned fans that her costume would be \"very ugly\", this probably isn't what anyone expected.\n\nHeidi collaborated with Oscar-nominated make-up artist Mike Marino once again to pull off her costume, with a team of more than 35 people working hard to ensure she had all eyes on her.\n\nAs the festivities continue, here is a look at some of the most impressive outfits at Heidiween 2025 and beyond.\n\nBut it's not all about Hollywood (or Heidiwood). Even politicians are getting in on the action, including President Trump, who is hosting a party at his Florida home.\n\nLike Heidi, her husband Tom Kaulitz, is never one to shy away from playing dress up.\n\nHe was by her side arriving to the party as a man who was unfortunately turned to stone after looking directly at Medusa.\n\nThe Tokio Hotel musician committed to the bit by posing with his weapon and shield raised, suggesting Medusa's appearance caught him by surprise moments before his demise.\n\nIce-T and Coco Austin have never shied away from going all out for Halloween, and are regulars at Heidi's annual bash. This year was no different as the rapper looked menacing in a red hooded jumpsuit, hiding his face with a blood-splattered white mask. He had a selection of weapons on hand to make his costume truly terrifying.\n\nModel Coco also got the horror memo in a bright red wig and denim bodysuit, with Chucky's tagline: \"Wanna play?\" scrawled across the front, layered on top of a striped, long-sleeved turtleneck top.\n\nYouTuber James Charles carried his own head as he made his way into the party, reminiscent of Jared Leto's red carpet arrival at the 2019 Met Gala.\n\nThe beauty vlogger put his own spin on things as a \"headless horseman\" and even filmed a make-up tutorial on Instagram for his unique accessory.\n\nDarren Criss may have taken some inspiration from his host as he donned a Shrek costume, including bright green face paint, a prosthetic nose and huge stomach, which he patted in front of the cameras.\n\nNot quite as epic as when Heidi did the same in 2018, the Glee star switched his efforts up with tartan red trousers alongside wife Mia Swier - who chose not to be his Princess Fiona, but instead Puss in Boots, complete with a black cape and a hair thong.\n\nOlympian Ilona Maher was a real-life vintage Barbie at Klum's Halloween party, modelling a strapless sparkly custom black Undone by Kate gown. She accessorized simply with black opera gloves and a chunky gold necklace.\n\nUnveiling her outfit on Instagram, the rugby player proudly posed with her very own Barbie doll, as well as a handkerchief emblazoned with the phrase: \"Beast. Beauty. Brains. Barbie.\"\n\nNot every costume has gone down well, with some saying that US model Julia Fox's costume as a blood-soaked Jackie Kennedy was in poor taste.\n\nOthers have been more popular.\n\nSinger  Demi Lovato recreated her \"Poot Lovato\" meme  which went viral on Tumblr in 2015 - a reference to her alter-ego who has been locked in a basement.\n\nOther highlights on social media include Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's daughter North West and her friends dressing up  as Japanese kawaii-metal band BABYMETAL.\n\nMaria Carey also went for Japanese theme, with hot pink hair and a frilly pastel blue dress,  and posting \"Happy Halloween from Japan\" in a photo with her two twin children .\n\nRapper Megan Thee Stallion opted for portraying  Choso from the Manga series Jujutsu Kaisen.\n\nSinger Jade, formerly of girl group Little Mix,  dressed up as Greta from the Gremlins , while the  Cat in the Hat's famous aesthetic was recreated  by singer Janelle Monae.\n\nElsewhere, Paris Hilton recreated the  famous look from Britney Spears's music video  for Oops!... I Did It Again.\n\nActress Keke Palmer channelled her inner rapper by  dressing up as Snoop Dogg  (and lip-synching to his music).\n\nActress and BLACKPINK member Lisa  looked dazzling as The Golden Woman  from the animated series Love, Death + Robots.\n\nKourtney Kardashian Barker is famously a big Halloween fan, with this year's costume serving as  a nod to the Bride of Frankenstein.\n\nLizzo, who dressed up as a weight loss drug last year, called Halloween \"so cheesy\"  as she dressed this year as a mozzarella stick , complete with an oozing cheese dress and boots.\n\nContent creator and media personality Amelia Dimoldenberg never takes the easy option when it comes to dressing up for Halloween and this  devilish costume certainly looks like it required some effort.\n\nThe night earlier, on the eve of Halloween, she went to a party in New York as the divorce of singer Lily Allen and Stranger Things actor David Harbour. Dressed as Harbour's sheriff character, she listened to the latest Allen album, which references their breakup.\n\nAnd singer Ed Sheeran  dressed up as Pennywise the clown,  Stephen King's character from It.\n\nMeanwhile, US Vice-President JD Vance wore a wig as he became the bizarre meme-version of himself. That same meme is alleged to have gotten  a Norwegian tourist banned from the US  earlier this year."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly44qwgnx0o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"05:31:42.696+00:00","title":"China to loosen chip export ban to Europe following Netherlands row","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"China has announced a relaxation of its chip export ban on completed Nexperia chips to Europe, following the Netherlands' controversial takeover of the Chinese-owned chipmaker under Cold War-era laws.

over Nexperia - a Chinese-owned chipmaker based in the Netherlands.\n\nIn September, the Netherlands used  a Cold War era law  to take over the company after citing \"serious governance shortcomings\" and to prevent the chips from becoming unavailable in an emergency.\n\nIn response, China said it would not re-export completed Nexperia chips to Europe which raised concern among carmakers.

However, it has not specified what that could entail.\n\nIt also went on to criticise the Hague for what it called \"improper interference in the internal affairs of enterprises\" and blamed it for \"the current disruption of global production and supply chains\".\n\nThe Dutch-controlled firm told customers it would stop sending chips back to China to be processed, according to a letter this week seen by the Reuters news agency.\n\nLast month, the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA) had warned Nexperia chip supplies would only last a few weeks unless the Chinese ban was lifted.\n\n\"Without these chips, European automotive suppliers cannot build the parts and components needed to supply vehicle manufacturers and this therefore threatens production stoppages,\" the group said.\n\nThe latest plans by Beijing to relax its export controls have emerged after Donald Trump and Xi Jinping met in South Korea earlier this week.\n\nTrump later said the leaders  discussed chips , while Beijing's post-meeting readout did not explicitly mention any area of trade.\n\nThe White House is expected to release a fact sheet later today detailing its new trade agreement with China. Reuters reports that it will also announce the resumption of Nexperia exports.\n\nIn December 2024, the US government placed Wingtech on its so-called \"entity list\", identifying the company as a national security concern.\n\nIn the UK, Nexperia was forced to sell its silicon chip plant in Newport, after MPs and ministers expressed national security concerns.

The men jailed for vandalism in French hybrid warfare case\n\nThis week's trial of three undercover operatives, accused of helping the Kremlin to wage a hybrid warfare campaign to \"destabilise\" France, sounds like a surefire recipe for drama, sophistication, and intrigue.\n\nIf only.\n\nOver the course of three days, in a spacious, pine-panelled courtroom on the northern edge of Paris, the case against three seemingly unremarkable Bulgarian men, seated behind glass and shadowed by three police officers who seemed absorbed with their own mobile phones, unfolded with all the panache and excitement of a half-whispered lecture in a library.\n\n\"I had absolutely no idea where we were.\"\n\n\"I did it for the money.\"\n\n\"In the future I plan to get involved in charity work.\"\n\nThese few lines from the men's testimony may help convey the general tone.\n\nAll three were jailed on Friday for two to four years.\n\nBut to bemoan the barely audible banality of it all – the dull motives, the mumbled attempts to shift blame, the sullen complaints about prison life and unsatisfactory psychiatric evaluations - is to miss the truth.\n\nThe banality is the whole point.\n\nLike the cheap drones that both Russia and Ukraine now use to patrol their front lines, the three men on trial in courtroom 2.01 at the Palais de Justice in Paris represent a low-budget evolution of modern hybrid warfare.\n\nImprovised and startlingly effective.\n\nRising in turn inside their glass cage, Georgi Filipov, Nikolay Ivanov and Kiril Milushev admitted carrying out the acts, but denied working for a foreign power as well as antisemitism.\n\nEarly one morning in May 2024, on the banks of the River Seine in the heart of Paris, the three men conspired to spray red paint - and filmed themselves doing so - on the Wall of the Righteous, a monument to those who saved French Jews from the Holocaust during World War Two.\n\nThirty-five red handprints were left on the Shoah memorial. Five hundred more were painted elsewhere.\n\nIt was the first in a series of symbolic attacks in France: pigs' heads placed outside mosques (an act blamed on a group of Serbians); coffins left ominously by the Eiffel Tower; Stars of David painted around the capital.\n\nNews of each event was swiftly broadcast around the world – not just by regular media outlets, but by the automated army of Russian social media trolls which, according to the French agency monitoring such activity, routinely seeks to weaponise each sliver of news that might raise doubts about the stability of French society, and the strength of Europe's democracies, its institutions, and its values.\n\nFrance is seen as a particularly tempting target for the Kremlin, given its current political and social divisions, its often ambiguous attitude to Nato, its large Muslim and Jewish populations, the increasing popularity of the far right, and a history of close ties to Moscow on both extremes of the political spectrum.\n\nIn another era, the Kremlin might have used its own deep undercover agents to carry out acts of sabotage or vandalism.\n\nBut – to make the drone warfare comparison again – why rely solely on valuable assets like highly trained spies, giant ballistic missiles, or submarines used to cut undersea cables, when for a few thousand euros you can, through discreet and easily deniable channels, recruit your own disaffected army of petty criminals, or unemployed wannabe fascists?\n\n\"I had absolutely no idea where we were,\" said Georgi Filipov, as he tried to play down his alleged role in the \"red hands\" operation, arguing that he had travelled from Bulgaria simply to make a little money to help with child support payments for his nine-year-old son.\n\nHe was allegedly paid €1,000 (£875) plus travel expenses.\n\nIn the dock, Filipov, 36, cut a gaunt but muscular figure, twitching slightly like a boxer before a fight as he attempted to defuse awkward questions about his tattoos. In particular, the swastika on his chest and the social media photos showing him giving a Nazi salute and wearing a t-shirt that claimed Hitler \"was right\".\n\n\"I made bad choices in the past,\" Filipov explained, and pointed out that he had already removed several tattoos.\n\nThe Paris criminal court sentenced him to two years in jail.\n\nHaving been successfully extradited from Bulgaria and Croatia to face trial in France, the men all sought to place the blame on a fourth man, Mircho Angelov, who remains at large but is alleged to have links to a Russian intelligence officer. He was given a three-year term in absentia.\n\nThe second defendant, Kiril Milushev, 28, said he had only come to France because he had broken up with his partner, was struggling with a bipolar disorder, and wanted to keep his friend, Mircho, company. He was given two years.\n\nSeated beside Milushev, Nikolay Ivanov creased his forehead as he denied any links with Russia.\n\nHe spoke of his grandparents' role in saving Jews during World War Two and said his ambition now was to obtain a master's degree in law, and to be reunited with his girlfriend - if she'd still have him, when all this was over.\n\nConsidered the mastermind behind the plot, he was given the heaviest jail term of four years.\n\nAs for Russia's alleged role in the red-hands affair, even the defence lawyers openly admitted that \"we suspect\" Moscow's hand.\n\nBut they insisted, as did their clients, that they were unwitting pawns, proxies – one might even say \"drones\" – in a shadow war against the West."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2ww0e0jewo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"06:47:50.488+00:00","title":"Tanzania election: Samia Suluhu Hassan wins 98% of vote amid unrest","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tanzania's President Samia Suluhu Hassan has been declared the winner of the presidential election with 98% of the vote, amid widespread unrest and allegations of fraud.

Ancient World - the Great Pyramid of Khufu at Giza - Egypt is officially opening what it intends as a cultural highlight of the modern age.\n\nThe Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM), described as the world's largest archaeological museum, is packed with some 100,000 artefacts covering some seven millennia of the country's history from pre-dynastic times to the Greek and Roman eras.\n\nProminent Egyptologists argue that its establishment strengthens their demand for key Egyptian antiquities held in other countries to be returned – including the famed Rosetta Stone displayed at the British Museum.\n\nA main draw of the GEM will be the entire contents of the intact tomb of the boy king Tutankhamun, displayed together for the first time since it was found by British Egyptologist Howard Carter. They include Tutankhamun's spectacular gold mask, throne and chariots.\n\n\"I had to think, how can we show him in a different way, because since the discovery of the tomb in 1922, about 1,800 pieces from a total of over 5,500 that were inside the tomb were on display,\" says Dr Tarek Tawfik, president of the International Association of Egyptologists and former head of the GEM.\n\n\"I had the idea of displaying the complete tomb, which means nothing remains in storage, nothing remains in other museums, and you get to have the complete experience, the way Howard Carter had it over a hundred years ago.\"\n\nCosting some $1.2bn (£910m; €1.1bn), the vast museum complex is expected to attract up to 8m visitors a year, giving a huge boost to Egyptian tourism which has been hit by regional crises.\n\n\"We hope the Grand Egyptian Museum will usher in a new golden age of Egyptology and cultural tourism,\" says Ahmed Seddik, a guide and aspiring Egyptologist by the pyramids on the Giza Plateau.\n\nApart from the Tutankhamun exhibit and a new display of the spectacular, 4,500-year-old funerary boat of Khufu - one of the oldest and best-preserved vessels from antiquity - most of the galleries at the site have been opened to the public since last year.\n\n\"I've been organising so many tours to the museum even though it was partially open,\" Ahmed continues. \"Now it will be at the pinnacle of its glory. When the Tutankhamun collection opens, then you can imagine the whole world will come back, because this is an iconic Pharoah, the most famous king of all antiquity.\"\n\n\"It's an absolute must-see,\" says Spanish tourist, Raúl, who is awaiting the full public opening on 4 November.\n\n\"We're just waiting to go and check out all of the Egyptian artefacts,\" says Sam from London, who is on an Egypt tour. \"It's a once in a lifetime opportunity.\"\n\nAnother British tourist says she previously saw the Tutankhamun exhibits on display at the neoclassical Egyptian Museum in bustling Tahrir Square.\n\n\"The old museum was pretty chaotic, and it was a bit confusing,\" she comments. \"Hopefully the Grand Museum will be a lot easier to take in and I think you will just get more out of it.\"\n\nThe new museum is colossal, spanning 500,000 square metres (5.4m sq ft) – about the size of 70 football pitches. The exterior is covered in hieroglyphs and translucent alabaster cut into triangles with a pyramid shaped entrance.\n\nAmong the GEM showstoppers are a 3,200-year-old, 16m-long suspended obelisk of the powerful pharaoh, Ramesses II, and his massive 11m-high statue. The imposing statue was moved from close to the Cairo railway station in 2006, in a complex operation in preparation for the new institution.\n\nA giant staircase is lined with the statues of other ancient kings and queens and on an upper floor a huge window offers a perfectly framed view of the Giza pyramids.\n\nThe museum was first proposed in 1992, during the rule of President Hosni Mubarak, and construction began in 2005.  It has now taken nearly as long to complete as the Great Pyramid, according to estimates.\n\nThe project was hit by financial crises, the 2011 Arab Spring – which deposed Mubarak and led to years of turmoil - the Covid-19 pandemic, and regional wars.\n\n\"It was my dream. I'm really happy to see this museum is finally opened!\" Dr Zahi Hawass, Egypt's former long-time minister of tourism and antiquities, tells the BBC. The veteran archaeologist says it shows that Egyptians are equals of foreign Egyptologists when it comes to excavations, preservation of monuments and curating museums.\n\n\"Now I want two things: number one, museums to stop buying stolen artefacts and number two, I need three objects to come back: the Rosetta Stone from the British Museum, the Zodiac from the Louvre and the Bust of Nefertiti from Berlin.\"\n\nDr Hawass has set up online petitions – attracting hundreds of thousands of signatures – calling for all three items to be repatriated.\n\nThe Rosetta Stone, found in 1799, provided the key to deciphering hieroglyphics. It was discovered by the French army and was seized by the British as war booty.  A French team cut the Dendera Zodiac, an ancient Egyptian celestial map, from the Temple of Hathor in Upper Egypt in 1821. Egypt accuses German archaeologists of smuggling the colourfully painted bust of Nefertiti, wife of Egyptian pharaoh Akhenaten, out of the country more than a century ago.\n\n\"We need the three objects to come as a good feeling from these three countries, as a gift, as Egypt gave the world many gifts,\" Dr Hawass says.\n\nAnother leading Egyptologist, Dr Monica Hanna, names the same objects, \"taken under a colonialist pretext\", as ones which must be repatriated. She adds: \"The GEM gives this message that Egypt has done its homework very well to officially ask for the objects.\"\n\nThe British Museum told the BBC that it had received \"no formal requests for either the return or the loan of the Rosetta Stone from the Egyptian Government\".\n\nEgyptian Egyptologists voice their excitement about the new museum becoming a centre for academic research, driving new discoveries.\n\nAlready, Egyptian conservators based there have painstakingly restored items belonging to Tutankhamun, including his impressive armour made of textiles and leather. According to Egyptian law, such restorations can only be done by Egyptians.\n\n\"Colleagues from around the world have been in awe of the fantastic conservation work that has been done,\" says Dr Tawfik, adding that the entire project is a source of great national pride. \"As well as ancient Egyptian history, we are also showcasing modern Egypt because it's Egypt that built this museum.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0qppe4vdevo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"18:01:15.015+00:00","title":"Sudan war: More than 60,000 flee el-Fasher after its capture by RSF militia, UN says","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Sudan is facing a deepening humanitarian crisis as more than 60,000 people flee el-Fasher after its capture by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which has been accused of widespread atrocities, including mass executions, rape, and ethnic targeting.

by starvation and heavy bombardment.\n\nThe flow of those fleeing the violence towards the town of Tawila, about 80km (50 miles) west of el-Fasher, had increased in the past few days, the UNHCR's

Ukraine war, President Vladimir Putin announced Russia had tested a new weapon.\n\n\"There is nothing like this,\" the Russian leader said of the Poseidon - a nuclear-powered, nuclear-capable underwater drone that can be fired like a torpedo and which a senior Russian MP said could \"put entire states out of operation\".\n\nWhen it was first unveiled in 2018, Russian media said the Poseidon would be able to achieve a speed of 200km/h (120mph) and travel in a \"constantly changing route\" that would make it impossible to intercept.\n\nPutin's claim came only days after the announcement that Moscow had conducted a test of its \"unlimited-range\" Burevestnik nuclear-powered cruise missile.\n\nIt's \"a unique product, unmatched in the world\", Putin said of the Burevestnik, noting the missile was so new \"we are yet to identify what it is, what class of weapons [it] belongs to\".\n\nIt is not unusual for Russia to test and flaunt weapons.\n\nAnd, despite the boisterous nature of Russian announcements, their military value is ambiguous.\n\n\"They are basically Armageddon weapons - too powerful to be used unless you're happy to destroy the world,\" Mark Galeotti, a Russia scholar and long-time observer of Russian politics, told the BBC.\n\nBoth the Poseidon and the Burevestnik are second-strike, retaliatory weapons, Mr Galeotti added - and not even the most rabid Kremlin propagandists are suggesting anyone is preparing to launch strikes on Russia.\n\nIt is also unclear whether the weapons are actually viable.\n\nIn 2019,  five Russian nuclear engineers died in a rocket engine explosion  which some Russian and Western experts said was linked to the Burevestnik.\n\nTwo years later, the International Institute of Strategic Studies (IISS) - a London-based think tank specialising in global conflict and security - noted that Russia faced \"considerable technical challenges\" in ensuring \"the reliable performance of the nuclear-propulsion unit\" of the missile.\n\nNeither the Poseidon nor the Burevestnik were entirely novel - both  had first been presented to the world in 2018  as part of a new array of weapons that Putin called \"invincible\".\n\nSo it is the timing of the announcements - rather than their contents - which could be noteworthy.\n\nAfter a whirlwind few months of tentative diplomacy by US President Donald Trump to try and bring Russia and Ukraine to the negotiating table, Trump appears to have cooled off on the endeavour to end the war.\n\nLast week, the White House cancelled a summit between Trump and Putin, apparently after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio realised the gulf between Moscow and Washington's positions was too great for a high-level meeting to achieve meaningful results.\n\nNot only is there no suggestion of any further talks, but soon after the meeting was cancelled, Trump imposed sanctions on two of Russia's biggest oil producers as punishment for Moscow's failure to agree on a peace deal in Ukraine.\n\nAnd while his relationship with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky seems to still be fraught, it appears Trump is growing irritated with Moscow's intractability.\n\nSo Putin may be vying for Trump's attention.\n\n\"In the face of Trump blowing hot and cold with his support for Ukraine or sympathy to Russia, here is an element in which Moscow has bigger cards than Kyiv,\" Mr Galeotti argued.\n\n\"So in that context [successful weapons tests] are more about keeping him thinking Russia is indeed powerful.\"\n\nAnother clue could come from the battlefield in Ukraine.\n\nThree-and-a-half years after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of its neighbour, its troops continue to merely grind on - at great cost in human life and resources - with no obvious breakthrough likely any time soon.\n\n\"We are getting towards the end of summer fighting season in Ukraine and it has not gone very well for the Russians,\" said David Heathcote, head of intelligence at McKenzie Intelligence Services.\n\nThe announcements about the Burevestnik and the Poseidon should be seen as a reflection of the weakness of their conventional forces, Mr Heathcote told the BBC.\n\nRussia is not formally part of any military alliances that would serve as a deterrent if it is on the back foot, and its army is tied up and under pressure in Ukraine.\n\nIn these cases, Mr Heathcote says, \"the Russians always react with unnecessary and overexaggerated sabre rattling\".\n\nWhile Moscow's decision to publicly announce the Burevestnik and Poseidon tests may have been influenced by this, it seems the claim has already had the tangible effect of provoking Trump into instructing its military to resume nuclear weapons testing.\n\nTrump justified the move as a way of keeping pace with other countries such as Russia and China.\n\n\"With others doing testing, I think it's appropriate that we do also,\" Trump said - although it will likely take several months for the US to restart nuclear tests after a 33-year pause.\n\nThe Kremlin's reaction to Trump's statement was quick\n\nPutin spokesman Dmitry Peskov questioned whether the US president had been correctly informed. The Russian tests \"cannot in any way be interpreted as a nuclear test\", Peskov said.\n\nTrump did not elaborate on the kind of tests he wanted the US to resume.\n\nIt was likely, said IISS Head of Strategy, Technology and Arms Control Dr Alexander Bollfrass, that Trump's decision was a direct response to the Russian test of the Burevestnik and that the US could be planning to conduct similar flight tests of US Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn09r01k9yqo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"01:25:14.868+00:00","title":"What Justin Trudeau's new era with Katy Perry tells us about his life after politics","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the unexpected romance between former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and American pop star Katy Perry, highlighting how both have faced reputational setbacks and are using the relationship as a strategic rebranding.

2025-11-01T01:25:14.868+00:00\n\nTitle: What Justin Trudeau's new era with Katy Perry tells us about his life after politics\n\nIt is a pairing that few could have predicted: a former Canadian prime minister and an American pop star who has toured the world and reached the edge of space.\n\nJustin Trudeau and Katy Perry have made it official. The couple were spotted holding hands in Paris last weekend as they left the Crazy Horse cabaret, where they had been celebrating Perry's 41st birthday.\n\nWhile they may seem an unlikely duo, Trudeau and Perry – who have both been in the spotlight for the better part of the last decade – have more in common than some might think. And their budding romance is not entirely unprecedented in Canadian political history.\n\nThe pairing also allows them to change the conversation after a year in which both have faced hits to their reputations.\n\nThe relationship is a \"rebranding for both of them in a very interesting and unexpected way\", says Jose Rodriguez, a professor of communication studies at California State University Long Beach.\n\nPartnering with a statesman creates a credible bridge for Perry into civic and philanthropic endeavours, he adds. It expands her audience and access to a politically engaged public, and global organisations outside the music industry.\n\nFor Trudeau, 53, the California Girls singer helps his new persona because she is in \"a softer arena\", Mr Rodriguez says, rather than the tough world of politics.\n\nAt the core of it is simple human connection, too, observers note. Both are newly single - Trudeau and his wife separated in 2023 - and this is the first post-split high-profile romance for both.\n\nThe romance rumours between them began swirling in late July, when the two were spotted having dinner together at Le Violon, a swanky restaurant in the heart of Montreal.\n\nTwo days later, Trudeau was spotted attending Perry's show in the city, singing along to her hits Firework and Teenage Dream.\n\nThen, in mid-October, images of them kissing aboard Perry's yacht off the coast of Santa Barbara, California, went viral.\n\nNeither Trudeau nor Perry have publicly spoken about their romance. Their representatives did not respond to the BBC's requests for comments. But before the weekend photos landed, the singer appeared to hint at the relationship during a London tour stop last month.\n\nA fan in the audience proposed to her shortly after photos of her and Trudeau canoodling surfaced.\n\n\"You know, you really should have asked me about 48 hours ago,\" Perry responded.\n\nEven though many may not have seen it coming, observers say their getting together helps serve their individual public images.\n\nAfter becoming a global progressive icon when he was catapulted into Canada's highest office in 2015, Trudeau was forced to resign earlier this year after his popularity plummeted.\n\nDespite winning a sweeping majority a decade ago - promising \"sunny ways\" domestically while being admired for his youthful charm abroad - it did not take long for scandals to tarnish his image.\n\nA series of luxury vacations drew criticism for being tone-deaf - including one trip to the private island of the Aga Khan in the Bahamas, which was found to have violated federal conflict-of-interest laws. Trudeau then faced another controversy in 2019 after old photos of him in blackface surfaced, forcing him to issue a public apology.\n\nBy the end of his tenure, Canadians had grown frustrated with his leadership and were ready to move on.\n\nPerry has similarly faced a crop of undesirable headlines after riding high for years.\n\nThe singer was enjoying the height of pop stardom in the 2010s, churning out consistent hits, and her bold, colourful style helped define pop culture. In 2018, Billboard magazine named her one of the greatest popstars of the 21st Century.\n\nBut scandal found her, too. Her newest album, 143, was panned by critics as her worst artistic effort to date. The Guardian called it \"some way short of a total catastrophe\", while the Telegraph called it \"disastrous\".\n\nAnd earlier this year, she was mocked for taking part in an all-woman Blue Origin space flight with billionaire Jeff Bezos' wife Lauren Sanchez and CBS anchor Gayle King. Perry acknowledged the criticism in April, saying \"I'm not perfect\" but that \"the internet is very much a dumping ground for the unhinged and unhealed\".\n\nThen came the split between her and Bloom, who she was with after her marriage to comedian Russell Brand fell apart in 2011.\n\n\"When you're in the middle of an unfortunate storyline, the best thing you can do is move onto a different storyline,\" notes Los Angeles Times pop music critic Mikael Wood.\n\nThe relationship with Trudeau \"changes the subject from a flop album and from a tour that seemed a little thirsty and misguided, and makes us talk about something else\".\n\nThe measured roll-out of the relationship also seemed to ease observers into the romance.\n\nProf Rodriguez notes that the optics of them appearing together in Paris was \"a high signal, low speech confirmation\" of their affection that allowed the visuals to do the work.\n\n\"Each has weathered scrutiny, so a carefully staged relationship narrative can re-index attention around vitality, optimism and cross-domain relevance.\"\n\nThe pair do have things in common.\n\nPerry and Trudeau are ideologically aligned, LA-based music writer Gerrick Kennedy observes, being \"anti-establishment\" disruptors in their respective fields.\n\nPerry herself is no stranger to activism and politics, having performed at multiple campaign events in 2016 for Democratic US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, and publicly endorsed Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.\n\nShe is a vocal advocate for LGBTQ rights and has supported various feminist charities and causes - issues that Trudeau had also publicly backed (he famously made gender-parity in cabinet central to his policy).\n\nThey also each appear to be dedicated parents to their young children. Perry's four-year-old daughter, Daisy, features frequently on her Instagram. Trudeau's Instagram shows he spent the summer taking each of his three children on separate holidays.\n\nBy dating Perry, Trudeau is charting a different path post-politics than his predecessors, who often assume high-level consulting gigs or join law firms.\n\nIt is, however, on-brand for a prime minister who was always unusual, says Michael Mulvey, a marketing professor at the University of Ottawa.\n\nAs the son of another former prime minister, Pierre Eliott Trudeau, he grew up in the spotlight. One of the earliest photos of him is of an infant Justin being held by former US First Lady Pat Nixon.\n\nAfter the separation from his wife, the youngest Trudeau could not escape the inevitable comparisons to his father, who also separated from his first wife and the mother of his children, Margaret, while in office.\n\nThe senior Trudeau had his own famous flings, namely with American singer Barbra Streisand and Canadian actress Kim Cattrall, of Sex and the City fame.\n\n\"There's no question that we see history repeating itself,\" says Jonathan Malloy, a professor of political science at Carleton University in Ottawa.\n\nBut Prof Mulvey notes that there are others who connect with his human experience of being a newly single dad.\n\nNot long after his exit from politics, Trudeau posted a photo of himself buying kitchenware, which commentators took as him signalling the start of his \"divorced dad era\".\n\n\"There are probably some people that hope he gets it together, has a cooling off period from the post-divorce trauma and gets on with his life,\" Prof Mulvey says."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2emmdnw82yo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"05:42:11.819+00:00","title":"Andrew Mountbatten Windsor will not leave Royal Lodge immediately","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, the younger brother of King Charles III, will not leave Royal Lodge immediately and may only move to Sandringham by the new year, following the King’s decision to strip him of his titles and honours.

Lodge immediately and could move to Sandringham as late as the new year, the BBC understands.\n\nOn Thursday, King Charles stripped his younger brother of his titles and honours, and moved to force him out of his Windsor mansion. He will be moving to a property on the King's Norfolk estate, paid for by the monarch.\n\nThe dramatic statement came after months of pressure over Andrew's private life, as his ties to disgraced paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein continued to dog the royals. Andrew has always denied any wrongdoing.\n\nMeanwhile, the government has said it had no plans to pass a law to formally remove Andrew from the line of succession.\n\nAndrew remains eighth in line to the throne, the only significant position he still holds - but there have been calls to bring in legislation to stop any chance of him becoming King.\n\nIt would take an act of Parliament to formally remove him which would be complex and would need to be agreed with all the Commonwealth realms, including Australia and Canada.\n\nBuckingham Palace has said Andrew's move from Royal Lodge in Windsor to Sandringham will take place \"as soon as possible and practicable\".\n\nBut according to royal sources, a delay in Andrew moving until the new year would avoid the embarrassment of him being in Sandringham at Christmas - where the Royal Family traditionally gathers for the festive season.\n\nAndrew will move to an undisclosed property on the privately-owned estate, with the accommodation funded by the King who will also make private financial provisions for his brother.\n\nSandringham was bought in 1862 by the then Prince of Wales, who later became Edward VII, as a private country retreat.\n\nThe historic, sprawling estate spans approximately 31 sq miles (80 sq km) of gardens - making it around the same size as Nottingham or Brighton and Hove.\n\nOn Friday, fresh court documents were published in the US showing that Andrew said in 2010 it would be \"good to catch up in person\" with Epstein, after the convicted sex offender was released from prison for soliciting prostitution from a minor.\n\nIn an email dated 15 April 2010, Epstein suggested the then-prince should meet American banker Jes Staley, which Andrew said he was not able to do due to his schedule.\n\n\"I have no immediate plans to drop by New York but I think I should at some stage soon,\" he told Epstein.\n\n\"I'll look and see if I can make a couple of days before the summer.\n\n\"It would be good to catch up in person.\"\n\nThe pair were later pictured together in Central Park in New York in December 2010, in a meeting that Andrew later claimed was to break off their friendship.\n\nIn an interview with BBC Newsnight, Democrat Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi called on the former Duke of York to \"come clean\" in regards to his dealings with Epstein, saying he would like to see Andrew testify before Congress.\n\nFellow Democrat Stephen Lynch echoed the sentiment, and told the BBC that Andrew's perspective \"might be helpful in getting justice for these survivors\".\n\nHe added that the House Oversight Committee would be unable to subpoena Andrew \"as the situation stands\", but urged him to consider testifying voluntarily.\n\nIt is understood the move to remove Andrew's titles was taken by the King in light of the serious lapses of judgement his brother made, and that his decision was supported by the wider Royal Family.\n\nThe public also seems to back the decision - according to a YouGov poll published on Thursday, 79% of people backed taking away the title and 53% thought the King had now done all that he could.\n\nThere were 58% who thought this response should have come sooner, with concerns that the royals had been too slow to take action over the links to Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nSir Keir Starmer also \"fully supports\" the Palace's decision, Downing Street said, and echoed Buckingham Palace's statement of support for Epstein's victims.\n\nThe controversy around Andrew has been rumbling on for years, but came to a head when he was accused by Virginia Giuffre of sexually assaulting her when she was a teenager.\n\nAndrew has strenuously denied the allegations.\n\nIn 2022 he paid millions to settle a civil case with her, despite insisting he did not remember meeting her.\n\nVirginia Giuffre's family said  she had \"brought down a prince\"  following the King's decision.\n\nHer brother Sky Roberts called for Andrew to be \"investigated\" and said the King's decision to remove his titles was \"not enough, in the sense that he's still walking around a free man\".\n\n\"I mean, let's not be naive, that he's not going to be living on the side of the road here, he's still in a very, let's say, cushy spot... He should be investigated, let's put it that way,\" he told Sky News.\n\nThe UK trade minister Chris Bryant told the BBC Andrew should, if asked, go to the US to answer questions about the crimes of Epstein.\n\n\"I think that, just as with any ordinary member of the public, if there were requests from another jurisdiction of this kind, I would expect any decently minded person to comply with that request,\" he said.\n\nGloria Allred, who has represented victims of Jeffrey Epstein, said Andrew losing his title and grand home was \"long overdue\" and \"definitely welcome\".\n\n\"This is a man who should no longer walk with honour. He should be ashamed of himself,\" the American lawyer said.\n\nMs Allred has long called for Andrew to speak to US law enforcement about his former friend Epstein \"under oath\" - something he has \"declined\" to do so far, she said.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police has previously said it is \"actively\" looking into media reports that Andrew tried to obtain personal information about his accuser Ms Giuffre through his police protection."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq6z5e5y55eo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"16:48:17.555+00:00","title":"Dutch centrist Rob Jetten claims victory over Wilders in neck-and-neck election race","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a historically close Dutch election, 38-year-old centrist liberal leader Rob Jetten has narrowly defeated anti-Islam populist Geert Wilders, winning 16.9% of the vote and securing 26 to 27 seats in the 150-seat parliament.

race\n\nCentrist liberal leader Rob Jetten has claimed victory in Wednesday's nail-biting Dutch election, after vote analysis indicated his party could not be beaten by anti-Islam populist Geert Wilders.\n\nJetten's D66 party currently has a narrow lead of 15,000 votes over Wilders' Freedom Party, and Dutch news agency ANP says even though the vote count is not complete, Wilders can no longer win.\n\n\"We are the biggest party in the Netherlands! Now we'll get to work for all Dutch people,\" Jetten posted on X.\n\nWilders said it was the electoral council not a news agency that decided the result: \"What arrogance not to wait for that.\"\n\nProjections from about 99% of the vote put both parties on 26 seats in the 150-seat parliament - but ANP says Jetten's centrists could win a 27th seat.\n\nJetten, 38, told reporters he was \"very proud of this historic result\" and now felt a great responsibility to form a stable and ambitious government.\n\nWilders had led opinion polls going into Wednesday's election, but Rob Jetten succeeded in winning in some of the main Dutch cities including Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht with a positive campaign using a catchphrase of \"Yes, we can\".\n\nNo Dutch election race has ever been so close, and if Jetten does become prime minister he will be the youngest in Dutch history.\n\nUntil now Jetten was careful not to declare victory until all votes were in, but ANP said based on figures from postal voters abroad he could now be declared the winner.\n\nWilders said even if D66 did go on to become the biggest party, his Freedom Party (PVV) would \"not let the Netherlands be broken up by Jetten and his people\".\n\nJetten told reporters that his party had \"shown to the rest of Europe and the world that it is possible to beat the populist movements if you campaign with a positive message\".\n\nThe Dutch electoral system is based on proportional representation in one nationwide constituency, so whichever party secures most votes wins most seats.\n\nJetten's liberals have so far won 16.9% of the vote, while Wilders' Freedom Party is on 16.7%. As results came in on Thursday, the race was so close that the lead flipped between the two parties.\n\nIn a sign that he was not ready to concede victory, Wilders dubbed the Dutch news agency \"ANP66\" and shared unfounded claims from social media of vote-rigging. One local authority, in Zaanstad outside Amsterdam, rejected the allegation as \"fabricated\".\n\nAlthough the D66 leader's path to forming a coalition is not straightforward, Jetten has said he wants to make a quick start.\n\nJetten said after the vote that never before had a party won a Dutch election with fewer than 30 seats.\n\nHe will need the support of at least three other parties to gather the 76 seats needed to form a coalition. The most obvious candidates would be the conservative-liberal VVD, the left-wing Labour (PvdA)-GreenLeft alliance and the Christian Democrats, but it could take months if that is to happen.\n\nVVD leader Dilan Yesilgöz has so far ruled out working with the left, but Jetten said he favoured a broad-based government from the centre of Dutch politics.\n\nThe weekend would be a good chance for all the parties to reflect, before a \"scout\" is given the task next Tuesday of sounding them out.\n\nJetten said he wanted to construct a coalition that represented best the millions of voters who had backed other parties to tackle the main issues, including the housing shortage and asylum and migration.\n\nHis path to victory has stunned observers. Less than two years ago he led D66 - a party formed by democratic reformers in 1966 - to fifth place and just nine seats.\n\nOnly a few weeks ago they were still languishing in the opinion polls, but gradually improved as Jetten put in several polished performances in TV debates and even  competed in the final of a TV quiz show 11 days before the election.\n\nOutgoing Prime Minister Dick Schoof predicted on Friday that Jetten's task of forming a coalition would prove complicated. \"I reckon I'll still be prime minister at Christmas - I'd be surprised if it happened [by then]\".\n\nSchoof, a former chief of Dutch intelligence, was picked for the top job by Geert Wilders, who abandoned his bid to lead the country last year because his prospective coalition partners would not support having a far-right prime minister.\n\nWilders won the last election in November 2023, and a government was only formed in July 2024. Eleven months later, he brought his own government down, in a row with his coalition partners over asylum and migration policy."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y44ly3vg2o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"05:29:58.808+00:00","title":"Cruise cancelled following death of woman left behind on island","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 60-day cruise around Australia operated by Coral Expeditions was abruptly cancelled after the death of 80-year-old Suzanne Rees, who was left behind on Lizard Island during a day excursion.

The ship left without her and returned several hours later after the crew realised the woman was missing.\n\nA major search operation found her body the following day.\n\nThe Australian Maritime Safety Authority (Amsa) is investigating the incident, alongside Queensland Police and the state coroner.\n\nThe CEO of the cruise operator Coral Expeditions, Mark Fifield, said on Saturday that passengers and crew on the Coral Adventurer were told on Wednesday that the remainder of the voyage had been cancelled due to the \"tragic passing of Suzanne Rees and previous mechanical issues\".\n\nHe added in a statement that passengers would be issued a full refund, and said Coral Expeditions was working \"to co-ordinate the return journeys of the passengers via chartered flights\".\n\nAmsa also released an updated statement on Saturday, saying it had \"issued a notice to the Master of Coral Adventurer\" prohibiting any new passengers from boarding the ship.\n\nThe spokesperson said that officials would attend the vessel in Cairns upon its return.\n\nThe ship initially left the north-western city on 24 October, and was just two days into the voyage at the time of the 80-year-old's death. Lizard Island was the first stop on the journey.\n\nPassengers aboard - who typically pay tens of thousands of dollars to join the cruise - were transported there for a day trip with the option of hiking or snorkelling.\n\nSuzanne Rees' daughter,  Katherine Rees, said on Thursday  that her family was \"shocked and saddened that the Coral Adventurer left Lizard Island after an organised excursion without my mum\".\n\nShe described her mother as an \"active 80-year-old\" who was a member of a bushwalking group.\n\n\"From the little we have been told, it seems that there was a failure of care and common sense.\"\n\nMs Rees added that she hoped the coroner's inquiry would be able to pinpoint what \"the company should have done that might have saved mum's life\".\n\n\"We understand from the police that it was a very hot day, and mum fell ill on the hill climb,\" she said.\n\n\"She was asked to head down, unescorted. Then the ship left, apparently without doing a passenger count.\n\n\"At some stage in that sequence, or shortly after, mum died, alone.\"\n\nEarlier this week, Mr Fifield confirmed that Coral Expeditions was \"working closely with Queensland Police and other authorities to support their investigation\".\n\nHe said that the company was \"deeply sorry that this has occurred\" and had offered its full support to the Rees family.\n\nThe Coral Adventurer caters for up to 120 guests with 46 crew, according to the company's website. It was purpose-built to access remote areas of Australia's coast and is equipped with \"tenders\" - small boats used to take passengers on day excursions.\n\nIncidents like this are rare, and cruise ships have systems to record which passengers are embarking or disembarking, Harriet Mallinson, cruise editor of travel website Sailawaze, told the BBC.\n\n\"Sneaking ashore or [back] on board just isn't an option,\" she said.\n\nCruise lines take these procedures very seriously and have \"clever tech in place to prevent such incidents from happening\", Ms Mallinson added.\n\n\"This is most likely a shocking - and tragic - one-off.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ylk9r336zo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"17:38:19.439+00:00","title":"What we know about Prince Andrew losing his titles and Royal Lodge","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Buckingham Palace has formally stripped Prince Andrew of all royal titles and honours, including Prince, Duke of York, and his associated honours, and has ordered him to vacate Royal Lodge.

losing his titles and Royal Lodge\n\nPrince Andrew has been stripped of his \"prince\" title and will leave his Windsor mansion, Royal Lodge, Buckingham Palace has announced.\n\nThe King has \"initiated a formal process\" to remove his titles, it said, and Andrew will now be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor.\n\nAndrew, 65 - the King's younger brother - has continued to face more questions about his private life in recent months.\n\nHis links to paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein have caused problems for the Royal Family. The prince, who relinquished his titles this month, has always strongly denied any wrongdoing.\n\nThe dramatic fall from grace affects not just him but his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson and their children, Beatrice and Eugenie.\n\n\"His Majesty has today initiated a formal process to remove the Style, Titles and Honours of Prince Andrew,\" Buckingham Palace  said in a statement  on Thursday evening.\n\n\"Prince Andrew will now be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor.\"\n\nIt also addressed the place where he lives, Royal Lodge.\n\n\"His lease on Royal Lodge has, to date, provided him with legal protection to continue in residence.\n\n\"Formal notice has now been served to surrender the lease and he will move to alternative private accommodation. These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him.\n\n\"Their Majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse.\"\n\nThe language of Buckingham Palace's statement was \"very brutal,\" royal historian Kelly Swaby told the BBC.\n\n\"Ordinary people don't care about the semantics, they want to see punishment, and public opinion is very much against Andrew, the Palace knows that, and the language very much reflects that\".\n\nThe decision was made, and action taken, due to serious lapses in Andrew's judgement, it is understood.\n\nIt is also understood that the wider Royal Family and the government was consulted, and made clear it supports the decision.\n\nThe BBC's former royal correspondent Jennie Bond said she thought the Prince of Wales had pushed for the recent action.\n\n\"I think this line had to be drawn and William was probably pushing for the King to do so,\" she said.\n\n\"William is about to go to Brazil on a very important tour - and the recent tour by the King and Queen to the Vatican was very nearly overshadowed by what was going on with Andrew, and that could not be allowed to continue.\"\n\nIt is understood Andrew will be relocated to the  Sandringham estate  in Norfolk, but details about his specific housing have not been released.\n\nThe wider Sandringham estate covers approximately 20,000 acres (8,100 hectares) with 600 acres (242 hectares) of gardens - and the Palace has not said which property he will stay in.\n\nIt is understood that Andrew is unlikely to move into Sandringham's Wood Farm, his late father's former home.\n\nFormal notice was given to surrender the lease at the Royal Lodge on Thursday and it is understood that Andrew's move to Sandringham will take place \"as soon as practicable\".\n\nAndrew's ex-wife Sarah Ferguson, 66, will also move out of Royal Lodge and make her own living arrangements, it is understood.\n\nShe lost her courtesy royal divorcee title as a duchess in early October, when Andrew lost the use of his Duke of York title - reverting to her maiden name.\n\nThough the public had long referred to her as \"Fergie\", royal commentator Richard Palmer  told the BBC at the time  the title change would \"no doubt\" have an impact.\n\n\"She will have lost a bit of cachet over this,\" he said. \"She certainly does use the title.\"\n\nFor their daughters - Beatrice, 37 and Eugenie, 35 - there is no formal change.\n\nThey will still be princesses because they are the daughters of the son of a sovereign - in line with King George V's Letters Patent of 1917.\n\nTheir places in the line of succession will also stay the same.\n\nAndrew remains eighth in line to the throne despite losing his titles - followed by Beatrice and Eugenie in ninth and twelfth place.\n\nBut their positions in the family are \"low down\" and will likely slip further with time, royal commentator Victoria Murphy said previously - adding that she could not see them, as non-working royals, step into official duties any time soon.\n\nThere was an \"appreciation of the fact that this scandal doesn't involve them,\" she also said, \"and it's not fair for it to impact them directly in the independent lives they are carving out for themselves\".\n\nIt is understood Andrew's accommodation will be privately funded by the King.\n\nAnd the King will make \"appropriate private provision\" for his brother as he moves out of his home.\n\nRoyal sources have previously said the King has tried to apply pressure, and last year cut off Andrew's funding.\n\nAndrew also cultivated his own independent sources of funding since leaving public life, including business connections with China, the Gulf States and a recently curtailed project with a Dutch start-up company.\n\nEarlier this week, Parliament's spending watchdog, the Public Accounts Committee wrote a letter detailing the \"considerable and understandable public interest in the spending of public money\" relating to Andrew.\n\nThe letter asked what the Crown Estate's plan was to ensure value for money in any future agreements with Andrew.\n\nAndrew is understood not to have objected to the King's decision to remove his titles.\n\nHis birth certificate does not need to be changed and the title change will not apply retrospectively.\n\nThe titles being stripped are: Prince, Duke of York, Earl of Inverness, Baron Killyleagh. And he will no longer have the right to be called His Royal Highness. The honours of Order of the Garter and Knight Grand Cross of the Victorian Order will also be removed.\n\nTo remove the titles, the King will send Royal warrants to the Lord Chancellor - who is David Lammy - to officially remove them.\n\nIt comes just weeks after Andrew voluntarily gave up his other royal titles, including the Duke of York.\n\nOn 17 October, Andrew said he would stop using the titles because the \"continued accusations about me distract from the work of His Majesty and the Royal Family\". \"I vigorously deny the accusations against me,\" he said.\n\nUntil this month, Ferguson kept the title Sarah, Duchess of York - but she reverted to her maiden name of Ferguson after Andrew was stripped of his Duke of York title.\n\nThe surname Mountbatten Windsor was created in 1960, and combines the surnames of the late Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip when they married.\n\nIn 1917, fearful of the anti-German sentiment in the UK the reigning monarch, George V, adopted the name Windsor to replace the original Germanic sounding house of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha dynasty.\n\nHe renamed the lineage Windsor, after the castle.\n\nMountbatten is an anglicised version of Battenberg. The Duke of Edinburgh's mother was Princess Alice of Battenberg, but during the First World War the family opted to change it to Mountbatten, again to avoid more anti-German sentiment.\n\nThe double-barrelled name was a concession to the Duke of Edinburgh, who was said to have complained that his children would not bear his name.\n\nAndrew is already not invited to attend royal public events, and his recent appearances have been limited to private, family events, such as funerals or memorials.\n\nThis fiasco will continue to dog the Royal Family, says historian and author Andrew Lownie.\n\n\"They're finally getting ahead of the story, but this isn't the end of it,\" Lownie told the BBC.\n\nThe Palace is \"finally taking some decisive action\" - but it \"won't completely satisfy the public disquiet\".\n\nCampaigners against the monarchy say there should be a wider investigation into what the Royal Family might have known about Prince Andrew's links to Epstein.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police has said it is \"actively\" looking into media reports that then Prince Andrew tried to obtain personal information about his accuser Virginia Giuffre through his police protection.\n\nAndrew has always denied any wrongdoing and has not faced any charges, but large sections of the media will continue digging into the case.\n\nAndrew's links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein are at the centre of this latest announcement.\n\nIn recent weeks, pressure has increased on the monarchy to resolve the issue of Charles's brother, with the King heckled earlier this week by a protester.\n\nAlthough Andrew denies the accusations, the Royal Family considers there have been \"serious lapses of judgement\" in his behaviour.\n\nEarlier this month, emails from 2011 re-emerged, showing Andrew in contact with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein months after he claimed their friendship ended.\n\nIn her posthumous memoir, Nobody's Girl Virginia Giuffre repeated allegations that, as a teenager, she was forced to have sex with Andrew on three separate occasions – claims he has always denied."},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/31/us/politics/trump-shutdown.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"20:34:49-04:00","title":"As the Shutdown Pain Grows, Trump Attends to Other Matters","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the government shutdown enters its fifth week, the pain for ordinary Americans grows, with families facing food insecurity, workers going without pay, and airports experiencing delays.

The Sovereign Grant, now £132.1 million in 2025-26, has increased due to Crown Estate profits from offshore wind farms and the completion of the £369 million Buckingham Palace modernisation. The Crown Estate, valued at £15 billion, generates profits used to fund royal duties, though the monarch cannot personally profit or sell assets. The King and Prince William receive personal income from the Duchy of Lancaster and Duchy of Cornwall, which are exempt from corporation tax and allow them to spend profits freely, though they voluntarily pay income tax. The article also highlights that public funding for royal activities has tripled since 2012, and that security costs — such as the Queen's funeral and the King’s coronation — are not covered by the Sovereign Grant and are borne by taxpayers.

dependent on his brother, King Charles III, for his home and money after being stripped of his \"prince\" title and asked to leave his mansion.\n\nThe King is understood to be funding Andrew's new accommodation himself and to be making \"appropriate private provision\" as he moves from Royal Lodge.\n\nThe Royal Family receives tens of millions of pounds each year from the Sovereign Grant and uses it to cover the cost of official duties, but this is not the King's only source of income.\n\nIn 2025-26, the  Sovereign Grant, which provides state funding for the monarchy, increased to £132.1m , following a sharp rise in profits for the Crown Estate.\n\nThe figure in 2024-25 was £86.3 million, for the fourth consecutive year.\n\nThat included £51.8 million for the core Sovereign Grant and £34.5 million towards the modernisation of Buckingham Palace, a 10-year £369m project.\n\nThe  Royal Household's annual financial statement  said additional income increased to £21.5m, following a record number of visitors to Buckingham Palace.\n\nPublic funding for the Royal Household has tripled  in real terms since 2012, official figures show. The Sovereign Grant was £31m per year when it was introduced in 2012.\n\nA report by the House of Commons Library said much of the increase had been driven by the Buckingham Palace project.\n\nA Palace spokesperson said: \"It has always been anticipated that the level of the Sovereign Grant will drop once the project is completed.\"\n\nProfits of the Crown Estate - a property business owned by the monarch but run independently - go to the Treasury.\n\nThe level of profit is used to calculate the funding given by the government to the Royal Family.\n\nThe Crown Estate had assets worth £15bn in 2023-24, with billions of pounds worth of properties in London, including Regent Street, as well as nearly half the land along the coast of England, Wales and Northern Ireland.\n\nThe estate is not the King's private property - it merely belongs to the monarch for the duration of their reign. The King cannot sell its assets or keep any profits for himself.\n\nThe Sovereign Grant was initially worth 15% of the Crown Estate profits generated two years previously. That increased to 25% in 2017-18, to help pay for the Buckingham Palace repairs, before reducing to 12% since 2024-25.\n\nHowever,  soaring profits from the Crown Estate  due to six new offshore wind farms still led to the £45m increase in the Sovereign Grant in 2025-26.\n\nUnder the Sovereign Grant Act 2011, if the Crown Estate's profits fall, the monarch still receives the same amount as the previous year, with the government making up the difference.\n\nThe UK government said that over the last 10 years, the revenue received from the Crown Estate was £5bn, which was used for public spending.\n\nThe King and other working members of the Royal Family use the money to pay for expenses related to their official duties.\n\nThe vast majority is spent on the upkeep of properties and staffing, but it also covers costs such as travel to royal engagements.\n\nMembers of the Royal Family carried out 1,900 engagements across the UK and abroad during 2024-25.\n\nMore than 93,000 guests attended 828 events at official Royal palaces, including receptions, award investitures and garden parties.\n\nThe King also receives money from a private estate called the Duchy of Lancaster, which is passed down from monarch to monarch.\n\nIt covers more than 18,000 hectares of land in areas such as Lancashire and Yorkshire, as well as property in central London.\n\nAt the end of March 2025, it was worth £679m and had made £24.4m in annual profits.\n\nWhoever holds the title of Duke of Cornwall (currently the Prince of Wales) benefits from the Duchy of Cornwall.\n\nIt mainly covers land in south-west England. In the year to the end of March 2025 it had assets worth £1.1bn and had made annual profits of £22.9m.\n\nThe King and Prince William receive the profits from the duchies personally, and can spend them as they wish. However, they are not entitled to any proceeds from the sale of any estate assets, which must be reinvested.\n\nThe monarch also owns the royal palaces (which are not part of the Crown Estate) and part of the Royal Collection of art, but these do not generate income.\n\nSome palaces are looked after and funded by the Royal Family itself. Others - such as the Tower of London - are managed by Historic Royal Palaces, an independent charity.\n\nThe King also privately owns properties such as Balmoral and Sandringham.\n\nIt is understood Andrew will be relocated to the  Sandringham estate  in Norfolk, which covers approximately 8,100 hectares.\n\nIn addition, some Royal Family members have private art, jewellery and stamp collections which they can sell or use to generate income as they wish.\n\nIn 1992, Elizabeth II volunteered to pay income tax and capital gains tax on her personal income, and the King does the same.\n\nThe two duchies are exempt from corporation tax, but the King and Prince William voluntarily pay income tax on the revenue they generate. However, the amount of tax they pay is not made public.\n\nThey do not pay capital gains tax because they do not benefit personally from any increase in the duchies' assets.\n\nMembers of the Royal Family pay tax on any income generated from privately-owned assets.\n\nKing Charles does not have to pay inheritance tax on the money he received when the late queen died, under the \"sovereign to sovereign\" exemption agreed in 1993 by then Prime Minister John Major.\n\nThe Sovereign Grant does not cover the Royal Family's security arrangements, which are usually paid for by the Metropolitan Police, although the cost is not disclosed.\n\nSome major events are also not included.  The late queen's funeral in 2022 cost the government an estimated £162m .\n\nThe Coronation of the King cost taxpayers £72m, including £22m for policing.\n\nRepublic, a group campaigning for an elected head of state, has argued that factors such as security need to be included in the cost of the Royal Family.\n\nThe group claims that the total cost of the monarchy is about £510m per year."},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/31/world/africa/darfur-sudan-atrocities.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"18:01:31-04:00","title":"Twenty Years On, Darfur Tips Into Chaos Again","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Two decades after the Darfur genocide, the region is experiencing a resurgence of violence as the city of El Fasher falls to the Rapid Support Forces (R.S.F.), a paramilitary group descended from the Janjaweed militias.

2025-10-31T16:46:11.747+00:00\n\nTitle: Where might Andrew live on the Sandringham estate?\n\nNewly stripped of his \"prince\" title, Andrew is moving from his Windsor mansion, Royal Lodge, to the Sandringham estate in Norfolk, it is understood.\n\nFormal notice was given to surrender the lease at the Royal Lodge on Thursday, and the move will take place as soon as possible.\n\nThe historic, sprawling estate spans approximately 31 sq miles (80 sq km) of gardens - making it around the same size as Nottingham or Brighton and Hove.\n\nIt was bought as a private country retreat for the future Edward VII when he was Albert, Prince of Wales in 1862, and has since been passed down from monarch to monarch.\n\nThe estate itself covers several residential villages and hamlets, and includes 15 sq miles (40 sq km) of farmland.\n\nThe main building - Sandringham House - is thought to have more than a hundred rooms, including a ballroom.\n\nIt remains a country retreat for the Royal Family and is where they traditionally gather at Christmas.\n\nAndrew will be moving some 140 miles (225km) north-east of his Windsor mansion - and away from senior royals like King Charles III and Queen Camilla, who reside in London, and the Prince and Princess of Wales in Windsor.\n\nSome assumed Andrew would move from Royal Lodge to another property on the Windsor estate, Frogmore Cottage for example, royal biographer Robert Hardman told the BBC.\n\n\"But no,\" he said, \"he's off the estate, he's out of Windsor, he's out of royal Berkshire - he's been sent up the M11 to the royal equivalent of Siberia to sit in Sandringham for the rest of his life.\"\n\n\"This is - some might say brutal, others might say definitive.\"\n\nSandringham is a private estate - not an official royal residence - and it is understood the King will be privately funding Andrew's accommodation there, and that it will not be directly funded by the taxpayer.\n\nThe Palace has not yet said exactly where on the estate Andrew will live, or when he could move.\n\nBut royal sources have said it will not be immediate, and instead be \"as soon as possible and practicable\".\n\nHere is a look at some of the options on the estate.\n\nOriginally known as Bachelor's Cottage, York Cottage is about a quarter of a mile from the main house.\n\nIt has its own set of stables and kennel buildings, according to Historic England, and overlooks one of two man-made lakes on the estate.\n\nThere were reports ahead of Prince Harry's marriage to the Duchess of Sussex that the pair might have been gifted the use of York Cottage by Elizabeth II for use as a country home, but no such plan was ever confirmed and the move never materialised.\n\nIt has reportedly been used as an office and accommodation for staff in recent years.\n\nThe birthplace of Diana, Princess of Wales and her childhood home, Park House was rented by the Spencer family for many years.\n\nIn 1983 it was gifted to Leonard Cheshire, a disability charity, which used it to run a 16-bedroom hotel for the disabled, their carers and family.\n\nThe charity planned a £2.3m refurbishment before the pandemic hit, but announced in 2020 it would not go ahead with the proposal and said instead that it was working with the Sandringham estate to exit the lease.\n\nAnother option is the Gardens House, which was once the residence of the head gardener on the Sandringham estate.\n\nThe Edwardian house has six bedrooms and three bathrooms, is dog-friendly and is one of two properties on the estate available to the general public as a holiday let.\n\nIts

restoration\n\n​​I'm bald, and that bothered me for a long time. ​​\n\nIt bothered me that I was bothered. But just one swipe down my Instagram feed reveals I'm not the only man who is self-conscious about his hair.\n\nI'm greeted with videos and posts offering me hair transplants, regrowth tablets, thickening sprays, powders that fill gaps, and hair systems (once known as wigs or toupees).\n\nThese products promise to restore my \"lost confidence\" and stop my lack of hair from \"holding back\" my life.\n\nBut does the wealth of treatment options on offer mean attitudes towards hair loss have shifted? Is what was once viewed as something to be resigned to now seen as reversible, albeit at a cost?\n\nAccording to the International Society of Hair Restoration Surgery (ISHRS), hair transplants are becoming more common around the world - and the people having them are getting younger.\n\nThis global collective of surgeons, doctors and experts found 95% of its members' patients sought hair restoration surgery between the ages of 20 and 35 - and that's something hair-loss surgeon Dr Nilofer Farjo confirms is mirrored in the UK.\n\nWhen my hair first began to recede in my early 20s, I tried my best to cover it up, tactically styling and positioning it in a way that hid the new patches of scalp I hadn't seen before.\n\nThen, while out for my brother's stag do in a Liverpool nightclub, something happened that I haven't been able to forget since.\n\nI had suggested we wear white t-shirts and carry permanent markers so people we met could leave funny messages on our shirts.\n\n\"Best man? Best comb-over,\" one woman wrote.\n\nI laughed it off at the time, but inside, I was crushed. It was clear my hair loss was now noticeable to other people. And from then on, I became more and more self-conscious about my thinning hair.\n\nWhen I was younger, bald men were often the butt of jokes - but taking steps to regain lost hair seemed to be viewed as effeminate and vain. Still, I began to wonder if a hair transplant was my only option. Was that a possibility for someone like me? In my mind, they were only for rich people, and celebrities like Elton John.\n\nFast forward ten years, and social media and dating apps have made us all more aware of how we look, says Dr Farjo, and seeing celebrities and influencers being more open about hair transplants has normalised the procedure.\n\nShe says more and more young men are now choosing to treat their hair loss, and what might have once been deemed \"vanity\" is now considered \"routine self-care\".\n\nWhen I started considering having a hair transplant, I had just finished university, had little money, and no real idea how much the procedure might actually cost.\n\nI began to do some research and discovered a nearby transplant clinic offering free consultations and monthly payment plans.\n\n\"You're still quite young,\" I remember the hair transplant consultant telling me, as he drew on my scalp with a felt-tip pin. \"After this transplant, your hair could recede further. But you can just come and get it filled in.\"\n\nDespite the payment plan, I realised I couldn't afford a hair transplant - especially if I'd have to come and get a top-up later in life.\n\nSince my own consultation in Cardiff in 2014, I've heard about men travelling abroad in increasing numbers to countries like Turkey to have hair transplants. Dr Farjo says this is down to costs being \"a fraction\" of what they are in the UK.\n\nBut while the price may be attractive, she says there are concerns about industry practices, with limited regulations in place. Dr Farjo also warns that cheap, unregulated procedures, not only in Turkey, can sometimes lead to people needing \"costly corrective surgery\" to deal with scarring and \"poor hairline design\".\n\nBut hair transplants in Turkey remain popular and there are many happy customers - including content creator, Ben Placito.\n\nAfter jokey comments from his barber, Ben decided to consider having a hair transplant. And after months of research, he discovered it would be cheaper to have the procedure carried out in Turkey than in the UK.\n\nSome quotes from Turkish clinics were \"crazy cheap\", Ben says, offering surgery for around £1,500. But the 31-year-old chose not to go with the cheapest hair transplant on offer and instead selected a \"premium\" option.\n\nBen felt reassured about his chosen clinic after speaking to other men who had been there and had good experiences. Ben travelled to Turkey in 2022 to have the procedure, sharing his experience on his TikTok account.\n\n\"People have said to me 'it's the best thing you've done,'\" Ben says. \"I'm really happy I did it.\"\n\nAbout a year after I gave up on the idea of surgery, I came across an advert for a clinic offering non-surgical treatments, like finasteride tablets and minoxidil cream, which can be used to stimulate hair growth.\n\nFinasteride is one of the most common pills for hair loss, taken by tens of thousands of men in the UK. It is only available by private prescription.\n\nIt works by preventing testosterone turning into another hormone called dihydrotestosterone (DHT) that can stop hair growing.\n\nMinoxidil, originally a blood pressure medication, has hair growth as a side effect and is commonly sold in the form of a daily cream applied directly to the hair and scalp.\n\nI paid several hundred pounds for a combined course of minoxidil and finasteride but the treatment requires consistent daily use, and I often forgot doses. Eventually, I realised I couldn't justify the cost - or trust myself to stick with it. Health concerns also weighed on me, something the clinic had made clear.\n\nAccording to a 2024 report by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), finasteride is linked to psychiatric issues like depression and suicidal thoughts, and can have side effects affecting sexual function.\n\nThe MHRA advises users to monitor symptoms and stop using the drug if adverse effects occur.\n\nMy experience was a decade ago, but the market for hair-loss medication has since exploded. Superdrug's private online doctor service says it has seen a 68% increase in new patients requesting hair-loss services in the last three months versus the equivalent period last year.\n\nHaving given up on medication, I relied on hats and carefully positioned sunglasses that would \"hide\" my receding hair. If I was taking a photo with family or friends, I'd position the camera so it cropped out the top of my head.\n\nThen in 2019, I began to see adverts for hair systems. These seamless-looking hair pieces are glued to a shaved scalp and blended with existing hair, with regular clinic visits for maintenance. This seemed like a side-effect-free, instant solution.\n\nBut I couldn't shake the thought of suddenly appearing at work or family events with a full head of hair - everyone knew I was balding. I also questioned the legitimacy of the adverts. Were the results real? Or just the result of clever lighting and angles?\n\nI had seen some people with systems telling their social media followers they could start peeling off in the middle of the day - and I dreaded that.\n\nHowever, for 36-year-old Adam Lomax, who has male pattern baldness and trichotillomania (a mental health disorder where you can't resist pulling out your own hair), a hair system was \"life changing\".\n\nAdam had already tried finasteride, which left him feeling anxious, depressed and low in libido.\n\n\"People have been really positive,\" Adam says of the reception to his new hair. \"The conversation around men's hair loss has shifted massively - but you still get the odd troll on TikTok.\"\n\nIt's clear there are plenty of options for men facing hair loss, but not every bald man sees losing their hair as something that needs to be fixed or prevented.\n\n\"The narrative around hair loss needs to change both socially and commercially,\" says Tariq Kazemi, co-founder and CEO of skincare company Bld Bro, a brand which began life as a support group for bald men.\n\nTariq recalls a colleague poking fun at his bald spot during a shopping trip, and describing that as \"like an ice pick to my heart\".\n\nTariq later shaved his head and noticed that jokes about his hair loss stopped. He chose not to pursue any form of hair restoration.\n\n\"Those industries prey on the fear and anxiety of young men,\" he says. \"We've been told it's our identity, our confidence and our attractiveness that will all disappear with the hair on our head.\"\n\nIn 2020, when the world went into coronavirus lockdown many people grew out their hair or attempted to cut it themselves.\n\nBy this time, the only remaining hair I had was around the back of my head and in a thin patch on the top of my forehead. I took the plunge and decided to shave my head. There was a freedom in skipping to the end stage of the balding process, and I've continued to shave my head ever since.\n\nThere's so much social media noise around hair loss, and money to be made from men's worries about it. But after speaking to different men about their hair loss experiences, it's clear there is no single right way to feel happy with your appearance.\n\nThe anxiety I felt while I was losing my hair has gradually ebbed away and I feel more accepting of the way I look. I've come to terms with my baldness now and I prefer to be bald than balding."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2dd7yyly9o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"21:56:03.985+00:00","title":"Tchéky Karyo, star of Nikita and The Missing, dies at 72","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"French actor Tchéky Karyo, born in Istanbul in 1953 and raised in Paris, has died at the age of 72 after a battle with cancer.

starring role in the film Nikita and the TV series The Missing, has died aged 72.\n\nKaryo, who was born in Turkey but grew up in Paris, died of a cancer on Friday, AFP news agency reported.\n\nKnown largely for supporting roles, Karyo acted in films for nearly four decades, finding a second career in TV series in his final years.\n\nKaryo's wife, actress Valérie Keruzoré, and their children announced his death in a statement to the news agency.\n\nKaryo first made his mark in crime thriller La Balance (1982) and he played the handler Bob in Luc Besson's assassin film Nikita (1990).\n\nBBC audiences might best remember him for his role in The Missing (2014).\n\nThe first eight-part series, about the search for a missing boy in France, starred Karyo as French detective Julien Baptiste. James Nesbitt and Frances O'Connor played the boy's parents.\n\nThe second eight-part series, about a missing girl in Germany, was brodcast in 2016. Karyo returned as Baptiste, with David Morrissey and Keeley Hawes as the girl's parents.\n\nBoth series received positive reviews, with critics praising the cast, especially Karyo's performance.\n\nIn February 2019, a spin-off series titled Baptiste was broadcast on BBC One.\n\nLindsay Salt, Director of BBC Drama, said: \"We are so sad to learn of the passing of Tchéky Karyo. He was a truly brilliant and much loved actor and he will be fondly remembered by BBC viewers for his roles in The Missing, Baptiste and most recently Boat Story. Our thoughts are with his family and loved ones at this time.\"\n\nKaryo was born on 4 October 1953 in Istanbul, the son of a Turkish lorry driver of Spanish-Jewish origin and a Greek mother, Le Monde newspaper writes.\n\nAfter several years as a theatrical actor, he saw his role in La Balance earn him a nomination for the César Award for Best Male Revelation.\n\nWith his strong jaw and penetrating stare, he went on to star in dozens of films of all kinds.\n\nOther French films included Besson's Joan of Arc (1993) and the anti-war epic A Very Long Engagement (2004). He was also cast in Ridley Scott's 1492: Conquest of Paradise (1992) and in the James Bond film GoldenEye (1995).\n\nOne of his starring roles was as the medieval prophet Nostradamus in the 1994 film of the same name, while his tiniest role was undoubtedly in Amélie (2001) where he only appeared as a face on an ID photograph in an album."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8vrzpgxnro","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"19:21:48.330+00:00","title":"Andrew: Why Sarah Ferguson, Beatrice and Eugenie can't escape the taint of family scandal","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the growing scandal surrounding Andrew, the former Duke of York, and his family, particularly Sarah Ferguson and their daughters Beatrice and Eugenie, due to their alleged connections with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

Andrew is of his own making, but it has had a profound impact on his immediate family: his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson, and their two daughters.\n\nMs Ferguson, 66,  has been haunted by her own links  with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nShe will now move out of Royal Lodge and will make her own living arrangements, although it's believed she won't be moving to Sandringham in Norfolk with Andrew.\n\nPrincesses Beatrice, 37, and Eugenie, 35, will retain their titles, as they are the daughters of the son of a Sovereign.\n\nBut questions have also been raised about whether they can disentangle themselves from their parents' mess.\n\nMs Ferguson, who lost her duchess title when Andrew gave up his Duke of York title a few weeks ago, had, until recently, sidestepped the firing line of the controversy around Epstein.\n\nBut in September,  several charities dropped her as patron or ambassador  after the emergence of an email from 2011 in which she called Epstein her \"supreme friend\" and seemed to apologise for her public criticism of him.\n\nThe only charity she is still linked with is her own foundation, Sarah's Trust.\n\nIt used to have a \"duchess collection\" - a range of products including tea and biscuit sets to raise funds for the charity - but the website for that is no longer active.\n\nIts causes include supporting vulnerable communities, including \"forgotten women\" globally.\n\nBBC News has made multiple attempts to contact the charity to ask if such a cause is appropriate given Ms Ferguson's ties to Epstein. But the phone number listed is not recognised, and emails bounced back.\n\nWe raised this with the Charity Commission, who said one of its team has been in touch with the charity reminding it to keep their contact details up to date.\n\nAway from her philanthropy, Ms Ferguson has various business ventures, and has written several children's books, non-fiction about Queen Victoria, and her own memoirs.\n\nHer latest children's book, which was due to be published on 9 October according to a press release in Bookseller, is now showing as available from 28 November on Amazon.\n\nWaterstones bookstores told BBC News that the publication date for Flora And Fern: Kindness Along The Way, had \"moved\" and that they didn't have a new publication date.\n\nHer publisher, New Frontier Publishing, has not responded to a request for comment.\n\nHowever, one industry source told the BBC that \"it would be an entirely sensible decision\" to delay publication.\n\nMs Ferguson's other publishers have remained tight-lipped when asked whether they plan to sever links with her.\n\nHarper Collins, which has published two of her titles, the most recent being A Most Intriguing Lady which came out in 2023, declined to comment but pointed to the fact that both her books remain in print and available.\n\n\"Publishers don't tend to drop authors, they just quietly don't renew contracts,\" said Neill Denny, editor of the book trade news website Book Brunch.\n\nHe said that while there has been speculation that Ms Ferguson, or indeed Andrew, could write a tell-all memoir, \"I think the publishers would be wary of taking on the ex Duchess of York's story.\"\n\nAs for Beatrice and Eugenie, they have kept their princess title - which will be a small victory for Andrew, who will have wanted to protect his daughters, even at his own expense.\n\nBoth appear to have escaped the UK this week.\n\nBeatrice was pictured at an investment summit in Saudi Arabia. Her family have long-held links to the Middle East and she also recently appeared in a promotional picture  for a UAE bank .\n\nMeanwhile, Eugenie was pictured in Paris with friends.\n\nAnd while there has been some sympathy for the princesses, they also haven't been able to completely avoid the scandals around their parents.\n\nEarlier this week, a picture resurfaced  showing Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell and Harvey Weinstein  at Beatrice's 18th birthday party in Windsor.\n\nThe Telegraph also reported a leaked email from Epstein to his UK-based lawyer that suggested Ms Ferguson and the princesses visited Epstein in New York after he was released from prison in 2009.\n\nA source close to Ms Ferguson insisted that neither she nor her daughters had any recollection of such a visit,  according to the newspaper .\n\nIn 2018, Beatrice  told British Vogue in a joint interview  with her sister: \"We are young women trying to build careers and have personal lives, and we're also princesses and doing all of this in the public eye.\"\n\nThe princesses are not working royals, and both have jobs - Beatrice founded advisory firm BY-Eq, while Eugenie works at the gallery Hauser & Wirth.\n\nBoth are married with children, with Beatrice splitting her time between her Cotswolds property and an apartment in St James' Palace. Eugenie lives between Portugal and a property in the grounds of Kensington Palace.\n\nOn Friday night, royal sources said the late Queen's corgis are still going to be looked after by Andrew, Sarah and their daughters - although it's uncertain whose home they will reside in.\n\nBoth princesses also have their philanthropic endeavours. Eugenie set up the anti-slavery collective, a charity whose focus includes victims of sex trafficking. According to the most recently available accounts, it has raised £1.5m in donations last year but has so far distributed very little, with £1.3m carried forward.\n\nBBC News approached the charity to ask for a comment in light of the latest controversy surrounding Andrew and Epstein, but it has not responded.\n\nAt the end of this tumultuous week, there are still many unanswered questions.\n\nFamily time will clearly be harder now. Andrew is moving to Norfolk, which means he is no longer close by to his daughters and grandchildren.\n\nMs Ferguson - who maintained a close relationship with Andrew and lived at Royal Lodge with him, despite their divorce in 1996 - will also now move, although it's unclear where.\n\nShe recently sold her Belgravia flat, which she purchased for £4.2m. It is still listed in her name on Land Registry records, but her spokesperson confirmed to BBC News that the sale has gone through.\n\nAnd then there's a question mark over Christmas.\n\nIt's been previously announced that Andrew would be excluded from the traditional royal family gathering which takes place in Sandringham at Christmas.\n\nWhere Ms Ferguson will be is also not clear.\n\nBut either way, the princesses will face a choice, whether to spend it with their parents, their in-laws, or the wider Royal Family.\n\nWhat they decide may be telling. With the York brand now tainted beyond repair, who they choose to celebrate with may be a sign of who they will align with in future."},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/31/world/europe/prince-andrew-explainer.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"09:02:48-04:00","title":"What’s Next for Andrew After He Loses His Royal Titles?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In response to years of allegations linking Prince Andrew to the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and to the testimony of Virginia Giuffre, who died by suicide in April 2025, King Charles III has stripped Prince Andrew of his royal titles and evicted him from royal property.

On Thursday, the king sought to end a scandal that has chipped away at the reputation of the monarchy by stripping Andrew of his remaining royal titles and evicting him from the mansion where he has lived.\n\nHere’s a guide to what the king has decided, and what happens now to Andrew and his family.\n\nAccusations linked to his ties with Mr. Epstein have shadowed Andrew for years. In 2022, he settled a lawsuit brought by Virginia Giuffre, a woman who accused him of sexually abusing her while she was a teenage victim of Mr. Epstein. He did not admit any of her accusations and he has continued to deny wrongdoing.\n\nBut the publication this month of a posthumous memoir by Ms. Giuffre, who died by suicide in April, made his position increasingly untenable.\n\nPublic opinion had hardened against Andrew in recent weeks to such an extent that some lawmakers were demanding action to ensure that he relinquished his honors.\n\nDiscussion of Andrew had begun to drown out other royal activities. It generated negative headlines even on the day the king, who is the nominal head of the Church of England, prayed alongside Pope Leo at the Vatican — a huge moment of symbolism between the leaders of two Christian denominations. During a recent public appearance, the king was heckled by a member of the public about his brother.\n\nIn an illustration of the public’s mood, the audience of a BBC discussion show applauded spontaneously on Thursday night when the decision to strip Andrew of his title was announced.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

2025-10-31T18:16:16-04:00\n\nThe elections on Tuesday hardly seem to be top of mind for President Trump.\n\nHe has spent the last week crisscrossing Asia, talking trade, nuclear weapons and rare earths, and is headed to Florida this weekend. He has not appeared in person in any of the major states hosting elections, like New Jersey or California, to pump up his party’s candidate or cause. In Virginia, where a weak Republican candidate for governor is lagging behind an impervious-looking Democrat, he’s offered only a tepid endorsement late in the campaign.\n\n(This has not, of course, stopped Democrats from talking about him, either in California, where they are fighting to pass a ballot measure that could give them five more safe House seats, or anywhere else.)\n\nNone of this is unusual for a president in an off-year. But the contests — particularly the governor’s races in New Jersey and Virginia — are essentially the opening salvos of the midterm elections. And even if Trump has relatively little to say about them, the results will offer signals about his political strength and his party’s strength more broadly, as it considers ways to keep his supporters in the fold when he is barred from once again topping the ticket.\n\n“Will those Trump voters become Republican voters?” asked Mike DuHaime, a Republican strategist who worked on Chris Christie’s successful off-year campaigns for New Jersey governor in 2009 and 2013. “Do they think any other race, other than presidential, is important enough to come out for?”\n\nHere are three story lines that show how even elections that aren’t directly about Trump can’t help but be a little Trumpy.\n\nWhen Jack Ciattarelli, a former state lawmaker and a Republican, first ran for governor of New Jersey in 2017, he cut a wonky profile and occasionally criticized Trump, who he knew repulsed swing voters.\n\nFast forward eight years — and a second unsuccessful run for governor in 2021 — and you have a candidate who has fundamentally shifted his approach, my colleague Nick Corasaniti wrote in a perceptive profile. Ciattarelli doesn’t talk so much about Trump. But he talks like him, decrying “open borders” and appearing with vaccine skeptics and far-right Trump-backers like Jack Posobiec. Nick wrote:\n\nSuch an approach amounts to a bet not yet tested in a competitive election since Mr. Trump’s return to power last year: that the margins in a close race can be made up by tacking closer to the Republican base in a general election, and that Trump supporters will turn out even without Mr. Trump atop the ticket.\n\nIt’s a departure from the timeworn tactic of playing to the middle, and if it works in a blue state, it will say a lot about the staying power of Trump’s political style.\n\nCiattarelli’s decision to tack so close to Trump reflects the president’s performance there in 2024, when he lost to former Vice President Kamala Harris by less than six percentage points, but showed remarkable strength in the state’s most diverse areas. Every single majority-Hispanic township in the state swung Trump’s way between 2020 and 2024, by 25 percentage points on average.\n\nThat, Shane Goldmacher and Christine Zhang wrote, makes Tuesday’s results in New Jersey an early test of whether that movement was “evidence of a durable political and racial realignment or a passing phenomenon specific to Mr. Trump.”\n\n“New Jersey ends up being the first meaningful temperature check since the last election,” said Carlos Odio, a Democratic pollster who specializes in studying Latino voting patterns and lives in New Jersey.\n\nCiattarelli appears to understand precisely what’s at stake, campaigning frequently in Black and Latino areas that were once considered safe Democratic turf.\n\nThere is no chance that a Republican is going to win New York City’s mayor’s race. But that hasn’t kept Trump entirely away from the contest to govern his hometown.\n\nHe mulled getting involved to stop Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee, from winning. He spoke directly with former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, the Democrat and former Trump foil now running as an independent, about the race. His advisers discussed giving Mayor Eric Adams, the embattled Democratic incumbent, an administration job in exchange for dropping out (Adams eventually did drop out, sans job offer).\n\nNone of that has stopped the rise of Mamdani, a democratic socialist, but Trump has tried one more tactic: threatening the city with major cuts to federal funding if Mamdani is elected.\n\nTrump seems unlikely to change the outcome of the race. But the question for New York is how, if Mamdani is elected, the president might flex his power to shape the city itself.\n\nPOSTCARD FROM SACRAMENTO\n\nPolls suggest that California voters are likely to pass Gov. Gavin Newsom’s redistricting measure on Tuesday, a win that could help Democrats flip five House seats next year — and that could pay political dividends for Newsom, too. My colleague Laurel Rosenhall, who covers California government, explains.\n\nThe ballot measure was framed as a way to fight President Trump’s mid-decade redistricting push with fire. But it could also serve as a foundation for a 2028 presidential campaign for Newsom himself.\n\nOver the course of the campaign, Newsom expanded a national list of supporters that helped him raise an astonishing $114 million in less than three months. The haul from small donations is especially notable, with $38 million from people across the country who responded to email and text message appeals.\n\nTheir contact information is on a list Newsom has been methodically building since his earliest days in politics. More than 25 years ago, as a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, Newsom began collecting emails for a bond measure to fund San Francisco parks. Since then, he told me he’s been disciplined about expanding and maintaining the list that he calls “the most valuable asset” of his political career.\n\nNewsom leveraged that asset to turn a state level redistricting measure into an attention-grabbing national campaign. And that’s a platform he can draw on again in 2028, if he wants to.\n\nProponents for California’s new redistricting measure say voters are motivated by stopping Trump.\n\nThe Virginia legislature took the first step to redrawing Congressional maps to benefit Democrats in 2026.\n\nOhio is now the latest Republican-led state to redraw its congressional map to benefit the G.O.P.\n\nQUOTE OF THE DAY\n\nThat’s what a spokesman for John Thune, the Senate majority leader, told my colleague Carl Hulse on Friday, shutting down a demand from President Trump to dispose of the filibuster in order to end the government shut down.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump took to Truth Social to call for Senate Republicans to “go for what is called the Nuclear Option.”\n\n“Get rid of the Filibuster, and get rid of it, NOW!” he wrote.\n\nThune has weakened the filibuster, but he and other Senior Republicans fear that getting rid of it entirely would spectacularly backfire if Democrats regained control of the Senate.\n\nMore on Senate Republicans:\n\nSenators opposed the president’s plan to import Argentine beef and voted three times this week to end his power to enforce sweeping tariffs, indicating growing Republican angst over Trump’s trade agenda.\n\nIt was the end of President Trump’s five-day visit to three countries in Asia — a tour packed with extravagant welcome dinners, an aircraft rally and the gift of a replica gold crown — and The New York Times’s photographer Haiyun Jiang thought she was done for the day.\n\nShe had already photographed Trump and Xi Jinping of China shaking hands, and watched them recede into the bilateral meeting the whole trip had built up to. She and the other photographers had been told they wouldn’t see the two men together again.\n\nBut, about 90 minutes into Trump and Xi’s meeting, the media was told that the plan had changed, and the two men were coming out once more — together. That’s when Haiyun took this photo showing Trump whispering some final words to a smiling Xi, as the men in his delegation solemnly looked on.\n\nHaiyun keeps cameras on her all the time in the event of surprises like this. That happened earlier on the trip, too, when Air Force One flew from Tokyo to Busan, and the captain told the passengers that they would soon be able to see a spectacular view of Mt. Fuji.\n\nHaiyun, of course, had two cameras at hand, slung over the seat in front of her, poised to capture the unexpected.\n\nLaurel Rosenhall, Taylor Robinson and Ama Sarpomaa contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/01/opinion/day-of-the-dead-mexico.html","dateOfPublication":"2024-11-01","timeOfPublication":"05:00:05-04:00","title":"For Day of the Dead, a Burst of Flowers to Honor the Departed","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During the Day of the Dead, the cempasúchil (marigold) flower is traditionally used to guide spirits back home.

In Mexico City, people who lost a loved one to Covid use the flower to honor their dead.\n\nSupported by\n\nBy César Martínez Barba\n\nMr. Martínez Barba is a documentary filmmaker.\n\nThe life of the marigold, known as the cempasúchil in Mexico, reflects our own: the plant sprouts, grows, flowers and dies. The flowers’ yellow and orange glow is ubiquitous across Mexico every year in the first few days of November, during Day of the Dead, as families place cempasúchil flowers on altars and at cemeteries to create a path to guide their loved ones back home.\n\nMy grandmother died of Covid in October 2020, just as the cempasúchil began to appear in the markets of Mexico City. Her death was sudden, and it was a painful experience for my family. Because of the restrictions on gatherings during Covid in Mexico, a funeral was not held after her death.\n\nA few days later, my cousin Gabriel, who lived with my grandmother, went to buy the materials for her first altar. When I saw the image of the altar through family text messages, I was struck by the beauty of his gift to her memory. He created it alone in their shared apartment; this was the only ceremony he could assemble to celebrate her life.\n\nAround her portrait beamed the sunlike glow of the cempasúchil. Absorbed by its radiance, I wondered what other hands had passed over the flowers resting on her altar. Had they faced a similar loss? Did they have the chance to celebrate their loved ones?\n\nThese questions led me to retrace the path that those flowers traveled: from the fields where they were harvested to the markets where they were sold and then to my grandmother’s altar. Along the way, I met people who had lost their loved ones to Covid and gained a deeper understanding of the unique grief we experienced during the pandemic. In the short documentary above, “más y más y más flores,” I observe how the cempasúchil not only connects us to those in the realm beyond, but to one another in the world of the living.\n\nAfter the Day of the Dead has passed, when the flowers wither and fall, seeds appear and scatter. From its own death, the cempasúchil’s next cycle of life begins.\n\nCésar Martínez Barba is a filmmaker living in New York City.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Backlash\n\nPublished: 2025-10-31T17:07:00-04:00\n\nVice President JD Vance provoked a broad backlash this week after he said that he hoped that his wife, Usha Vance, who is of Indian heritage and was raised in a Hindu family, would eventually convert to his own Catholic faith.\n\n“Do I hope eventually that she is somehow moved by the same thing that I was moved by in church?” he said during an event at the University of Mississippi on Wednesday, in response to a question from the audience. “Yeah, I honestly do wish that because I believe in the Christian Gospel, and I hope eventually my wife comes to see it the same way.”\n\nThe comments, which were made in front of thousands of students as part of a Turning Point USA event honoring the slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk, were widely reported by news media outlets and quickly criticized on social media.\n\nBeyond partisan salvos, there was also criticism from some Indians and Indian Americans across the political spectrum who said that Mr. Vance was not respecting his wife’s religious decisions. Some also said his remarks suggested that Hinduism was inferior at a time when aggressive immigration enforcement has left many South Asian Americans and people of non-Christian faiths feeling uncertain and afraid of their place in American society.\n\nThe backlash reflected worries by some in the South Asian community over the Trump administration’s immigration policies and its embrace of conservative Christian groups.\n\nSuhag Shukla, executive director of the Hindu American Foundation, described Mr. Vance’s remarks as “basically saying that my wife, this aspect of her is just not enough.”\n\n“If you were any ordinary pastor, then whatever,” said Ms. Shukla, who has been critical of both Democrats and Republicans in the past. “But he’s not the pastor in chief, he’s the vice president wanting to be president.”\n\n“There’s a lot of uncertainty in the community,” Ms. Shukla said. “This just added kind of fuel to those fears.”\n\nOn Friday, Mr. Vance responded to the upswell of criticism. In a reply to a commenter on X who accused him of throwing his wife’s religion “under the bus,” Mr. Vance called the message “disgusting” and full of “anti-Christian bigotry.”\n\nHe also called Mrs. Vance the “most amazing blessing” in his life, noting that he had also said that at the Turning Point event. He said that she had encouraged him to re-engage with his faith and that while he still wished that she would convert, he would “continue to love and support her” regardless.\n\nIt is not unusual for people in interfaith relationships, and especially for Christians across denominations, to hope for their partners to convert. And the Roman Catholic Church teaches that baptism is required for salvation.\n\nRaised in a loosely evangelical family, Mr. Vance has described himself as going through an “angry, atheist phase” before later converting to Catholicism. Mr. Vance’s embrace of the Catholic faith is evident in his politics, as seen through his frequent emphasis on traditional family principles, social conservatism and economic populism.\n\nMrs. Vance, who was born and raised in Southern California by parents who immigrated from India, has spoken about growing up in a religious Hindu household. The couple, who first met when they were studying at Yale Law School, have spoken publicly before about her role in Mr. Vance’s conversion and their approach to raising their three children in an intercultural and interfaith household.\n\nIn a June interview on Meghan McCain’s podcast, Mrs. Vance said that while the children went to Catholic school, they could choose whether they wanted to be baptized.\n\n“The kids know that I’m not Catholic, and they have plenty of access to the Hindu tradition from books that we give them, to things that we show them, to the visit recently to India and some of the religious elements of that visit,” she said. “So it is a part of their lives and they know many practicing Hindus as a part of their lives in their own family.”\n\nThese family issues, though, can take on a different valence when placed within a broader political and historical context.\n\nThere is a sensitivity in India to proselytizing by non-Hindus because of the long history of Muslim rule and Christian missionary work.\n\nMr. Vance’s comments also appeared to have struck a nerve at a time when rhetoric against immigrants has been growing. An August report from Stop AAPI Hate, a coalition that tracks acts of violence against Asian Americans, documented recent spikes in online hate rhetoric against South Asians related mainly to the mayoral run of Zohran Mamdani and the ongoing debate around H-1B visas.\n\nEarlier this month, a City Council member in Palm Bay, Fla., was censured over a series of social media messages in which he disparaged Indians as coming to the United States to “drain our pockets” and called for them to be deported en masse. The member, Chandler Langevin, is now suing the city of Palm Bay saying that the censure restrictions violated his First Amendment right to free speech.\n\nSangay Mishra, an associate professor at Drew University and the author of “Desis Divided: The Political Lives of South Asian Americans,” said that Mr. Vance’s comments may have come from a deeply personal place, but they were interpreted by some as effectively “nodding to these larger politics of anti-immigration, anti-migrants, anti-replacement theory and white Christian nationalism.”\n\nNot all Indian Americans were bothered by Mr. Vance’s comments.\n\nRami Reddy Mutyala is chairman of Shri Mandir, a Hindu temple in San Diego that Mrs. Vance’s parents occasionally attend. Even though he is a Republican, he said that he disapproved of President Trump, who he said was acting like a “monarch.”\n\nBut he saw nothing wrong with the vice president’s remarks.\n\n“They are adults, they can decide whatever is good for them,” he said. “We cannot force anybody — even I cannot force my children to convert to Hinduism.”\n\nElizabeth Dias contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/31/business/media/artificial-intelligence-death-threats.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"12:45:06-04:00","title":"A.I.

Is Making Death Threats Way More Realistic\n\nPublished: 2025-10-31T12:45:06-04:00\n\nEven though she was toughened by years spent working in internet activism, Caitlin Roper found herself traumatized by the online threats she received this year.\n\nThere was the picture of herself hanging from a noose, dead. And another of herself ablaze, screaming.\n\nThe posts were part of a surge of vitriol directed at Ms. Roper and her colleagues at Collective Shout, an Australian activist group, on X and other social media platforms. Some of it, including images of the women flayed, decapitated or fed into a wood chipper, was seemingly enabled — and given a visceral realism — by generative artificial intelligence. In some of the videos, Ms. Roper was wearing a blue floral dress that she does, in fact, own.\n\n“It’s these weird little details that make it feel more real and, somehow, a different kind of violation,” she said. “These things can go from fantasy to more than fantasy.”\n\nArtificial intelligence is already raising concerns for its ability to mimic real voices in service of scams or to produce deepfake pornography without a subject’s permission. Now, the technology is also being used for violent threats — priming them to maximize fear by making them far more personalized, more convincing and more easily delivered.\n\n“Two things will always happen when technology like this gets developed: We will find clever and creative and exciting ways to use it, and we will find horrific and awful ways to abuse it,” said Hany Farid, a professor of computer science at the University of California, Berkeley. “What’s frustrating is that this is not a surprise.”\n\nDigitally generated threats have been possible for at least a few years. A judge in Florida was sent a video in 2023, most likely made using a character customization tool in the Grand Theft Auto 5 video game, that featured an avatar who looked and walked like her being hacked and shot to death.\n\nBut threatening images are rapidly becoming easier to make, and more persuasive. One YouTube page had more than 40 realistic videos — most likely made using A.I., according to experts who reviewed the channel — each showing a woman being shot. (YouTube, after The New York Times contacted it, said it had terminated the channel for “multiple violations” of its guidelines.) A deepfake video of a student carrying a gun sent a high school into lockdown this spring. In July, a lawyer in Minneapolis said xAI’s Grok chatbot had provided an anonymous social media user with detailed instructions on breaking into his house, sexually assaulting him and disposing of his body.\n\nUntil recently, artificial intelligence could replicate real people only if they had a huge online presence, such as film stars with throngs of publicly accessible photos. Now, a single profile image will suffice, said Dr. Farid, who co-founded GetReal Security, a service that identifies malicious digital content. (Ms. Roper said she had worn the blue floral dress in a photo published a few years ago in an Australian newspaper.)\n\nThe same is true of voices — what once took hours of example data to clone now requires less than a minute.\n\n“The concern is that now, almost anyone with no skills but with motive or lack of scruples can easily use these tools to do damage,” said Jane Bambauer, a professor who teaches about A.I. and the law at the University of Florida.\n\nWorries about A.I.-assisted threats and extortion intensified with the introduction this month of Sora, a text-to-video app from OpenAI. The app, which allows users to upload images of themselves to be incorporated into hyper-realistic scenes, quickly depicted actual people in frightening situations.\n\nThe Times tested Sora and produced videos that appeared to show a gunman in a bloody classroom and a hooded man stalking a young girl. Grok also readily added a bloody gunshot wound to a photo of a real person.\n\n“From the perspective of identity, everyone’s vulnerable,” Dr. Farid said.\n\nAn OpenAI spokeswoman said the company relied on multiple defenses, including guardrails to block unsafe content from being created, experiments to uncover previously unknown weaknesses and automated content moderation systems. (The Times sued OpenAI in 2023, claiming copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems, an assertion that OpenAI has denied.)\n\nExperts in A.I. safety, however, said companies had not done nearly enough. Alice Marwick, director of research at Data & Society, a nonprofit organization, described most guardrails as “more like a lazy traffic cop than a firm barrier — you can get a model to ignore them and work around them.”\n\nMs. Roper said the torrent of online abuse starting this summer — including hundreds of harassing posts sent specifically to her — was linked to her work on a campaign to shut down violent video games glorifying rape, incest and sexual torture. On X, where most of the abuse appeared, she said, some harassing images and accounts were taken down. But the company also told her repeatedly that other posts depicting her violent death did not violate the platform’s terms of service. In fact, X once included one of her harassers on a list of recommended accounts for her to follow.\n\nSome of the harassers also claimed to have used Grok not just to create the images but to research how to find the women at home and at local cafes.\n\nFed up, Ms. Roper decided to post some examples. Soon after, according to screenshots, X told her that she was in breach of its safety policies against gratuitous gore and temporarily locked her account.\n\nNeither X nor xAI, the company that owns Grok, responded to requests for comment.\n\nA.I. is also making other kinds of threats more convincing. For example: swatting, the practice of placing false emergency calls with the aim of inciting a large response from the police and emergency personnel. A.I. “has significantly intensified the scale, precision and anonymity” of such attacks, the National Association of Attorneys General said this summer. On a lesser scale, a spate of A.I.-generated videos showing supposed home invasions have caused the targeted residents to call police departments around the country.\n\nNow, perpetrators of swatting can compile convincing false reports by cloning voices and manipulating images. One serial swatter used simulated gunfire to suggest that a shooter was in the parking lot of a Washington State high school. The campus was locked down for 20 minutes; police officers and federal agents showed up.\n\nA.I. was already complicating schools’ efforts to protect students, raising concerns about personalized sexual images or rumors spread via fake videos, said Brian Asmus, a former police chief who was working as the senior manager of safety and security for the school district when the swatter called. Now, the technology is adding an extra security challenge, making false alarms harder to distinguish from true emergency calls.\n\n“How does law enforcement respond to something that’s not real?” Mr. Asmus asked. “I don’t think we’ve really gotten ahead of it yet.”\n\nStuart A. Thompson contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/31/opinion/shutdown-snap-trump-deal.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"15:59:16-04:00","title":"What Happened to the Art of the Deal?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During a prolonged government shutdown, President Donald Trump has withheld funding for critical social programs, including the Affordable Care Act tax credits and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), despite legal and moral concerns.

fast and loose with federal law during the current government shutdown to fund the things he considers important. He has found ways to pay military service members and F.B.I. agents. He has distributed tariff revenues to women with small children and arranged billions of dollars in financial support for Argentina. He has even ordered the Interior Department to keep federal lands open for hunting.\n\nAnd what has Mr. Trump refused to fund?\n\nAs the shutdown enters its second month, the president still will not agree to an extension of the federal tax credits that allow millions of Americans to afford health insurance. Last week the Trump administration also said it would stop distributing food stamps to more than 40 million lower-income families, declining to tap the program’s emergency reserve fund.\n\nA federal judge in Rhode Island intervened on Friday, ordering the administration to use the program’s reserves. A second federal judge, in Massachusetts, indicated that she was also prepared to rule against the administration if it did not agree to continue distributing food stamps. We urge the administration to abide by the decision and allow millions of Americans to receive food aid.\n\nThe government has never paused the distribution of food stamps, even during past shutdowns, and the threat is just one of the ways this shutdown is causing pain. More than a million federal workers are not being paid. The Small Business Administration is not making loans. Regulators are not conducting many routine safety inspections of food processing plants.\n\nMr. Trump and his congressional allies could end all of this by doing what they should have done months ago: making a deal. Under current Senate rules, Republicans manifestly do not have enough votes to pass a funding bill on their own, and it is absurd that they continue to insist that Democrats should simply acquiesce. The hard work of governing in a democracy is hammering out a compromise.\n\nMr. Trump already has sought to pile pressure on Democrats by suspending funding for projects in blue states, including the important Hudson River train tunnel between New Jersey and New York and mass transit in Chicago. The attempt to raise the stakes by suspending the distribution of food stamps is unconscionable. The administration would literally be keeping food from the mouths of hungry children. Food stamps, formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, provide a monthly credit to millions of households that do not make enough money to feed themselves. Many recipients work low-wage jobs. Others are disabled or elderly.\n\nThe Agriculture Department, which administers the program, has an emergency reserve of $5.5 billion that could have been used to maintain benefits. During the last long shutdown, in Mr. Trump’s first term, the department said it would tap that fund to delay any interruption in the distribution of benefits. As recently as Sept. 30, the day before the current shutdown began, the department said that remained its plan. Instead, however, the Trump administration insisted the reserve was “not legally available” because it was meant for the aftermath of natural disasters.\n\nDemocrats, for their part, have remained united in their insistence that Republicans must agree to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits as part of any funding bill. They have resisted despite the pain Mr. Trump is causing because the credits are worth fighting for. The cost of health insurance plans sold through the A.C.A. marketplaces is set to rise sharply next year. The expiring tax credits would have shielded buyers from most of the increase. Without the credits, the average amount that people must pay each month is expected to rise to $159 from $74, according to KFF, a health research group.\n\nFor many, the difference — about $1,000 a year on average — would make the plans unaffordable. Indeed, one reason the premiums are rising is that insurers anticipate the cost increases will cause a significant number of relatively healthy people to drop their insurance, raising costs for everyone else.\n\nRepublicans say their party has become the party of the American working class. But many working families rely on the tax credits to afford health insurance. And many of those same families rely on food stamps to put enough food on the table. Mr. Trump can serve their needs by demonstrating his skills as a negotiator. It’s time to make a deal.\n\nSource photographs by juefraphoto, Oksana Dolgikh and Muhammad Labib Adilah, via Getty Images.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

His home was on the other side of a large pool of chest-high water.\n\nBut he thought better of it when he saw the dead livestock.\n\n“There is a dead cow and hog; the water is starting to get infested,” he said. “The water is coming from all sides.”\n\nThree days after Hurricane Melissa roared across Jamaica, many people in communities stricken by the powerful storm find themselves trapped by floodwaters that keep rising, apparently because of a drainage system that had become blocked.\n\nThe hurricane, one of the strongest ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean, ripped through several island nations, leaving behind death and widespread destruction.\n\nAt least 19 people were killed in Jamaica, and at least 30, including children, in Haiti, officials said. Jamaican officials said they expected the death toll to climb as the authorities reached and searched through the worst hit areas.\n\nThe Jamaican authorities would be “all-hands on deck” to help the country recover from “unimaginable” devastation, the country’s information minister, Dana Morris Dixon, said at a news conference.\n\nIn New River, where there was still no power on Friday, residents said they thought the worst of the storm was behind them — until the water started coming. Water began seeping into people’s homes two days ago and started rising considerably again on Friday, residents said.\n\nAt the height of the storm, one person said, the wind kept peeling the roofs off homes, forcing people to run from house to house in search of safe shelter.\n\nBefore the storm, Mr. Beck said, he had been boarding up windows at a local infirmary, and ended up riding out the storm there.\n\nWhen he was able to get back to his home, he said, the roof had been torn off.\n\n“My house is rubbish,” Mr. Beck said.\n\nReginald Campbell, 64, dragged cushions and mattresses into the sunlight from his flooded house.\n\n“I am trying to get some sun on it because it is starting to stink,” he shouted from his porch, which was surrounded by water.\n\nMr. Campbell said the blocked drainage system was causing the water to keep rising.\n\n“We are anxious,” he said.\n\nElsewhere, a man with a chain saw tackled a palm tree that had fallen across his front yard. He climbed another tree that had power lines draped across it, trying to cut it down.\n\nAbout 2,000 feet down the road, drone footage of the area showed the dead cow and pig that had given Mr. Beck pause. People in houses with roofs torn off peeked through windows in homes surrounded by water. Those with a bit of exposed land had scattered their belongings outside to try to dry them in the sun.\n\nTwo little boys, one barefoot and both shirtless, walked down the street carrying their belongings in plastic bags on their heads. They reached a large pool of water and debated going further.\n\nThey waded through the knee-high water.\n\nWeston Brown, who works as an embalmer for funeral homes, drove to check the conditions at the Bailey Parlor funeral home, which had part of its roof torn off.\n\nMr. Brown was certain that the death toll would rise, as the authorities received more and more reports of bodies deteriorating inside homes.\n\n“We are going to have more people dying,” he said. “People are going to start dying from hunger.”\n\nEmiliano Rodríguez Mega contributed reporting from Mexico City.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/31/world/europe/king-charles-prince-andrew.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"11:25:48-04:00","title":"Will the Unmaking of a Prince Be the Making of a King?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a landmark move, King Charles III has stripped Prince Andrew of his titles — Duke of York and Prince — and removed his designation as 'His Royal Highness' from official royal records, a decision prompted by persistent allegations of sexual misconduct involving Jeffrey Epstein and Virginia Roberts Giuffre.

in 2022, royal watchers predicted he would be a cautious reformer, edging Britain’s ancient monarchy toward a more open, inclusive and accountable style. Few predicted that exiling his wayward younger brother, Andrew, would be a defining moment in that project.\n\nKing Charles III’s decision this week to strip Andrew of his title as a prince, turning him into Mr. Mountbatten Windsor, is a watershed in the history of the royal family — an act so legally complicated, politically sensitive and emotionally fraught that it left royal historians casting about for a precedent.\n\nAt one level, Charles’s move is a concession that a decade of half measures was not enough to quell the public outcry over allegations of sexual misconduct against Andrew and his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted sex offender. At another level, it is an affirmation that royals, too, can be held accountable.\n\n“These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him,” Buckingham Palace said in a statement whose passive voice did little to disguise the hammer blow.\n\nFor those who parse royal communications, the next line was equally noteworthy. “Their Majesties,” the statement concluded, “wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse.”\n\nThat likely signaled the endorsement of Charles’s wife, Queen Camilla, who has never been close to Andrew, according to people who worked at the palace. She also supports charities that work for victims of rape and sexual abuse.\n\nPalace officials said the king’s elder son and heir to the throne, Prince William, also supported the decision. The current and former palace officials spoke on condition that they not be identified because of the sensitivity of discussing internal royal family matters.\n\nStill, the Firm, as royals often refer to their family, is neither a democracy nor a collective. The king made the decision to send so-called royal warrants to the lord chancellor, David Lammy. In these, he requested that Mr. Lammy remove Andrew’s titles — Duke of York and prince — as well as the honorific “His Royal Highness” from the Peerage Roll, which sets out royal and aristocratic titles in Britain.\n\nThe maneuver will bypass the need for Parliament to act against Andrew, 65, a prospect that was becoming uncomfortably plausible after calls by several lawmakers to address the slurry of sordid disclosures about the accusation that he raped a teenager, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who was trafficked to him by Mr. Epstein.\n\nAndrew has repeatedly denied these allegations, which Ms. Giuffre detailed in a newly published memoir, “Nobody’s Girl.” She died by suicide in Australia in April. (Mr. Epstein died, also in a suicide, while awaiting trial in 2019.)\n\nLast week, a member of Parliament, Rachael Maskell, introduced a bill that would give the king the authority to rescind royal titles on his own initiative. Charles appears to have found another way to do this, though it will require the cooperation of Mr. Lammy, who also serves as deputy prime minister and justice minister. The palace officials said Charles had consulted the government and that it supported him.\n\nMr. Lammy, as the official responsible for maintaining the Peerage Roll, will have to remove the dukedom of York and the other titles. He is expected to comply without delay, which would short-circuit the need for further action in Parliament.\n\nThat is hardly surprising. The Labour government, like its predecessors, has shown no appetite to confront the royal family, reflecting centuries of convention under which the crown and Parliament try to stay out of each other’s affairs.\n\n“I’m delighted,” Chris Bryant, the government’s trade minister, told the BBC about the king taking the initiative. “I’ve felt for a long time this was a necessary step, and I’m glad that it’s happening now.”\n\nOpposition leaders agreed. “The public has no truck whatsoever with any kind of sexual abuse, sexual offenses, especially of minors,” said the leader of the Conservative Party, Kemi Badenoch, in a radio interview.\n\nThe leader of the centrist Liberal Democrats, Ed Davey, said on social media, “It’s clear that Andrew’s position had become totally untenable, having disgraced his office and embarrassed the country.” He added, “This is an important step towards rebuilding trust in our institutions and drawing a line under this whole sorry saga.”\n\nWhether it will definitively do that is not yet clear, though royal watchers said the magnitude of this step dwarfed previous punishments. The king had previously instructed Andrew not to use his Duke of York title and to forgo being addressed as “His Royal Highness.” But Andrew remained a prince, and his other titles were merely held in abeyance.\n\nNow he will lose all those titles, as well as his princely home outside London, the Royal Lodge, from which the king is evicting him. As in many family disputes, real estate proved to be one of the biggest bones of contention.\n\nUnder a deal between Andrew and the Crown Estate, which owns the lodge, he was able to live there for a nominal annual rent — specified, in traditional English terms, as “one peppercorn (if demanded)” — in return for having paid a large sum upfront to renovate the 30-room residence. The BBC reported he had paid around 8 million pounds, or $10.7 million.\n\nCharles could not simply break that “cast-iron lease,” according to palace officials. So the king, the Crown Estate and Andrew negotiated a deal under which Andrew agreed to surrender it. The Crown Estate may compensate Andrew for his investment in the property. He will move to a smaller house on Sandringham, a royal estate northeast of London that the king personally owns.\n\nSarah Ferguson, whom Andrew divorced in 1996 but who continued to live with him in the Royal Lodge, will not move to Sandringham, according to a palace official. Palace officials emphasized that their two daughters, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, would keep their titles.\n\nThat underlines the emotional toll of this drama for the royal family. The palace said that the king had a “duty of care” for Andrew and his daughters. That was another reason for the delay in taking these harsher measures, they said. Although Charles and Andrew are not especially close, according to two people who worked for the palace, the king has been anguished by the human impact of the scandal.\n\nAt the same time, royal watchers said, Charles’s actions showed that he — like Queen Elizabeth II before him — will ultimately put the interests of the crown first. After Andrew gave a disastrous interview in 2019 to the BBC about his friendship with Mr. Epstein, Charles, then the Prince of Wales, called his mother from New Zealand to press her to strip his brother of his public duties.\n\nIt was a moment, royal watchers said, that laid bare Charles’s rising influence in the family. But as king, he has had his own trials. His three-year-old reign has been shadowed by his treatment for cancer. Although he has kept up a busy travel schedule, analysts say his health has impeded his other reform efforts.\n\nNow, in acting decisively to punish Andrew, Charles has moved on at least one of those: He has introduced accountability to an institution often faulted by critics for living by its own rules.\n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5590264","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"20:05:00-12:05","title":"The Best New Albums Out Oct. 31","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article, titled 'The Best New Albums Out Oct. 31,' features a curated list of new music releases from a variety of artists across genres, with a special emphasis on Halloween-themed or spooky music.

A lifelong Democrat who now identifies as an independent, she joked that “they were going to take away my Black card” after she endorsed Mr. Ciattarelli.\n\n“A Newark girl voting for a Republican?” she said with a laugh.\n\nHector Lora, the mayor of Passaic who is supporting Ms. Sherrill, also tipped his hat to Mr. Ciattarelli for his frequent visits to his city of 70,000, where nearly half of the residents were born outside the United States.\n\n“He is everywhere,” Mr. Lora said. “He has spoken to Latino pastors, he’s going to the barbershops. If you welcome him to speak, he will show up.”\n\nMr. Ciattarelli is aiming to repeat the remarkable gains that Mr. Trump made in Passaic. In his first presidential run in 2016, Mr. Trump lost the city by more than 50 points. Last year, Mr. Trump carried the city, which is more than 70 percent Hispanic.\n\nPassaic, both the city and the surrounding county with the same name, is ground zero for how Mr. Trump scrambled the state’s traditional demographic allegiances in 2024. While Mr. Trump did better in each of the state’s 21 counties, compared with his performance four years earlier against former President Joseph R. Biden Jr., his biggest improvements were in the most diverse areas.\n\nDespite his gains, Mr. Trump still lost Hispanic voters nationally, and the Sherrill campaign has worked — in English and in Spanish — to tie Mr. Ciattarelli to a president with sagging approval ratings.\n\nThere is no guarantee that Mr. Ciattarelli can match — let alone surpass — Mr. Trump’s showing last year, when the president did far better than expected, but still lost New Jersey by six points. Mr. Ciattarelli also must exceed his performance from four years ago, when frustration over pandemic-related mandates drove Republicans to the polls and Mr. Ciattarelli came within three points of beating the Democratic incumbent, Gov. Philip D. Murphy.\n\nBut to have any chance to wresting control of a state with roughly 850,000 more registered Democrats than Republicans, Mr. Ciattarelli will have to make inroads in traditional Democratic terrain and with the 2.3 million voters who are not registered with either party.\n\nThe battle for Hispanic voters has been on full display in pre-election editions of the Spanish-language newspaper, El Especialito. As early voting began, Ms. Sherrill and the Democratic ticket were featured in five full-page ads while an interview with Mr. Ciattarelli ran next to a full-page ad of his own.\n\nEl Especialito and another Spanish-language newspaper, Americano, endorsed Ms. Sherrill and ran her photograph on their covers.\n\nShe also has broad institutional party support and last week, ahead of the first weekend of early, in-person voting, she won a key endorsement from nearly 150 Black faith leaders.\n\nOn Saturday, former President Barack Obama is set to be in Newark, the state’s largest city, with Ms. Sherrill. Senator Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat whose mother emigrated from Colombia and whose father is Mexican, is expected to campaign with her on Sunday in West New York and Long Branch.\n\nRepresentative Linda Sánchez, a California Democrat who leads the campaign arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, said policies Mr. Trump had enacted during his second term were eroding the electoral gains he made in 2024.\n\n“Trump’s support among Latinos isn’t growing — it’s crumbling,” she said. “From the rising cost of living to reckless deportation policies, our community feels betrayed.”\n\nBut in New Jersey, Mr. Ciattarelli’s efforts have shown early dividends. He has been endorsed by a handful of Democratic politicians, including Nicholas Sacco, the longtime mayor of North Bergen, in Hudson County. He won an endorsement last week from more than 100 Latino pastors and he is drawing newly minted Republicans like Adela Rohenda to campaign events.\n\nMs. Rohenda is 67 and lives in Jersey City. She traveled to a recent Ciattarelli event in Clifton carrying a Puerto Rican flag. She explained that she first voted for Mr. Trump, in 2016, because her son convinced her that a Trump presidency would give him a better chance at finding a job.\n\nMore recently, she has turned away from the Democratic Party over the issue of crime. “Now I’m Republican,” Ms. Rohenda said in an interview. “I voted Democrat 40 years.”\n\nSome of Ms. Sherrill’s allies have expressed concern that she has been slow to try to make up ground that Mr. Ciattarelli covered extensively while running for governor in three consecutive races.\n\nRafael Collazo, the executive director of UnidosUS Action PAC, which has endorsed Ms. Sherrill, said “the big dynamic is they don’t know her.”\n\n“They don’t want to support Ciattarelli,” he added, “but a lot of them don’t know Mikie Sherrill.”\n\nMs. Sherrill has shown up at Jersey City’s Puerto Rican Day Parade, Perth Amboy’s Hispanic Heritage Month Picnic and Union City’s 50th Annual Hispanic Parade, along with many other cultural events. At the same time, her campaign has invested heavily in Spanish-language advertising, where the Ciattarelli campaign has been mostly absent.\n\nKennith Gonzalez, a former executive director of New Jersey’s Republican Party now helping oversee Hispanic outreach for Mr. Ciattarelli, panned Ms. Sherrill’s ad strategy as cynical.“Let me do all of these Spanish ads only connecting Jack with Trump. And let’s not offer anything, because the Hispanic community is too stupid to really care about the issues,” he said. “We just want to scare them with Trump.”\n\nAs the head of the Statewide Hispanic Chamber of Commerce in New Jersey, Carlos Medina is used to being courted by politicians, but he said there was a feeling among some Black and Hispanic voters “that the Democratic Party has abandoned them and only comes around in an election.”\n\nAfter Ms. Sherrill was unable to attend several events sponsored by the business group, Mr. Medina said he had offered her an “olive branch” to speak virtually to his members at her convenience. Mr. Ciattarelli participated, but she sent her running mate instead. “I was pretty shocked,” he said.\n\nThen, when Democrats used a clip from Mr. Ciattarelli’s appearance to attack him for being dismissive of “Black and Hispanic communities,” Mr. Medina said he was bewildered. “Now I’m being used as some sort of pawn in this argument,” he said in an interview.\n\nSean Higgins, a spokesman for Ms. Sherrill, said she had “partnered directly with Black and Latino communities.”\n\nOf Mr. Ciattarelli’s efforts, he said: “Like a typical career politician, he tells groups what they want to hear — but he has never stood up for the Black or Latino community with his vote or his voice, and has now pledged his loyalty to Trump over the people of New Jersey.”\n\nM. Teresa Ruiz, the Democratic majority leader in the State Senate who is among Ms. Sherrill’s strongest supporters, said the national Democratic Party had to “do much better” speaking with — not over — diverse communities like the one she represented in Newark.\n\n“The work to build back the party has to continue,” she said. “We have to motivate people to get up off the sofas, to feel engaged, to feel recognized.”\n\nJoshua Rodriguez, the pastor of Cityline Church, where Mr. Ciattarelli spoke on Sunday in Jersey City, said he remained puzzled by Mr. Trump’s ability to persuade Latino voters, given his efforts to significantly increase deportations.\n\n“Trump definitely moved the needle a bunch in terms of the Latino vote,” Mr. Rodriguez said. “Will Jack be able to do that? That’s what we’ll find out next week.”\n\nChristine Zhang contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/31/science/nasa-moon-lander-spacex-blue-origin.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"19:34:53-04:00","title":"NASA Gets Moon Lander Plan B’s From SpaceX and Blue Origin","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"NASA is urgently seeking faster alternatives to its Artemis III lunar landing program due to delays in SpaceX’s Starship lander development.

And now, it has some.\n\nOn Wednesday, the space companies owned by two of the richest people on Earth — Elon Musk’s SpaceX and Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin — submitted ideas to the space agency for a faster program to land astronauts near the lunar south pole under the Artemis III mission.\n\nThe proposals follow appearances by Sean Duffy, the secretary of transportation who is temporarily also serving as the head of NASA, on cable news networks last week. He said NASA was looking to accelerate its return-to-the-moon program known as Artemis, and the next landing of NASA astronauts would occur before President Trump’s second term ends in January 2029.\n\nSpaceX currently has a $2.9 billion contract to build a version of its gargantuan Starship rocket to serve as the lander for Artemis III. But after several failed test flights of Starship this year, leaving major technological hurdles yet to be cleared, Mr. Musk’s company is running behind schedule.\n\nThat means that the next footprints on the moon could be made by astronauts from China, which is aiming to send its astronauts to the moon’s surface by 2030.\n\nSeveral weeks ago, NASA went to SpaceX and Blue Origin, which has a contract to build a lander for later Artemis missions, and asked if they could come up with alternative designs for Artemis III that would be quicker to build.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

He has wide latitude as president to make changes, although critics have raised questions about the funding and lack of transparency.\n\nPresident Harry Truman redid the bathroom in 1945, and Mr. Trump has repeatedly criticized its style.\n\nSpeaking to donors this month, Mr. Trump called the bathroom’s style “not good.”\n\n“Art Deco doesn’t go with, you know, 1850 and civil wars and all of the problems,” Mr. Trump said. “But what does is statuary marble. So I ripped it apart and we built the bathroom. It’s absolutely gorgeous and totally in keeping with that time.”\n\nEdward Lengel, who served as the chief historian of the White House Historical Association, said of the photos Mr. Trump posted: “It doesn’t look anything like 1860s interiors to me.”\n\nMichael F. Bishop, the former executive director of the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission, said the bathroom was a sitting room in the president’s day and was unlikely to have included marble.\n\n“The present-day bathroom only takes up a portion of the Lincoln sitting room,” Mr. Bishop said. “They created a bathroom in the corner of this room. Trump’s change to the bathroom is not remotely a crime against historical preservation or anything like that. It was just a fairly dated-looking bathroom.”\n\nThe historian Harold Holzer, the author of many books about Mr. Lincoln, said that when Mr. Lincoln moved into the White House in 1861, there were two water closets on the second floor, including one adjacent to the rooms where he lived with the family.\n\nWhen Mary Todd Lincoln complained about the overall poor condition of the White House, Mr. Holzer said, he reminded her that it was better than any other house they had ever lived in.\n\n“Lincoln had an outhouse in Springfield, and heaven knows what when he lived in log cabins with his parents, so the plain bathroom was fine with him,” Mr. Holzer said. “He thought it was a majestic step up.”\n\nDuring his second term, Mr. Trump has wasted no time making changes to historical elements of the White House, arguing that parts of it are dated or too small. He tore down the entire East Wing, which had stood for more than a century, to make way for a planned 90,000-square-foot, $300 million ballroom that he said was necessary for receiving dignitaries.\n\nHis plans for the size of the ballroom to continue to expand.\n\nMr. Trump has said that he and a group of donors — not the taxpayers — are footing the bill for the ballroom. His staff has released a list of donors, but has not said how much each one has given. The money is being deposited in the Trust for the National Mall, a nonprofit, tax-exempt entity that is not subject to transparency laws.\n\nHe also has added gold moldings and gold decorations throughout the Oval Office, and gold ornaments to the Cabinet Room. He cut down the White House’s historic magnolia tree, which President Andrew Jackson planted in 1829 in memory of his wife, Rachel.\n\nHe removed a photo of Hillary Clinton and replaced it with an image of his own face colored with the American flag. He added marble floors and a chandelier to the Palm Room.\n\nHe paved over the Rose Garden grass to add a patio. Along the West Wing colonnade, he added gold-framed photos of every American president except his predecessor, Joseph R. Biden Jr., whom he depicted as an autopen.\n\nMr. Trump and White House staff members say the president is granted wide latitude to make renovations on the property. Mr. Trump has said he is not subject to zoning regulations or permitting requirements.\n\nJennifer Schuessler and Zachary Small contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/31/climate/national-parks-orphan-wells.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"09:43:56-04:00","title":"He Alone Tracked Leaky Oil Wells in National Parks.

National Parks. He Was Let Go.\n\nPublished: 2025-10-31T09:43:56-04:00\n\nUntil recently, Forrest Smith was the sole employee at the National Park Service responsible for cleaning up dozens of abandoned oil and gas wells at national parks across the country.\n\nBut last month, the Park Service did not renew Mr. Smith’s four-year contract.\n\nNow it is unclear whether anyone will clean up an estimated 93 abandoned wells on federal lands managed by the Park Service. The wells are at high risk of spewing planet-warming gases into the atmosphere and contaminating groundwater, posing significant threats to the environment and public health.\n\n“There’s nobody left in the national parks who can confidently oversee this work with the expertise that I have,” Mr. Smith, 40, said in an interview. “I don’t think you could just pick somebody up and throw them in and expect them to do a really great job.”\n\nOld oil wells dot federal lands across the country. Most were drilled before the national parks were established. In many cases, the companies that owned the wells went bankrupt and deserted the sites, which are often called “orphaned” wells.\n\nScientists have found that orphaned wells can release methane, a powerful greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change, as well as benzene, a chemical linked to leukemia and other blood cancers. Oil and brine can also seep from the wells into aquifers that supply drinking water to nearby communities, research shows.\n\nMr. Smith had held the job since 2019 and said he was surprised that the Trump administration did not retain him, since it has generally prioritized workers and programs focused on fossil fuels, even during the government shutdown. “You’d think that in this administration, the petroleum engineer would be pretty protected,” he said.\n\nDuring the Biden administration, Mr. Smith was part of a four-person team that inspected and plugged abandoned wells with cement. The three other engineers left in recent months after accepting other jobs. The agency did not replace them, and it has not filled Mr. Smith’s role either, citing President Trump’s freeze on hiring civilian federal employees.\n\nElizabeth Peace, a spokeswoman for the Interior Department, which oversees the Park Service, said in an email that the agency does not comment on personnel. She said the Park Service “has made strong progress in meeting the administration’s priorities to identify and plug orphaned wells on park lands,” and that “staffing levels naturally fluctuate as appointments conclude and new positions are filled.”\n\nThrough the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law, Congress approved $4.7 billion for states, tribes and federal agencies like the Park Service and the Forest Service to plug abandoned wells nationwide. “Now that there’s no one to mind the shop, I’m concerned that either these projects will stop happening or there will be no one watching to ensure that our taxpayer dollars are being spent properly,” said Adam Peltz, a lawyer with the Environmental Defense Fund, an advocacy group.\n\nMr. Smith estimated that there are around 2,500 inactive wells on Park Service lands, including 93 that are orphaned. Of those abandoned wells, about 70 are leaking methane, he said.\n\nMethane, which is responsible for roughly a third of all planetary warming, is colorless and odorless. Backpackers recently discovered a leaky well in Ohio’s Cuyahoga Valley National Park because the methane plume was making a loud hissing noise they heard from a nearby trail.\n\nOther leaky wells are spread across the scenic valleys and gorges of Big South Fork National River and Recreation Area in Tennessee and Kentucky. More are dotted across the bayou canals of Louisiana’s Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve.\n\nOverall, there are more than 168,000 orphaned wells within 30 miles of a national park, according to an analysis by two advocacy groups, the National Parks Conservation Association and FracTracker Alliance. There are likely many more wells that have not yet been documented, experts say.\n\n“I don’t think I can underscore enough that this has been a significantly underestimated public health and safety problem,” said Beau Kiklis, associate director of energy and landscape conservation at the National Parks Conservation Association.\n\nOutside of national parks, states are still plugging orphaned wells using grants from the bipartisan infrastructure law. The Interior Department has continued to distribute these grants, even as the Trump administration has clawed back billions of dollars in other climate money. (In July, the agency said grant recipients no longer needed to study the effects of well cleanups on endangered species or historical artifacts.)\n\nIn Pennsylvania, where natural gas has long powered the economy, the state’s environmental protection office is working to plug 59 wells using federal funding, spokesman Neil Shader said in an email. The department has sealed an additional 315 wells since Gov. Josh Shapiro took office in 2023, he said.\n\nAt the Park Service, well-plugging expeditions are complicated affairs. Workers often lug heavy construction equipment across deserts, forests, mountains and other rough terrain. On site, they pump the well pipes with layers of cement, sealing them, according to Mr. Smith.\n\nAfter leaving the Park Service last month, Mr. Smith scrambled to find a new job. His efforts paid off, and this month he started a new position as the director of engineering at TAQ Energy, a Denver-based oil and gas consulting firm.\n\nThere, he has continued to focus on plugging orphaned wells, this time partnering with states and private companies instead of the federal government.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/31/briefing/the-us-was-ordered-to-pay-food-stamp-benefits.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"17:18:24-04:00","title":"The U.S. Was Ordered to Pay Food Stamp Benefits","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal judge ruled that the Trump administration violated the law by refusing to use an emergency fund for the SNAP (food stamp) program during a government shutdown, ordering it to continue paying benefits.

The judge sided with nonprofits and local officials who had warned that many poor Americans rely on the benefits to buy groceries.\n\nIt was the second of two rulings in the span of about an hour that found the administration had acted unlawfully after it had refused to tap an emergency reserve for the SNAP program that was enacted by Congress.\n\nIt is not yet clear, however, when the money might actually reach the roughly 42 million people who receive the federal help, or the amount that they would receive. The judge ordered distribution of funds “as soon as possible,” but the Trump administration has said that distribution could take weeks. The Justice Department could try to appeal, perhaps further delaying aid.\n\nWithout a last-minute intervention, the decades-old safety net program is set to run out of funds on Nov. 1, more than four weeks into a shutdown seemingly without an end in sight. President Trump called last night for the Senate to eliminate the filibuster so it could pass new legislation to fund the government, but the Republican majority leader, John Thune, was not interested.\n\nThe shutdown has also contributed to a shortage in air traffic controllers, who went without their payday this week. It has led to travel delays.\n\nAs we head into the final weekend before Election Day, Democrats in California are optimistic about their effort to pass a redistricting referendum that could oust as many as five Republican House members next year. Polls show the measure passing by a healthy margin, fueled in part by opposition to Trump.\n\nDemocrats are also leading in polls in Virginia and New Jersey, which will each elect a new governor on Tuesday. In New Jersey, their lead is narrow, and the Republican candidate’s path to victory could be through the Black and Hispanic voters Trump made inroads with.\n\nIn other election news:\n\nOhio Republicans pushed through a new congressional map that would give the party 12 red-leaning districts. The G.O.P. now holds 10 of the state’s 15 seats.\n\nNearly 400,000 New Yorkers have already cast early ballots in the mayoral race.\n\nThe war in Ukraine is mostly a drone war: Around 80 percent of the casualties on both sides are coming from drones. To get an edge, the Ukrainian military has turned its drone campaign into a game.\n\nUnits are awarded with points for successful attacks. If a drone operator kills a Russian soldier, that’s 12 points. Capture one? 120 points. Destroying a tank is worth 40. The more points a unit gets, the more weapons and gear it can acquire through a government website.\n\nBadly outnumbered on the nation’s top court, the liberal justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson are split over the best approach. Kagan is diplomatic with the conservatives in an attempt to sway them on crucial votes. Jackson prefers blistering dissents as warnings to the public.\n\nFriction between the two sides is building, as my colleague Jodi Kantor reported.\n\nStorm: The Times went to New River, Jamaica, one of the towns hardest hit by Hurricane Melissa.\n\nEnergy: Despite lower oil prices, Exxon and Chevron pumped more and reported robust profits.\n\nBusiness: Despite the risk of a bubble, Google, Meta, Microsoft and Amazon plan to spend billions more on artificial intelligence.\n\nSudan: Videos of executions and mass casualties that have emerged out of El Fasher stoked fears that Darfur is again plunging into genocidal violence.\n\nBanks: After Jeffrey Epstein died in 2019, JPMorgan alerted the U.S. to about 4,700 potentially suspicious transactions, totaling more than $1 billion.\n\nJobs: The leader of the Navajo Nation has embraced Trump over coal, which has been an economic engine for the region.\n\nRoyals: Andrew Mountbatten Windsor lost his title as prince over his ties to Jeffrey Epstein. Here’s what’s next for him.\n\nSports: Saudi Arabia and Qatar have helped bankroll the World Cup, and have benefited from rule changes that gave them extra rest and home-field advantage.\n\nTech: A.I. is making death threats way more realistic.\n\nSpace: NASA’s chief, Sean Duffy, corrected Kim Kardashian after she repeated the conspiracy theory that the 1969 moon landing had been faked.\n\nGothic novels have evolved since they first emerged in the mid-18th century. Once defined by common themes, the label now mostly describes a foreboding mood or aesthetic, though many still involve bygone transgressions, old wounds and long-forgotten grudges.

Bidding will start around $10 million, because that is the current market rate of the gold used to make it.\n\nThe artwork, which is called “America,” was made by Maurizio Cattelan, the same prankster whose duct-taped banana sold last year for $6.2 million. Cattelan initially created two solid gold toilets, but the first was stolen in 2019 and most likely melted down.\n\nHave a sparkling weekend.\n\nThanks for reading.
