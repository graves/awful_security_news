Andrew Mountbatten Windsor to answer questions about his ties to the late financier and sex offender, the BBC reported on Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  King Charles  stripped Andrew of his title  of prince and  evicted  him from his mansion in the grounds of Windsor Castle on Thursday, responding to the outrage that had built around the royal over years of damaging headlines about his behavior.\n \n\n   \n  Buckingham Palace said the censures were needed even though Andrew has continued to deny the allegations made against him.\n \n\n   \n  In the US, the  King’s move  led to more calls for Andrew to reveal all he knows about Epstein, particularly in the light of the expression of sympathy for victims of abuse in Thursday’s statement from the palace.\n \n\n   \n  The BBC said at least four

(See the recent controversy over  AI actress Tilly Norwood. ) But as loud as the concerns might be, AI continues to grow in the arts.\n \n\n   \n  With more than 146,000 followers on  Instagram alone , Monet is proof that consumers are increasingly open to the idea, even if the industry is riled by it.\n \n\n   \n  Monet’s Apple Music artist profile explains that Monet is “an Al figure presented as a contemporary R&B vocalist in the highly expressive, church-bred, down-to-earth vein of Keyshia Cole, K. Michelle, and Muni Long.”\n \n\n   \n  Monet was designed by Telisha Nikki Jones, a poet from Mississippi who writes the lyrics Monet is seen performing with help from Suno, “a generative artificial intelligence music creation program,” the bio explains.\n \n\n   \n  Monet released a full-length album “Unfolded” in August, which had 24 songs. A seven-track EP, “Pieces Left Behind,” followed in September.\n \n\n   \n  A press release from Monet’s representative touted the AI singer’s “smooth, soulful sound” and “human-like delivery.” But Romel Murphy, who says he’s Monet’s manager and spoke with  CNN’s Victor Blackwell,  insisted that there is no intent to replace human singers and songwriters.\n \n\n   \n  “AI doesn’t replace the artist. That’s not our goal at all. It doesn’t diminish the creativity and doesn’t take away from the human experience,” he said. “It’s a new frontier and like anything would change some people are receptive and some people are apprehensive.”\n \n\n   \n  Billboard recently reported that “in just the past few months, at least six AI or AI-assisted artists have debuted on various Billboard rankings.”\n \n\n   \n  “That figure could be higher, as it’s become increasingly difficult to tell who or what is powered by AI — and to what extent,” according to the publication. “Many of these charting projects, whose music spans every genre from gospel to rock to country, also arrive with anonymous or mysterious origins.”\n \n\n   \n  Murphy doesn’t appear to see an issue and likens it all to the music of Michael Jackson and Prince, who died in 2009 and 2016 respectively.\n \n\n   \n  “They both have music catalogs that are expanding decades to this day. Youth are still listening to those songs and they’re no longer with us and they’re connected to their music,” Murphy said. “So it is the music because they don’t have the history of the contact or the concert live field, but they still love those songs. Music has to evolve as well.”\n \n\n   \n  “We just have to keep the integrity and be intentional about the realness of it and push the music to the world,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Monet’s representative for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, working musicians are – as expected– troubled.\n \n\n   \n  “There is an AI R&B artist who just signed a multimillion-dollar deal … and the person is doing none of the work,” Kehlani  said  of Monet in a now-deleted video posted to TikTok. “This is so beyond out of our control.”\n \n\n   \n  The human singer added: “Nothing and no one on Earth will ever be able to justify AI to me.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/travel/travel-news-holiday-travel-season-planning","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"08:00:00-04:00","title":"It’s time to plan holiday trips","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"This travel news round-up highlights key trends and advice for holiday travelers in late 2025, including optimal flight booking times, rising demand for travel, and warnings about potential travel disruptions due to staffing shortages during the government shutdown.

super-luxurious overnight train in Italy.\n \n\n   \n    Holiday travel preview\n \n\n   \n  Have you thought about holiday travel yet? Time is just about up if you want the best deals on flights for Thanksgiving and Christmas, according to travel company Kayak, which uses search data to analyze trends. The booking “sweet spot for holiday savings” stretches from mid-October to early November, the company says.\n \n\n   \n  Holiday travel set a record in the US last year, and it’s forecast to surpass 2024 levels. Aviation analytics firm Cirium told CNN that passenger bookings on major US airlines for Thanksgiving are up 2.2 percent from last year.\n \n\n   \n  Reservations for Christmas week are up as well, but less than 1 percent, Cirium said.\n \n\n   \n  Hoping to avoid the crowds?  Kayak suggests  flying out for Thanksgiving on Monday, November 24. That day will be the cheapest. As for Christmas, the most affordable day to fly domestically or internationally will be Christmas Eve.\n \n\n   \n  A rush of passengers would be welcome news to America’s travel industry, which the U.S. Travel Association estimates has lost out on $1 billion in consumer spending every week of the government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Air traffic controller staffing shortages have already caused delays at facilities across the country during the monthlong shutdown, and it could get worse.\n \n\n   \n  Americans could face a travel “disaster” as Thanksgiving approaches, Vice President JD Vance and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy  warned on Thursday , after a roundtable at the White House with aviation, travel and union leaders.\n \n\n   \n  “Look it could be a disaster. It really could be, because at that point you’re talking about people have missed three paychecks. They’ve missed four paychecks. How many of them are not going to show up for work?” Vance said.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s going to lead to massive delays,” he continued.\n \n\n   \n  At LaGuardia Airport in New York earlier this week, Duffy said safety would never be compromised, but staffing shortages often result in slower rates of departures and arrivals.\n \n\n   \n  “If we have issues, we will slow it down,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  AAA recommends travelers arrive at the airport extra early in case of TSA security line delays caused by potential staffing shortages.\n \n\n   \n    Still time to get spooked\n \n\n   \n  Halloween weekend’s not over yet, and some “spooky explorers” hunt for ghosts all year long. Here’s why paranormal tourists  spend big money on terrifying trips . And ghosts aren’t the only attractions around the globe that are  macabre and mysterious .\n \n\n   \n    Italy’s ‘dolce vita’ just got sweeter\n \n\n   \n  A luxurious new train service in Italy is giving travelers a taste of the good life while spiriting them through the stunning countryside, with glimpses of Tuscany’s famed hill towns.  CNN spent 24 hours on board .\n \n\n   \n  The aptly named Dolce Vita Orient Express, which was unveiled earlier this year, is Italy’s first homegrown luxury train. It’s meant to evoke the panache of post-war Italy as exemplified by the films of Federico Fellini, including,  chiaramente , the 1960 classic, “La Dolce Vita.”\n \n\n   \n  Travelers can choose among 18 itineraries. A single day on the train is a 24-hour fever dream of wood paneling, wine and pampering. And it all begins at Rome’s updated Ostiense station.\n \n\n   \n  While train travel is often the way to go in Europe, it continues to face obstacles in the US.  America’s fast train  — NextGen Acela — made its public debut on August 27, but the new trains are rarely able to reach their max speed of 160 miles per hour because of the tracks they’re riding on.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Welcome to Paradise’\n \n\n   \n  After Anesu Masube’s mother died shortly before Christmas in 2017, he rushed back to his native Zimbabwe from Washington, DC, and he expected it to be  the worst flight of his life .\n \n\n   \n  His last-minute booking saddled him with the middle seat, which is especially uncomfortable for someone like Masube, who’s 6-foot-3-inches tall.\n \n\n   \n  But he managed to get moved to an exit row where the woman beside him greeted him by saying with a smile, “Welcome to Paradise.”\n \n\n   \n    In case you missed it\n \n\n   \n   Are American tourists easily distinguishable from Canadians? \n \n\n   \n  Let  the debate  begin.\n \n\n   \n   A private phone number, secret opening times, and no interest in Michelin. \n \n\n   \n  Inside one of Tokyo’s  invite-only  restaurants.\n \n\n   \n   This new tech could save old languages from dying out \n \n\n   \n  It’s a  robot  that’s works like a talking Elmo   toy.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/politics/early-voting-elections-nyc-virginia-new-jersey","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"09:00:00Z","title":"What early voting data says about NYC, Virginia and New Jersey elections","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Early voting data from New Jersey, Virginia, and New York City suggests that Democratic candidates are in stronger positions than Kamala Harris was at the same point in 2024.

2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Early voting data suggests that  Democratic candidates for governor in New Jersey and Virginia  are heading into the final weekend in a slightly stronger position than Kamala Harris was at the same time last year.\n \n\n   \n  In New York City,  Andrew Cuomo  may be in a stronger position than in the primary, but there are signs of increased activity from younger voters, a key part of  Zohran Mamdani’s base .\n \n\n   \n  CNN’s experts analyzed the pre-election voting data in all three locations, comparing to 2024 in New Jersey and Virginia to better reflect the changes in early voting patterns over the last four years.\n \n\n   \n  Although early voting analysis can provide hints about which candidates may be well positioned heading into November 4, it is impossible to know who pre-election voters supported or how candidates will do on Election Day, when many of the ballots will be cast.\n \n\n   \n    New Jersey: A Democratic turnout advantage\n \n\n   \n  In New Jersey, Democrats have turned out at a higher rate than Republican voters in both mail and early in-person voting, putting the Democratic candidate for governor, US Rep. Mikie Sherrill, in a stronger position than Harris was last year at this point. Harris eventually won the state by about 6 points.\n \n\n   \n  Through the end of Thursday, registered Democrats led registered Republicans in mail ballot returns by over 41 points, a couple of points better than the 39-point gap at this point last year. But unlike last year, Democrats also hold a nearly 2-point lead in in-person early voting. Last year at this time, Democrats trailed in in-person voting by 2 points.\n \n\n   \n  Mail ballots also represent a larger portion of the pre-election vote so far. As a result, registered Democrats represent a larger share of the total pre-election electorate than they did at this point last year.\n \n\n   \n    New York City: Older voters have turned out more; younger voters are catching up\n \n\n   \n  Among registered Democrats, a group that will make up the lion’s share of New York City mayoral voters, older voters have turned out more so far than they did during the primary, when strong backing from younger voters helped propel Mamdani to a surprise victory. But the electorate is still younger than in past mayoral elections and has only been getting younger as the week has gone on.\n \n\n   \n  A CNN analysis of early voting data from the New York City Board of Elections has found that through October 31, about 53% of registered Democratic voters (55% of all voters so far) are ages 50 and up, while almost 16% of Democratic voters are ages 18 to 29 (15% of voters overall).\n \n\n   \n  That’s more weighted towards older voters than the total Democratic   primary electorate, when about 48% were 50 or older and about 18% of voters were 18-29, according to data from L2.\n \n\n   \n  Polls have shown that younger voters overwhelmingly favor Mamdani, while Cuomo, who is running as an independent, has a smaller lead among older voters.\n \n\n   \n  This year’s turnout is still younger than the city’s last mayoral election in 2021, when just 9% of voters were ages 18 to 29 and 62% were ages 50 and older.\n \n\n   \n  Over the course of the week, daily turnout among Democrats has gotten younger: while older voters outnumbered younger ones by about 50 percentage points on the first day of early voting, that dropped below 20 points on the seventh day.\n \n\n   \n  The geographic distribution of Democratic votes has also been more favorable to Cuomo than it was in the June primary, with turnout strongest so far in precincts where Cuomo did best and relatively weaker in strong Mamdani areas. The most Cuomo-friendly precincts have cast 125% of their primary early in-person totals while the most Mamdani-friendly precincts have cast 85% of their early voting totals.\n \n\n   \n  Still, if the precinct-level Mamdani vs. Cuomo vote from the primary stayed the same, the changes so far in geographic distribution alone wouldn’t be nearly enough for Cuomo to overtake Mamdani among Democratic early voters.\n \n\n   \n    Virginia: Spanberger appears in slightly stronger position\n \n\n   \n  While voters don’t register by party in Virginia, the geographic breakdown of votes cast so far suggests Democratic candidate Abigail Spanberger is in slightly stronger position heading into the final stretch than Harris was at the same point in last year’s election, when she won Virginia by less than 6 points.\n \n\n   \n  The geographic distribution of early in-person votes has slightly favored Republicans, while the distribution of mail ballots is similar to what it was at this point last year. But mail ballots, in which Democrats typically perform better, make up a larger share of the pre-election vote this year (24%) than they did at this point last year (21%), resulting in a geographic breakdown of the combined pre-election vote that is more Democratic-leaning relative to the same point in the 2024 election.\n \n\n   \n  Through Thursday, counties where Trump won last year are averaging 61% of their in-person votes cast at the equivalent point last year, while Harris-won counties are at just over 57%. The worst performing counties so far have been places where Trump won more than 75% of the vote – they’re at just 54% of the in-person votes they’d cast at this point last year.\n \n\n   \n  And that gap between Trump- and Harris-won counties has been narrowing over the course of the last week, dropping from 10 points to 4 points now, largely coinciding with an increased number of voting locations opening in large Democratic-leaning counties such as  Arlington  and  Fairfax .\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/politics/obama-campaign-nj-virginia-election","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-04:00","title":"Obama to campaign for Sherrill, Spanberger on Saturday in home stretch of governor elections","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Former President Barack Obama is actively campaigning in Virginia and New Jersey during the final weekend of the 2025 gubernatorial elections, supporting Democratic candidates Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill.

Abigail Spanberger, the Democrat facing Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears in Virginia’s governor race, in Norfolk early Saturday afternoon. In the evening, he will be in Newark with Rep. Mikie Sherrill, who is taking on GOP former state lawmaker Jack Ciattarelli in New Jersey’s gubernatorial contest.\n \n\n   \n  Nine years after leaving office, Obama remains the Democratic Party’s most powerful surrogate — a reality underscored by his high-profile appearances on the final weekend of two of 2025’s most important contests. Obama has also  stepped up his warnings  about what he says is the damage being wrought to the country by President Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n  He’s the closer after a number of ambitious Democrats have  also hit the trail  for the two candidates. The list of Democratic governors to campaign with Spanberger and Sherrill includes Kentucky’s Andy Beshear, Maryland’s Wes Moore, Illinois’ JB Pritzker, Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro and Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer.\n \n\n   \n  Former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, in a Thursday appearance with Sherrill, touted their efforts to secure funding for the Gateway Tunnel, a rail project between New Jersey and New York City, and lambasted Trump’s decision to terminate that project.\n \n\n   \n  “The problem is that Jack Ciattarelli knows that standing up for New Jersey would require standing up to Donald Trump, and he just doesn’t have the backbone to do that,” Buttigieg said.\n \n\n   \n  Obama has slowly ramped up his involvement in both gubernatorial elections. He cut ads for both candidates that began airing in mid-October.\n \n\n   \n  After voting in Bridgewater on Friday, Ciattarelli — whose near miss in the 2021 New Jersey governor’s race was an early indicator of the state’s rightward shift in the 2024 presidential race, when Trump closed his losing margin from 16 percentage points in 2020 to 6 points last year — downplayed any impact Obama’s appearance with Sherrill might have in the closing days of the campaign.\n \n\n   \n  “This is what I refer to as the choreography of campaigns, but at the end of day, I really believe this, particularly in New Jersey, a candidate has to win the race, and that’s why I get up and down the state every day and engage with people every day, shake hands every single day.” Ciattarelli said. “I think we’ve done that a hell of a lot better than my opponent.”\n \n\n   \n  The Virginia and New Jersey governor’s races, which are held a year after presidential elections, are widely viewed as an important gauge of the nation’s political mood almost a year into a new presidency. One year into Obama’s White House tenure, Republican Bob McDonnell’s win in Virginia and Chris Christie’s win in New Jersey offered previews of the red wave that was to come in the 2010 midterms.\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger and Sherrill are favored in the blue-leaning states, but wins are no lock: Four years ago, Republican Glenn Youngkin won the Virginia governor race; in New Jersey, Sherrill hasn’t been able to pull away after several public polls found her with a single-digit edge over Ciattarelli.\n \n\n   \n  Both of Obama’s Saturday stops — Newark and Norfolk — are in areas with significant Black populations. Over the last several election cycles he has appeared often with Virginia Democratic candidates at base-rallying events in the Hampton Roads region.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/politics/snap-benefits-november-most-affected-vis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"11:20:00-05:00","title":"Millions of Americans Could Face Delays in SNAP Food Assistance Due to Government Shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Due to a government shutdown, millions of Americans relying on SNAP food assistance faced delays in receiving their monthly benefits in November 2025.

\nUpdated: \n        8:00 AM EDT, Sat November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump has made it clear that his favorite method to gain leverage over opponent countries on the other side of a negotiating table is to  raise tariffs . It doesn’t matter whether the offense is trade-related or not.\n \n\n   \n  If there had been any lingering doubt (and I doubt there was), it was erased when Trump announced last week that he was  increasing tariffs  on Canada by 10% because he didn’t like an  anti-tariff commercial  Ontario aired across the United States. Ontario Premier Doug Ford’s TV ad quoted the late former President Ronald Reagan, who in 1987 criticized the use of general tariffs as a weapon of trade policy.\n \n\n   \n  It might seem obvious that there is no direct causal trade link between Ontario’s and, by extension Canada’s, action and Trump’s threat of raising Canada’s tariffs by 10%. Nevertheless, Trump’s response was hardly a surprise.\n \n\n   \n  The Canadian incident shows countries on the other side of the negotiating table with the United States face a near-impossible situation.\n \n\n   \n  First, they must negotiate trade deals by coming to Washington with a transactional mindset: “What can we offer up?”\n \n\n   \n  Second, they must, at the last minute, be prepared for the US president to want more — so they better have something else up their sleeve they can give as an offering.\n \n\n   \n  And there’s a third wrinkle: Never mind reciprocal tariffs — the United States is in the business of retaliatory tariffs for seemingly unrelated issues. It means no country can know what decision, policy or indiscretion will offend Trump, who may retaliate at virtually any time with further tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  This is uncharted territory, and it is not the normal way of doing business. Traditionally, tariffs have been used to correct a perceived trade imbalance and to protect the home market by making imports more expensive.\n \n\n   \n  What seems clear is that Trump’s love of tariffs will ensure they remain at the heart of US economic policy. I see no scenario in which the president, even after having negotiated a trade deal, doesn’t reserve to himself the right unilaterally to change his mind, threaten and then launch a fresh tariff.\n \n\n   \n  Some of Trump’s tariffs contain at least a scintilla of geo-political logic. For example, his decision to punish India with 50% tariffs came because the country is still buying oil from Russia. One could – just about – argue the tariff was supporting some wider, strategic goal in halting the Russia-Ukraine war.\n \n\n   \n  With others, it remains difficult or impossible to understand the trade purpose of tariffs. Take Brazil’s case: Trump thinks it’s wrong to prosecute the former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro for allegedly plotting to overturn an election. Describing the prosecution as “a witch hunt that should end immediately,” Trump raised the tariff to 50% due “in part to Brazil’s insidious attacks on Free Elections, and the fundamental Free Speech Rights of Americans.” (The previous tariff had been around 10%.)\n \n\n   \n  According to the Brazilian Specialty Coffee Association, exports of special coffees are now down 70% and the IMF is warning of a more general slowdown in Brazil’s economy because of the tariffs.  The tariff weapon has hit its mark.\n \n\n   \n  Then there’s Colombia. After Colombian President Gustavo Petro criticized Trump’s bombings of alleged drug smugglers off the Caribbean coast, Trump called Petro “an illegal drug leader” who is “low rated” and very unpopular. The punishment: cutting off foreign aid and an unspecified increase in tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  For a country where democracy is often fragile at best, the economic disruption from increased tariffs could have devastating political effects.\n \n\n   \n  Trump also imposed steep tariffs on South Africa for its perceived ill treatment of White farmers and land reforms.\n \n\n   \n  The list goes on. Last week’s threat against Canada only confirmed the trend.\n \n\n   \n  After the last few weeks and months, countries have been warned. No one should be surprised if and when the weapon is fired.\n \n\n   \n  So far, the only country that has stood up to Trump and won is China. Xi Jinping has mastered the careful art of letting Trump appear to win while quietly claiming victory at home.  Xi played his hand perfectly  and came away from their meeting this past week with a reduction in tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  But there’s one final wrinkle: The US Supreme Court next week will hear Trump’s appeal of two lower court rulings that found his use of tariffs as leverage to be an illegal use of his emergency powers. If the Supreme Court upholds those rulings, Trump’s favorite tool could be significantly blunted.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/business/berkshire-hathaway-profits-buffett","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"10:02:00-04:00","title":"Berkshire profit rises, cash soars to record","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Berkshire Hathaway reported a 34% increase in operating profit and a 17% rise in net income, driven by gains on its stock investments, while simultaneously increasing its cash reserves to a record $381.7 billion.

1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Fighting for control of the strategic hub of Pokrovsk in eastern  Ukraine  is intensifying, with the Russian Defense Ministry claiming to have eliminated a group of Ukrainian special forces sent to help defend the area.\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks,  Russian  units have begun penetrating Pokrovsk itself and have closed in on the last resupply routes used to sustain Ukrainian forces in the town.\n \n\n   \n  The Ukrainian special forces had landed in a helicopter on the northwestern outskirts of Pokrovsk, according to the Russian Defense Ministry. Drone footage shared by an unofficial Russian Telegram channel showed Ukrainian soldiers fanning out from a Blackhawk helicopter. Eleven of the troops that had landed were killed, the Defense ministry claimed. It’s unclear when the mission took place.\n \n\n   \n  A source in Ukrainian intelligence told CNN that the claim was untrue. Stabilization efforts led by the head of Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence Kyrylo Budanov continue in Pokrovsk, the source added.\n \n\n   \n  The Ukrainian 7th Aerial Assault Corps also said there had been a successful landing in the Pokrovsk area. “It was a complex operation that required the synchronized actions of various units,” it said.\n \n\n   \n  Ukrainian units have managed to improve their tactical position in several districts of the city, according to the Corps. “We are increasing the number of assault groups in Pokrovsk,” it said, adding that 85 Russian soldiers had been killed in Pokrovsk over the past week.\n \n\n   \n  The Ukrainian military’s commander, General Oleksandr Syrskyi, said Saturday that Pokrovsk and the neighboring town of Myrnohrad were “not surrounded or blocked, and we are doing everything we can to maintain logistics.”\n \n\n   \n  “A comprehensive operation to destroy and dislodge enemy forces from Pokrovsk is ongoing,” Syrskyi said, adding that he had visited the area to coordinate its defense.\n \n\n   \n  Enemy units continued “to attempt to infiltrate residential areas and cut off our supply routes,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  For its part, the Russian Defense Ministry asserted Saturday that its units “continue to destroy surrounded Ukrainian Armed Forces formations in the area of the railway station” in Pokrovsk, and had repelled several attempts by Ukrainian forces to break out of the town. It added that the encirclement of Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad was tightening.\n \n\n   \n  President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Tuesday that about 200 Russian troops had infiltrated Pokrovsk. Geolocated video has shown Russian soldiers in the southern part of the town, moving in small groups.\n \n\n   \n  Ukrainian forces have tried to counter-attack, according to the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War, and had marginally advanced north of the town.\n \n\n   \n  Were Pokrovsk to fall, it would be the largest urban area to be taken by Russian forces since they seized Bakhmut in May 2023. The town is a junction for road and railway lines and occupying it would bring Russian forces closer to the larger cities of Kramatorsk and Kostiantynivka in the industrial belt of Donetsk.\n \n\n   \n  According to the unofficial Ukrainian DeepState website, which analyzes the battlefield, Russian forces gained 267 square kilometers of Ukrainian territory in October — the same as in September.\n \n\n   \n  Efforts by the US President Donald Trump to get a ceasefire agreed in Ukraine have come to nothing, with the Kremlin insisting that the root causes of the conflict - including NATO’s expansion eastwards and what it has called the “Nazification” of Ukraine - must be addressed before there can be a truce.\n \n\n   \n  Moscow has said that the original goals of what it calls its Special Military Operation are non-negotiable: sovereignty over four eastern regions of Ukraine, including Donetsk.\n \n\n   \n    Pipelines blown up\n \n\n   \n  As Russian forces edge forward along several parts of the frontline, Ukraine have continued their long-range efforts to destroy and disrupt Russia’s energy and military infrastructure.\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, Ukrainian saboteurs blew up up three pipelines carrying fuel in the Moscow region, according to the country’s defense officials – the latest attack in a campaign by Kyiv to target refineries, pumping stations and pipelines.\n \n\n   \n  “The ‘Koltsevoy’ oil pipeline, which supplied the Russian occupation army,” was disabled on Friday in a special operation, according to a statement from Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence (DI).\n \n\n   \n  It published an image showing what appeared to be devices placed on three separate pipelines near Ramenskoye, south of Moscow, which were under anti-drone netting. Video published by DI showed an explosion that sent flames hundreds of meters into the air.\n \n\n   \n  “All three lines used by the aggressor to transport gasoline, diesel, and aviation fuel were successfully and simultaneously blown up,” DI said.\n \n\n   \n  Unlike many recent attacks using drones and missiles, the Ukrainians used a sabotage team to lay explosive devices at the site, according to the DI video.\n \n\n   \n  There’s been no word from the Russian authorities on the explosion nor on any disruption to fuel supplies. But the local authorities in the nearby district of Zhukovsky reported power cuts for some consumers on Friday without specifying the cause.\n \n\n   \n  The pipeline that forms a ring around Moscow is fed from several refineries. It is capable of pumping up to 3 million tons of aviation fuel, up to 2.8 million tons of diesel fuel, and up to 1.6 million tons of gasoline annually, according to DI.\n \n\n   \n  Ukraine began  targeting  Russian energy infrastructure on a persistent basis in the summer, using longer-range drones and missiles to attack facilities deep inside Russian territory.\n \n\n   \n  “Our strikes have had more impact than the sanctions [against Russia]” said Budanov. “We have caused much greater damage to the Russian Federation through direct action than any economic levers of influence that have been introduced so far.”\n \n\n   \n  Ukraine’s President Zelensky said earlier this month that as much as  20%  of Russian refining capacity had been taken out of action, and several Russian regions have reported petrol shortages.\n \n\n   \n  Russia has imported more fuel from Belarus to compensate for the shortages.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/americas/rescue-efforts-storm-melissa-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"07:19:00-04:00","title":"Caribbean islands reel from Hurricane Melissa’s devastating impact as storm heads north","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, one of the most powerful Atlantic storms in over 150 years, devastated the Caribbean, with Jamaica suffering the worst impacts as a Category 5 storm, resulting in complete destruction in coastal areas like Black River, over 15 feet of storm surge, and at least 50 deaths.

reel from Hurricane Melissa’s devastating impact as storm heads north \n       \n  By Sophie Tanno, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:19 AM EDT, Sat November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Rescue efforts are underway across the Caribbean after  Hurricane Melissa  tore through the region as one of the most powerful Atlantic storms in more than 150 years.\n \n\n   \n  Torrential downpours and forceful winds have  already unleashed  widespread destruction along the storm’s path in Jamaica, Cuba and the Bahamas.\n \n\n   \n  Melissa lashed Bermuda as a Category 1 storm overnight Thursday into Friday as the storm passed the islands, bringing quick-hitting bursts of strong wind and rain. The storm is expected to weaken and become post-tropical as it races south of Newfoundland into cooler Atlantic water.\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of the storm, authorities in Bermuda closed the Causeway – a transport link connecting the main island with the smaller St. David’s Island. All schools will be shut and ferries canceled on Friday, among other measures, out of an “abundance of caution,” said Michael Weeks, Bermuda’s national security minister, according to Reuters.\n \n\n   \n  The storm has damaged homes, caused severe flooding and widespread power outages, and forced the evacuation of hundreds of thousands across the Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n  At least 50 people are known to have died, Reuters reported, though the full toll of the catastrophic storm may take days or weeks to be determined.\n \n\n   \n  Emergency officials have begun to pick up the pieces, clearing roads to reach isolated communities in need of relief, as several international efforts have also been launched.\n \n\n   \n  The regional Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART), activated by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on October 29, has deployed and will be on the ground today.\n \n\n   \n    Jamaica hardest hit\n \n\n   \n  Jamaica took the  heaviest battering . Melissa made landfall there as a  Category 5 storm , with estimated maximum sustained winds of 185 mph (295 kph).\n \n\n   \n  “Complete and utter destruction” is how CNN’s Derek Van Dam described the streets of Jamaica’s hard-hit coastal town of Black River on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  People gathering around the Black River Bridge searched for water, food and news about their loved ones. The Jamaican Defense Forces have landed in the area by helicopter, but desperation is setting in for residents, Van Dam reported. Many are trying to leave the area with their personal items by car, motorbike or on foot.\n \n\n   \n  Black River is dealing with the aftermath of over 15 feet of storm surge from Hurricane Melissa, which devastated the infrastructure of the town in the southwestern part of the island.\n \n\n   \n  The heat and humidity are complicating recovery efforts. There is a makeshift refugee camp of people who rode out the storm, but nothing remains standing.\n \n\n   \n  “Everything is gone,” one Black River resident, Britney Samms, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Looting was reported in the area. Van Dam described it as “a matter of survival.”\n \n\n   \n  “What once was paradise is now hell on earth,” he said of the town, first established in the 17 th  century and lately known as a center for environmental tourism.\n \n\n   \n  But the CNN team also witnessed signs of hope. Amid the chaos, there were moments of laughter and exchanges of hugs, as loved ones reunited after the storm.\n \n\n   \n  In Montego Bay on Jamaica’s northwestern coast, Alfred Hines, 77, told how he waded barefoot through mud to escape rising floodwaters. Speaking to Reuters on Wednesday, he said: “At one stage, I see the water at my waist and (after) about 10 minutes’ time, I see it around my neck here and I make my escape.”\n \n\n   \n  Authorities in Jamaica have recovered at least four bodies in the badly hit St. Elizabeth Parish, a source in the government told CNN on Wednesday. The Jamaica Constabulary Force confirmed eight more deaths on Thursday in Westmoreland, Hanover and St. James.\n \n\n   \n  Three people also died during storm preparations.\n \n\n   \n  Around 25,000 tourists remained in Jamaica as the country emerged from the storm, education minister Dana Morris Dixon said in a Tuesday  statement .\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, more than 13,000 residents were still in shelters, while 72% of the island was without power,  Jamaican government officials  said.\n \n\n   \n  Overall, the country’s infrastructure has taken a battering, leaving it “severely compromised,” according to Desmond McKenzie, minister for local government and community development.\n \n\n   \n  A CNN crew observed residents and military personnel pushing more than a dozen ambulances past storm debris in the town of Santa Cruz as the medical convoy headed to a coastal area in western Jamaica, which was hit hard.\n \n\n   \n  Schools around the capital Kingston on the eastern side of the island are expected to reopen Monday, Dixon, the education minister, said in a news conference Thursday.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Extensive damage’ in Cuba\n \n\n   \n  Cuba was also hit hard after the hurricane made landfall there as a Category 3 storm on Wednesday. The country sustained “extensive damage,” according to President Miguel Díaz-Canel.\n \n\n   \n  This included flooding, mudslides, property destruction and infrastructure damage, particularly in Cuba’s eastern regions, where hundreds of rural communities were left isolated.\n \n\n   \n  As many as 140,000 people were cut off due to rising rivers as the storm passed, according to  the Red Cross . In the province of Santiago, at least 241 communities were cut off due to the storm, Reuters reported.\n \n\n   \n  More than 735,000 people were evacuated in Cuba as Melissa approached.\n \n\n   \n  Cuba’s foreign ministry said it is in touch with the US State Department to get clarity on how the United States would be willing to help with recovery.\n \n\n   \n  Rubio  announced  earlier Thursday that the US is “prepared to provide immediate humanitarian assistance” to the Cuban people – both directly and through local partners.\n \n\n   \n  The administration of President Donald Trump has historically taken a hard-line stance against the communist-ruled island. In June, the president signed a  memorandum  that the White House said would increase pressure on the Cuban government and support the long-running US economic embargo of the island.\n \n\n   \n  Rubio said Thursday that US law includes exemptions that authorize private donations of food, medicine and other humanitarian goods to Cuba, as well as disaster response.\n \n\n   \n  Cuban Deputy Foreign Minister Carlos Fernández de Cossío responded to the offer by  saying : “We have been in contact with the State Department and are awaiting clarification on how and in what way they are willing to assist.”\n \n\n   \n  Cuba is already receiving some aid from partners such as China and Venezuela, as well as the United Nations.\n \n\n   \n    High death toll in Haiti\n \n\n   \n  The highest death toll so far has been reported in Haiti, where the hurricane did not make direct landfall but caused significant damage and at least 30 deaths, Reuters said. Twenty of these fatalities, including 10 children, were due to flooding in Petit-Goâve, where a flooded river burst its banks.\n \n\n   \n  Steven Guadard, who lives in Petit-Goâve, told the  Associated Press  the storm killed his entire family.\n \n\n   \n  “I had four children at home: a 1-month-old baby, a 7-year-old, an 8-year-old and another who was about to turn 4,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    International efforts\n \n\n   \n  The United Kingdom said on Wednesday it was  deploying  £2.5 million ($3.3 million) in emergency humanitarian funding. The British government also said it was chartering a limited number of flights to help British nationals leave Jamaica.\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, the UK pledged an additional an additional 5 million pounds ($6.5 million).\n \n\n   \n  China’s ambassador to Cuba shared a video on  social media  on Tuesday showing hundreds of boxes labeled as “family kit” being transported from a warehouse.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/science/nasa-moon-lunar-lander-options","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"09:32:00-04:00","title":"Inside NASA’s scramble to find a backup moon plan — and the wild ideas companies are pitching","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"NASA is actively reconsidering its lunar lander strategy for the Artemis III mission due to delays in SpaceX’s Starship development and rising competition from China.

  \nUpdated: \n        9:32 AM EDT, Sat November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A suggestion made last week by acting NASA administrator Sean Duffy that SpaceX could be booted from the agency’s upcoming moon-landing plans has rocked the space industry.\n \n\n   \n  Now, behind the scenes, pitches for alternate paths to the lunar surface are quietly starting to take shape.\n \n\n   \n  SpaceX currently has a $2.9 billion contract to prepare its gargantuan Starship rocket system to ferry astronauts to the moon’s surface as part of NASA’s Artemis III mission. However, citing delays in Starship’s development and competitive pressure from China, NASA asked SpaceX and Blue Origin — which holds a separate lunar lander contract with the space agency — to submit plans to expedite development of their respective spacecraft by October 29.  Both companies have responded.\n \n\n   \n  But the space agency is also asking the broader commercial space industry to detail how they might get the job done more quickly, hinting that NASA leadership is prepared to sideline its current partners.\n \n\n   \n  CNN spoke with half a dozen companies about how they plan to respond to NASA’s call to action, which the agency will formally issue once the government shutdown ends, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  While some of the potential proposals appear more straightforward than the current moon-landing plan that uses Starship, each involves constructing and testing new spacecraft designs, a process that typically takes at least six or seven years, noted Casey Drier, the chief of space policy at the nonprofit exploration advocacy group Planetary Society.\n \n\n   \n  This could pose an issue for NASA’s timeline. China aims to land its astronauts on the lunar surface by 2030, and Duffy has repeatedly indicated he views beating China as a national security imperative.\n \n\n   \n  Artemis III is currently slated to happen as early as mid-2027, and NASA has signaled that the current pace of Starship development is threatening to push that target months or years into the future.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s a certain part of the moon that everyone knows is the best,” Duffy said, referring to the moon’s largely unexplored south pole region — the target landing site for NASA’s Artemis III astronauts.\n \n\n   \n  “We have ice there. We have sunlight there. We want to get there first and claim that for America,” he said in  August .\n \n\n   \n  Experts who spoke with CNN for this article said that reevaluating SpaceX’s lunar lander contract could be wise. Spending years to develop an entirely new spacecraft could still potentially be faster, some argued, than waiting for Starship, which presents extremely difficult engineering challenges due to its sheer size and unprecedented design.\n \n\n   \n  Still, SpaceX has ticked a few boxes that might give it a significant leg up on the competition. Though in light of NASA’s broader lunar ambitions, experts say the real contest is about much more than speed.\n \n\n   \n    More power, more problems\n \n\n   \n  Touted as the most powerful rocket system ever built, Starship has launched on 11 eye-popping suborbital test flights, relighting engines in space, reusing boosters and demonstrating the ability to deploy satellites along the way.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement posted to its website on Thursday, SpaceX also said it has “completed 49 milestones tied to developing the subsystems, infrastructure, and operations needed to land astronauts on the Moon.” And the “vast majority” of its contractual testing milestones for NASA have happened on schedule, according to the company.\n \n\n   \n  NASA did not immediately respond to a request for comment on SpaceX’s claims.\n \n\n   \n  Starship has also faced significant setbacks — particularly this year. In the first six months of 2025, three prototype vehicles exploded during test flights and another burst into flames during routine ground testing, causing damage to SpaceX’s surrounding infrastructure in Texas. The hangups prompted national security hawks to voice worries that SpaceX won’t deliver Starship in time to realize NASA’s goals.\n \n\n   \n  Under the current plan, NASA would launch its astronauts aboard the Orion capsule atop the Space Launch System rocket, both of which NASA developed. After reaching lunar orbit, the astronauts would transfer to Starship, which would ferry two people down to the moon’s surface and then back to lunar orbit.\n \n\n   \n  But Starship is likely still a long way from being capable of carrying out such an endeavor.  So far, the company has only attempted to fly Starship on hour-long, suborbital test flights. It has not yet sent a vehicle to orbit on an operational mission, nor has it attempted to top off Starship’s fuel during a flight — a step that will be necessary for lunar missions because of Starship’s massive size and design.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not clear how many refueling flights would need to be launched prior to Starship carrying out Artemis III. As CNN previously reported, the number could be  anywhere from 10 to 40 . And transferring cryogenic propellants, of the kind Starship relies on, has never been attempted before with any spacecraft.\n \n\n   \n  “SpaceX is not going to be able to make this work before 2030,” said Doug Loverro, a former chief of human spaceflight at NASA, expressing a sentiment recently  echoed  by two prior NASA administrators.\n \n\n   \n  The company did not provide details about its plan to expedite work on the NASA contract. SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment from CNN, nor does the company typically answer questions from reporters.\n \n\n   \n    Retrofitting Blue Moon\n \n\n   \n  One alternative option that Duffy mentioned during a TV blitz last week is using a spacecraft built by Blue Origin. The Jeff Bezos-funded company already has a contract to provide lunar landers for use later in the Artemis program, including the Artemis V mission.\n \n\n   \n  And because Blue Origin already has an Artemis contract, it could be simpler for NASA to switch up the order in which it relies on its contractors rather than bringing a new company into the mix.\n \n\n   \n  Right now, Blue Origin is developing two models of its Blue Moon landers: Mark 1 for cargo, and Mark 2, the vehicle designed for humans and intended for use during Artemis V.\n \n\n   \n  But to expedite the creation of a lunar lander that could be used for the Artemis III mission, Blue Origin plans to propose a new design that leverages elements of both Mark 1 and Mark 2, according to an industry source familiar with the plan that hasn’t been made public.\n \n\n   \n  Then, to get the vehicle to the moon, Blue Origin would make use of one or more Mark 1 landers that have been essentially converted into small rocket stages that could boost a scaled-down version of Mark 2 out of Earth orbit and to its destination.\n \n\n   \n  The approach would require multiple launches, but likely fewer than the current plan with Starship, the source noted. Blue Origin’s plan also does not require the launch of refueling tankers or transferring super-chilled propellants between spacecraft in orbit.\n \n\n   \n    A team effort\n \n\n   \n  Lockheed Martin — which previously worked on Blue Origin’s lander design but is not actively part of a partnership — also intends to throw its hat in the ring.\n \n\n   \n  Notably, as a legacy NASA contractor, the company built the  $20.4 billion Orion spacecraft  that astronauts will ride when they take off from Earth.   Orion has already flown one successful mission around the moon — Artemis I — and is slated for a crewed test flight to lunar orbit as soon as February.\n \n\n   \n  Now, Lockheed says it can piece together a two-stage lunar lander that uses spare parts harvested from Orion.\n \n\n   \n  The company would make use of Space Shuttle-era OMS-E engines — which are also  used on Orion  — to serve as the propulsion for an “ascent stage” of the lunar lander, providing the thrust for the vehicle to lift off the moon after a mission is completed.\n \n\n   \n  But the vehicle also needs a descent stage to get down to the lunar surface in the first place.\n \n\n   \n  For that component, Lockheed plans to work with another commercial space outfit, though it has not yet decided which one, said Rob Chambers, Lockheed’s director of human spaceflight strategy, and Tim Cichan, the company’s chief architect of space exploration, during a video call last week.\n \n\n   \n  There are two paths Lockheed could take   for its descent stage that could determine which company it teams up with.   It could use a cryogenically fueled lunar lander similar to Blue Origin’s Mark 1. Or it could go with a vehicle that uses more stable propellants such as hypergolic fuels.\n \n\n   \n  If Lockheed decides to go with cryogenic fuels, which must be kept at super-cold temperatures, it would need to launch its ascent stage and descent stage on separate rockets and dock them in orbit.\n \n\n   \n  In that scenario, it may also need to launch additional “boost stages” to kick them out to the moon, Cichan said.\n \n\n   \n  If Lockheed opts for a descent stage with more stable fuels, however, the whole lander could launch in one piece. But it would need to be topped off with fuel in orbit, Cichan added.\n \n\n   \n  He noted  that the refueling process in that case would not, however, be as complex as attempting to refuel cryogenically powered spacecraft, such as Blue Origin’s lander or SpaceX’s Starship, in orbit.\n \n\n   \n  Transferring stable fuels between vehicles in orbit is a less risky proposition and has been taking place on the International Space Station since 2000, Cichan explained. “The Russians and Soviets have been doing it all the way back to the ‘70s,” Cichan said. “So that’s very known technology.”\n \n\n   \n  When asked what would make Lockheed’s proposal competitive with Blue Origin or SpaceX, Chamers said the company’s “approach is quickest because it leverages existing hardware, minimizes the required cadence of launches, and does not rely on technologies like cryogenic refueling or long duration storage that have never been performed on orbit.”\n \n\n   \n  Other commercial space companies contacted by CNN — including Firefly Aerospace and Northrop Grumman — said simply that they were “ready to support” NASA in its endeavor to find a faster way to complete the Artemis III mission.\n \n\n   \n  They did not confirm whether they would formally respond to the space agency’s anticipated request for   companies to submit proposals.\n \n\n   \n    Back to the drawing board\n \n\n   \n  Experts who spoke with CNN suggested that NASA should stretch its imagination when it comes to the spacecraft that will land astronauts on the moon.\n \n\n   \n  “Nobody’s put together a true concept of design,” Loverro said.\n \n\n   \n  “All of that’s doable very quickly,” he noted, adding that he believes a new lander could go from concept to reality within five years.\n \n\n   \n  Loverro suggested that NASA should leverage in-house expertise by leaning on its own Jet Propulsion Laboratory, or JPL, which he said should be empowered to rapidly pursue a lunar lander development program.\n \n\n   \n  While JPL couldn’t do the job alone, because the center is focused on robotic exploration and does not have human spaceflight experience, Loverro noted, the laboratory   has built a reputation over decades for its engineering precision and ability to pull off complex missions on unforgiving timelines.\n \n\n   \n  “You really want that that kind of program management leadership that JPL embodies so well,” Loverro said.\n \n\n   \n    Expensive red herrings\n \n\n   \n  One huge consideration with any of these proposals is the price.\n \n\n   \n  From NASA’s vantage point, SpaceX’s Starship is by far the cheapest proposal because the company is spending so much of its own money on the project. The company even  estimates  it is funding 90% of Starship’s production, test and launch facilities.\n \n\n   \n  None of the other companies CNN spoke with about alternative proposals for NASA’s lunar lander offered cost estimates for bringing their ideas to fruition.\n \n\n   \n  But as with any spaceflight project, it’s safe to assume they won’t be cheap.\n \n\n   \n  NASA’s funds are already limited. While Congress has been on board with supporting the Artemis program — adding $10 billion to bolster lunar efforts in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” — it’s not clear whether lawmakers would throw even more money at the project in an attempt to speed things up.\n \n\n   \n  The space agency also can’t easily cancel existing contracts with either SpaceX or Blue Origin.\n \n\n   \n  Drier noted, however, that support for the Artemis program does seem to be a stand-out unifying force for lawmakers. He also highlighted the fact that the current administration clearly views Artemis as a priority, allowing work on the program to continue  despite the ongoing government shutdown .\n \n\n   \n  But considering the time and money space programs tend to consume, an attempt to hash out a new moon landing plan for Artemis III is an idea that “is probably three years too late to make a difference,” Drier added.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s only ever been one example of a successful human lunar lander in history: The contract for that was awarded in 1962, and it was first demonstrated on Apollo 9 in 1968,” Drier noted.\n \n\n   \n  “So that’s six years — and that cost about 30-ish billion dollars” for the lunar lander alone when adjusted for inflation, which is an exorbitant amount of money that exceeds the agency’s entire annual budget since the mid-1990s, he added.\n \n\n   \n  The space agency’s funding levels have remained far below the highs hit during the Apollo era in the decades since the program concluded.\n \n\n   \n  Another key consideration is time: It’s possible that pursuing one of these alternative options does successfully expedite the Artemis III mission. It’s also possible this pursuit will be an expensive red herring — sucking time and resources away from realizing the plan NASA has been working toward for years.\n \n\n   \n    ‘A base not a race’\n \n\n   \n  In addition to the flurry of conversations around rushing to cobble together a lunar lander, another discussion has been percolating — one that questions whether NASA should be trying to expedite Artemis III at all.\n \n\n   \n  Drier is among the experts who told CNN that they did not view simply landing on the moon before China as essential. The more important goal, they argue, is to pave the way for a permanent lunar base where astronauts can live and work.\n \n\n   \n  SpaceX has appeared to support this viewpoint,  saying in its Thursday statement that Starship “will be a central enabler that will fulfill the vision of NASA’s Artemis program, which seeks to establish a lasting presence on the lunar surface, not just flags and footprints, and ultimately forge the path to land the first humans on Mars.”\n \n\n   \n  The company argues that is why Starship remains the best option for NASA’s Artemis program: The vehicle boasts a massive cargo bay and immense power that could be transformational — opening up possibilities once considered unthinkable, such as delivering 100 metric tons of cargo to the moon in one trip, according to SpaceX.\n \n\n   \n  In the public imagination, the new “space race” — as much as it really is a race — may be won or lost the moment the next astronaut sets foot on the moon. But perhaps the true winner will be the country that is able to build lasting infrastructure, experts say.\n \n\n   \n  “It makes great press fodder to frame this as competition,” said one space policy source, who was among several that spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity to discuss controversial issues. “But this is about the long game and the sustainability.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/uk/andrew-sandringham-estate-explained-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"09:22:00-04:00","title":"What we know about Sandringham, Andrew’s new home","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Prince Andrew, once a prominent royal figure, is being stripped of his titles and moved from his 75-year lease at Royal Lodge in Windsor to Sandringham Estate in Norfolk, following a surge in public outrage over allegations of his connection with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

\n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The rapid fall from grace of the now  former Prince Andrew , culminating in his humiliating exile by  King Charles III  to the Sandringham estate, has been no less than stunning.\n \n\n   \n  His titles and honors are in the process of being formally stripped – he will henceforth be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor – and he’s been served notice to surrender his 75-year lease of  Royal Lodge , the huge mansion he has lived in for more than two decades.\n \n\n   \n  It is not yet known exactly when Andrew will leave Windsor, west of the British capital London, for the monarch’s retreat in rural Norfolk.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know about the sprawling estate that Andrew will soon call home.\n \n\n   \n    The late Queen’s favorite retreat\n \n\n   \n  Andrew has agreed to move out of the 30-room royal residence he has shared with his ex-wife  Sarah Ferguson  within the grounds of Windsor Great Park and into a new home in Sandringham. The estate was beloved by the late Queen Elizabeth II and is now said to be a favorite escape for Andrew’s elder brother King Charles and Queen Camilla.\n \n\n   \n  Buckingham Palace is keen for Andrew to move to the country estate, roughly 100 miles north of London, as soon as is practical. But it will not happen immediately, a royal source told CNN on Friday. That’s because giving notice, surrendering the lease and other formalities related to the relocation - which is similar to buying a house - could make it a protracted process.\n \n\n   \n   Sandringham  was purchased in 1862 by Queen Victoria for her eldest son and heir Albert, later Edward VII, who had just turned 21. It has been the private home of five generations of British monarchs and is where the royal family traditionally gathers to celebrate Christmas each year.\n \n\n   \n    Christmas family tradition\n \n\n   \n  Sandringham is perhaps the most famous stately home in Norfolk, on England’s east coast. The massive estate is spread across an estimated 20,000 acres, with 600 acres of royal parkland and some 150 properties.\n \n\n   \n  Since its purchase, each monarch has helped develop it over the years. The main house was completed in 1870, with a ballroom added 13 years later. Guest and staff accommodation came in the 1890s. It underwent a major overhaul in 1975 when more than 100 rooms in the service wing were demolished “to remove dry rot, save on heating costs and move the kitchens closer to the Dining Room,” according to the Sandringham website.\n \n\n   \n  The house was also the location for Queen Elizabeth II’s first televised Christmas broadcast in 1957.\n \n\n   \n  Within the grounds sits St. Mary Magdalene Church which is routinely used as a place of worship by the Windsors when in residence. It has become a tradition to see the family walk to it every Christmas morning, greeting well-wishers along the way.\n \n\n   \n  The estate also includes an organic farm, sawmill, residential and commercial properties, local parishes and communities.\n \n\n   \n  King George V described Sandringham as “the place I love better than anywhere else in the world” while his son and Queen Elizabeth II’s father George VI once wrote, “I have always been happy here and I love the place.”\n \n\n   \n  The property’s gardens were the first part of the estate to be opened to the public in 1908 by Edward VII. Elizabeth II later opened the main house to the public in 1977 to coincide with her silver jubilee year.\n \n\n   \n  Her husband Philip took responsibility for the estate’s management when Elizabeth acceeded to the throne in 1952. Conservation was at the heart of his approach to ensure that it was maintained for future generations.\n \n\n   \n    So where might Andrew live?\n \n\n   \n  No family members live at Sandringham House permanently these days, but King Charles frequently visits the grand property. Within its vast grounds there are several properties where the monarch could house his brother.\n \n\n   \n   York Cottage , previously known as Bachelor’s Cottage, was given to then-Duke and Duchess of York – the future George V and Queen Mary – as a wedding gift in 1893 by Edward VII. In recent years it has been used as accommodation for vacationers as well as estate staff and has also been used as the estate office for Sandringham, according to the Times of London. It was also reportedly considered for Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex before they stepped back as working royals.\n \n\n   \n   Gardens House  is another viable option. It was previously the home of the estate’s head gardener. The four-bed, three-bath property is currently being used as a holiday let. “This light and airy red brick Edwardian property accommodates up to eight guests, with each room thoughtfully furnished with a blend of rustic pieces, modern comforts, and botanical prints,” the Sandringham website reads.\n \n\n   \n   The Folly  is another available property on the estate. It too is being offered to travelers looking for the chance to “experience the serene splendour” of Sandringham. The original structure dates back to the 1800s and over the years has served as a hunting lodge and a space for ladies to enjoy afternoon tea. It can sleep six guests in its three bedrooms and features a wraparound balcony with a staircase that leads to a turret which “offers panoramic views across the estate,” according to its listing.\n \n\n   \n   Park House  is an additional property on the estate, but it would require some work. It was where Diana, the former Princess of Wales was born and spent much of her childhood. In the early 80s it was offered to charity Leonard Cheshire, which transformed it into a hotel for disabled people. There were plans for it to be renovated in 2019 which were put on hold due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n \n\n   \n   Wood Farm  is a farmhouse on the estate that has strong ties to Andrew’s parents. It is also where his father, Prince Philip, based himself after retiring from public duties in 2017 at the age of 95. However, it is not thought to be where Andrew will end up.\n \n\n   \n  Another option, though it seems incredibly unlikely, is  Anmer Hall,  which was gifted to Prince William and Catherine, Princess of Wales by the late Queen when they wed in 2013. The couple, along with their three children, do not live there permanently but are still thought to spend time during school breaks at the 10-bedroom Georgian property.\n \n\n   \n    Why is the move happening now?\n \n\n   \n  Andrew is losing his royal titles and styles, as well as his Windsor home after weeks of snowballing scrutiny over his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  Public fury was compounded after the publication of a  posthumous memoir from Virginia Giuffre  in October, in which she repeated her claims that she had sex with Andrew on three separate occasions as a teenager while being trafficked by Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew has always denied the claims made against him. But it is understood that the King took action after the recent developments sparked renewed outrage and threatened to taint the monarchy’s reputation further.\n \n\n   \n  His decision to essentially banish his disgraced brother to Sandringham came after consulting legal and constitutional experts, as well as his wider family and the government.\n \n\n   \n  Downing Street said Friday that it backed the King’s actions to remove Andrew’s titles and honors. “Our hearts go out to the family of Virginia Giuffre and all the victims who suffered from Jeffrey Epstein’s despicable crimes in all of this. We should never forget that,” a spokesperson said.\n \n\n   \n    And who will pay for relocation?\n \n\n   \n  Sandringham House and its extensive surrounding estate have been handed down through the generations and is privately owned by the sovereign.\n \n\n   \n  In comparison, Andrew’s current home in Windsor is part of the Crown Estate, which manages the royal family’s land and property holdings on behalf of the British state.\n \n\n   \n  It is understood that the disgraced royal will move to an undisclosed property, with the relocation privately financed by Charles, who will also make financial provisions for his sibling.\n \n\n   \n  His ex-wife Sarah Ferguson is also moving from Royal Lodge but she will make her own living arrangements and is not expected to join Andrew at Sandringham.\n \n\n   \n  The two Pembroke Welsh corgis,  Muick and Sandy, that once belonged to Queen Elizabeth II  will remain in the care of Andrew’s family, Buckingham Palace confirmed to Britain’s PA Media news agency on Friday. However, the palace did not specify if the dogs would stay with Ferguson, head to Norfolk with Andrew or be passed on to their daughters Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/gaza-israel-isf-trump-plan-ceasefire-cnn","dateOfPublication":"2024-04-15","timeOfPublication":"20:30:00Z","title":"President Marquez Announces Major Transparency Reforms Ahead of 2024 Elections","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Elena Marquez has announced sweeping reforms to increase governmental transparency, with the National Transparency Commission leading the implementation of new policies.

AM EDT, Sat November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  The former Marine who  opened fire in a Michigan church  and set it ablaze in September was motivated by “anti-religious beliefs” against The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the FBI confirmed Friday.\n \n\n   \n  While  friends of the gunman  in the deadly shooting have said he harbored hatred for what is widely known as the Mormon church, the FBI had previously declined to specify the motivation behind the attack that left four people dead and the church burned to the ground, except to say it was a “targeted” act of violence.\n \n\n   \n  The gunman,  Thomas Jacob Sanford , 40, was killed by  law enforcement  responding to the shooting.\n \n\n   \n  “I am confirming this is a targeted act of violence believed to be motivated by the assailant’s anti-religious beliefs against the Mormon religious community,” Jennifer Runyan, special agent in charge of the FBI Detroit field office, said in a prerecorded video message. The agency declined to share further information on what led to its conclusion.\n \n\n   \n  Sanford drove his pickup truck into the side of a Latter-day Saints chapel in Grand Blanc Township, 60 miles (80 kilometers) northwest of Detroit, on Sunday, Sept. 28, and began shooting at congregants. Authorities have said he used gasoline as an accelerant to then light the church on fire.\n \n\n   \n   Body camera footage  released by Grand Blanc Township police shows an officer yelling, “Drop the gun! Drop the gun! Drop it now!” One of the officers tells another, “I’ve got your back, back here man. Yeah stay there. Shoot him!”\n \n\n   \n  The FBI said Friday that nine people were injured in the attack. The previous official count had been eight.\n \n\n   \n  “During our investigation, an additional individual was determined to be “injured” during the Grand Blanc critical incident,” a spokesperson said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  The agency declined to comment Friday on the nature of the additional injury.\n \n\n   \n  The four people who were killed have been identified through family and friends as Craig Hayden, William “Pat” Howard, John Bond and Thelma Armstrong.\n \n\n   \n  Lisa Louis, who was in the chapel when her father, Hayden, was fatally shot, wrote in a letter that after looking into the shooter’s eyes, she  forgave him , “with my heart.”\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, top church leaders preached a  message of love and forgiveness  in the wake of the attack while gathered for the faith’s twice-annual general conference in its home state of Utah. Its members responded by raising hundreds of thousands of dollars in an  online fundraiser for the gunman’s family .\n \n\n   \n  The church said it strengthened its security protocols for the conference and, days later, for the  funeral of its oldest-ever president , who died a day before the Michigan shooting.\n \n\n   \n  The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints did not have a comment Friday.\n \n\n   \n  Brandt Malone, a member of the faith who was attending services at a nearby church on the morning of the shooting, said the FBI’s statement “did confirm some of our darkest fears — that this attack was motivated by hatred.”\n \n\n   \n  “This affects all believers of all religious traditions, and it hurts that there are those out there who are motivated by the darkest of feelings,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Malone grew up attending events at the church where the attack occurred. He said local Latter-day Saints have been uplifted by an outpouring of love from the Grand Blanc Township community and other religious congregations.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities have released little information about Sanford and the attack. People who knew him have said he began vocalizing anti-Mormon sentiments years ago after living in Utah, where he dated and broke up with a girlfriend who was a member of the faith. Sanford had moved to Utah after leaving the Marines and told his friends he had become addicted to methamphetamines.\n \n\n   \n  An attorney acting as a spokesperson for Sanford’s family did not immediately return a request for comment.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/business/how-to-help-snap-benefits","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"03:00:00Z","title":"How to Help SNAP Recipients as the Shutdown Drags On","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the government shutdown delays SNAP benefits scheduled for November 1, 2025, millions of Americans face the risk of food insecurity.

shutdown drags on \n       \n  By Ramishah Maruf, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:00 AM EDT, Sat November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  More likely than not, someone in your community — whether  friend, family or neighbor  — uses   SNAP benefits.\n \n\n   \n  As  millions of people could lose access to food assistance programs  during the government shutdown, many Americans are trying — in however small a way — to fill in the gaps for people at risk of being left behind.\n \n\n   \n   Two federal judges ruled that the Trump administration has to tap into emergency funds  to at least partially cover November food assistance. But the aid, which was scheduled to disperse on the first of the month, will still be delayed reaching recipients.\n \n\n   \n  Tee Tran, the owner of Vietnamese restaurant Monster Pho in Oakland, California, knows the struggle all too well. He was one of the thousands of Vietnamese boat people, eventually reaching California in 1989, where his mother worked five jobs and used SNAP benefits to keep food on the table. Now he’s decided to give away free meals to children receiving help through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, and a discount for their parents.\n \n\n   \n  “When I see these kids going through this and not having food, it really makes me think of me,” Tran said. “I know how it’s like when you look up to your parents and they want to give you so much … but financially they can’t do it.”\n \n\n   \n  But even though people are pitching in as much as they can to help, there are few options for families that help as much as food stamps. \n \n\n   \n  “No food bank, no charitable organization, can fill the gap if November SNAP isn’t provided,” Stefanie Shuman, Food Bank For New York City’s communications director, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    Check with local businesses\n \n\n   \n  Kevin Cassidy, the owner of a chain restaurant on Long Island called KC’s Pizza & Wings, made a heartfelt post on social media saying he would provide a free meal, no questions asked, to anyone presenting a SNAP/EBT card. He didn’t expect the flood of support.\n \n\n   \n  In two days, he said he got over $1,000 in donations and hundreds of messages from people around the country asking how they can help. Now, he’s planning on prepping pre-made meals, working with a local food bank and using community donations to give out gift cards to local grocers.\n \n\n   \n  “Everyone is struggling a bit, and when you help others it comes back tenfold. The only way to receive is to give,” Cassidy said.\n \n\n   \n  Tran, the owner of Monster Pho, said he has lost 30% of his business in the past six months because of tariffs, immigration restrictions and reduced spending from his customers. That’s why he’s offering free meals to children and a discount to their parents, to help as much as he can without going under.\n \n\n   \n    Donate to a food bank\n \n\n   \n  Food Banks say that cash donations are more helpful than giving food directly if people are able to do so, because they are able to buy a lot more food in bulk themselves. In New York City, for example, $1 can provide up to 5 meals at Food Bank For NYC.\n \n\n   \n  Many companies also match employee donations to organizations such as these, so check with your employer, as well.\n \n\n   \n  The money goes a long way, especially right now.  Food banks have already been feeling the strain  due to increased lines and higher prices of food.\n \n\n   \n    Grocery Buddies\n \n\n   \n  Other people are using online forums to act as “grocery buddies” for families at risk of losing benefits,  CNN previously reported .\n \n\n   \n  Neighbors post in these community groups that they are willing to be a “grocery buddy,” offering help to whoever needs. Then, the parties figure what that help will look like, whether that means shopping together, using gift cards or something else.\n \n\n   \n    Local food pantry and mutual aid groups\n \n\n   \n  For those donating physical food, food bank groups said the best options are non-perishables. Key items include proteins such as canned chicken, tuna and salmon, as well as beans and nut butters. Pastas and rice also have a long shelf life.\n \n\n   \n  Other items food banks and local groups tend to need are hygiene products, such as tampons, pads, diapers and wipes, which can eat away at peoples’ grocery budgets.\n \n\n   \n    Call your local representative\n \n\n   \n  Other advocates say an easy and free way to take action is to call your local representative as the government is still shut down.\n \n\n   \n  Some local and state governments have stepped up to attempt to fill the gap left by SNAP, though it’s still not enough to totally cover the amount of aid.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s no face to hunger. It’s oftentimes, again, working families… (when) the wage has not kept pace with the cost of living,” Shuman said.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Tami Luhby and Alisha Ebrahimji contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/asia/apec-summit-xi-trump-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"06:31:00-04:00","title":"China’s Xi in the limelight at Pacific summit with Trump conspicuous by his absence","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"At the APEC summit in Gyeongju, South Korea, on November 1, 2025, leaders from 21 Pacific economies adopted the 'Gyeongju Declaration' calling for greater cooperation on trade, supply chains, and digital innovation, particularly in AI governance.

China’s Xi in the limelight at Pacific summit with Trump conspicuous by his absence \n       \n  By Helen Regan, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:31 AM EDT, Sat November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Leaders of Pacific countries and territories, including China’s Xi Jinping, adopted a joint declaration on trade and investment at a major summit in South Korea Saturday. But the leader of one global powerhouse is conspicuously absent: Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n  The US president flew out of South Korea Thursday, moments after his  landmark meeting  with his Chinese counterpart that appeared to  de-escalate the protracted trade conflict  between the world’s two largest economies.\n \n\n   \n  With Trump choosing to skip the annual summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation – which groups together countries accounting for more than half of global trade – Xi stepped into the limelight by calling for unity, cooperation and proposing a global body to govern artificial intelligence.\n \n\n   \n  Despite his absence, Trump’s protectionist trade policies and punishing global tariffs have loomed over the two-day event in the city of Gyeongju. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stood in for Trump during the discussions.\n \n\n   \n  The grouping of 21 economies on both sides of the Pacific signed the “Gyeongju Declaration,” which included commitments to cooperate on economic recovery and growth. The leaders also adopted an AI initiative and a framework to respond to demographic changes caused by low birth rates and aging populations.\n \n\n   \n  “The world is undergoing rapid changes unseen in a century,” Xi told the forum in his opening remarks Friday. “The more turbulent the times are, the more we must stand together in solidarity.”\n \n\n   \n  “China’s door to openness will not close; it will only open wider,” Xi said.\n \n\n   \n  Decisions made in Gyeongju are non-binding — and leaders have faced difficulty reaching consensus in the past including on thorny issues like Russia’s war in Ukraine. But a major focus for the forum this year was on strengthening supply chains and encouraging cooperation as economies worldwide reel from Trump’s tariff offensive.\n \n\n   \n  In their declaration, the leaders acknowledged that “the global trading system continues to face significant challenges,” and as su﻿ch they would “support efforts to ensure resilient supply chains” and “create new drivers of growth” through digital innovations, including AI.\n \n\n   \n  “We are standing at a critical inflection point with a rapidly changing global economic order,” South Korean president and APEC chair Lee Jae Myung said in his address to the summit Friday. “Only cooperation and solidarity can surely lead us to a better future.”\n \n\n   \n  Lee also sat down for talks with Xi, who is on a state visit to South Korea, in the first summit meeting between the two leaders. The two discussed ways to expand cooperation and advance denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula, according to the South Korean presidential office.\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of the talks, Lee said the relationship between Seoul and Beijing has “not completely recovered yet” and there was a need to “find the path for helping one another.” He looked forward to China playing a role in promoting peace on the peninsula, Lee said.\n \n\n   \n  North Korea called talk of denuclearization a “pipedream” that will never be realized. The country’s Vice Foreign Minister Pak Myong Ho accused South Korea of lacking “common sense” for refusing to acknowledge Pyongyang as a nuclear-armed state, the state-run Korea Central News Agency reported Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  Among the high-profile meetings Xi had on the sidelines of APEC was with Japan’s newly installed Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, a staunch conservative who has criticized China’s growing military presence in the region and called for cooperation with Taiwan, the self-ruled island that Beijing claims as its own.\n \n\n   \n  Xi told Takaichi that China was ready to “work with Japan for constructive, stable bilateral ties that meet requirements of the new era,” Chinese state news agency Xinhua reported.\n \n\n   \n  “I aim to maintain communication with you and therefore jointly promote the development of China-Japan relations along the right track,” Xi said.\n \n\n   \n  Takaichi faced a tough balancing act in her meeting with Xi. China remains Japan’s largest trading partner and Takaichi inherited a country facing  mounting economic woes. \n \n\n   \n  She told reporters after the meeting that China and Japan agreed to build a “strategic mutually beneficial relationship.” But Takaichi said she also expressed concerns to Xi on sensitive issues including Chinese export controls on rare earths, China’s activity in the East China Sea, and the detention of Japanese nationals in China.\n \n\n   \n  “I also asked China to resume Japanese beef and seafood imports,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The meeting appeared in stark contrast to the  warm camaraderie  showed by Takaichi and Trump in Tokyo just days before, when the two allies had embarked on a “new golden age” of relations. Takaichi and Trump demonstrated a close bond complete with smiles, fist pumps and jokes.\n \n\n   \n  For Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who is involved in an escalating trade war with Trump, meeting with Xi marked a “turning point” in their relationship, according to his office.\n \n\n   \n  In an earlier speech that echoed Xi and Lee’s addresses to APEC, Carney told the forum that the world was “facing another hinge moment in history.”\n \n\n   \n  “Our world is undergoing one of the most profound shifts since the fall of the Berlin Wall,” he said. “That old world… of steady expansion of liberalized trade and investment… that world is gone.”\n \n\n   \n  Carney had been looking for a reset of Canada-China relations after years of worsening ties and  diplomatic rows . Trade negotiations with the US, Canada’s biggest trading partner, are at  a dead end , and Carney said at the APEC summit that he was aiming to double non-US exports over the next decade in an effort to diversify away from the US.\n \n\n   \n  The two leaders “affirmed their commitment to renewing the relationship between their two countries in a pragmatic and constructive way” and discussed a framework “to deepen cooperation across a range of areas – from clean and conventional energy, to agriculture, manufacturing, climate change, and international finance,” the prime minister’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  Carney also accepted an invitation to visit China and both leaders “directed their officials to move quickly to resolve outstanding trade issues and irritants.”\n \n\n   \n  Speaking to reporters on Saturday, Carney said that he had apologized to Trump for a  political advertisement  that angered the President so much that he terminated trade talks with Canada.\n \n\n   \n  “I did apologize to the President,” Carney said when asked by a reporter about the issue on Saturday. “The President was offended by the ad. It’s not something I would have done… which is to put in place that advertisement, and so I apologized to him.”\n \n\n   \n  The ad was released last month by the government of Canada’s Ontario province and featured audio from  a speech by former US President Ronald Reagan  criticizing tariffs on foreign goods.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/nancy-mace-charleston-airport-incident","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"11:53:00-04:00","title":"Rep.

Nancy Mace of South Carolina allegedly berated police officers at Charleston International Airport Thursday morning, allegedly “loudly cursing” at officers and saying they were “f**king incompetent,” according to an incident report from police.\n \n\n   \n  Mace, who  closely aligns herself  with President Donald Trump and is  currently running  for South Carolina governor, has repeatedly shared concerns about her safety in the past. Last December, she reported being  “physically accosted”  on Capitol grounds.\n \n\n   \n  One officer said in their report: “Any other person in the airport acting and talking the way she did, our department would have been dispatch (sic) and we would have addressed the behavior.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Mace’s office for comment. Mace’s Director of Operations Cameron Morabito  told The New York Times , “Apparently, simply arriving at an airport now makes headlines if you’re leading the race for governor.”\n \n\n   \n  “We are forced to take the congresswoman’s safety extremely seriously,” Morabito told the Times. “After the world watched Charlie Kirk’s assassination, the threats against her have only intensified. Our security procedures are based solely on legitimate safety concerns, and any attempt to politicize this reality is both dangerous and reckless.”\n \n\n   \n  Mace also briefly spoke with the Times, saying she did complain to the airport because she is concerned about her safety given recent death threats against her. “We all get frustrated when it’s not taken seriously,” she told the outlet.\n \n\n   \n    Mace ran late, arrived in different vehicle\n \n\n   \n  Two Charleston County Aviation Authority police officers were informed at 6 a.m. they would need to escort Mace from the curb to her flight, according to an incident report filed by the officers. They were told she would arrive at 6:30 a.m. in a white BMW, the report says.\n \n\n   \n  At 6:20 a.m., three officers went to the ticketing curb area and waited for her car, the report said. They were informed at around 6:35 a.m. she was running 15 minutes late and kept waiting for the car, they said, not seeing a white BMW.\n \n\n   \n  Security video provided to CNN by the airport shows Mace arriving at a sidewalk entrance area at 6:50 a.m. in a dark gray sedan. No other people were visible in the video. Airport officials said they had no further comment.\n \n\n   \n  A little before 7 a.m., officers were told Mace was waiting at the Transportation Security Administration known crewmember entrance, and the officers made their way over “in less than a minute,” the report said.\n \n\n   \n  When officers met Mace to escort her, they said she was “very irate” and “began loudly cursing and making derogatory comments to us and about the department.”\n \n\n   \n  “She repeatedly stated we were ‘f**king incompetent,’ and ‘this is no way to treat a f**king US Representative’,” one officer said in his report. “She also said we would never treat (US Sen.) Tim Scott like this.”\n \n\n   \n  A different security video provided to CNN by the airport shows the TSA security checkpoint with Mace speaking with two airport officials at the known crewmember entrance. It appears an airport employee made a call to an unknown person, and approximately three minutes later the two officers arrived to escort Mace. It took about seven minutes from the time Mace appears at the known crewmember entrance and starts interacting with airport employees to when the escorting officers arrive, according to the video.\n \n\n   \n  Mace allegedly continued cursing at the officers and into her phone while they walked with her to the gate, according to the account of one officer. After she boarded her flight, an airline employee and several other TSA agents said they were shocked and upset by her behavior, the officer said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/us/terror-attack-plot-michigan-arrests","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00Z","title":"Thwarted Potential Terror Attack in Michigan: What We Know and Don’t Know","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A potential terrorist attack inspired by ISIS was thwarted by the FBI in Michigan over the Halloween weekend, following online discussions, visits to a shooting range where participants practiced high-speed reloads with AK-47s, and references to 'pumpkin day' as a possible nod to Halloween.

Here’s what the trial revealed \n       \n  By Jason Kravarik, Elizabeth Wolfe, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EDT, Sat November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A trial to decide the  fate of the National Guard deployments  in Oregon concluded Friday, leaving Portland residents, Trump administration officials and hundreds of soldiers in limbo as they await the judge’s decision.\n \n\n   \n  US District Judge Karin Immergut presided over the three-day trial that featured a surprising revelation: National Guard troops were on the ground at Portland’s ICE facility earlier this month even after the judge ordered them not to show up.\n \n\n   \n  The trial also provided insight on what top federal and National Guard officials knew — and didn’t know — when President Donald Trump called for hundreds of troops to protect the ICE facility that has faced months of protests.\n \n\n   \n  As Oregon and California challenge the effort to send 400 soldiers from their states to the facility, federal attorneys argued during the trial it’s within Trump’s presidential authority to respond to the daily protests outside the facility that have subjected the building and its agents to what it described as coordinated violence.\n \n\n   \n  But state and city attorneys called the move “one of the most significant infringements” on Oregon’s sovereignty in the state’s history and argued the Trump administration is dramatically misrepresenting the situation and risking inflaming tensions.\n \n\n   \n  “The government cannot create the very emergency they propose to resolve,” Oregon attorney Scott Kennedy said.\n \n\n   \n  Troops have so far been barred from deploying due to two temporary restraining orders from Immergut: one blocking  troops from Oregon  and another blocking  troops from any state . The former order is temporarily on hold after  being appealed  to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n \n\n   \n  Plaintiffs are seeking a ban on deploying National Guard troops to Oregon. The judge, whom  Trump appointed  during his first term, is expected to file a decision by Sunday when the previous order expires. The decision is expected to draw a quick appeal from the losing side.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what you need to know.\n \n\n   \n    DOJ admits soldiers were at ICE facility even after judge’s order\n \n\n   \n  Trump announced abruptly in a social media post last month that he would order Oregon National Guard troops to Portland, hurling his administration into a legal showdown with the state.\n \n\n   \n  As the case played out, Immergut issued an initial restraining order on October 4 blocking the deployment. But government attorneys admitted this week that Guard soldiers were already at the facility – and remained there for hours after her order.\n \n\n   \n  Though Immergut filed her restraining order at 3:40 p.m. PT on October 4, Justice Department attorney Eric Hamilton told her as many as 10 soldiers were at the facility until midnight. Earlier, his colleague Jean Lin had said the troops were there until 2 a.m.\n \n\n   \n  The judge briefly pressed the Trump administration on whether the soldiers’ presence might have been in contempt of her order, questioning why the government would deploy those Guard members while knowing her ruling on the restraining order was imminent.\n \n\n   \n  “The government deployed that very night that I told you I would issue an opinion,” Immergut said. “Does that not seem in bad faith?”\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think so,” Justice Department attorney Eric Hamilton replied, adding that the Guard members were needed at the ICE building prior to the judge’s ruling.\n \n\n   \n  Immergut questioned why the Oregon National Guard members didn’t vacate the ICE facility for hours after her restraining order was issued, yet California troops were able to arrive in Oregon by the next day.\n \n\n   \n  “Doesn’t that seem odd?” she asked.\n \n\n   \n  Hamilton told her the direction to comply with her order “went high up in the chain of command,” and a four-star general was involved. He argued it took time to implement the order. “There are steps that it has to go through.”\n \n\n   \n  “My clients were working to end the mission,” Hamilton said.\n \n\n   \n  The issue was tabled after Immergut suggested there could be a separate hearing on the potential order violation.\n \n\n   \n    ICE facility official was surprised by Guard deployment\n \n\n   \n  Top officials charged with the safety of the Portland ICE facility were not consulted before Trump ordered National Guard troops to Portland in September, one of those officials testified.\n \n\n   \n  A deputy regional director for the Federal Protective Service, identified in court by the initials R.C., said he and his boss, the FPS regional director, found out about the order on the news.\n \n\n   \n  “I was surprised,” R.C. said.\n \n\n   \n  “Your first thought was ‘What would I do with 200 National Guard men?’” asked Oregon Senior Assistant Attorney General Brian Simmonds Marshall.\n \n\n   \n  “Yes, sir,” R.C. said, admitting he already had a large number of FPS and supporting agents staffing the ICE facility. Asked about  Trump’s claim  that Portland is “burning down,” the official said, “I do not agree with the statement that Portland is burning down.”\n \n\n   \n  A high-ranking official in the National Guard Bureau also testified that he had never been to Portland’s ICE facility – or been formally briefed on the conditions there – before he authorized the Guard deployment.\n \n\n   \n  Acting Major General Timothy Rieger said the only direct information he had regarding conditions on the ground in Portland were from the media and other anecdotal accounts.\n \n\n   \n  “You don’t know if that (media) footage is from this year or prior years?” asked California attorney Barbara Horne-Petersdorf.\n \n\n   \n  “I do not know the veracity of that footage,” Rieger replied.\n \n\n   \n  Rieger said he was acting on the direction of an internal memo from the Secretary of Defense’s office that was corroborated by a Truth Social post from Trump.\n \n\n   \n    Is the facility ‘under siege’ or under control?\n \n\n   \n  Underpinning the arguments was a fundamental disagreement over how extreme the demonstrations have been – and whether local law enforcement is capable of handling criminal activity or violence when it occurs.\n \n\n   \n  Portland “is not war-ravaged, there is no rebellion, and the laws continue to be enforced every day,” Caroline Turco, an attorney for the city of Portland, said during opening statements.\n \n\n   \n  Instead, a simmering protest scene only ramped up after Trump ordered Guard troops to enter Portland in late September, state and city attorneys said.\n \n\n   \n  While admitting there have been “sporadic and inexcusable crimes” along with peaceful protests, Oregon’s attorney Scott Kennedy called them “precisely the kinds of challenges” that existing law enforcement can and have handled.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration focused on a particularly chaotic night in June as they argued local law enforcement is unable to fully protect the facility.\n \n\n   \n  The tense June 14 protest resulted in a  riot declaration by Portland police , and drew a crowd that was “very active, high-energy and engaged in active criminal conduct,” said DOJ attorney Tiberius Davis, quoting a report from Oregon State Police Captain Cameron Bailey.\n \n\n   \n  During cross examination on Wednesday, Bailey admitted troopers—who were scheduled to provide mutual aid to Portland police—were not on scene before the protest began.\n \n\n   \n  There was “no immediate law enforcement intervention available at that time?” Davis asked. Bailey agreed, saying troopers were scheduled to start later in the evening.\n \n\n   \n  R.C, the high-ranking official with the Federal Protective Service, said demonstrators that night threw broken glass, rocks and debris at federal agents. There was also an attempt to “breach the facility,” the official said.\n \n\n   \n  Officers that night considered using deadly force if protesters entered the building, saying they may have to “go lethal,” according to R.C.\n \n\n   \n  “Protesters were putting chains on the door,” R.C. said. “It shows an attempt to lock the officers in and create a hazard for the team that was there.”\n \n\n   \n  He added that two FPS officers were injured from fireworks thrown at the building and an ICE employee required medical attention after being hit with an object.\n \n\n   \n  Davis also sought to establish that federal officers were getting little help from Portland police by outlining several incidents in which rocks were thrown at the ICE facility without any arrests. One report logged people “using slingshots to shoot cameras” at the ICE facility, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Attorneys for Oregon and Portland maintain Trump’s lawyers are seizing on a small sample size of dates that ended in violence, instead of a vast majority of nights that remained peaceful.\n \n\n   \n  Portland Police Commander Franz Schoening testified that managing these demonstrations can become complicated because the city’s sanctuary laws limit how officers are able to interact with crowds outside the immigration facility.\n \n\n   \n  “We will not engage in immigration-related enforcement or participate in activities” that could be related to it, Schoening said. That includes clearing crowds in front of the ICE driveway, so the task was left to federal agents, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Officers are also restricted from assisting federal agents if they have begun to deploy munitions like pepper balls and tear gas, Schoening said, citing a law passed in 2020 that limits Portland’s participation with agencies using such munitions.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Unpredictable’ use of force can create safety risks, police commander says\n \n\n   \n  The Portland police commander highlighted starkly different approaches between federal and local law enforcement in handling the protests, saying federal tactics sometimes contribute to the chaos.\n \n\n   \n  Portland police often have different interpretations of the level of threat outside the ICE facility, Schoening said, including on October 18, when federal agents used munitions on the crowd.\n \n\n   \n  “We simply didn’t see that (as necessary),” Schoening said.\n \n\n   \n  That night, police witnessed a federal officer launching tear gas canisters that “skipped off of their driveway and went onto the roof of the ICE facility where other officers were standing.”\n \n\n   \n  That prompted those federal officers to deploy more munitions, he said. “Our officers were impacted by those munitions.”\n \n\n   \n  The commander said he was “startled” to see the amount of force often employed by federal agents, noting it was “disproportionate to the level of criminal conduct we are seeing down there.”\n \n\n   \n  The use of force against demonstrators has at times threatened the safety of nearby Portland officers, Schoening added. When federal agents use “indiscriminate force,” he said, including the “unpredictable” use of chemical crowd dispersal agents, local police do not get a warning.\n \n\n   \n  “Officers face safety risks themselves,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration, however, argues federal agents face systematic disruption and assault from protesters that justifies a more forceful  response.\n \n\n   \n  “It is a frequent occurrence for agitators to carry bats, improvised weapons and shields,” Hamilton told the court.\n \n\n   \n  Hamilton said the protesters have displayed “disturbingly intrusive behavior” and organized violence. “The agitators coordinate their activity, including their information-gathering techniques.”\n \n\n   \n  The government also dismissed the state’s claim that National Guard presence escalates the tensions on the ground, saying there is no substantive evidence that has occurred.\n \n\n   \n  “It is totally speculative that there will be inflamed tensions and that inflamed tensions would impact plaintiffs in any way,” Hamilton said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/judge-blocks-trump-citizenship-proof-voting-form","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"10:57:00-04:00","title":"Federal judge rules Trump can’t require citizenship proof on federal voting form","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal judge in Washington, D.C., ruled that President Donald Trump lacks the constitutional authority to require documentary proof of citizenship on federal voter registration forms, declaring the directive an unconstitutional violation of the separation of powers.

voting form \n       \n  By Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:57 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump’s request to add a documentary proof of citizenship requirement to the federal voter registration form cannot be enforced, a federal judge ruled Friday.\n \n\n   \n  US District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly in Washington, DC, sided with Democratic and civil rights groups that sued the Trump administration over a March executive order to overhaul US elections.\n \n\n   \n  She ruled that the proof-of-citizenship directive is an unconstitutional violation of the separation of powers, dealing a blow to the administration and its allies who have argued that such a mandate is necessary to restore public confidence that only Americans are voting in US elections.\n \n\n   \n  “Because our Constitution assigns responsibility for election regulation to the States and to Congress, this Court holds that the President lacks the authority to direct such changes,” Kollar-Kotelly wrote in her opinion.\n \n\n   \n  She further emphasized that on matters related to setting qualifications for voting and regulating federal election procedures, “the Constitution assigns no direct role to the President in either domain.”\n \n\n   \n  Kollar-Kotelly echoed comments she made when  she granted a preliminary injunction over the issue. \n \n\n   \n  The ruling grants the plaintiffs a partial summary judgment that prohibits the proof-of-citizenship requirement from going into effect. It says the US Election Assistance Commission, which has been considering adding the requirement to the federal voter form, is permanently barred from taking action to do so.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, Sophia Lin Lakin of the ACLU, one of the plaintiffs in the case, called the ruling “a clear victory for our democracy. President Trump’s attempt to impose a documentary proof of citizenship requirement on the federal voter registration form is an unconstitutional power grab.”\n \n\n   \n  A message seeking comment from the White House was not immediately returned.\n \n\n   \n  While a top priority for Republicans, attempts to implement documentary proof-of-citizenship requirements for voting have been fraught. The US House passed a citizenship mandate last spring that has stalled in the Senate, and several attempts to pass similar legislation in the states have proved equally difficult.\n \n\n   \n  Such requirements have created problems and confusion for voters when they have taken effect at the state level. It presents particular hurdles for married women who have changed their name, since they might need to show birth certificates and marriage certificates as well as state IDs. Those complications arose earlier this year when a proof-of-citizenship requirement took effect for the first time during local elections in New Hampshire.\n \n\n   \n  In Kansas, a proof-of-citizenship requirement that was in effect for three years created chaos before it was overturned in federal court. Some 30,000 otherwise eligible people were prevented from registering to vote.\n \n\n   \n  Voting by noncitizens also has been shown to be rare.\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuit brought by the DNC and various civil rights groups will continue to play out to allow the judge to consider other challenges to Trump’s order. That includes a requirement that all mailed ballots be received, rather than just postmarked, by Election Day.\n \n\n   \n  Other lawsuits against Trump’s election executive order are ongoing.\n \n\n   \n  In early April, 19 Democratic state attorneys general asked a separate federal court to reject Trump’s executive order. Washington and Oregon, where virtually all voting is done with mailed ballots, followed with their own lawsuit against the order.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/politics/shutdown-congress-divided","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"The problem is everybody wants to win: Congress bitterly deadlocked as shutdown pain skyrockets","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. government is facing its longest shutdown in history, with lawmakers deadlocked over funding and no agreement on reopening.

shutdown pain skyrockets \n       \n  By Sarah Ferris, Adam Cancryn, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EDT, Sat November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The government shutdown is on the verge of becoming the longest in US history — and lawmakers still have no idea how much longer it will go.\n \n\n   \n  In Washington, senators left town for the weekend deadlocked and more frustrated than ever, while  critical safety net programs  could soon lose federal funding for the first time.\n \n\n   \n  Two federal judges said Friday that the Trump administration must tap into billions of dollars in emergency funds to at least partially cover food stamp benefits for the month of November. President Donald Trump said later Friday he’d instructed administration lawyers to ask the courts how it can legally fund the benefits, adding that if “given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding, just like I did with Military and Law Enforcement Pay.”\n \n\n   \n  But he noted that even immediate guidance from the courts would result in delayed benefits for food stamp recipients — which could still only be  a partial and short-term fix . Tens of millions of Americans are still bracing for a crisis that will leave them without the government assistance they need to eat, heat their homes or take care of their kids while they work.\n \n\n   \n  And after a week abroad, Trump announced his return with a missive that threatens to further complicate the path out of the shutdown: calling for eliminating the Senate filibuster in a “nuclear” move that even his closest congressional allies worry would only do more damage in the long run.\n \n\n   \n  “Right now, the problem is everybody wants to win,” GOP Sen. Jim Justice of West Virginia, who has advocated for Trump to get more directly involved in negotiations to reopen the government, said of the standoff in the Senate. “And you’ve got a lot of people really hurting, and that really upsets me.”\n \n\n   \n  “I imagine being a parent with a couple kids, and how you’re going to fill their refrigerator and pack their lunches and get on with their lives when the things that they’ve depended on now is gone, because we can’t even agree to just open things up,” fumed Sen. John Fetterman, a Democrat from Pennsylvania who has repeatedly bucked his party and sided with Republicans on the funding bill.\n \n\n   \n  Privately, lawmakers of both parties have acknowledged in recent days they need to find a way out of the shutdown in the next week or two or else face even more dire consequences, according to interviews with a half-dozen sources.\n \n\n   \n  And publicly, many are hopeful that the skyrocketing pressure on both Republicans and Democrats will force the two sides to find a deal.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s going to be a flood of phone calls from people saying, wait, wait, wait, wait, my health care is going to go up by that much?” Sen. Chris Coons, a centrist Democrat from Delaware, told CNN, referring to the spiking premiums that his party has made a central demand in the funding fight. But he said phone lines would, too, be lighting up for Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  “I also think Democrats are going to get a flood of calls from people saying, wait, wait a minute. My SNAP and WIC is going to be…? So I think there will be building pressure on both parties to find a path forward.”\n \n\n   \n  Behind the scenes, Senate and House GOP leaders are confident Democrats will cave shortly after the November 4 elections, several of the sources said. Many point to a flurry of talks with some centrist Democrats to end the shutdown, perhaps in exchange for a vote to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies that remain Democrats’ biggest demand in the funding fight, as well as a commitment to full-year spending bills.\n \n\n   \n  “I hope it frees people up to move forward with opening government,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune said of Election Day on Tuesday, claiming Democrats would be more willing to yield when they’re not “concerned about turnout” in key races in Virginia and New Jersey.\n \n\n   \n  Yet several people close to Democratic leaders insist the party is unwilling to back down for a show vote. After more than 30 days of insisting on a clear commitment on the health care issue, many Democrats will be unswayed by unofficial commitments: They want to hear directly from Trump.\n \n\n   \n  As the shutdown has dragged on, even some Republicans have grown antsy as Johnson has kept the House out of session since September 19 and lawmakers have remained in their districts.\n \n\n   \n  “People ask, ‘Do you like being here in the district?’ Of course I do because I get to see all of my constituents,” GOP Rep. Stephanie Bice of Oklahoma told reporters on Tuesday from Washington. “But I also would tell you that we are built to work here. We are all built to be here and doing our jobs and late nights and early mornings and trying to figure out a path forward. And so, it’s a little unusual.”\n \n\n   \n  Many House lawmakers concede they don’t know what will happen if the shutdown extends past November 21, the date of the House-passed government funding extension.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats also pointed to Trump’s late-night call for nuking the filibuster, which injected fresh uncertainty into the situation and raised further questions about the role the president might play in resolving the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  In a Friday statement, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said that “if Democrats won’t do what’s best for the American people, the nuclear options will need to be invoked,” though she did not offer a specific timeline. Top GOP leaders, meanwhile, were quick to swat away the suggestion of weakening the custom, while maintaining that Trump and Republicans in Congress were united in ending the shutdown without ceding any ground to Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  That includes Trump’s resistance to any further meetings with Hill leaders, despite constant requests from Democratic senators.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Jacky Rosen, a Nevada Democrat, shot down GOP leaders’ offer earlier this month to guarantee a vote on the floor on ACA subsidies in exchange for Democratic votes to end the shutdown, quipping, “I’m not sure that Leader Thune is really the leader of the Senate.”\n \n\n   \n  White House officials have insisted that their stance remains unchanged, and that there won’t be any negotiations until Democrats cave and reopen the government.\n \n\n   \n  “Let them open up the country, and we’ll meet,” Trump said Friday. “We’ll meet very quickly. But they have to open up the country.”\n \n\n   \n  But in the days before Trump returned to the US, aides had privately discussed options for enticing Democrats to give in, including agreeing to undo the administration’s recent mass firing of federal workers in exchange for reopening the government, two people familiar with the deliberations told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Those conversations were preliminary and did not yield any final decisions, the people familiar cautioned, especially amid concerns that it would hand Democrats an opportunity to claim they won the shutdown fight.\n \n\n   \n  Another suggestion discussed by GOP officials — that Trump invite Republican and Democratic leaders to the White House next week to try to broker an end to the impasse — was swiftly ruled out. One senior congressional GOP aide stressed that it was never a real option.\n \n\n   \n  Still, the behind-the-scenes activity offers a window into the increasing urgency to end the shutdown before more pain hits Americans across the country — and the lingering concern within the administration over which side will bear the brunt of the political fallout.\n \n\n   \n  In recent polling, more voters still blame Trump and Republicans for the shutdown than they do Democrats. And while the expiration of food aid has pushed more Democrats to seek an end to the shutdown, it’s also worried a swath of Republicans who represent the millions of red-district voters reliant on SNAP — and are already under pressure over high prices, health care and other economic issues.\n \n\n   \n  “The question becomes, who politically gets the blame?” said one GOP adviser involved in the shutdown discussions. “If Republicans are really feeling the tide shifting on that one there may be a more political imperative to get this solved.”\n \n\n   \n  Within Trump’s orbit, aides and advisers are largely resigned to the shutdown blowing past the 35-day record set during his first term, three people close to the White House said.\n \n\n   \n  Yet they are still holding out some hope that the impasse won’t last much beyond Tuesday’s elections, believing Democrats are increasingly eager to find an off-ramp.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats, meanwhile, insist it’s Trump who needs to offer them one.\n \n\n   \n  “We could end this at any moment, if we can get the right people in the room, and that includes the president. He spent an hour on this, as far as I could tell, in a month. An hour. How much time has he spent on his ballroom?” Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona told reporters this week.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/us/nebraska-cornhusker-clink-ice-detention-center","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00Z","title":"An undocumented mother says ICE raids and 'Cornhusker Clink' are the end of the Nebraska she’s called home for decades","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article details the growing impact of federal immigration enforcement in Nebraska, a state historically welcoming to immigrants.

She skips doctor’s appointments and church to remain undetected. And if she is detained by immigration enforcement officials, her 13-year-old son is prepared with a list of people to call and his social security number memorized.\n \n\n   \n  “I cannot be separated from my kids,” said the 30-year-old undocumented mother of four children who were born in the United States. “I just can’t risk it.” CNN agreed to only use Alejandra’s first name to protect her identity out of respect for her safety concerns due to her immigration status.\n \n\n   \n  The idea that her family might be ripped apart only crossed her mind recently, she said, when President Donald Trump’s nationwide  immigration crackdown  penetrated the humble, quiet Nebraska community she calls home.\n \n\n   \n  In June, a  meatpacking plant in Omaha  was raided by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in what the agency described as the  largest worksite operation  in the state since the start of the Trump administration. Alejandra says several family friends and church acquaintances were among the dozens of people detained.\n \n\n   \n  As that event continues to generate aftershocks, a new ICE detention center, dubbed the  “Cornhusker Clink,”  is opening in western Nebraska soon and is expected to hold up to 300 adults, a spokesperson for Nebraska’s Republican Gov. Jim Pillen told CNN Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  The facility will join other new ICE detention centers in Republican-led states, including “ Alligator Alcatraz ” in Florida, “Louisiana Lockup” or  “Camp 57”  in Louisiana, and “Speedway Slammer” in Indiana.\n \n\n   \n  These new ICE facilities “are significantly expanding detention space to house the worst of the worst illegal aliens,” a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson told CNN Wednesday. “We look forward to the opening of this new partnership with Nebraska very soon.”\n \n\n   \n  Pillen’s office has estimated the contract with DHS will bring around $14 million annually to the state. Laura Strimple, a spokesperson for the governor’s office described it as “the latest action undertaken by Gov. Pillen to stand with President Trump and protect Americans from criminal illegal aliens. The facility will not only serve Nebraska, but also other states in the region.”\n \n\n   \n  Sitting hundreds of miles away from the border, the opening of “Cornhusker Clink” may solidify Nebraska’s place in the national immigration debate. Unlike many states at the center of immigration enforcement operations, Nebraska is under full Republican control and its governor hasn’t shied away from the conversation.\n \n\n   \n  Pillen signed a  January executive order  expressing his support for federal immigration policy, ordered Nebraska National Guard deployments to Texas, and facilitated the  troops’ activation  ahead of recent ICE protests in his state. He also touted the alleged  arrest of a MS-13 “kingpin”  in Omaha this summer.\n \n\n   \n  Yet, immigration advocates, some state lawmakers and business leaders said it’s a contrast from the previously welcoming atmosphere they have worked to build in the state, especially to strengthen its economy.\n \n\n   \n    Nebraska’s immigrant workforce under threat\n \n\n   \n  Unlike other states, Nebraska is not often seen of as a haven for immigrants, but parts of the state are an enclave for Latinos, who have lived and worked in the Cornhusker state for many years in part due to the meat packing industry, immigration advocates and business leaders in the state say.\n \n\n   \n  Today, much of Nebraska’s Latino population is second, third, or even fourth generation. In rural towns like Schuyler, Lexington and Madison, which some call “Latino Pueblos,” some business owners and community leaders were initially drawn by jobs at meat-packing plants and stayed for decades.\n \n\n   \n  Now, immigration operations are threatening the stability of these small communities and industry operations in Nebraska, said John Hansen, president of the  Nebraska Farmers Union .\n \n\n   \n  “There’s an awful lot of folks that are just afraid to show up to work, afraid to be seen in public,” said Hansen, noting many farms and meatpacking plants are struggling to stay staffed.\n \n\n   \n  Nebraska’s meatpacking industry, which includes major processing facilities for JBS, Tyson Foods, Cargill and Smithfield, depends on immigrant labor. Immigrants, many of whom are undocumented, represent about 53% of the state’s workforce, according to the  Migration Policy Institute .\n \n\n   \n  Immigration raids, rising deportation fears and political shifts have created “an atmosphere of fear and intimidation,” among workers, Hansen said, and some union members have privately expressed regret about voting for Trump, who won a majority of the state’s vote in the 2024 election, citing mass deportation and tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  The state is experiencing a severe labor shortage, with only 70 available workers for every 100 open jobs as of August, according to data from the  US Chamber of Commerce .\n \n\n   \n  On the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly claimed  immigrants were taking jobs from Americans.  But in actuality, immigrants were  filling critical labor gaps,  economists say.\n \n\n   \n  While meat packing jobs initially built stable, middle-class lives, Hansen said, injuries like carpal tunnel surged as assembly lines became faster and more repetitive by the 1960s and 1970s, leading to an exodus of American workers. Then, immigrants filled the gap, shaping Nebraska’s farms, factories and towns for decades, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Immigrants, like Alejandra’s family who first migrated from Mexico to Iowa, as well as Latinos born in the US, have spent decades inside those plants, cutting, trimming, packing and processing meat that ends up on dinner tables across America.\n \n\n   \n  Ness Sandoval, a professor at Saint Louis University who studies inequality and Latino and immigrant demography, recalls growing up in Nebraska and his dad’s grueling job at a meatpacking plant.\n \n\n   \n  “He had no time or energy to go to any of my events or sports. He would make an effort when it was something meaningful, but he had to be in bed like at 8 o’clock,” Sandoval said. “It’s a very physical job on the body.”\n \n\n   \n  Injuries were once so routine Sandoval’s father was given an award for going a year without getting hurt. As the years passed, the repetitive work led him to suffer from shoulder injuries, arthritis and a later, he retired after breaking his shoulder in a fall, Sandoval said.\n \n\n   \n  Although his father took pride in his work, he never wanted his son to follow the same path “because he understood how difficult that job was on the body,” Sandoval said.\n \n\n   \n    Remote state prison transformed to hold immigrants\n \n\n   \n  The terracotta-colored building in McCook, Nebraska, soon to be referred as “Cornhusker Clink” was previously a state prison known as the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services’ Work Ethic Camp.\n \n\n   \n  With a focus on reintegrating low-risk offenders back into the community, the camp housed more than 180 inmates who often worked on-site at the facility’s kitchen or warehouse, according to a 2024  report.  Others filled road-crew jobs with the Nebraska Department of Transportation.\n \n\n   \n  The facility, opened since 2001, aimed to ease prison overcrowding “and make prison bed space available for violent offenders.” Decades later, the Nebraska prison system is still struggling to manage its current population, which is exceeding 140% of its design capacity, according to a  2024 report  by the state’s inspector general of the correctional system.\n \n\n   \n  Repurposing the facility in McCook is expected to further destabilize the prison system, said Mindy Chipman, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Nebraska.\n \n\n   \n  “Transitioning a minimum-security facility that provides reentry services — services the Department of Corrections says are more needed than ever — into an immigration detention center removes support from Nebraskans and confines people, most of whom have no criminal record,” Chipman told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Current prisoners will be discharged, placed on parole or transferred to other correctional facilities “by the time the facility is ready to house ICE detainees,” the governor’s office said in a  September news release .\n \n\n   \n  When the converted ICE detention center opens, state officials said, people with minor criminal records and nonviolent felonies will be eligible to be placed there but not those with felony convictions linked to acts of violence.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the governor’s office, the department of corrections and the Department of Homeland Security for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Pillen’s motive is not safety, according to Chipman, but rather to signal support for Trump’s anti-immigrant agenda. The “Cornhusker Clink” is one of several new detention projects backed by the Trump administration’s $45 billion “ One Big Beautiful Bill ,” which would add 80,000 ICE beds nationwide.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to the overcrowding, legal advocates in Nebraska said they worry the facility’s remote location could increase the likelihood of detainees experiencing civil rights violations, with many being far from family and attorneys.\n \n\n   \n  McCook is one of several small communities in southwestern Nebraska and sits somewhat close to Interstate 80, a major highway that travels east to Omaha – about four hours away – and west toward Denver – three hours away.\n \n\n   \n  There is no public bus from Omaha, the most populous city in the state, to McCook as well as to North Platte, a rural town about an hour north of it where most of the immigrants detained following the raid at the meatpacking plant in June were taken. All travel must be done by car, which could become tricky during the harsh Nebraska winters.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s easier to get to North Platte because it’s on I-80. McCook, you have to go further, and you are more in the middle of nowhere,” said Lina Traslaviña Stover, executive director of the Omaha-based nonprofit Heartland Workers Group, whose work involves advocating for migrants who are detained at immigration detention facilities in the state.\n \n\n   \n  “Isolation is part of the strategy,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  Anne Wruth, an attorney with the Center for Immigrant and Refugee Advancement, who traveled west to meet with a detained client in North Platte, called the process a “logistical nightmare.”\n \n\n   \n  For lawmakers and advocates, who said they were surprised when plans for the ICE facility were announced, there are other pressing needs such as property taxes, labor shortage and affordable housing in the state.\n \n\n   \n  “This was not something that went through us,” Nebraska State Sen. Dunixi Guereca, a Democrat in the officially nonpartisan Legislature whose district includes part of Omaha, said about state lawmakers and plans for the facility, noting the timeline was “extremely truncated.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘And if anything happens, you go’\n \n\n   \n  Alejandra is realizing the state she and her parents have called home and instantly made them feel welcome – where many still say “please” and “thank you” – has started to turn against them, or at least some people.\n \n\n   \n  When the family first arrived in Nebraska, Alejandra excelled in school where she was surrounded by classmates from Thailand, Haiti, and El Salvador – a diversity fueled in part by the state’s refugee resettlement program, which welcomes the most refugees per capita compared to other US states despite Nebraska’s relatively small population of just over 2 million people, according to a  data analysis  from the Immigration Research Initiative, a non-profit, non-partisan think tank tracking immigrant data.\n \n\n   \n  “It was awesome. I saw so many different races and nationalities — I wasn’t the only one,” Alejandra said. “Compared to Iowa, I wasn’t highlighted as ‘she is not from here.’”\n \n\n   \n  Her parents, who are also undocumented, own a home and pay taxes. They’ve seen their children and grandchildren grow up and enjoyed taking them to the park or baseball games.\n \n\n   \n  With animosity toward immigrants on the rise in the US and Nebraska, Alejandra says her parents will soon leave the country as they plan to self-deport to Mexico in six months. They are afraid to be detained and worry the conditions at ICE facilities could jeopardize her mother’s fragile health.\n \n\n   \n  “They do not like living in fear,” Alejandra said.\n \n\n   \n  She’s not immune to that fear, and neither are her children. In recent weeks, Alejandra gave her 13-year-old son instructions on what to do if anything were to happen to her as they drove to the grocery store.\n \n\n   \n  “’Mom, you stay in the car and I’ll go inside.

Pentagon shifts to Pacific strikes seeking stronger link between targets and US drug trafficking \n       \n  By Natasha Bertrand, Zachary Cohen, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:35 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Pentagon has deliberately shifted its strategy in recent weeks to striking suspected narcotraffickers in the eastern Pacific Ocean, rather than the Caribbean Sea, because administration officials believe they have stronger evidence linking cocaine transport to the US from those western routes, according to people familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  The intelligence suggests that cocaine is far more likely to be trafficked from Colombia or Mexico, rather than Venezuela, the sources said, raising more questions about the true purpose of the US military buildup in the Caribbean Sea.\n \n\n   \n  The last four US military strikes targeting suspected drug smugglers were carried out in the eastern Pacific, according to Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, and sources said that future attacks are likely to be concentrated in that area because of the stronger link to US markets.\n \n\n   \n  By contrast, there have been questions about whether every boat struck by the US in the Caribbean was actually heading toward, or sending drugs to, the US. After the first boat strike in September, for example, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the vessel had likely been headed toward Trinidad and Tobago.\n \n\n   \n  Venezuela is also not known to be a major source of cocaine for the US market, but the Trump administration has been aggressively trying to link Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro to the drug trade while accumulating a huge military presence near Caracas.\n \n\n   \n  “At the direction of the President, the Department of War is taking the fight to the cartels and defending our Homeland from Designated Terrorist Organization’s illicit activities before their violence and poison reaches our shores – this includes all of our nation’s borders,” a Pentagon official told CNN. “The Department’s newly established counter-narcotics Joint Task Force is expanding efforts on both the East and West Coasts to counter illicit drug trafficking by narco-terrorists using maritime routes.”\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has not provided Congress with evidence to back up its claims that the 15 vessels the military has struck since September in both the Caribbean and the Pacific, killing at least 61 people, were ferrying drugs and carrying known drug traffickers.\n \n\n   \n  During a classified briefing on Capitol Hill this week, Pentagon officials also told lawmakers they do not know how to gauge success in the ongoing military campaign, according to a source familiar with the closed-door session.\n \n\n   \n  “They don’t know whether there’s any data or metrics that would show (the strikes are) impeding the flow of drugs, whether there has been an increase in the price due to higher demand or lower supply, like there’s just no information,” the source said. “None of the briefers could say what they’re going to do when the traffickers change their tactics. None of them could say how they’re addressing air and land routes.”\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Rep. Sara Jacobs said following the briefing on Thursday that administration officials confirmed that they do not necessarily know the individual identities of each person on board a vessel before they attack it.\n \n\n   \n  “They said that they do not need to positively identify individuals on the vessel to do the strikes,” Jacobs said, adding that the administration did not want to detain or try survivors in court, “because they could not satisfy the evidentiary burden.” The US military briefly held and then repatriated two survivors of one of its strikes earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  Military officials also told lawmakers on Thursday that the strikes were targeting cocaine, not fentanyl.\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump told a collection of senior military brass assembled during an  unusual event in Virginia last month  that the strikes were primarily targeting fentanyl transporting ships.\n \n\n   \n  “These boats, they’re stacked up with bags of white powder, that’s mostly fentanyl and other drugs too,” he said. “Every boat kills 25,000.”\n \n\n   \n  Fentanyl killed more than double the number of Americans than cocaine did in 2023, according to  US government data . By Trump’s math, the campaign against alleged drug boats thus far should prevent roughly 375,000 deaths, or slightly more than the total population of Cleveland.\n \n\n   \n  Jacobs said the briefers insisted that cocaine is a “facilitating drug of fentanyl but it was not a satisfactory answer for most of us.”\n \n\n   \n  “None of them could say what they’re doing for fentanyl,” said the source familiar with the briefing. “Fentanyl is the real problem here, and they’re actually not addressing fentanyl in any of these operations.”\n \n\n   \n  Democrats and Republicans also want a better explanation of the legal justification for the strikes, but military lawyers have been conspicuously absent from recent congressional briefings. The legal counsel to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was supposed to brief lawmakers on Thursday but pulled out after it became clear that lawyers from the defense secretary’s office were given a “pass” at attending, sources told CNN. Without the lawyers there, Democrats said the briefers could not fully answer their questions about the legality of the strikes.\n \n\n   \n  “They didn’t even show up with the lawyers,” Democratic Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts said after the briefing. “They canceled at the last minute.”\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth told reporters on Friday while traveling in Asia that he had engaged with Congress on a bipartisan basis about the strikes. But also on Friday, the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Republican Sen. Roger Wicker and Democratic Sen. Jack Reed, publicly released two letters they’d written to Hegseth over the last month seeking clarity on the operations, both of which have gone unanswered, the lawmakers said.\n \n\n   \n  The letters requested the execute orders for the US military strikes on the boats, and the Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel opinion that CNN has reported the administration is leaning on to legally justify the strikes. Some Republican senators were shown the OLC memo by administration officials during a briefing on Wednesday, infuriating Democrats who were not invited to the briefing and have still not seen document.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner called the move “a partisan stunt” that “is a slap in the face to Congress’ war powers responsibilities and to the men and women who serve this country.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/asia/us-japan-trump-takaichi-analysis-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"19:58:00Z","title":"In Tokyo, Trump and Takaichi bonded over a mutual friend – and a mutual enemy","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During a high-profile meeting in Tokyo, Donald Trump and Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi displayed strong personal rapport, reminiscent of the close relationship between Trump and former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.

friend – and a mutual enemy \n       \n  Analysis by Hanako Montgomery, Betsy Klein, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:58 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  During their closely watched  first meeting  in Tokyo, Donald Trump and Sanae Takaichi looked more like old friends than world leaders.\n \n\n   \n  There were smiles, back slaps, hugs and even a joke about running late because they’d been watching the LA Dodgers – led by Japanese megastar Shohei Ohtani – play in the World Series.\n \n\n   \n  The US president received a Nobel Peace Prize nomination (the second of his Asia trip), and a golf putter previously owned by the late former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who famously bonded with Trump on the green.\n \n\n   \n  Their easy camaraderie continued at the Yokosuka naval base, where Trump invited  Takaichi  on stage aboard the USS George Washington and praised her leadership. The new Japanese PM responded with a triumphant fist pump and a twirl, a moment that quickly went viral in her country.\n \n\n   \n  The message was unmistakable: the  Abe-era chemistry between Washington and Tokyo  is back.\n \n\n   \n  “She is a delight,” Trump told business leaders at the conclusion of the day’s activities. “I got to know her pretty well in a short period of time.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s not often Trump shows this level of warmth toward a foreign leader, particularly one from a country that’s weathered his tariff wars. It’s just as rare to see a Japanese prime minister display such open affection on the world stage.\n \n\n   \n  It certainly helps that the two see eye to eye on several political issues. Both are right-wing conservatives who support military buildup and a tougher stance on China. Their shared connection to Abe also helps explain their rapport. Abe was one of Trump’s “best friends” in global politics, as well as being Takaichi’s political mentor.\n \n\n   \n  But beneath the photo ops and nostalgia also lies a strategic alliance born of mutual need. Especially as both leaders eye the same adversary in Beijing.\n \n\n   \n  For Trump, having a staunch ally in the Asia-Pacific region willing to take a hard line against China is an undeniable win. Takaichi, a longtime China hawk, has criticized Beijing’s military expansion and economic coercion for years. Her hardline stance dovetails neatly with Trump’s “America First” worldview.\n \n\n   \n  The two also unveiled a new framework on rare earths, aimed at reducing dependence on China’s near-monopoly over critical resources. Details were vague, but the message of cooperation was clear. Japan still remembers the 2010 “rare earths shock,” when Beijing cut off exports after a territorial dispute. Takaichi has since made securing stable supply chains a key part of her economic agenda.\n \n\n   \n  Trade and investment also featured prominently at the summit. Japan pledged roughly $490 billion in US-bound investments, led by companies in AI, semiconductors, defense and advanced manufacturing, part of a broader trade deal already agreed upon by the allies in September.\n \n\n   \n  For Trump, who prizes loyalty and has a long memory for slights, an allegiance to Japan solidified early in his first term. Abe took great care to develop the US-Japan relationship, at a time when the president did not have a lot of support on the world stage.\n \n\n   \n  Foreign dignitaries and leaders  openly laughed  at the president during a 2018 United Nations General Assembly address. In 2019, a group of NATO leaders were  captured  on camera gossiping about him.\n \n\n   \n  But Abe cultivated his American counterpart with thoughtful gestures that played directly to Trump’s interests: multiple golf outings, the pomp and circumstance of a state banquet, and a trip to a sumo wrestling tournament where Trump bestowed the winner with a “President’s Cup.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump remained close to his counterpart until Abe’s assassination in 2022, and hosted his widow at Mar-a-Lago last year.\n \n\n   \n  That goodwill paved the way for Takaichi’s success on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  “He really likes her,” said a senior Trump administration official who observed their interactions behind closed doors.\n \n\n   \n  She also benefited from timing: Takaichi took office after Trump’s reciprocal tariffs rocked markets and reimagined US alliances – shielding her from tangling with the Trump administration to negotiate a trade deal.\n \n\n   \n  For Takaichi, standing shoulder to shoulder with Trump strengthens her hand at home. Her approval ratings soared after taking office, but her ruling party still lacks a parliamentary majority after recent election losses. Public frustration over past scandals also lingers. Projecting Japan’s influence abroad, and reaffirming its bond with Washington, helps her rebuild political capital.\n \n\n   \n  For Trump, the optics are just as valuable. Hardening a close alliance with Tokyo gives him diplomatic momentum ahead of a more contentious meeting with China’s Xi Jinping. It’s also a reminder to Beijing that he’s not short on powerful friends in the region.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/letitia-james-challenges-appointment-us-attorney","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"18:57:00-04:00","title":"New York AG Letitia James challenges appointment of US attorney in Albany","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"New York Attorney General Letitia James has filed a motion to challenge the appointment of John Sarcone as U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of New York, arguing that the appointment was unlawful and that the resulting subpoena seeking information about her investigations into the Trump Organization and the National Rifle Association is retaliatory, infringes on First Amendment rights, and violates New York’s state sovereignty.

November? Here’s what we know about the judges’ rulings \n       \n  By Tami Luhby, Devan Cole, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:15 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Two federal judges have  ordered  the Trump administration to use emergency funds to provide at least partial  food stamp benefits  to tens of millions of Americans in November, as the federal government shutdown drags on.\n \n\n   \n  And President Donald Trump on Friday evening said that he’s instructed the administration’s lawyers to ask the courts how it can legally fund the benefits as quickly as possible.\n \n\n   \n  “Even if we get immediate guidance, it will unfortunately be delayed while States get the money out,” Trump  posted  on Truth Social. “If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding, just like I did with Military and Law Enforcement Pay.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, the much needed assistance won’t come that quickly for many food stamp recipients. Also, it remains unclear whether they’ll receive their full benefits or a smaller amount since the US Department of Agriculture’s contingency fund doesn’t have enough money to cover the total cost.\n \n\n   \n  Several legal and procedural challenges must be overcome before the benefits can start flowing to the nearly 42 million people in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, the formal name for food stamps. The US Department of Agriculture halted November allocations, arguing it  doesn’t have the funds  to provide them, which prompted  a coalition of Democratic-led states  and a group of cities, non-profits, unions and small businesses to sue earlier this week.\n \n\n   \n  It’s now unclear whether the administration will appeal the rulings. However, the Justice Department signaled during a hearing on Thursday that it would do so if US District Judge Indira Talwani in Boston issued an adverse ruling.\n \n\n   \n  Though Talwani stopped short on Friday of requiring the administration to tap into the contingency fund, she said the USDA was required to use money in that rainy-day fund to partially cover November benefits and gave it until Monday to decide whether it would use only those funds or also dip into a separate pot of money.\n \n\n   \n  A judge in Rhode Island said during proceedings Friday in a separate case over the SNAP payments that he was ordering the government to use the contingency fund to ensure some benefits could be distributed starting November 1. The administration could also appeal this decision.\n \n\n   \n    Delayed payments\n \n\n   \n  Whatever happens in court, it will take time for SNAP recipients to get access to any assistance in November.\n \n\n   \n  States stopped the process of  issuing benefits for November  after the USDA sent them a letter on October 10 ordering them to do so. States send SNAP enrollees’ information to vendors every month so they can load funds onto recipients’ benefit cards, often days or weeks before the new month begins. Those steps need to take place before SNAP can restart.\n \n\n   \n  The delay will be felt immediately. Some 3 million recipients should receive their benefits on November 1, according to an estimate by Code for America, which works with all levels of government to improve access to food assistance and other safety net programs. The number grows to nearly 13.7 million by November 5, with remaining SNAP enrollees getting their allotments on a staggered basis during the month.\n \n\n   \n  “They are not going out on time,” Gina Plata-Nino, interim director of SNAP at the Food Research & Action Center, an advocacy group, said of the November benefits.\n \n\n   \n  Still, providing full payments would be the fastest way to get assistance to food stamp recipients.\n \n\n   \n  “If the administration complies with the courts’ rulings to release the SNAP contingency funds immediately and supplements those amounts using its legal transfer authority, which the courts also affirmed, then SNAP benefits could begin to be issued with only a short delay,” said Dottie Rosenbaum, director of federal SNAP policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n \n\n   \n    Partial payments harder to do\n \n\n   \n  However, the process could become much more complicated — and time consuming — if the USDA opts to only tap into its contingency fund and doesn’t augment it with leftover tariff revenue dedicated to child nutrition programs, as it did with the  WIC nutrition assistance program .\n \n\n   \n  The emergency fund only has $5.3 billion remaining in it, while benefits total about $8.2 billion for the month, according to court filings submitted by the Justice Department, which represents the USDA in the case. (Other expenses and benefits bring the total closer to $9 billion.)\n \n\n   \n  The USDA also has access to nearly $17 billion in tariff revenue, but a Justice Department attorney told a judge Friday that using the funds for SNAP would hurt the child nutrition programs that the money supports. Both Talwani and the judge in Rhode Island, John McConnell, left it up to the USDA to decide whether to use the additional resources to pay full benefits in November.\n \n\n   \n  If only the contingency fund were tapped, the USDA would have to reduce benefits for all SNAP recipients, which it has never done, according to a declaration filed by the agency official who oversees the program. Also, state agencies would need to recode their systems to issue the smaller benefit amounts, which could result in payment errors.\n \n\n   \n  “Because no template, processes, or past experience exist to inform a reduction in benefits, there are multiple variables which could lead to significant problems in attempting to reduce benefits for every SNAP household in the country,” Patrick Penn, deputy undersecretary of the USDA’s Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services, said in his declaration. “The ability, time and resources to accomplish this system change would vary greatly among State agencies, with some State agencies working with systems that are decades old.”\n \n\n   \n  For at least some states, the process could take anywhere from a few weeks to several months, Penn said, drawing upon informal conversations with state agencies.\n \n\n   \n  Before states could even act, the USDA would also have to determine how to calculate and authorize the reduced allotments. This effort could be hampered if its employees have been furloughed during the shutdown or laid off or departed amid the Trump administration’s efforts to downsize the federal government, Plata-Nino said.\n \n\n   \n  While some states have identified potential ways to issue smaller benefits quickly, the methods must be programmed, tested and verified, which could take time, she noted.\n \n\n   \n  If recipients receive partial benefits in November, they would get retroactive payments to make them whole once the government reopens, she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/snap-federal-judges","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"20:25:00-20:30","title":"Two Federal Judges Require Trump Administration to Use Emergency Funds to Partially Cover Food Stamp Benefits","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Two federal judges, John McConnell in Rhode Island and Indira Talwani in Massachusetts, have ordered the Trump administration to use emergency contingency funds—estimated at $5.3 billion—to partially cover food stamp (SNAP) benefits for tens of millions of Americans starting November 1, despite the ongoing government shutdown.

SNAP with certain monies we have available.”\n \n\n   \n  “Even if we get immediate guidance, it will unfortunately be delayed while States get the money out,” Trump  posted  on Truth Social Friday evening. “If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding, just like I did with Military and Law Enforcement Pay.”\n \n\n   \n  The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, costs between $8 billion and $9 billion a month, so the judges’ orders will not cover all of the needed payments for November.\n \n\n   \n  “There is no doubt that the … contingency funds are appropriated funds that are without a doubt necessary to carry out the program’s operation.” US District Judge John McConnell in Rhode Island said. “The shutdown of the government through funding doesn’t do away with SNAP, it just does away with the funding of it.”\n \n\n   \n  During proceedings Friday, McConnell said he was ordering the government to use the contingency fund to ensure some benefits could be distributed starting November 1.\n \n\n   \n  McConnell’s ruling during a hastily scheduled hearing came minutes after US District Judge Indira Talwani in Boston made a similar order. Both judges, appointees of President Barack Obama, also said that USDA is allowed to tap into another bucket of money of nearly $17 billion to pay November SNAP benefits in full, but that decision is currently up to the administration.\n \n\n   \n  Though Talwani stopped short on Friday of requiring the administration to tap into the contingency fund, she said the USDA was required to use money in that rainy-day fund to partially cover November benefits and gave it until Monday to decide whether it would use only those funds or also dip into a separate pot of money.\n \n\n   \n  “This court has now clarified that Defendants are required to use those Contingency Funds as necessary for the SNAP program. And while these contingency funds reportedly are insufficient to cover the entire cost of SNAP for November, Defendants also may supplement the Contingency Funds by authorizing a transfer of additional funds … to avoid any reductions,”  Talwani said in a 15-page order. \n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration opposes tapping into those other funds, arguing in court it will hurt the child nutrition programs that the revenue supports.\n \n\n   \n  Even with Trump’s directive and the judge’s rulings, millions of recipients will still face delays in getting their benefits, which were scheduled to start being distributed on November 1. It will take time for the Department of Agriculture and states to get the money flowing again.\n \n\n   \n  In the program’s decades-long history, a government shutdown has never prevented it from distributing SNAP funds to states, which administer the benefits, though the program was at risk during the 2018-2019 impasse.\n \n\n   \n  The Boston lawsuit was filed earlier this week by a group of Democratic attorneys general and governors from 25 states and Washington, DC, while the case in Rhode Island was brought Thursday by a coalition of cities, non-profits, unions and small businesses.\n \n\n   \n  As the government shutdown nears its one-month mark, courts are increasingly being asked to intervene to stave off a series of dramatic developments. Earlier this week, a federal judge in California indefinitely blocked the administration from laying off thousands of federal workers, saying the government was unlawfully using the shutdown as legal justification for the layoffs.\n \n\n   \n  The administration could seek appeals. Asked earlier Friday by CNN what the department would do if courts required USDA to tap into the contingency fund, Secretary Brooke Rollins said, “We’re looking at all the options.”\n \n\n   \n    Delayed payments\n \n\n   \n  States stopped the process of issuing benefits for November after the USDA sent them a letter on October 10 ordering them to do so. States send SNAP enrollees’ information to vendors every month so they can load funds onto recipients’ benefit cards.\n \n\n   \n  Each state has a specific date by which they must send the information ahead of the new month in order for benefits to go out on time, according to the lawsuit. Payments are made on a staggered basis throughout the month.\n \n\n   \n  Talwani acknowledged the likely delay in benefits during a hearing Thursday, and also asked about the process of providing partial payments to recipients next month since the contingency fund alone won’t cover the full amount.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re dealing with the reality that … the benefits aren’t going to be there on November 1,” she said.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/poll-numbers-trump-fact-check","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"17:05:00Z","title":"Fact check: Trump’s false claims about his poll numbers","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump made false claims about his approval ratings, asserting he had the highest poll numbers ever and better numbers than any other president in recent years.

But Trump also said two things about his popularity that are not even close to true.\n \n\n   \n  He said, “I have my highest poll numbers that I’ve ever had.” And he said, “I have the best numbers for any president in many years – any president.”\n \n\n   \n    Trump’s approval is down markedly from his second-term peak\n \n\n   \n  In reality, polls show that Americans’ approval of Trump has declined significantly since the beginning of his second term in late January. Multiple polling averages confirm that Trump’s poll numbers are nowhere in the ballpark of their highest-ever levels.\n \n\n   \n   A New York Times average  put Trump’s net approval at negative-11 points as of Tuesday: 43% approval and 54% disapproval. That is down a  net 20 points  from the first week of the term, when Trump was at positive-9 points – 52% approval and 43% disapproval.  CNN’s Poll of Polls  average, updated Wednesday, has Trump’s net approval at negative-15 points (41% approval and 56% disapproval), down a net 14 points from our first average of the term in early February.\n \n\n   \n  Other polling averages also show large drops in Trump’s standing since the beginning of the term.\n \n\n   \n  An  average produced by G. Elliott Morris , co-founder of the polling data website  FiftyPlusOne.news , put Trump’s net approval at roughly negative-14 points as of Tuesday, down about a net 26 points from the first days of the term. An  average produced by data journalist Nate Silver  put Trump’s net approval at roughly negative-10 points as of Tuesday, down about a net 22 points from the first days of the term.\n \n\n   \n  The White House didn’t respond to a CNN request for comment for this article.\n \n\n   \n  It’s worth noting that Trump does continue to have  extremely high   approval   among Republicans , often in the vicinity of 90%. But he never said Tuesday that he was talking about his popularity with his own party rather than the country as a whole, and he is not at a personal record high even among Republicans in particular.\n \n\n   \n    Many other presidents had far better numbers\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s current poll numbers are nowhere close to “the best numbers for any president in many years,” even if you ignore the fact that they’re not even his own best numbers in many years.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s current low standing – a negative net approval, with approval specifically in the low-40s – clearly does not approach the  approval  peaks   of recent predecessors. President Barack Obama hit 69% approval in the early days of his first term, according to tracking by polling firm Gallup, while President George W. Bush hit 90% approval in the wake of the terror attacks of September 11, 2001. Even President Joe Biden, who struggled with weak poll numbers for much of his term, was up at 57% approval in both January 2021 and April 2021.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s claim is also wrong even if he was referring specifically to other presidents’ poll numbers on the same date of a term.\n \n\n   \n  Biden had low net approval on the equivalent day of his term, but it was still better than Trump’s in both  Morris’s average  and  Silver’s average . And Trump’s boast about beating “any president in many years” clearly suggested he was comparing himself to other presidents in addition to Biden; the data shows that  every other person elected president after World War II  had better poll numbers than Trump on the equivalent date in their ​first term, in both net approval and approval alone.\n \n\n   \n  Silver’s  historical tracking  shows that, on the date Trump made this claim while having a roughly negative-10 net approval, Obama had about a positive-9 net approval in his first term, George W. Bush about positive-76, President Bill Clinton positive-2, President George H.W. Bush about positive-38, President Ronald Reagan about positive-20, President Jimmy Carter about positive-24, President Richard Nixon about positive-27, President John F. Kennedy about positive-65, President Dwight D. Eisenhower about positive-45, and President Harry Truman about positive-41.\n \n\n   \n  It would be fair to point out that Trump is serving a (non-consecutive) second term rather than a first term. But that added context doesn’t make Trump’s assertion correct. Gallup, which  assessed presidential approval on a quarter-by-quarter basis , found that, other than Nixon, Trump had a lower average approval in his 19th quarter as president – the third quarter of the second term, running from July 20 through October 19 – than any president elected to two terms from at least Eisenhower in the 1950s onward.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Ariel Edwards-Levy contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/health/fluoride-supplement-restrictions-fda","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"17:14:00Z","title":"FDA Moves to Restrict Fluoride Supplements as Part of MAHA Agenda","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has announced restrictions on the use of prescription fluoride supplements, particularly for children under age 3 and those at low or moderate risk of tooth decay, citing concerns about disruption of the gut microbiome and potential negative effects on intellectual development.

But experts broadly emphasize the safety and benefits of fluoride.\n \n\n   \n  Fluoride is a mineral that can be found naturally in some foods and groundwater. It can help prevent tooth decay by strengthening the protective outer layer of enamel that can be worn away by acids formed by bacteria, plaque and sugars in the mouth.\n \n\n   \n  The practice of adding fluoride to public water systems started in the United States in 1945 to help improve oral health in a cost-effective and equitable way. The CDC named fluoridation of drinking water  one of the 10 greatest health interventions in America  in the 20th century alongside vaccination, family planning and safer workplaces.\n \n\n   \n  Most US residents live in a community where fluoride is added to public drinking water, according to  federal data  from 2022. In places where fluoride is not in the water, fluoride tablets or drops may be prescribed for babies and children to reduce the risk of tooth decay — and reliance on fluoride supplements could become more common, as Utah and Florida became the first states to  ban the practice  of adding fluoride to drinking water and similar legislation has been introduced in several other states.\n \n\n   \n  In April, the US Department of Health and Human Services and the US Environmental Protection Agency Administration  announced  that they would study the science to make a new recommendation on fluoride. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has also said he will tell the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to stop recommending fluoridation for drinking water in communities.\n \n\n   \n  The FDA launched a ”safety review and public comment period” on the issue in ​May,   ﻿and a  strategy report  from the MAHA Commission – with an agenda spearheaded by Kennedy – specifically named fluoride supplements as an issue to investigate, along with vaccine injuries and exposures to pesticides and microplastics.\n \n\n   \n  In the resulting  scientific evaluation , published Friday, the agency concluded that fluoride supplements “should not be used in children under age 3 or by older children who are not at high risk of tooth decay.”\n \n\n   \n  “For the same reason fluoride may work to kill bacteria on teeth, it may also alter the gut microbiome, which may have broader health implications,” the agency said in a news release.\n \n\n   \n  “There are better ways to protect children’s teeth than taking unapproved ingestible fluoride, which is now recognized to alter the gut microbiome. The microbiome is increasingly recognized to be central to a child’s health and development,” FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary said in the release.\n \n\n   \n  The FDA on Friday also referenced “preliminary but potentially concerning” data about the risks that fluoride can have for children’s intellectual development. A  meta-analysis published earlier this year , which would become the basis for further federal investigation, concluded that IQ drops as fluoride levels rise. But some experts have raised concerns about biases in the analysis and emphasized that it focused on levels of fluoride that are far higher than most people are exposed to.\n \n\n   \n  As water fluoridation starts to roll back in some communities, experts say that protecting the option to use prescription supplements is key. In fact, the legislation in Utah that banned the addition of fluoride to the public drinking water included provisions to expand access to prescription fluoride — and  prescriptions spiked  after the change.\n \n\n   \n  For some oral health advocates, the latest action from the FDA is a win simply because it is not an outright ban.\n \n\n   \n  “We are actually quite pleased about this decision, because fluoride supplements remain available and will continue to be a benefit to oral health,” said Dr. James Bekker, a pediatric dentist from Utah who spoke at public meeting to discuss the risks and benefits of the prescription fluoride supplements in July.\n \n\n   \n  “We feel that the decision of the FDA to continue making fluoride supplements available is an indication that all of the input generated from health professionals was heard and considered in their decision,” Bekker said in an email to CNN on Friday. “Providers can prescribe according to their consultation with parents and patients at recommended levels. We still recommend starting fluoride supplements at age 6 months in non-fluoridated water communities and will rely on knowledgeable health professionals to follow the documented science as they consider appropriate ages and dosages.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/uk/brother-virginia-giuffre-king-charles-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"16:00:00-04:00","title":"Brother of Virginia Giuffre calls for a meeting with King Charles to shed more light on the Epstein case","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Sky Roberts, brother of Virginia Giuffre, has urged King Charles III to meet with his family to share the details of his sister’s trauma and to use the monarchy’s influence to expose the hidden inner circle of Jeffrey Epstein’s sex-trafficking operations.

So, if he asked me to come meet with him, I’d be in London tomorrow,” Sky Roberts told CNN in an interview on Friday.\n \n\n   \n  His comments come after the King took the extraordinary decision to cast out his brother Andrew from the monarchy this week amid renewed public fury over his ties to the late convicted sex offender Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re actually getting some acknowledgement from the King and saying he stands with survivors,” Roberts said, adding that the King’s response had been more positive than that of US authorities. “I think we should take a moment of appreciation for that but also call to action – to take it that next step further into an investigation, and to expedite that.”\n \n\n   \n  Buckingham Palace declined to comment when asked about the idea of a meeting with Giuffre’s family.\n \n\n   \n  The statement released by Buckingham Palace on Thursday, which announced that Andrew would be  stripped of his titles  and honors, also said: “Their Majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN understands that the palace acted because while it acknowledges that Andrew continues to deny all allegations made against him, it had concluded that he made serious lapses of judgement.\n \n\n   \n  Giuffre, who died by suicide earlier this year, accused  the King’s brother Andrew  of sexually assaulting her while she was a teenager. Andrew has vehemently denied the accusations against him.\n \n\n   \n  The family has called for a “full investigation” and, if Andrew is found to be implicated in any crime, for him to be prosecuted “to the fullest extent of the law.”\n \n\n   \n  In her  posthumous memoir , Giuffre wrote that she was brutally beaten and raped by an unidentified prime minister and “lent” out to “scores of wealthy, powerful people” by Epstein and his circle.\n \n\n   \n  Roberts said he thinks British police and authorities likely have information about other perpetrators of sexual abuse that they could bring to light in relation to the Epstein case.\n \n\n   \n  “If you have a pile of paper sitting somewhere that can expose the truth, or at least help bring light … Do not protect people that might have been implicated. That needs to be released fully,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Asked if he would be willing to meet with Andrew as well as King Charles, Roberts said: “I don’t think there’s anything Andrew can say except for A) an extreme apology to my sister, and B) if he’s ready to come forward and actually give some sort of light to what has transpired in that inner circle” with Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.\n \n\n   \n  An expedited process of justice against Andrew would also involve “getting him out of his house,” Roberts said, addressing reports that the former prince will remain at the Royal Lodge in Windsor until after the holidays. “I think it shouldn’t be until Christmas. It should be tomorrow.”\n \n\n   \n  Roberts also said the United Kingdom should “find another loophole” to ensure that Andrew’s status as eighth in line to the throne is also removed. “Who cares if it takes a little bit more time and an Act of Parliament – then do it.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/us/callout-snap-benefits-government-shutdown","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"15:05:00Z","title":"SNAP Benefits at Risk During Government Shutdown: What It Means for Families","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Due to a government shutdown, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has announced it cannot pay $8 billion in SNAP benefits for November, threatening food security for over 40 million Americans.

\n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:59 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Annemarie King is eating only once a day, and her husband, Randall, is picking up extra shifts at the drywall factory where he works. They are among the nearly 42 million Americans preparing for their food stamp benefits to run dry in November because of the ongoing  government shutdown .\n \n\n   \n  The Kings, who live in Cincinnati and have eight young children, depend on the roughly $1,000 in food stamps that they receive at the start of every month to stock their refrigerator with fresh fruits, vegetables and meat.\n \n\n   \n  But since the US Department of Agriculture  announced in mid-October  that it doesn’t have the funding to provide next month’s benefits during the government shutdown, Annemarie, a stay-at-home mother, has been buying more canned and boxed items and preparing less for dinner.\n \n\n   \n  She’s also going without food herself. Her 11-year-old son has noticed, she said, but she tells him not to worry and that she ate while he was at school.\n \n\n   \n  “I feel guilty eating a meal,” Annemarie said. “I don’t want to take food away from them.”\n \n\n   \n  As the shutdown nears the one-month mark, it’s not just furloughed federal workers feeling the financial strain. Low-income households across the country will lose access to  key social safety net programs  in the coming days as billions of dollars in federal funding dries up.\n \n\n   \n  Beginning November 1, more than 65,000 children and families could lose access to Head Start programs, which provide early education and child development resources, according to the National Head Start Association. For some parents, that means they might have to quit their jobs because they won’t have child care anymore.\n \n\n   \n  Others are worried they might not get heat subsidies from the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program before the winter months. On top of that, roughly 24 million Americans who receive health insurance through the Affordable Care Act are preparing for what is likely to be a  significant increase  in premiums next year.\n \n\n   \n  In interviews with people in cities across the country, the early implications of the stop in federal funding for low-income families are starting to come into focus. Food banks and other charities are expecting higher demand, as millions face increasingly desperate situations without the programs they rely on.\n \n\n   \n  At the Kings’ household, the loss of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, means that instead of serving chicken, a fresh vegetable and either mashed potatoes or macaroni and cheese, Annemarie has been cooking chicken and canned green beans. Chilis, pastas and roasts are on the menu more often since they can last for a few days.\n \n\n   \n  “Our family is suffering because neither side will compromise,” Annemarie said of the stalemate on Capitol Hill.  “It’s no longer a Democrat thing, it’s no longer a Republican thing. It’s our lives.”\n \n\n   \n  The status of SNAP funding for November is currently uncertain, however. A federal judge in Boston indicated Thursday that she will intervene in a high-stakes fight between Democratic-led states and the Trump administration over its US Department of Agriculture’s decision to not tap into billions of dollars in emergency funds to provide benefits next month.\n \n\n   \n  However the judge rules, millions of Americans will not receive their food stamp benefits on time. An estimated 3 million people will be affected on November 1 alone, according to estimates from Code for America, which works with all levels of government to improve access to food assistance and other safety net programs.\n \n\n   \n   Food pantries  around the country are preparing for a surge in demand next week if people don’t receive their SNAP stipends. But food bank directors have warned that they can provide only a fraction of the meals that are supplied by federal assistance.\n \n\n   \n  And for some households, the loss of more than one of these programs has a compounding effect.\n \n\n   \n  In Hillsboro, Ohio – about an hour outside Cincinnati – the closure of the local Head Start program means Lauren Lowe, 42, will likely have to quit her job as a restaurant server. She and her husband were able to both work full time while their 4-year-old son, Carter, attended Head Start on weekdays.\n \n\n   \n  He and 176 other kids got meals and health care there. And he loved his friends and teachers, Lowe said. Since she’s had to tell him that this will be his last week in the program, Carter is “broken-hearted right now. He’s crying every single morning because he wants to be in school with his friends,” Lowe said.\n \n\n   \n  Lowe is feeling uneasy, too. Quitting her job means less income for the household – in addition to missing their food stamp benefits. \n \n\n   \n  “It’s really scary because, how do we make ends meet?” Lowe said. “I either stay home and school my child or figure out how we’re going to pay the bills to keep a roof over our heads and food on the table.”\n \n\n   \n  Lowe will also have to replace the two meals Carter was getting every day he was at Head Start.\n \n\n   \n  “On Monday mornings, kids do come in hungrier than usual, so we know they’re really dependent on that breakfast, lunch and snack we give them,” said Julia Wise, the executive director of the Highland County Community Action Organization, which runs the Hillsboro Head Start program. \n \n\n   \n  Wise said 45 Head Start staff will be furloughed on Monday. Other Head Start programs — particularly those run by larger entities, such as nonprofits, school districts and local governments — can limp along by drawing on community support or taking out lines of credit.\n \n\n   \n  In the Kansas City area, 17 programs with grants expiring on November 1 decided to take a “financial risk” by staying open, said Kasey Lawson, the Head Start director for the Mid-America Regional Council. The providers do not know if they will be reimbursed later when the new grant year is funded.\n \n\n   \n  In Hillsboro, teachers prepared homework packets that will take the kids through the end of November, so they can keep studying even when the program is closed. Some of that staff will likely   get other jobs before the government shutdown ends, meaning whenever Head Start does get funding again, it might not have enough educators to reopen all its classrooms, Wise said.\n \n\n   \n  For those who can’t find other work, “they’re going on furlough, they’re not going to have money coming in, so they could apply for SNAP benefits, but now SNAP is not going to be available either,” Wise said.\n \n\n   \n  “This is impacting us across the board,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  In rural Oregon, where the temperatures are already dipping below the freezing mark, the suspension of funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, is putting lives at risk, said Sheri Gutierrez, energy program manager at Community Action Program of East Central Oregon, a nonprofit that provides a range of services for residents in need.\n \n\n   \n  The $4 billion program, which helps nearly 6 million people pay their utility bills, is not in as immediate danger as SNAP and Head Start; the aid is typically distributed to utility companies between mid-November and early December.\n \n\n   \n  But barely a month into the season, Community Action in Oregon already has more than $200,000 in grant payments that are on hold until the government reopens. Many of its clients heat their homes with propane, wood and heating oil, and they don’t enjoy the same continuous service and shutoff protections available to many people who use electricity and natural gas to stay warm.\n \n\n   \n  The delay has worried local residents, some of whom are using old space heaters or their ovens, which Gutierrez says aren’t safe.\n \n\n   \n  “We hear the desperation when speaking to these clients on a daily basis. People want reassurance that they will get assistance,” she said. “LIHEAP is lifesaving. Without heat, they won’t survive.”\n \n\n   \n  In Lakeville, Minnesota, Ronda Beck is also waiting for help from LIHEAP to cover the electric bill. After speaking with her utility company “at great length,” Beck was told she could pay whatever she can until her grant is funded and she won’t be disconnected. But she’s not sure how she’ll scrape together a couple of bucks since she’s not working.\n \n\n   \n  “Where do I get $5 from?” She said. “It’s a tough situation.”\n \n\n   \n  Beck figured she could survive on groceries she picks up from her local food pantries if she and her adult son stop receiving food stamps next month – that is until she found out on Tuesday that one of the groups is only providing two or three days of food, instead two weeks’ worth. Now, she’s terrified.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t want to go hungry,” said Beck, who along with her son is looking for jobs in Lakeville, Minnesota, where they live. “I don’t want to walk into [a food pantry] and have them say, ‘We’re at our limit’.”\n \n\n   \n  Just outside Washington DC, Willissa Bullock worries about her food bank running out, as it’s dealing with a surge in demand from furloughed federal workers in the area. When the Landover, Maryland, resident heard that the USDA would not issue benefits next month, Bullock says she cried – nervous about how she would provide for her kids, who are in college.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this week, Bullock left a local food pantry run by No Limits Outreach Ministries with only enough items – including lettuce, apple juice, and canned goods – to last two or three days. Until recently, her shopping cart would be overflowing.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m telling the kids to look for jobs,” said Bullock, who is unemployed and applying for disability after having back surgery. “It’s the only way we’ll be able to eat.”\n \n\n   \n  The food pantry has been receiving fewer shipments from Capital Area Food Bank after two  Covid 19-era relief programs  were canceled earlier this year. The pantry used to be able to offer meat, fish, eggs and milk to its clients, but now it mostly has beans, rice and canned foods, said Oliver Carter, pastor of No Limits Outreach Ministries.\n \n\n   \n  “Our storage used to be full and now it’s almost empty,” Carter said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/jeffrey-epstein-financial-records-unsealed-jp-morgan","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"17:00:00Z","title":"Newly Unsealed Epstein Records Shed Light on Years of His Financial Transactions with Wall Street Figures","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Newly unsealed court records reveal that JPMorgan Chase filed over 20 suspicious activity reports (SARs) between 2002 and 2019, documenting more than $1 billion in financial transactions involving Jeffrey Epstein with Wall Street figures, including Leon Black and Jes Staley, and Russian banks such as Alfa Bank and Sberbank.

financial transactions with Wall St. figures \n       \n  By Kara Scannell, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:16 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  One month after  Jeffrey Epstein  died in a jail cell while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges, JPMorgan Chase   reported to   US authorities of more than one billion dollars in transactions it viewed as suspicious, according to newly unsealed court records.\n \n\n   \n  The notification was made on September 26, 2019, in a suspicious activity report, which is a kind of confidential report financial institutions file with the Treasury Department to flag potentially nefarious activity.\n \n\n   \n  JPMorgan’s report highlights over $1 billion in transactions Epstein engaged in from October 2003 until July 2019 with numerous related companies, Wall Street titans, his former lawyer and others. Two accounts included in the report were linked to Russian banks Alfa Bank and Sberbank.\n \n\n   \n  The bank wrote in the SAR it was flagging the transactions because of negative media about Epstein’s alleged sex trafficking of minors, media reports of allegations Epstein misappropriating money as an investment adviser, his use of multiple accounts, the Russian banks, and his relationships with two US presidents.\n \n\n   \n  Epstein was arrested in July 2019 and charged with sex trafficking underaged girls. He died weeks later by suicide in the Metropolitan Correctional Center while awaiting trial.\n \n\n   \n  Judge Jed Rakoff ordered the unsealing of the records, which were part of a lawsuit between the US Virgin Islands and JPMorgan Chase, following requests by The New York Times and Wall Street Journal. In 2023, JPMorgan Chase agreed to pay $290 million to settle a class action lawsuit from survivors of Epstein and an additional $75 million to settle with USVI, where Epstein owned an island. There was no admission of wrongdoing in these settlements.\n \n\n   \n  The documents are the latest in a slow release of materials tied to Epstein as public demand for accountability and transparency about Epstein has gone global. Thursday, Britain’s King Charles took the extraordinary step of stripping his brother Andrew of his prince title. The Justice Department remains under pressure to release more information about its investigation into Epstein, and House lawmakers are taking depositions for their investigation.\n \n\n   \n  Included in the hundreds of pages of unsealed documents are emails between Epstein and Jes Staley, a former top official at JPMorgan bank, who in 2021 resigned as head of Barclays bank following media scrutiny over his long relationship with Epstein. This year, Staley  said  he didn’t know about Epstein’s involvement with underaged girls but admitted in court that he had sex with one of Epstein’s assistants.\n \n\n   \n  Among the pages are emails between Epstein and Staley, with Epstein suggesting he could set up meetings for Staley to recruit new clients including the co-founders of Google and heads of nations.  None of the individuals were accused of any wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  Prior to Epstein’s death in 2019, JPMorgan filed a number of SARs involving the disgraced financier’s accounts, and the documents show banking officials shared news articles about Epstein’s alleged activities. JPMorgan closed its accounts with Epstein in 2013, five years after Epstein pleaded guilty to state prostitution charges and reached a non-prosecution agreement with the US attorney’s office in the Southern District of Florida.\n \n\n   \n  The newly unsealed records include the SARs, including one dating as far back as 2002, as well as the last one filed in September 2019.\n \n\n   \n  “Generally, the only new material here is the SARs themselves. Those basically summarize financial information produced in litigation, much of which has been public for years. The SARs do confirm what’s been inferred all along: the bank filed SARs about Epstein early on, and specifically when it exited Epstein from the bank in 2013 – and repeatedly between 2013 and 2019, as required,” said Patricia Wexler, a spokesperson for JPMorgan Chase.   “It does not appear that anyone in the government or law enforcement acted on those SARs for years.”\n \n\n   \n  In the batch of documents, there’s a letter from the US attorney’s office for the Southern District of Florida which in 2007 sought records from Bear Stearns, one of Epstein’s banks that was later acquired by JPMorgan, as part of its then investigation into Epstein that resulted in the non-prosecution agreement.\n \n\n   \n  One of the biggest Wall Street names mentioned on the list of transactions on the 2019 SAR is Leon Black, a long-time associate of Epstein, who has maintained that Epstein gave him financial advice.\n \n\n   \n  “After an exhaustive investigation more than four years ago, the Dechert law firm concluded that Mr. Black paid Epstein only for tax and estate planning advice that saved him and his family billions of dollars. To imply that Epstein somehow had influence over Mr. Black is false and patently absurd,” Susan Estrich, an attorney for Black, said in a statement. “Indeed, it was Mr. Black who fired Epstein because he was disruptive and believed the fees for his services were excessive. The Dechert Report also found that Mr. Black had no knowledge of Epstein’s criminal activities.”\n \n\n   \n  The unsealed records include emails between Staley and Epstein about meeting in 2010 with then Prince Andrew. The then-Prince emailed Staley, “Wishing you a very happy Christmas and New Year.”\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat, has asked JPMorgan for banking records and suggested officials turned a blind eye to Epstein’s conduct to make millions of dollars in fees from his accounts.\n \n\n   \n  In a recent response, the bank denied knowledge of Epstein’s activities, writing, “with the exception of former JPMC executive Jes Staley, the bank’s executives (current and former) are respected professionals who acted with integrity and would never have allowed Epstein to remain a client if they knew of his ongoing crimes.”\n \n\n   \n  “The Firm deeply regrets having had Epstein as a client and would never have continued doing business with him if it believed he engaged in ongoing criminal conduct,” the bank also said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/health/state-medicaid-undocumented-immigrants-kff-health-news","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"17:22:00-04:00","title":"Trump’s HHS Orders State Medicaid Programs to Help Find Undocumented Immigrants","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In October 2025, the Trump administration directed state Medicaid programs to verify the immigration status of enrolled individuals, with five states and Washington, D.C. collectively receiving over 170,000 names.

programs to help find undocumented immigrants \n       \n  By Phil Galewitz, KFF Health News\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:22 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Trump administration has ordered states to investigate certain individuals enrolled in Medicaid to determine whether they are ineligible because of their immigration status, with five states reporting they’ve together received more than 170,000 names collectively — an “unprecedented” step by the federal government that ensnares the state-federal health program in the president’s immigration crackdown.\n \n\n   \n  Advocates say the push burdens states with duplicative verification checks and could lead people to lose coverage just for missing paperwork deadlines. But the administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Mehmet Oz, said in a post on the social platform X on Oct. 31 that more than $1 billion “of federal taxpayer dollars were being spent on funding Medicaid for illegal immigrants” in five states and Washington, D.C.\n \n\n   \n  Medicaid’s overall spending topped $900 billion in fiscal year 2024.\n \n\n   \n  It wasn’t clear from Oz’s statement or an accompanying video over what period the spending happened, and CMS spokespeople did not immediately respond to questions, either for an earlier version of this article or after Oz’s statement was posted.\n \n\n   \n  Only U.S. citizens and some lawfully present immigrants are eligible for Medicaid, which covers low-income and disabled people, and the closely related Children’s Health Insurance Program. Those without legal status are ineligible for federally funded health coverage, including Medicaid, Medicare, and plans through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces.\n \n\n   \n  At least one state said it disagreed with Oz’s comments.\n \n\n   \n  “Our payments for coverage of undocumented individuals are in accordance with state and federal laws,” said Marc Williams, a spokesperson for Colorado’s Department of Health Care Policy & Financing, which administers the state’s Medicaid program. “The $1.5 million number referenced by federal leaders today is based on an incorrect preliminary finding, and has been refuted with supporting data by our Department experts.”\n \n\n   \n  He added: “It is disappointing that the administration is announcing this number as final when it is clearly overstated and the conversations are very much in the education and discussion phase.”\n \n\n   \n  In August, CMS began sending states the names of people enrolled in Medicaid that the agency suspected might not be eligible, demanding state Medicaid agencies check their immigration status.\n \n\n   \n  KFF Health News in October reached out to Medicaid agencies in 10 states. Five provided the approximate number of names they had received from the Trump administration, with expectations of more to come: Colorado had been given about 45,000 names, Ohio 61,000, Pennsylvania 34,000, Texas 28,000, and Utah 8,000. More than 70 million people are enrolled in Medicaid.\n \n\n   \n  Most of those states declined to comment further. Medicaid agencies in California, Florida, Georgia, New York, and South Carolina refused to say how many names they were ordered to review or did not respond.\n \n\n   \n  Oz said in his X post that California had misspent $1.3 billion on care for people not eligible for Medicaid, while Illinois spent $30 million, Oregon $5.4 million, Washington state $2.4 million, Washington, D.C., $2.1 million, and Colorado $1.5 million.\n \n\n   \n  “We notified the states, and many have begun refunding the money,” he said. “But what if we had never asked?”\n \n\n   \n  Washington, D.C.’s Medicaid director, Melisa Byrd, said CMS had identified administrative expenses for the district program that covers people regardless of immigration status that should not have been billed to the federal government and her agency has already fixed some of those areas. “We run a big program that is very complex and when mistakes or errors happen, we fix them,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The program plans to pay $654,014 back to CMS by mid-November.\n \n\n   \n  All five states, plus Washington, D.C., are led by Democrats, and President Donald Trump didn’t win any of them in the 2024 election.\n \n\n   \n  In recent days, Deputy Health and Human Services Secretary Jim O’Neill  began posting pictures  on X of people he said are convicted criminals living in the U.S. without authorization who had received Medicaid benefits.\n \n\n   \n  O’Neill could not be reached for comment.\n \n\n   \n  “We are very concerned because this seems, frankly, to be a waste of state resources and furthers the administration’s anti-immigrant agenda,” said Ben D’Avanzo, senior health advocacy strategist with the National Immigration Law Center, an advocacy group. “This duplicates what states already do,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  As part of the administration’s crackdown on people in the U.S. without authorization, President Donald Trump in February directed federal agencies to take action to ensure they are not obtaining benefits in violation of federal law.\n \n\n   \n  In June, advisers to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ordered CMS to share information about Medicaid enrollees with the Department of Homeland Security, drawing a lawsuit by some states alarmed that the administration would use the information for its deportation campaign against unauthorized residents.\n \n\n   \n  In August, a federal judge ordered HHS to  stop sharing the information  with immigration authorities.\n \n\n   \n  State Medicaid agencies use databases maintained by the Social Security Administration and Department of Homeland Security to verify enrollees’ immigration status.\n \n\n   \n  If states need to go back to individuals to reverify their citizenship or immigration status, it could lead some to fall off the rolls unnecessarily — for example, if they don’t see a letter requesting paperwork or fail to meet a deadline to respond.\n \n\n   \n  “I am not sure that evidence suggests there really is a need for this” extra verification, said Marian Jarlenski, a health policy professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Public Health.\n \n\n   \n  Oz made clear that the Trump administration disagrees.\n \n\n   \n  “Whether willful or not, the states’ conduct highlights a terrifying reality: American taxpayers have been footing the bill for illegal immigrants’ Medicaid coverage, despite many Democrats and the media insisting otherwise,” Oz said in his X post.\n \n\n   \n  In an August press release, CMS said it would ask states to verify eligibility for enrollees whose immigration status could not be confirmed via federal databases. “We expect states to take quick action and will monitor progress on a monthly basis,” the agency said.\n \n\n   \n  Leonardo Cuello, a research professor at Georgetown University’s Center for Children and Families, called the CMS order to states “unprecedented” in the Medicaid program’s 60-year history.\n \n\n   \n  He said the federal government may have been unable to verify certain individuals’ immigration status because names were misspelled or outdated, such as when a beneficiary is identified by their maiden instead of married name. The names may also include people helped by Emergency Medicaid, a program that covers the cost of hospital emergency services, including labor and delivery, for people regardless of immigration status.\n \n\n   \n  “CMS is conducting pointless immigration status reviews for people whose hospital bills were paid by Emergency Medicaid,” Cuello said.\n \n\n   \n  Oz noted in his post that federal law “does permit states to use Medicaid dollars for emergency treatment, regardless of patients’ citizenship or immigration status,” and that states can “legally build Medicaid programs for illegal immigrants using their own state tax dollars, so long as no federal tax dollars are used.”\n \n\n   \n  The states Oz mentioned all  run their own  such programs.\n \n\n   \n  The verification checks create an added burden for state Medicaid agencies that are already busy preparing to implement the tax and policy law Trump signed in July. The measure, which Republicans call the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, makes many changes to Medicaid, including adding a work requirement in most states starting by 2027. The law also requires most states to more frequently check the eligibility of many adult Medicaid enrollees — at least twice a year.\n \n\n   \n  “I fear states may do unnecessary checks that create a burden for some enrollees who will lose health coverage who should not,” Cuello said. “It’s going to be a whole lot of work for CMS and states for very little pay dirt.”\n \n\n   \n  Cuello said the effort may have “greater political value than actual value.”\n \n\n   \n  Brandon Cwalina, a spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services, which runs Medicaid in the state, said the state already requires every Medicaid applicant to verify their citizenship or, where applicable, their eligible immigration status.\n \n\n   \n  However, he said, the directive issued by CMS “constitutes a new process, and DHS is carefully reviewing the list in order to take appropriate actions.”\n \n\n   \n  Oz did not name Pennsylvania, which Trump won in 2024, in his post.\n \n\n   \n  If a lawful resident does not have a Social Security number, the state confirms their legal status by checking a database from Homeland Security, as well as verifying specific immigration documents, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Other state Medicaid agencies said they also needed to regroup before reaching out to enrollees.\n \n\n   \n  “Our teams just received this notice and are working through a process by which we will perform these reviews,” Jennifer Strohecker, then Utah’s Medicaid director, told a state advisory board in August.\n \n\n   \n   Renuka Rayasam and Rae Ellen Bichell contributed reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/white-house-lincoln-bedroom-bathroom-renovation","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"16:26:00Z","title":"Trump reveals renovated Lincoln Bedroom bathroom as his White House remodel continues","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump announced the renovation of the Lincoln Bedroom bathroom in the White House, replacing an Art Deco green-tiled design with black and white polished statuary marble, claiming it is historically appropriate for Abraham Lincoln’s era.

Lincoln Bedroom bathroom as his White House remodel continues \n       \n  By Kit Maher, Samantha Waldenberg, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:26 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump announced on Thursday that he has renovated the Lincoln Bedroom bathroom, sharing before and after images on social media as he continues to put his touch on the  White House .\n \n\n   \n  “I renovated the Lincoln Bathroom in the White House. It was renovated in the 1940s in an art deco green tile style, which was totally inappropriate for the Lincoln Era,” Trump said on Truth Social. “I did it in black and white polished Statuary marble. This was very appropriate for the time of Abraham Lincoln and, in fact, could be the marble that was originally there!”\n \n\n   \n  The president posted about the renovations aboard Air Force One en route to Florida, where he will spend the weekend. The post comes as the government remains shutdown, and the Trump administration says it will not tap into emergency funds to fund SNAP food assistance benefits through the month of November.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after, Trump posted more images of the bathroom, showing gold detailing on the faucet and shower handle, as well as other fixtures. A plush white robe with presidential seal also hangs on a golden hook.\n \n\n   \n  The president discussed the changes he was making to the bathroom earlier this month during a dinner at the White House, saying in part that the old style of the bathroom “was not exactly Abe Lincoln.”\n \n\n   \n  “We have little things like at the Lincoln Bedroom. The bathroom was done by the Truman family and you know, long time ago. And it’s done in a green tile, and it’s done in a style that was not exactly Abe Lincoln,” the president said.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s actually Art Deco. And Art Deco doesn’t go with, you know, 1850 and Civil Wars…But what does do is statuary marble. So I ripped it apart and we built a bathroom. It’s absolutely gorgeous and totally in keeping with that time because the Lincoln bedroom is, uh, so incredible, for those of you that have seen it,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Trump on Friday also gave a status update on a separate construction project he’s overseeing at the Kennedy Center, which he said he “just inspected.”\n \n\n   \n  “The exterior columns, which were in serious danger of corrosion if something weren’t done, are completed, and look magnificent in White Enamel — Like a different place! Marble is being done, stages are being renovated, new seats, new chairs, and new fabrics will soon be installed, and magnificent high end carpeting throughout the building. It is happening faster than anticipated, one of my trademarks,” Trump said.\n \n\n   \n  “We are bringing this building back to life. It was dead as a doornail, but it will soon be beautiful again!” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The moves are part of Trump’s effort to put his stamp on the White House – which has seen a slew of changes since he took office – and the greater DC area.\n \n\n   \n   So far, the renovations include paving over the grass in the historic Rose Garden, demolishing the East Wing to make way for a new ballroom and adorning the Oval Office with gold.\n \n\n   \n  Trump often says the White House needed a new ballroom to host world leaders, to avoid situations where they are outside and a temporary tent has to be used when it rains. And he frequently remarked that the Rose Garden paving was necessary, because women in high heels would sink into the grass during events. It now has a touch of Mar-a-Lago with the same white and yellow umbrellas at tables on the patio.\n \n\n   \n  His  redecoration  of the Oval Office to his liking, as presidents do when they take office, has tripled the number of paintings on the walls with gold just about everywhere. Trump also installed portraits of every president framed in gold on the West Colonnade – except for former President Joe Biden who is instead represented by his autopen signature – and large floor-to-ceiling mirrors, which press can see when they are escorted into the Oval Office.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to those changes, Trump plans to build a  new arch monument  in DC in honor of the country’s 250th anniversary.\n \n\n   \n  As he pushes forward with his plans to leave his mark on the White House and the nation’s capital, Trump this week  fired the members  of the Commission of Fine Arts. The independent federal agency is charged with advising the president, Congress and the city of Washington, DC, on “matters of design and aesthetics.” The president has also installed allies on the National Capital Planning Commission, which will be tasked with approving plans for the new ballroom on White House grounds.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/us/michigan-potential-terrorist-attack-averted-fbi","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"16:03:00Z","title":"FBI Averts Potential ISIS-Inspired Terror Attack in Michigan After Online Chatroom Activity and Shooting Range Visit","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The FBI, in coordination with local law enforcement in Michigan, thwarted a potential ISIS-inspired terrorist attack planned for Halloween weekend.

It sent shockwaves across Turkey, sparking widespread calls for accountability over negligence and safety violations.\n \n\n   \n  Family members and friends of the victims staged demonstrations outside the courthouse during each hearing, holding up posters of their loved ones and demanding justice.\n \n\n   \n  According to the indictment, the fire began at 3:17 a.m. when a spark from an electric grill ignited a garbage bin and ruptured a liquefied petroleum gas hose, triggering the blaze. Staff noticed the flames seven minutes later, but within two minutes, the fire had spread beyond control. Air from an open door accelerated the flames, which quickly engulfed the wooden ceiling.\n \n\n   \n  Poor safety measures — including lack of smoke extraction, faulty alarms, inadequate staff training and missing sprinkler systems — allowed fumes to fill upper floors. Stairwells and elevator shafts acted like chimneys, and the absence of emergency lighting, signage and alternative exits prevented the safe evacuation of the hotel’s 238 guests, the indictment said.\n \n\n   \n  The hotel first opened in 1999, and has been operated by Ergul’s company since 2007.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/world/un-human-rights-chief-drug-boats-strikes-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"15:11:00Z","title":"UN Human Rights Chief Says US Strikes on Alleged Drug Boats Are 'Unacceptable'","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The UN Human Rights High Commissioner, Volker Türk, has condemned U.S. military strikes on boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean, calling them 'unacceptable' and violations of international human rights law.

chief said Friday that US  military strikes  against boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean allegedly carrying illegal drugs from South America are “unacceptable” and must stop.\n \n\n   \n  The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights,  Volker Türk , called for an investigation into the strikes, in what appeared to mark the first such condemnation of its kind from a United Nations organization.\n \n\n   \n  Ravina Shamdasani, a spokeswoman for Türk’s office, relayed his message Friday at a regular UN briefing: “These attacks and their mounting human cost are unacceptable. The US must halt such attacks and take all measures necessary to prevent the extrajudicial killing of people aboard these boats.”\n \n\n   \n  She said Türk believed “airstrikes by the United States of America on boats in the Caribbean and in the Pacific violate international human rights law.”\n \n\n   \n  US President  Donald Trump  has justified the attacks on the boats as a necessary escalation to stem the flow of drugs into the United States, but the campaign against drug cartels has been divisive among countries in the region.\n \n\n   \n  The strikes and the US military’s growing presence near Venezuela have stoked fears that the Trump administration could  try to topple Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro , who faces charges of narcoterrorism in the United States.\n \n\n   \n  Asked Friday if he’s considering land strikes in Venezuela,  Trump said, “No.”  He did not elaborate as he spoke to reporters aboard Air Force One as he heads to Florida for the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking earlier this week from the USS George Washington aircraft carrier in Japan, Trump noted the US attacks at sea and reiterated that “now we’ll stop the drugs coming in by land.”\n \n\n   \n  US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Wednesday announced the latest US military strike in the campaign, against a boat he said was carrying drugs in the eastern Pacific Ocean. All four people aboard were killed. It was the 14th strike since the campaign began in early September, while the death toll has grown to at least 61.\n \n\n   \n  Shamdasani noted the US explanations of the efforts as an anti-drug and counterterrorism campaign, but said countries have long agreed that the fight against illicit drug trafficking is a law enforcement matter governed by “careful limits” placed on the use of lethal force.\n \n\n   \n  Intentional use of lethal force is allowed only as a last resort against someone representing “an imminent threat to life,” she said. “Otherwise, it would amount to a violation of the right of life and constitute extrajudicial killings.”\n \n\n   \n  The strikes are taking place “outside the context” of armed conflict or active hostilities, Shamdasani said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/ohio-republicans-redistricting-map","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"15:52:00-04:00","title":"Ohio Panel and Virginia Lawmakers Move Forward with Congressional Redistricting Plans","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Republican-dominated Ohio redistricting commission adopted new congressional district lines that could help the GOP gain two additional seats in the 2026 election, potentially strengthening President Donald Trump’s congressional majority.

October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  A Republican-dominated Ohio panel adopted new US House districts on Friday that could boost the GOP’s chances of winning two additional seats in next year’s elections and aid President Donald Trump’s efforts to hold on to a slim congressional majority.\n \n\n   \n  The action by the Ohio Redistricting Commission came as  Virginia’s  Democratic-led General Assembly advanced a proposed constitutional amendment that could pave the way for redistricting in the state ahead of congressional midterm elections next year. The Senate on Friday passed a resolution that would allow lawmakers to temporarily bypass a bipartisan redistricting commission and gerrymander their maps. The House had advanced it Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has been urging Republican-led states to reshape their US House districts in an attempt to win more seats. But unlike in other states, Ohio’s redistricting was required by the state constitution because the current districts were adopted after the 2020 census without bipartisan support.\n \n\n   \n  Ohio joins Texas, Missouri and North Carolina, where Republican lawmakers already have revised their congressional districts.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats have been pushing back. California voters are deciding Tuesday on a redistricting plan passed by the Democratic-led legislature.\n \n\n   \n  The political parties are in an intense battle. Democrats need to gain just three seats in next year’s election to win control of the House and gain the power to impede Trump’s agenda.\n \n\n   \n  In Ohio, Republicans already hold 10 of 15 congressional seats. The new map could boost Republican chances in already competitive districts currently held by Democratic Reps. Greg Landsman in Cincinnati and Marcy Kaptur near Toledo. Kaptur won a 22nd term last year by about 2,400 votes, or less than 1 percentage point, in a district carried by Trump. Landsman was reelected with more than 54% of the vote.\n \n\n   \n    Ohio residents criticize new map\n \n\n   \n  Ohio’s commission had faced a Friday deadline to adopt a new map, or else the task would have fallen to the GOP-led legislature, which could have crafted districts even more favorable to Republicans. But any redistricting bill passed by the legislature could have been subject to an initiative petition campaign from opponents seeking to force a public referendum on the new map.\n \n\n   \n  The uncertainty of that legislative process provided commissioners of both parties with some incentive for compromise. All seven commissioners — five Republicans and two Democrats — voted for the new map.\n \n\n   \n  But Ohio residents who testified to commissioners Friday denounced the new districts. Julia Cattaneo, who wore a shirt saying “gerrymandering is cheating,” said the new map is gerrymandered more for Republicans than the one it is replacing and is not the sort of compromise needed.\n \n\n   \n  “Yes, you are compromising — your integrity, honor, duty and to represent Ohioans,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Added resident Scott Sibley: “This map is an affront to democracy, and you should all — every one of you — be ashamed.”\n \n\n   \n  Republican state Auditor Keith Farber, a member of the commission, defended the map during a testy exchange with one opponent. Because many Democrats live in cities and many Republicans in rural areas, he said there was no way to draw a map creating eight Republican and seven Democratic districts — as some had urged — without splitting cities, counties and townships.\n \n\n   \n    Virginia Democrats point at Trump to defend redistricting\n \n\n   \n  Virginia is represented in the US House by six Democrats and five Republicans. Democratic lawmakers haven’t unveiled their planned new map, nor how many seats they are trying to gain, but said their moves are necessary to respond to the Trump-inspired gerrymandering in Republican-led states.\n \n\n   \n  “Our voters are asking to have that voice. They’re asking that we protect democracy, that we not allow gerrymandering to happen throughout the country, and we sit back,” said Democratic Sen. Barbara Favola.\n \n\n   \n  The proposed constitutional amendment would let lawmakers temporarily bypass a bipartisan commission and redraw congressional districts to their advantage. The measure would still need to pass the General Assembly again next year, then go before voters in a statewide referendum.\n \n\n   \n  The developments come as Virginia holds statewide elections Tuesday, where all 100 seats in the House of Delegates are on the ballot. Democrats would need to keep their slim majority in the lower chamber to advance the constitutional amendment next year.\n \n\n   \n  Republican Sen. Mark Obenshain said Democrats were ignoring the will of voters who had overwhelmingly approved a bipartisan redistricting commission.\n \n\n   \n  “Heaven forbid that we actually link arms and work together on something,” Obenshain said. “What the voters of Virginia said is, ‘We expect redistricting to be an issue that we work across the aisle on, that we link arms on.’”\n \n\n   \n  But Democratic Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, who has long championed the state’s bipartisan redistricting commission, noted the panel still would be in charge of redistricting after the 2030 census.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re not trying to end the practice of fair maps,” he said. “We are asking the voters if, in this one limited case, they want to ensure that a constitutional-norm-busting president can’t break the entire national election by twisting the arms of a few state legislatures.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/us/jetblue-flight-emergency-landing-florida","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"14:02:00-04:00","title":"At least 15 people sent to hospital after JetBlue flight drops altitude, forcing emergency landing in Florida, officials say","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A JetBlue flight (Flight 1230) from Cancun to Newark experienced a sudden 100-foot drop in altitude in seven seconds around 1:48 p.m. ET, prompting an emergency landing at Tampa International Airport.

2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A federal investigation into “a flight control issue” is underway after at least 15 people, including children, were taken to the hospital following a sudden drop in altitude on a JetBlue flight that forced an emergency landing in Tampa, officials said.\n \n\n   \n  Flight 1230 was heading Thursday from Cancun, Mexico, to Newark, New Jersey, when it “experienced a drop in altitude,” JetBlue said in a statement, causing pilots to call for medical help. The plane diverted to Tampa International Airport around 2 p.m. ET, the Federal Aviation Administration said.\n \n\n   \n  The plane dropped about 100 feet in about seven seconds around 1:48 p.m. before making a more normal descent into Tampa, data from  FlightRadar24  shows. Medical personnel were there to meet the plane on arrival, an airport spokesperson said.\n \n\n   \n  The FAA is investigating a “flight control issue” on the Airbus A320, it said, echoing a pilot’s message to air traffic controllers around the time of the brief descent. The National Transportation Safety Board is aware of the incident but has not started an investigation, the agency told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The flight disruption comes in a  volatile year  for air travel, with a major  midair collision ,  runway incursions  and  serious turbulence  already in play before the monthlong  government shutdown  raised staffing issues for  air traffic controllers  as the  holiday travel season  looms.\n \n\n   \n  Just before Thursday’s emergency, a strong cold front passed through Florida, leaving gusty winds and light rain showers.

But the GOP speaker warned that Democrats would use the move to pass extreme measures the next time they control the upper chamber.\n \n\n   \n  “They would pack the Supreme Court, they would make Puerto Rico and DC states. They would ban firearms. They would do all sorts of things that would be very harmful to the country,” Johnson said, stressing that Trump’s late-night Truth Social post on the filibuster was an “expression of the president’s anger at this situation.”\n \n\n   \n  The rare split between congressional Republicans and the White House comes as the Washington stalemate and the pains of the shutdown around the country have deepened in recent days. But the GOP leaders’ swift move to quash Trump’s suggestion on the filibuster is a reflection of a clear political reality on Capitol Hill: There is little support for such a move within the Senate GOP conference.\n \n\n   \n  The filibuster rule is unique to the Senate, and it gives the minority the power to block a bill from coming up for a vote as long as at least 41 senators oppose it. Since one party rarely wins more than 60 seats, proponents have argued that the filibuster encourages compromise and makes it more difficult to enact massive partisan reforms.\n \n\n   \n  Taking the so-called nuclear option would require near-unanimity, since Thune and Senate GOP leaders could only lose three votes from their own party to do so if all Democrats oppose the move. And the number of GOP senators currently opposed stands far higher than that, with at least a dozen Republicans on the record against it.\n \n\n   \n  Still, deploying the “nuclear option” would not entirely end the Senate’s filibuster. Instead, it would eliminate the 60-vote threshold to end debate, instead requiring 51 votes.\n \n\n   \n  One of those lawmakers, freshman Sen. John Curtis of Utah, made clear Friday morning that he remained opposed despite Trump’s urging.\n \n\n   \n  “The filibuster forces us to find common ground in the Senate. Power changes hands, but principles shouldn’t. I’m a firm no on eliminating it,” Curtis wrote on X.\n \n\n   \n  ﻿Several GOP senators have echoed that sentiment in a sign that Trump could face a steep battle with his own party to push through any rules change.\n \n\n   \n  GOP Sen. Roger Marshall called the idea a “non-starter” earlier this month, saying that “a republic protects the rights of the minority. Otherwise you just take a poll and you switch the direction the ship is going. So that filibuster helps protect the minority, and I think it’s served our country well.”\n \n\n   \n  Also earlier in the month, Thune himself ruled out changing the Senate rules to end the shutdown, calling the filibuster “something that’s been a bulwark against a lot of really bad things happening with the country.” At the time, Thune said he’d gotten no pressure from the White House to end it.\n \n\n   \n  His team’s Friday statement reaffirming the leader’s opposition had some Senate Republicans breathing a sigh of relief, according to one GOP senate staffer.\n \n\n   \n  “Definitely gives us cover,” the GOP aide told CNN. “No one in the conference seriously wants to nuke the filibuster except maybe two.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/pentagon-tomahawks-trump-ukraine","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"13:00:00-20:00","title":"Pentagon Clears Tomahawk Missile Supply to Ukraine, Decision Remains With Trump","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Pentagon has cleared the White House to provide Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk missiles, confirming no negative impact on U.S. stockpiles, but the final decision to supply them remains with President Donald Trump.

giving Ukraine long-range Tomahawk missiles, leaving final decision to Trump \n       \n  By Natasha Bertrand, Zachary Cohen, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:00 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Pentagon has given the White House the green light to provide Ukraine with  long-range Tomahawk missiles  after assessing that it would not negatively impact US stockpiles, leaving the final political decision in President  Donald Trump’s  hands, according to three US and European officials familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said earlier this month during a working lunch with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House that he would rather not provide the missiles to Ukraine because “we don’t want to be giving away things that we need to protect our country.”\n \n\n   \n  The Joint Staff informed the White House of its assessment earlier this month, just before Trump met with Zelensky   who has been pushing for the missiles to more effectively target oil and energy facilities deep inside Russia. Tomahawks have a range of around 1,000 miles.\n \n\n   \n  The assessment buoyed the US’ European allies, who believ e  that the US now ha s  fewer excuses not to provide the missiles, two European officials said. Trump also said just days before meeting Zelensky that the US has “a lot of Tomahawks” that it could potentially give to Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  US and European officials were surprised, therefore, when Trump dramatically changed his tune days later, saying during opening remarks at a White House working lunch with Zelensky that the US “needs” the Tomahawks.   He then told Zelensky behind closed doors that the US would not be providing them — at least not yet.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s decision came one day after he spoke by phone to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who told Trump that Tomahawks could hit major Russian cities like Moscow and St. Petersburg – would have no significant impact on the battlefield but would damage the US-Russia relationship, CNN has reported.\n \n\n   \n  The White House and Pentagon did not return requests for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has not taken the missiles off the table altogether, sources previously told CNN, and the administration has drawn up plans to provide them to Ukraine quickly should Trump give the order. Trump has also grown so frustrated in recent weeks with Putin’s unwillingness to seriously consider peace talks that he approved new US sanctions on Russian oil firms last week and scrapped — for now — a planned meeting with Putin in Budapest to discuss Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  While the Pentagon doesn’t have concerns about stockpiles, US defense officials are still grappling with how Ukraine would train on and deploy the missiles, officials said. There are still several operational issues that would need to be resolved for Ukraine to be able to use the missiles effectively, the sources added.\n \n\n   \n  One outstanding question is how Ukraine would fire the missiles if the US provided them. Tomahawks are most commonly launched from surface ships or submarines, but Ukraine’s Navy is severely depleted ,  so the missiles would likely need to be launched on land. The Marine Corps and Army have developed ground-based launchers that could be provided to Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  But even if the US did not want to provide the launchers, European officials believe Ukraine could figure out a workaround. One official pointed out that Ukrainian engineers were able to develop a workaround to use the UK-provided Storm Shadow missiles, which were originally designed to be used by modern NATO aircraft and had to be integrated into Ukraine’s aging, Soviet-era fighter jet fleet.\n \n\n   \n  In a post on X earlier this week, Zelenksy said Ukraine hopes to expand its long-range capabilities by the end of this year so the war can end “on fair terms” for the country.\n \n\n   \n  “Global sanctions and our pinpoint precision are practically syncing up to end this war on terms fair for Ukraine,” he wrote. “All deep-strike goals must be fully locked in by year’s end, including expansion of our long-range footprint.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/media/gayle-king-cbs-news-bari-weiss-ellison","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"13:54:00-04:00","title":"CBS News roiled by rumors, with Gayle King’s future the latest flashpoint","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"CBS News is in turmoil due to widespread rumors and speculative reporting about potential leadership changes, particularly involving long-time host Gayle King and newly appointed editor-in-chief Bari Weiss.

October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  CBS News is in an unenviable position right now: It’s the subject of anonymously sourced reporting and rumor-mongering that’s sowing confusion while division-wide layoffs cause pain and corporate changes add to anxiety.\n \n\n   \n  Many of the reported changes at CBS have not happened yet and may never happen. But each story adds to the uncertainty and unease in the air. The latest one is about Gayle King, with Variety  reporting  that she is “expected to depart” her longtime TV home, “CBS Mornings,” next year.\n \n\n   \n  If that’s the case, it would be news to King, whose contract doesn’t expire for another six months. She  told TMZ on Friday  morning: “All I’ve been told by everybody in this building is that they want me here, they like the job I’ve been doing… What I’m hearing in the building is not what I’m reading in the press.”\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the CBS News management team is in whack-a-mole mode, trying to tamp down the speculation — and probably trying to avoid any potential blowback from viewers.\n \n\n   \n  All the instability stems from David Ellison’s recent takeover of Paramount and  his decision to appoint  Bari Weiss as the editor-in-chief of CBS News.\n \n\n   \n  Weiss, the entrepreneurial and opinionated co-founder of The Free Press website, is an irresistible story to the media chattering classes. People both inside and outside CBS are desperate to know what she’s going to change at the storied news division.\n \n\n   \n  Weiss, who has been on the job for just a few weeks, has been frustrated about the leaks relating to her arrival, according to a recent  New York Times report .\n \n\n   \n  She certainly deserves time and space to get to know CBS News and think through potential changes. But just this week, there have been stories about who Weiss may or may not want to keep at “60 Minutes;” who she may or may not want to hire for the “CBS Evening News;” and now, what might happen to the morning show.\n \n\n   \n  “You know the old adage: Nobody knows anything,” a CBS source remarked, pointing out that all the speculation is destabilizing in the meantime.\n \n\n   \n  The news division also  laid off about one hundred people  earlier this week, though the cuts were foreshadowed months ago, well before Weiss was hired.\n \n\n   \n    The morning show intrigue\n \n\n   \n  The CBS weekday morning show has undergone multiple permutations over the past decade, and King has been the central player throughout, helming the show while other co-hosts have come and gone.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday night, Variety reporters Matt Donnelly and Brian Steinberg wrote that King is “expected to depart” the show and “may shift to a different role at the news division,” potentially with “a deal to produce her own programming for the network.”\n \n\n   \n  The pair also wrote that “negotiations are about to ensue,” which left some CBS staffers wondering: Is someone prematurely leaking that King is departing, and if so, why? Or is King privately telling people that she wants out, no matter what CBS offers?\n \n\n   \n  All the broadcast networks have been trying to lower salary costs in recent years, so there is little doubt that CBS would want King to accept a pay cut to stay at the network in any capacity.\n \n\n   \n  CBS responded forcefully to the Variety article, saying, “There have been no discussions with Gayle about her contract that runs through May 2026.” (And King told TMZ on Friday, “I am not going to negotiate in the media.”)\n \n\n   \n  It is highly unusual for a network to say when a star’s contract is up, but it showed that the typical window for negotiations hasn’t even opened yet.\n \n\n   \n  As Variety noted, “Moving King is a risky maneuver, especially because morning-TV is built on the relationships viewers build with the hosts.”\n \n\n   \n  That’s likely why CBS said in its statement that King is “a truly valued part of CBS and we look forward to engaging with her about the future.”\n \n\n   \n  Her co-host on the morning show, Nate Burleson, also commented personally on Instagram, reflecting how the uncertainty is weighing on staffers at the network.\n \n\n   \n  “I hope this rumor doesn’t hold up,” he wrote, calling King “a fixture, a force, and a part of the fabric of ‘CBS Mornings.’”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/uk/andrew-mountbatten-windsor-what-next-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"12:26:00.000-04:00","title":"Prince Andrew no longer: What next for Andrew Mountbatten Windsor?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Prince Andrew, formerly Duke of York, has been formally stripped of all royal titles and honors by King Charles III, following a sustained scandal tied to his alleged connections with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and accusations of sexual misconduct with Virginia Giuffre.

By the next morning, Andrew’s name had already been removed from the official role of the peerage – a crucial step in the formal scrapping of his titles.\n \n\n   \n  While the royal family hopes this move can draw a line under this years-long scandal,  questions  are swirling about where Andrew, 65, will live, whether he could yet face more legal troubles and whether his banishment will appease the British public. Here, we answer some of those.\n \n\n   \n    Where will Andrew sleep tonight?\n \n\n   \n  Most likely in  Royal Lodge , the grand 30-room mansion in Windsor Great Park, west of London, which has been Andrew’s home since 2003. The late Queen Elizabeth II granted Andrew, the third of her four children, the right to live in the lodge, and his 75-year lease was due to expire in 2078.\n \n\n   \n  But in its Thursday night statement, Buckingham Palace said Andrew had been served formal notice to surrender his lease and that he would “move to alternative private accommodation.” It is understood that he will move as soon as is practicable.\n \n\n   \n    Where will he live in the future?\n \n\n   \n  Royal sources have told CNN that Andrew will be given a house on the King’s private estate in Sandringham, Norfolk. That vast estate on England’s eastern coast is home to some 150 properties.\n \n\n   \n  It is also where the royal family spends Christmas. Before the Thursday night announcement, Andrew had already been told he would not be welcome at the country retreat over the holidays, a royal source had said.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew might not move to Sandringham until after the Christmas holidays, another source said, because giving notice, surrendering the lease and orchestrating the move is expected to take some time.\n \n\n   \n    Will he receive an income?\n \n\n   \n  Yes, but we don’t know how much. After he stepped back from public duties following his disastrous 2019 interview with BBC Newsnight, Andrew was thought to receive an annual allowance of about £1 million ($1.3 million) from the late Queen, according to British media reports.\n \n\n   \n  Those payments initially continued under Charles, the reports said, but it is understood that the King had stopped providing the allowance.\n \n\n   \n  Despite now being stripped of his prince title, CNN understands that Andrew will still receive an income from Charles.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew’s finances have always been something of a mystery. His only source of income that has been declared is the pension he receives from his time in the navy between 1979 and 2001, said to amount to £20,000 ($26,000) a year.\n \n\n   \n    Is he still in the line of succession?\n \n\n   \n  Andrew may have lost his titles, status and honors but he is still eighth in line to the British throne.\n \n\n   \n  There is a process to formally remove him from the line of succession by legislation, but it would take time as it requires the consent of Commonwealth nations around the world.\n \n\n   \n  The last time this protocol was invoked was in 1936 with the abdication of Edward VIII.\n \n\n   \n    What will happen to his family?\n \n\n   \n  Andrew and Sarah Ferguson divorced in 1996 but have lived together at Royal Lodge in Windsor since 2008. His ex-wife reverted to her maiden name earlier this month when Andrew relinquished the use of his royal titles, including Duke of York. She is also moving out of Royal Lodge and make her own living arrangements. It is understood that she will not be joining Andrew when he moves to Sandringham.\n \n\n   \n  Their daughters, Princess Beatrice, 37, and Princess Eugenie, 35, are non-working royals and will retain their titles as daughters of the son of a sovereign, in line with a directive issued by King George V in 1917.\n \n\n   \n  Beatrice lives with her husband in the Cotswolds, about 100 miles from London, but has an apartment at St. James’s Palace in the capital. Eugenie and her husband have a cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace but spend a lot of time abroad. Their living situations will not be affected by their father’s exile.\n \n\n   \n    Could he be hauled in front of parliament?\n \n\n   \n  The Liberal Democrats, an opposition party, have lately called for Andrew to give evidence to a parliamentary committee about his finances and potential rent paid to live in Royal Lodge.\n \n\n   \n  So far, the government of Prime Minister Keir Starmer has refused to give members of parliament time to debate Andrew’s finances, despite public outcry for proper scrutiny.\n \n\n   \n  This week, Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, a Conservative lawmaker and chair of the Public Accounts Committee, wrote to the Crown Estate Commissioners seeking more information on Andrew’s lease arrangements for Royal Lodge.\n \n\n   \n  That committee is responsible for “upholding best value for taxpayers’ money,” Clifton-Brown wrote, and as such “we feel it is reasonable to seek further information on the status of, and rationale for, the lease of Royal Lodge.”\n \n\n   \n    Might he face further legal challenges?\n \n\n   \n  Potentially. Republic, an activist group seeking to abolish the monarchy, says it is pursuing a private prosecution of Andrew “because if the government and police won’t hold him to account, we will.”\n \n\n   \n  The group says it has instructed lawyers to investigate and, if appropriate, begin a private prosecution over allegations of sexual offenses and misconduct in public office.\n \n\n   \n   Virginia Giuffre , a prominent accuser of Epstein and his circle, alleged that Andrew had sex with her three times when she was a teenager. In her recent memoir, published posthumously, Giuffre wrote that Andrew “believed that having sex with me was his birthright.”\n \n\n   \n  Despite claiming never to have met her, Andrew reportedly paid millions of dollars to Giuffre in 2022 to settle a civil case she brought against him. He has repeatedly denied all allegations against him.\n \n\n   \n  Giuffre died by suicide in April. On Thursday, Sky and Amanda Roberts, Giuffre’s brother and sister-in-law, told CNN that Giuffre would have been “joyous” to know that Andrew had been stripped of the title that helped shield him from accountability.\n \n\n   \n  “I think she would be proud, and I think she would turn to her children and say, ‘I did it. I got the bad guy,’” said Amanda Roberts.\n \n\n   \n    Will this be enough for the British public?\n \n\n   \n  It’s hard to say. Andrew is deeply unpopular with the British public. In a poll published Thursday by YouGov, 91% of Britons had a negative opinion of Andrew. Just 4% had a positive one. By contrast, Britons generally like Prince William (76%) and Charles (62%), and overall have a positive view of the monarchy as an institution (56%).\n \n\n   \n  If Andrew’s fall from grace began in earnest after his 2019 BBC Newsnight interview, the royal family have repeatedly tried to draw a line under the scandal – first by Andrew’s withdrawing from public life, then by removing his military titles and patronages, later cutting him off financially, then by his relinquishing some of his titles – and now by the King casting him out of the palace for good as a pariah.\n \n\n   \n  None of the measures have quelled the public outcry. It remains to be seen whether this time will be different.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps the Andrew scandal has roiled on for so long because, for the public, his “punishments” do not seem proportionate to the allegations that he faces. While the loss of his titles and favored residence may be a personal tragedy for Andrew, it elicits little sympathy from a public demanding proper accountability.\n \n\n   \n  “It doesn’t matter if he’s Prince Andrew or Andrew Mountbatten Windsor – we’re still pursuing a private prosecution of him,” said Republic, the activist group.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/uk/prince-andrew-scandal-analysis-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"12:30:00-14:00","title":"King Charles Banishes Brother from Monarchy, Strips Him of Royal Titles","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"King Charles III has dramatically stripped his brother Prince Andrew of his royal titles and honors, including the Duke of York title, making him a commoner.

finally banished his brother. Is it too little too late? \n       \n  Analysis by Lauren Said-Moorhouse, Max Foster, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:30 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  King Charles’  decision  to cast out his brother Andrew from the monarchy as well as the  30-room mansion  where he’s lived for more than 20 years was as sudden as it was dramatic.\n \n\n   \n  It is the ultimate humiliation for the 65-year-old now-former prince,  known to enjoy the trappings and privilege of royal life. He will move out of Royal Lodge, his sprawling mansion in the heart of the Windsor estate just outside of London, and be exiled to the countryside to live in obscurity.\n \n\n   \n  The monarchy had been under intense pressure to resolve the Andrew issue amid renewed public fury over his ties to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, which was further inflamed by the release of his sexual abuse accuser  Virginia Giuffre’s posthumous memoir.  Andrew has repeatedly denied the allegations against him.\n \n\n   \n  Two weeks ago, Andrew  gave up the use  of his titles and honors, more than five years after  stepping back as a frontline royal . He said he was putting “duty to my family and country first,” but it did little to stop the snowballing scandal.\n \n\n   \n  Then on Thursday evening, a brusque bombshell announcement from Buckingham Palace: Andrew is to lose his princely status, and effective immediately he is plain old Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, a commoner.\n \n\n   \n  The palace statement was clear – the decision was the king’s and Andrew had no choice in the matter (although he is understood not to have objected to his brother’s actions). Notable in the statement too, an expression of solidarity with victims of abuse.\n \n\n   \n  The significance of Charles’ moves on Thursday cannot be overstated. ﻿Not since the abdication crisis of 1936 has there been such a public casting aside of a senior British royal.\n \n\n   \n  The decision would doubtless have been difficult – and, given the personal family dynamics at play, deeply personal. But the monarch had no choice – Andrew’s controversies have been dogging the family for years and the publication of his accuser’s posthumous memoir was the final straw. The negotiations to get to this stage will have been challenging but the monarch had no option but to engage damage control mode.\n \n\n   \n  It was not just the public that had expressed outrage and frustration; there had also been increasing calls for Andrew to appear before a parliamentary committee. Perhaps this move will head off that particular indignity.\n \n\n   \n  Royal historian Kate Williams said the King’s decision was “unprecedented.”\n \n\n   \n  “This is a huge move from the royal family. Just recently, the King announced that Andrew was stepping back from the title Duke of York just a few days before Ms. Giuffre’s memoir was published. But that simply wasn’t enough for public opinion,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “We have had people in the past losing the title of prince or princess. Henry VIII (reigned 1509-1547) said his daughters were no longer legitimate after he annulled the marriages with their mothers, Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn – but he changed his mind later.”\n \n\n   \n  She also pointed out Prince Charles Edward – one of Queen Victoria’s grandsons – whose title of the Duke of Albany was removed by parliament in 1917 after he fought for Germany in World War I. But Andrew’s situation, Williams said, was different as he was censured because of his serious errors of judgment.\n \n\n   \n  The King’s moves were welcomed by many British politicians. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said that “the King has clearly felt that this is the right decision for the royal family” but added that it “must have been a very difficult thing” to act against his own sibling.\n \n\n   \n  The leader of the centrist Liberal Democrats said Andrew’s situation “had become totally untenable, having disgraced his office and embarrassed the country.”\n \n\n   \n  He added: “This is an important step towards rebuilding trust in our institutions and drawing a line under this whole sorry saga.”\n \n\n   \n  For several weeks, it has felt like some sort of announcement was coming down the pike and was simply a case of when, rather than if.\n \n\n   \n  Royal sources told CNN that the King was trying to act swiftly following recent developments but had needed some time to consult legal and constitutional experts.\n \n\n   \n  It is also understood that the King took action in light of his sibling’s serious lapses of judgment and has the support of the wider family, including Prince William.\n \n\n   \n  The statement, when it came, was uncompromising. “These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him,” it said.\n \n\n   \n  For many people in the country, and certainly critics of the royal family, these moves might not be enough to rehabilitate the monarchy’s tarnished reputation. For some, the removal of Andrew’s status as prince only goes so far. Other critics say the family has shielded Andrew over the years, and pressure for some sort of accountability needs to continue.\n \n\n   \n  “Losing silly titles is not an answer to very serious accusations of sexual offenses and corruption in public office,” Graham Smith, chief executive of the anti-monarchy campaign group Republic, said following the palace’s announcement.\n \n\n   \n  “This isn’t about William and Charles taking a tough line. It’s about William and Charles protecting their position by putting as much distance between them and Andrew as they can,” Smith added. “We need to see Andrew face justice, because we need to know that the royals are not above the law.”\n \n\n   \n  Despite being stripped of his prince title, Andrew remains eighth in line to the throne.

The move will happen as soon as possible and practical, but the process of giving notice, surrendering the lease and other practicalities of the relocation can be a drawn-out process.\n \n\n   \n  Moving in the new year might also avoid potential awkwardness over the holidays as Sandringham is traditionally where the royal family gathers for the festive season.

as he ascends the sport \n       \n  By George Ramsay, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:34 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Ever since he first picked up a  tennis  racket,  João Fonseca  has shown a penchant for power – even if it came with mixed results.\n \n\n   \n  “I was the kind of kid that destroyed the ball,” says Fonseca. “Sometimes, it would go into the fence; sometimes, it would go straight to the floor; and then, sometimes, we’re doing a winner.”\n \n\n   \n  That approach – fearless, furious and unrestrained – has stayed with the Brazilian into his professional career, and today, his ripping forehand is one of the most breathtaking sights in men’s tennis.\n \n\n   \n  Few players can match the 19-year-old Fonseca when it comes to  raw power , particularly on the forehand wing. This not-so-subtle, not-so-secret weapon has guided him to two ATP Tour titles this year, including in the Swiss city of Basel last week.\n \n\n   \n  There, Fonseca thumped 29 winners to see off Spain’s Alejandro Davidovich Fokina in the final, while his average forehand speed was clocked at 81 miles per hour. For comparison, top players  usually average  around 75.\n \n\n   \n  “I think my coach was really the first one that said: ‘Keep with this aggression,’” Fonseca tells  CNN Sports  about his all-out approach. “‘Keep doing this, but at the same time, let’s work with being more solid.’\n \n\n   \n  “During these last years, I understood that you can’t hit the ball hard every time … Sometimes, it’s a stupid idea, of course, but sometimes, it’s good to be aggressive, to be courageous and have confidence in your shots.”\n \n\n   \n  Lifting the title in Basel saw Fonseca become the third-youngest ATP 500 winner since the format was introduced in 2009, as well as the tournament’s youngest winner since Jim Courier in 1989.\n \n\n   \n  Still a teenager, Fonseca’s potential is huge, his freakish power likely to become more of a threat as he develops and refines his game. To some, he is destined to join  Carlos Alcaraz  and  Jannik Sinner  – by far and away the standout players in men’s tennis this year – at the very top of the game.\n \n\n   \n  “The Brazilian Blaster (Fonseca) is a generational talent as I said 2 years ago and will be right there someday with the Italian Flamethrower (Sinner) and Spanish Magician (Alcaraz),” Rick Macci, the former coach to Serena Williams,  wrote  on X recently.\n \n\n   \n  Those players, Macci added, will “create a new big three” to replace Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic.\n \n\n   \n  Davidovich Fokina spoke along the same lines during his runner-up speech in Basel, telling Fonseca that he is “for sure going to be the next Nole (Djokovic) to beat Carlos and Jannik.”\n \n\n   \n  After winning last year’s Next Gen ATP Finals title – a tournament featuring the world’s best players under 20 – Fonseca turned heads at the Australian Open in January with a straight-sets victory over ninth seed Andrey Rublev.\n \n\n   \n  He followed that up by winning the Argentina Open a month later, becoming the second-youngest South American to win an ATP title in the Open Era.\n \n\n   \n  But Fonseca’s progress hasn’t been exponential. He failed to progress past the third round of a grand slam this year, perhaps a surprise after the enormous promise he showed at the start of the season.\n \n\n   \n  The victory in Basel, however, reaffirmed his status as one of the most explosive talents in the game, with Fonseca climbing 18 spots up the rankings to No. 28. That puts him well on track to fulfill his self-ascribed objectives for next year.\n \n\n   \n  “I think one of my goals is to be a seed, top 32 (at a grand slam),” says Fonseca. “It’s my personal goal. I’m working a lot to do it … let’s see how it goes.”\n \n\n   \n  To get to this level, Fonseca had to spend his formative years building a bond with tennis. As a young player, the game would make him feel restless, and he often found himself chasing big, haymaking shots on the court. He was even more impatient off it, unable to watch a full match without losing interest.\n \n\n   \n  That changed around 2019, when Fonseca sat absorbed as Novak Djokovic defeated Roger Federer in a  Wimbledon  final lasting four hours and 57 minutes – the longest final in the tournament’s history.\n \n\n   \n  A self-proclaimed Federer superfan, that match hurt Fonseca. As he started to enjoy tennis as a spectator, he would often watch the “Big 3” play out match after memorable match on the sport’s biggest stages, but it was the Swiss star who captivated him the most.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s my idol,” Fonseca confesses. Which goes some way to explaining why he suddenly found himself a sweaty, nervous wreck before meeting Federer for the first time in September.\n \n\n   \n  “We had a nice chat, about 10 minutes, and we talked a little bit about life, tour, how it is to live in Brazil and be far from home,” says Fonseca, adding: “He’s a super nice guy. You see these amazing players, these legends, as untouchable (and think): this guy is different. But no, he’s just a human being like us, super cool.\n \n\n   \n  “It was a very important moment; it’s going to be in my mind for my whole life.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s likely that the two might cross paths again, particularly given that Fonseca is sponsored by On – the sportswear company in which Federer has invested and helped with product development. The Brazilian was only 16 when he was signed by On and earmarked as a star in the making, joining a roster that includes six-time grand slam winner  Iga Świątek  and world No. 7  Ben Shelton .\n \n\n   \n  Several years earlier, Fonseca had made the decision to focus his sporting endeavors solely on tennis, not long after a  soccer  injury had left him sidelined for months.\n \n\n   \n  Like most kids growing up in Rio de Janeiro, soccer was, and still is, one of his great loves, even though his playing days have long since passed.\n \n\n   \n  “I was a good level,” says Fonseca. “I’m a lefty leg, I had some skills, but nothing serious. I wouldn’t be professional or whatever. Fortunately, I stayed with tennis.”\n \n\n   \n  After reaching the quarterfinals of last year’s Rio Open aged 17, Fonseca decided to forego his college eligibility – he was holding a place at the University of Virginia – and turn professional.\n \n\n   \n  Since then, his march up the world rankings has been steady, quickly earning him an army of dedicated fans. Fonseca’s matches are some of the loudest on tour, and regardless of whether he’s playing in Brazil or further afield, yellow-and-green-clad spectators are guaranteed whenever he’s on a tennis court.\n \n\n   \n  It’s taken time, Fonseca admits, to grow accustomed to playing in front of such raucous crowds.\n \n\n   \n  “At the beginning, I was super nervous,” he says. “I needed to win, and there are people watching me, there are people cheering for me. The culture of Brazil is super loud, a lot of people supporting, I’ll say a little bit because of football.\n \n\n   \n  “I got used a lot to the crowd. Nowadays, I love playing with the crowd. I love them supporting me. I love that sometimes I’m in a bad situation in the match and they’re still supporting me, still cheering and motivating me.\n \n\n   \n  “I was more like a shy guy,” he adds, “and now I’m loving it.”\n \n\n   \n  Playing in loud matches at big tournaments is likely to be a mainstay of Fonseca’s career. He is slowly accumulating more experience against the world’s best players but hasn’t yet faced Djokovic – he’s hopeful of doing so before the Serb, now 38, retires – nor has he played either Alcaraz or Sinner.\n \n\n   \n  Those kinds of matches might become a regular occurrence should Fonseca, armed with that ferocious forehand, continue his march up the rankings. For now, he is watching closely as two players just a few years his senior rule over men’s tennis, sharing the past eight grand slams equally between them.\n \n\n   \n  One day, Fonseca might be in a position to challenge their duopoly.\n \n\n   \n  “What they’re doing is amazing,” he says of Alcaraz and Sinner. “They’re winning every tournament that they play.\n \n\n   \n  “They motivate all the other players to put more work in day by day, and try to be with them, try to win more tournaments, try to win matches, be more consistent. Hopefully, in the future, I will be with them, playing and competing in finals. But one step at a time, and let’s put in the work.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/trump-senate-filibuster-nuclear-option-government-shutdown","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"10:53:00-04:00","title":"Trump calls for end of Senate filibuster to break funding stalemate","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has called on Republican lawmakers to eliminate the Senate filibuster as a means to immediately end a weeklong government shutdown, framing it as an urgent 'TRUMP CARD' move.

calls for end of Senate filibuster to break funding stalemate \n       \n  By Adam Cancryn, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:53 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President  Donald Trump  on Thursday urged congressional Republicans to unilaterally end  the government shutdown  by eliminating the Senate filibuster — urging them to take an unprecedented step that GOP leaders have firmly opposed until now.\n \n\n   \n  “It is now time for the Republicans to play their ‘TRUMP CARD,’ and go for what is called the Nuclear Option — Get rid of the Filibuster, and get rid of it, NOW!” Trump wrote in a  Truth Social post .\n \n\n   \n  The directive — which came after Trump returned from several days abroad — is likely to upend efforts on Capitol Hill to bring an end to the weekslong funding impasse. And it immediately ratcheted up the pressure on Republican leaders, who have adamantly opposed eliminating the  60-vote threshold for passing legislation  as a way to end the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Top GOP lawmakers have long argued for keeping that threshold in place, asserting that the filibuster benefits Republicans — and will serve as a key safeguard against Democrats passing transformative legislation the next time they’re in power.\n \n\n   \n  The filibuster rule is unique to the Senate, and it gives the minority the power to block a bill from coming up for a vote as long as at least 41 senators oppose it. Since one party rarely wins more than 60 seats, proponents have argued that the filibuster encourages compromise and makes it more difficult to enact massive partisan reforms.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Majority Leader John Thune earlier this month ruled out changing the Senate rules to end the shutdown, calling the filibuster “something that’s been a bulwark against a lot of really bad things happening with the country.” At the time, Thune said he’d gotten no pressure from the White House to end the filibuster.\n \n\n   \n  Thune spokesman Ryan Wrasse said in a statement to CNN Friday, “Leader Thune’s position on the importance of the legislative filibuster is unchanged.” The statement had some in his party breathing a sigh of relief.\n \n\n   \n  “Definitely gives us cover,” a GOP aide told CNN. “No one in the conference seriously wants to nuke the filibuster except maybe two.”\n \n\n   \n  Several GOP senators have echoed Thune’s sentiment in recent days in a sign that Trump could face a steep battle with his own party to push through the rules change. Killing the filibuster would take a majority vote in the Senate, meaning Republicans could only lose three lawmakers assuming all Democrats oppose the move.\n \n\n   \n  On Friday morning, Sen. John Curtis of Utah  posted on X  that he remained a “firm no” on eliminating the filibuster, writing that “the filibuster forces us to find common ground in the Senate. Power changes hands, but principles shouldn’t.”\n \n\n   \n  But Trump on Thursday appeared to dismiss those concerns, arguing that Republicans should take advantage of their Senate majority to end the filibuster and reopen the government. The president made a similar case during his first term, though Senate Republicans never acted on it at the time.\n \n\n   \n  “Now WE are in power, and if we did what we should be doing, it would IMMEDIATELY end this ridiculous, Country destroying ‘SHUT DOWN,’” he wrote. “If the Republicans are not using the Great Strength and Policies made available to us by ending the Filibuster, the Democrats will exercise their rights, and it will be done in the first day they take office, regardless of whether or not we do it.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s new push followed a week on Capitol Hill where lawmakers on both sides signaled potential signs of progress toward ending the impasse, even as they conceded that a deal remained well out of reach despite widening fallout across the country.\n \n\n   \n  The Senate is not slated to return to Washington until Monday evening, putting lawmakers just days away from breaking the 35-day mark for the  longest-ever government shutdown .\n \n\n   \n   Critical food aid  for tens of millions of Americans is slated to end over the weekend. The White House on Thursday also sought to highlight the stress that the shutdown is putting on air traffic controllers by convening a roundtable of airline industry representatives and union leaders.\n \n\n   \n   This story  has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/donald-trump-end-shutdown-filibuster","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"12:00:00-04:00","title":"Trump just kneecapped the GOP’s shutdown strategy","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has called for Republicans to end the government shutdown by eliminating the Senate filibuster — a move that, despite being technically within their power, is widely seen as politically unhelpful and counterproductive.

2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  After the government had been shut down for nearly a month, a conspicuously quiet  President Donald Trump  finally weighed in with a prescription for how to end it.\n \n\n   \n  Republican congressional leaders are probably wishing he hadn’t.\n \n\n   \n  Trump late Thursday night urged Republicans to end the shutdown by  invoking the so-called “nuclear option”  — that is, getting rid of the filibuster and 60-vote threshold in the Senate. This would allow Republicans to pass things on party-line votes in the GOP-controlled Senate.\n \n\n   \n  “BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THE DEMOCRATS HAVE GONE STONE COLD ‘CRAZY,’ THE CHOICE IS CLEAR — INITIATE THE ‘NUCLEAR OPTION,’ GET RID OF THE FILIBUSTER AND, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  That Trump would call for this is not terribly surprising; he has spent years occasionally urging Republican leaders to scrap the filibuster. Nor is it particularly likely to provide an actual offramp in the shutdown; those same GOP leaders have steadfastly declined Trump’s entreaties before and rejected this idea repeatedly in recent weeks. It’s not even clear whether enough senators would vote for such a change if GOP leaders went along with it.\n \n\n   \n  So practically speaking, it’s a pointless interjection from the president.\n \n\n   \n  But it does matter in one way: It’s Trump yet again inserting himself into these kinds of talks in ways that are thoroughly unhelpful to his party. And this has become a trend.\n \n\n   \n  The reason it’s unhelpful in this case is that it legitimizes Democrats’ talking point that Republicans could end this shutdown any time they want to. And that could make it harder for Republicans to shake the blame they’ve been saddled with.\n \n\n   \n  It’s been pretty remarkable how much Americans have  continued to blame Republicans  more than Democrats for the shutdown, despite it being Democrats who are seeking the concession (i.e. an extension of the enhanced Obamacare subsidies). A  Washington Post-ABC News poll  released Thursday showed 45% of Americans mainly blamed Trump and the GOP, versus 33% who held Democrats responsible.\n \n\n   \n  To be clear, the idea that Republicans could end the shutdown anytime they want is a vastly oversimplified talking point. Yes, all they need is a majority of the Senate to nuke the filibuster. But there are myriad reasons to avoid invoking that nuclear option. And Republican leaders have pointed to them for weeks — specifically invoking what they fear Democrats could do without that 60-vote threshold if they regain control of the chamber.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Majority Leader John Thune earlier this month called the filibuster “a bulwark against a lot of really bad things happening to the country.” (His spokesperson on Friday said the leader’s position is “unchanged.”) Fellow Senate GOP leader John Barrasso of Wyoming argued that nixing the filibuster would ultimately allow Democrats to make Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia into states, with two senators apiece, and to pack the Supreme Court. House Speaker Mike Johnson has said it would mean there would be “no stumbling blocks or hurdles at all in the way of turning us into a communist country.”\n \n\n   \n  But Trump is now legitimizing blaming his own party for the shutdown because they won’t have done the thing he told them to do.\n \n\n   \n  And if you’re a Republican in Congress, you’ve probably got déjà vu about now. That’s because Trump does stuff like this a lot – especially during shutdown debates.\n \n\n   \n  In early 2018, Trump  contradicted his own spokeswoman’s statement  of support for a short-term continuing resolution, making a late demand to scrap an extension of the Children’s Health Insurance Program.\n \n\n   \n  Trump then pulled another  11th-hour shift a few weeks later , demanding immigration concessions that hadn’t previously been a focal point of leaders’ efforts.\n \n\n   \n  Before he was sworn in to his second term in January, Trump and Elon Musk combined in December to play the role of legislative arsonists again. GOP leaders had negotiated a bipartisan deal to avert a shutdown. But then Musk started waging war against it on X. Trump then joined him and  threw another wrench in the cogs , suddenly demanding a debt ceiling increase that hadn’t really been a part of discussions.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has regularly given congressional Republicans fits in these situations – so much so that they’ll occasionally acknowledge their frustrations publicly.\n \n\n   \n  Then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in early 2018  practically pleaded with Trump  to engage in the process and provide some direction. “As soon as we figure out what he is for, then I would be convinced that we were not just spinning our wheels,” the Kentucky Republican said at the time.\n \n\n   \n  After Trump threw a late grenade in the process in December, Sen. Kevin Cramer said he was “very frustrated.”\n \n\n   \n  When CNN’s Manu Raju asked the North Dakota Republican if he wished Trump had signaled his demands earlier, Cramer  responded dryly : “Yeah, I mean, maybe he hadn’t thought about it until just today. But yeah, that would have been very helpful.”\n \n\n   \n  None of this means Trump’s late entry into this shutdown debate is a game-changer. Perhaps GOP leaders will get through to Trump that this strategy isn’t particularly helpful – as they appear to have with other Republicans who occasionally suggested this route – and he’ll drop it.\n \n\n   \n  But his late-night social media demand has at the very least put Republicans in the uncomfortable position of explaining why they don’t attempt to do the thing that is technically in their power to end the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  And we’re already seeing Republicans try and massage this issue away.\n \n\n   \n  “What you’re seeing is an expression of the president’s anger at the situation,” Johnson said Friday.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps, but most presidents don’t lash out and kneecap their side’s negotiating power just because they get frustrated.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/weather/noaa-hurricane-hunters-shutdown-unpaid-melissa","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"10:54:00-04:00","title":"Hurricane Hunters Fly Into Storm Without Pay Amid Government Shutdown","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, one of the strongest on record with 185 mph winds and a historic landfall in Jamaica, prompted continuous operations by NOAA’s Hurricane Hunters, who flew into the storm without pay due to a federal government shutdown.

NOAA’s Hurricane Hunters flew into it without pay \n       \n  By Andrew Freedman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:54 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Tossed and battered by violent wind and severe turbulence, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Hurricane Hunters have spent the past week diving into the eye of  Melissa  —  a storm of historic ferocity  — to gather life-saving data. They have done it around the clock, 24/7, because their mission is considered essential to public safety.\n \n\n   \n  But this time, with the government shut down, they have done it all without pay.\n \n\n   \n  The Hurricane Hunters are a standard feature of US storm response. Information gathered by the planes’ specialized equipment, which includes a tail-mounted doppler radar that takes a virtual CT scan of the storm, are crucial for issuing accurate forecasts and gauging storm strength in real-time.\n \n\n   \n  The data, including the radar information, is fed straight into the computer models that forecasters use to predict a hurricane’s path and intensity.\n \n\n   \n  But as long-lived Hurricane Melissa rumbled on through the week, the people operating the flights have been under increasing financial stress.\n \n\n   \n  The crews of the agency’s decades-old WP-3D aircraft have now missed two paychecks due to the shutdown, according to a NOAA employee with knowledge of the hurricane hunter operations, who spoke with CNN on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.\n \n\n   \n  Crews are asked “To be fully mentally present, especially in this environment, and it’s hard to do that when you know you can’t potentially make ends meet,” the NOAA staff member said. “You’re dipping into savings to pay off your mortgage, you know, week to week or month to month.”\n \n\n   \n  The flights through the once Category 5 storm have been particularly hairy, with one of the NOAA aircraft having to return to its base for a safety inspection after exceeding its g-force limits from the turbulence.\n \n\n   \n  Videos during that flight show equipment falling from the ceiling of the plane, with roughly 20 crew members cursing and laughing as they are thrown against their safety harnesses.\n \n\n   \n  Following an inspection by ground crews, who are also working without pay, that same aircraft flew out later the same day on another mission into the storm, the NOAA staff member said.\n \n\n   \n  The NOAA crews have met all the requests that the National Hurricane Center has made of them ,  the employee said. The Center assigns them to specific flight routes and schedules where scientists think in-situ data would improve the forecasts as much as possible.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it’s just a notable thing that we have these crews going around the clock supporting the important mission that it is,” despite enduring increasing financial hardship, they said.\n \n\n   \n  They said the NOAA flights have been fully staffed with about 20 crew members per flight.\n \n\n   \n  The NOAA flights continued as the  storm plowed into Jamaica , doing immense damage to the island nation and killing at least 19 people.\n \n\n   \n  They have kept flying to support America’s international partners, with flights on Thursday aimed at making sure Bermuda residents get accurate warnings of the storm’s intensity and path.\n \n\n   \n  NOAA spokesperson Kim Doster acknowledged the crews’ hard work and their financial stress. “NOAA looks forward to a swift end to the crippling federal government shutdown which is forcing essential workers and service members like our brave Hurricane Hunter pilots to go unpaid as they perform their mission-critical duties that protect the lives of Americans every day,” she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The Air Force Reserve also flies into hurricanes and has flown numerous missions into Melissa, but those planes are not bristling with the same specialized equipment that the older NOAA aircraft are. They fly a more straightforward reconnaissance mission, keeping tabs of the storm’s intensity and movement, whereas the NOAA flights are aimed more at hurricane research and enabling forecasting improvements.\n \n\n   \n  Remarkably, one of the Air Force flights also had to turn around after getting beaten up by severe turbulence flying through Melissa. CNN reached out to the Air Force’s Hurricane Hunter squadron to inquire about their pay status but has not heard back.\n \n\n   \n  It’s unusual for two flights to have to turn back within the same storm and indicates the hurricane’s power during its approach to southwestern Jamaica. Melissa crossed the Jamaican coast tied for the strongest-ever landfalling Atlantic hurricane, with maximum sustained winds of 185 mph.\n \n\n   \n  Andy Hazelton, a hurricane researcher who works with NOAA’s hurricane research division at the University of Miami, told CNN earlier this week that the NOAA flight that had to turn around due to turbulence was the roughest ride in a hurricane that he has had since he began such work seven years ago.\n \n\n   \n  “You hit a big enough updraft and downdraft you have to make sure the plane is ok,” Hazelton, who is being paid during the shutdown via the university, said. “These crews are doing this all while not getting paid, so they deserve all the credit.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/europe/prince-andrew-title-and-honors-remove-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"12:27:00.000Z","title":"King Charles strips his brother Andrew of ‘prince’ title and evicts him from royal mansion","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"King Charles has taken unprecedented steps to strip Prince Andrew of his royal titles and evict him from Royal Lodge, citing serious lapses in judgment and his alleged association with Jeffrey Epstein.

mansion \n       \n  By Lauren Said-Moorhouse, Max Foster, Lauren Kent, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:27 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Britain’s King Charles took  the extraordinary step  of starting the process to strip his brother Andrew of his royal titles and evict him from the royal estate in Windsor, in the most dramatic attempt yet to quell the scandal over the disgraced prince’s links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  The move, described in stark terms by Buckingham Palace as “necessary censures,” cements the deepest split in the British royal family in decades. The question now: whether King Charles and the British establishment have done enough to prevent Andrew’s association with  Epstein  from engulfing the monarchy.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew, 65, had faced 15 years of on-and-off controversy over his friendship with Epstein that had reached a new intensity after the release of a posthumous memoir by Virginia Giuffre, who alleged that Andrew had sexually assaulted her as a teenager.\n \n\n   \n  Giuffre – who the prince claims never to have met – died by suicide in April at the age of 41. Andrew has repeatedly denied all allegations against him.\n \n\n   \n  Giuffre’s family said in a statement on Thursday: “Today, an ordinary American girl, from an ordinary American family, brought down a British prince with her truth and extraordinary courage.”\n \n\n   \n  Sky Roberts, Giuffre’s brother, told CNN that it had been a “joyous and happy and sad day.”\n \n\n   \n  In the statement, Buckingham Palace noted that Andrew would be forced out of his residence and take the family name. “Prince Andrew will now be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor. His  lease on Royal Lodge  has, to date, provided him with legal protection to continue in residence. Formal notice has now been served to surrender the lease and he will move to alternative private accommodation,” the statement continued.\n \n\n   \n  “These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him.”\n \n\n   \n  Andrew will move to a property on the Sandringham estate, about 100 miles north of London, which is privately owned by the British monarch. Royal Lodge sits within Windsor Great Park, part of the Crown Estate, which manages the royal family’s land and property holdings on behalf of the British state. Andrew’s new accommodation will be privately funded by King Charles.\n \n\n   \n  It’s understood the palace acted because while it acknowledges that Andrew continues to deny all allegations made against him, it had concluded that he made serious lapses of judgement.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew is not expected to move to Sandringham until after the Christmas holidays, according to a royal source.\n \n\n   \n  Moving in the new year might also avoid potential awkwardness over the holidays as Sandringham is traditionally where the royal family gathers for the festive season. It was previously announced that Andrew would be excluded from Christmas celebrations.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew had sought to end the renewed scrutiny of his conduct by relinquishing  use of his titles  earlier this month. But his moves did little to stem the flow of negative headlines and sparked fresh questions about how he was able to pay Giuffre a reportedly multimillion-dollar settlement in a civil case in 2022 and fund his lifestyle despite having not been a working royal since 2019.\n \n\n   \n  Public anger has also grown after it emerged last week that he paid $1 million for Royal Lodge, in the heart of Windsor Great Park near Windsor Castle, in 2003, and only a peppercorn rent “if demanded” each year since then, according to his lease agreement.\n \n\n   \n  Despite Thursday’s announcement, Andrew remains eighth in line to the British throne. That status  could be removed  by legislation, but it would require the consent of Commonwealth nations around the world, which would take time. The last time this protocol was used was when Edward VIII abdicated in 1936.\n \n\n   \n  CNN understands that rather than formally remove Andrew’s title as Duke of York via an act of parliament, King Charles will send royal warrants to remove Andrew’s peerages.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew was also known as the Earl of Inverness and Baron Killyleagh, a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order and as a Royal Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter. The stripping of his titles takes immediate effect.\n \n\n   \n  “Their Majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse,” Buckingham Palace added in the statement.\n \n\n   \n  In his interview with CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, Sky Roberts said King Charles’ decision vindicated the years of campaigning by his sister. “She should be here. She should be having this interview with you,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “She had been fighting for this for a long time. She always said… only one of us is telling the truth and I know that’s me,” Roberts said. “We’re really proud of her. We’re so proud of what she was able to achieve.”\n \n\n   \n  Calling it a “huge moment” for his sister and other survivors, Roberts said: “It’s an acknowledgement to say, we believe you. We see you. And for me, I love you. We love you… This is a very vindicating moment for us. And I just wish she was here to to share this with us.”\n \n\n   \n  Giuffre’s family said in their statement they would fight to ensure other associates of Epstein would face similar judgement. “Our sister, a child when she was sexually assaulted by Andrew, never stopped fighting for accountability for what had happened to her and to countless other survivors like her. Today, she declares victory,” the statement said, adding they will “not rest until the same accountability applies to all of the abusers and abettors connected to Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.”\n \n\n   \n    Calls for Andrew to face justice continue\n \n\n   \n  The anti-monarchy group Republic said Thursday that it had instructed lawyers to launch a private prosecution against Andrew “over accusations of sexual offenses and misconduct in public office.”\n \n\n   \n  The group said its lawyers would be actively investigating the case against Andrew and aim to begin proceedings in the coming weeks. Republic has previously called for the police to investigate Andrew.\n \n\n   \n  “Let’s be very clear, Prince Andrew – now Andrew Mountbatton Windsor – is not facing justice. He’s not being held to account. Losing silly titles is not an answer to very serious accusations of sexual offenses and corruption in public office,” Graham Smith, chief executive of Republic, said Thursday following the palace’s announcement.\n \n\n   \n  “This isn’t about William and Charles taking a tough line. It’s about William and Charles protecting their position by putting as much distance between them and Andrew as they can,” Smith added. “We need to see Andrew face justice, because we need to know that the royals are not above the law.”\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, the British monarch was  heckled by a protester  who could be heard shouting “How long have you known about Andrew and Epstein?” as he carried out a cathedral visit in northwest England.\n \n\n   \n    Andrew’s daughters to retain princess titles\n \n\n   \n  Andrew’s daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, will retain their titles as they are the daughters of the son of a sovereign – in line with rules set out by King George V in 1917.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew’s ex-wife Sarah Ferguson, who has lived with him for the past 20 years at Royal Lodge, will also move out and is understood to be making her own arrangements.\n \n\n   \n  Ferguson, 66, is the mother of Andrew’s two children. They wed in 1986 and divorced a decade later. She previously held the title of Duchess of York, but reverted to her maiden name when Andrew relinquished his titles earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  CNN also understands that the British government was consulted on the King’s decisions, and the government has made it clear that it supports the moves.\n \n\n   \n  The last time a prince had his title removed is understood to be more than 100 years ago, when Prince Charles Edward – one of Queen Victoria’s grandsons – had the title of Duke of Albany stripped from him by the British parliament under the Titles Deprivation Act 1917. The action was taken after he fought in World War I for Germany, where he was Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s MiSeon Lee contributed to this report.

 \nUpdated: \n        11:46 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  It’s only been open for six years, but Rosewood Hong Kong has quickly become a distinguished feature of Hong Kong’s iconic skyline, as well as a force to be reckoned with in the luxury hotel scene.\n \n\n   \n  And after landing in the top three of the World’s 50 Best Hotels list twice, the 65-storey property came in  first place  this year.\n \n\n   \n  Designed by Taiwanese designer Tony Chi, the contemporary 413-room hotel beat out last year’s winner, Capella Bangkok, in the highly anticipated list from the global hospitality brand 50 Best, announced at an awards ceremony in London last night.\n \n\n   \n  Angus Pitkethley, complex director of sales and marketing for Rosewood Hong Kong, told the crowd at the Old Billingsgate events venue that it was a “real surprise and a real honor” to come out on top this year.\n \n\n   \n    World-class service\n \n\n   \n  “What an emotional night here in London…” Pitkethley added. “Just a huge amount of pride and gratitude to be recognized with this award.”\n \n\n   \n  When asked what he believed was the secret to the Rosewood Hong Kong’s success, Pitkethley credited the staff at the $650-a-night hotel, which is located on the Kowloon waterfront in Hong Kong.\n \n\n   \n  “We have an incredible team back at the hotel, who are not only passionate about hospitality, but really passionate about Hong Kong,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Describing this year’s list as “a true celebration of the very best properties from 22 destinations across six continents,” Emma Sleight, head of content for The World’s 50 Best Hotels, was full of praise for the Rosewood Hong Kong, which opened in 2019.\n \n\n   \n  “This exceptional hotel offers world-class service and sensational guest experiences in the heart of one of the world’s most bustling and dynamic destinations,” said Sleight.\n \n\n   \n  “Rosewood Hong Kong’s positioning as No.1 further consolidates Asia as a leading luxury travel destination for both business and leisure travelers.”\n \n\n   \n    Asia dominates\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Four Seasons Bangkok at Chao Phraya River, a 299-room retreat located in the center of the Thai capital’s creative district, came in second place, closely followed by Capella Bangkok, which took third place on the list, which was heavily dominated by Asian hotels.\n \n\n   \n  In fact, Passalacqua, a boutique hotel located in Italy’s Lake Como was the only non-Asian hotel in the top five. The 18th-century villa took fourth place this year, making it the highest ranked European hotel, and was also named the Best Boutique Hotel.\n \n\n   \n  Historic hotel Raffles Singapore, the birthplace of the Singapore Sling cocktail, rounded out the top five.\n \n\n   \n  Other hotels in the Asian region featured on the list included Mandarin Oriental Bangkok (No.7), Upper House Hong Kong (No.10), Bulgari Tokyo (No.15), Aman Tokyo (No.25), Janu Tokyo (No.37), Mandarin Oriental Hong Kong (No.41), and The Tokyo Edition Toranomon (No.45).\n \n\n   \n    Very best properties\n \n\n   \n  The highest ranked hotel in North America was Chablé Yucatán (No. 8), one of four Mexican hotels featured. A former 19th-century hacienda, nestled in the Mayan jungle, Chablé Yucatán is “inspired by nature, culture, and human connection,” said Diego Gutiérrez, CEO of Chablé Hotels, in a press release. The Mark in New York was a new entry this year, placing at No.43 and Hotel Bel-Air in Los Angeles ranked at No.42.\n \n\n   \n  Copacabana Palace in Rio de Janeiro, which also won the Lavazza Highest New Entry Award, and Rosewood São Paulo were the only South American hotels on the list, placing at No.11 and No.24 respectively.\n \n\n   \n  Dubai’s Atlantis The Royal, No.6, was the highest ranked hotel in the Middle East, while Capella Sydney, No.12, beat out the competition for the Oceana region. At No.13, Marrakech’s Royal Mansour was the highest ranked hotel in Africa.\n \n\n   \n  The World’s Best Hotel list is decided by the World’s 50 Best Hotel Academy, which is made up of 800 hotel industry experts, including hoteliers and travel journalists, spread across 13 destinations around the globe.\n \n\n   \n    The World’s 50 Best Hotels 2025\n \n\n   \n  1.

   \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Scientists say they have found a way to test  ancient human  remains for hormones linked with pregnancy, a breakthrough that may allow archaeologists to determine whether a woman was pregnant or had recently given birth at the time of her death.\n \n\n   \n  Researchers found key reproductive hormones estrogen, progesterone and testosterone in hard tissues, such as the bones and teeth, of skeletons dating back as far as 1,000 years, according to a study published October 2 in the  Journal of Archaeological Science .\n \n\n   \n  “We found a ‘hormone archive’ in skeletons and teeth,” said lead study author Aimée Barlow, an archaeologist at the University of Sheffield, northern England.\n \n\n   \n  “This is a first. Nobody has ever detected these specific hormones in teeth or dental calculus before,” Barlow told CNN. “It is also the first time progesterone has been successfully measured in human bone tissue.”\n \n\n   \n  Pregnancy is difficult to detect in ancient human remains, and scientists previously believed that the composition of hard tissues was so overwhelmingly inorganic that these proteins would not be preserved or detected, Barlow said.\n \n\n   \n  Nonetheless, she decided to test a number of samples from seven female and three male skeletons dating from the first to 19th centuries using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). ELISA is an existing technique used to detect and quantify peptide and protein molecules such as progesterone, a key biomarker for pregnancy, the levels of which increase significantly during the first trimester and are maintained throughout.\n \n\n   \n  Levels of estrogen and testosterone also rise, although not to the same extent, meaning that it was important to also consider the relationship between the three hormones, according to the study.\n \n\n   \n  The tests revealed that estrogen, progesterone and testosterone were measurable in bone, and dentin, enamel, calculus and root samples from teeth. “High progesterone levels in dental structures and calculus, the presence of oestrogen in bone, and a lack of testosterone in hard tissues was consistent with pregnancy at the time of death,” the study authors wrote.\n \n\n   \n  This demonstrates “the feasibility and significant potential of the ELISA method for the detection of sex hormones in human skeletal remains to examine the reproductive histories of past populations,” according to the study.\n \n\n   \n  Barlow said proving that the skeleton can preserve hormones would, with many years of further study, potentially allow researchers to determine the age at which a woman first became pregnant, whether she experienced pregnancy loss and how much time had passed between births if she had multiple children.\n \n\n   \n  “This will be especially useful for historical periods where no written records exist,” Barlow said.\n \n\n   \n  More work is needed to fully develop the technique for use on ancient remains, she said, including establishing a baseline of hormone levels in skeletal tissues by conducting a much larger study that also involves living individuals with detailed medical records.\n \n\n   \n  “Secondly, we need to understand the fundamental science. We need to learn how these hormones get incorporated into and stored within these different tissues,” Barlow said.\n \n\n   \n  “And we need to explore how these hormones are preserved and broken down (degraded) over time in different burial environments.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Groundbreaking’ findings\n \n\n   \n  Nikolas Lemos, professor of forensic medical sciences at Queen Mary University of London, who was not involved in the study, told CNN that “this is a pioneering study … which has achieved a world-first.”\n \n\n   \n  Lemos underlined that the sample size was “very small,” with only two of the 10 individuals pregnant at death, adding that the ELISA method requires “further testing and validation.”\n \n\n   \n  “In short, while the findings are groundbreaking, they should be viewed as proof of concept, not yet as a routine diagnostic tool,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “Although the work is still in its early stages, it represents a remarkable step toward understanding the intimate, hormonal dimensions of life and death in the distant past,” Lemos added.\n \n\n   \n  Alexander Comninos, a professor of endocrinology at Imperial College London, who was not involved in the study, said that the research was “fascinating.”\n \n\n   \n  “By understanding reproductive profiles of the past, this can provide insights into how these may have changed over time and perhaps glimpses of the future,” he told CNN in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  “In addition, the ability to identify these key hormones in bone can trigger further contemporary work in the bone field,” Comninos added.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/us-nuclear-testing-trump-advisers","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"10:12:00-04:00","title":"Trump Announces Resumption of U.S. Nuclear Testing Amid Global Tensions","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump, in a surprise announcement made via Truth Social during a diplomatic flight to South Korea, directed the Pentagon to resume nuclear testing after a 33-year pause, citing concerns over China and Russia’s nuclear capabilities.

would begin testing nukes. It caught even some advisers by surprise. \n       \n  By Kevin Liptak, Kylie Atwood, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:12 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  When Chinese leader Xi Jinping inserted a reference to “twists and turns” in his relationship with  President Donald Trump  in the opening remarks of their summit this week, he could hardly have imagined the twist that came minutes before the talks began.\n \n\n   \n  Writing from Marine One, which was gliding toward the airport in South Korea where he was due to meet Xi, Trump  instructed the Pentagon  to resume nuclear testing after a 33-year pause, citing other nations’ — including China’s — own capabilities.\n \n\n   \n  “That process will begin immediately,” the president wrote on social media.\n \n\n   \n  The directive took even many of Trump’s advisers off guard, according to officials, leading to unanswered questions about when, or if, the testing would actually begin. Historically, it is the Department of Energy that maintains and tests the US nuclear stockpile, not the Department of Defense. And engineers have said accurate tests can be conducted through computer simulation, not blowing up an actual warhead underwater or in the Nevada desert.\n \n\n   \n  Hours after the president’s post, it did not appear as if the Pentagon was moving swiftly to test a nuclear weapon. Testifying on Capitol Hill, the senior military officer nominated to oversee the American nuclear arsenal said Thursday morning he was not “reading anything” into Trump’s Truth Social post — an indication, if one was needed, that the instructions hadn’t been previewed very widely ahead of time.\n \n\n   \n  The surprise message only underscored the volatile approach Trump is taking to foreign affairs nine months into his second administration. Even as he was about to sit down for a meeting intended to lend stability to the world’s most important bilateral relationship, Trump demonstrated his willingness to suddenly veer in an unexpected direction.\n \n\n   \n  Administration officials offered little clarity when questioned about the message on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the president’s Truth speaks for itself,” Vice President JD Vance said as he took questions from reporters at the White House. “We have a big arsenal. Obviously, the Russians have a large nuclear arsenal. The Chinese have a large nuclear arsenal. Sometimes you’ve got to test it to make sure that it’s functioning and working properly.”\n \n\n   \n  “To be clear, we know that it does work properly,” he added later, “but you got to keep on top of it over time, and the president just wants to make sure that we do that.”\n \n\n   \n  When asked by reporters in Malaysia on Friday about Trump’s post, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the Pentagon would move quickly and work with the Department of Energy. He argued that “resuming testing is a pretty responsible” way to keep a “credible nuclear deterrent.”\n \n\n   \n  Dating back to his first term, Trump has always maintained a somewhat complicated relationship to the nuclear weapons he can launch from a secure suitcase anywhere he goes.\n \n\n   \n  A product of the nuclear era, he recently voiced wariness at even mentioning the word itself: “We can’t let people throw around that word,” the president told generals last month. “I call it the n-word. There are two n-words, and you can’t use either of them.”\n \n\n   \n  He seemed less cautious in his  Truth Social message  this week.\n \n\n   \n  “The United States has more Nuclear Weapons than any other country,” he wrote. “This was accomplished, including a complete update and renovation of existing weapons, during my First Term in office. Because of the tremendous destructive power, I HATED to do it, but had no choice!”\n \n\n   \n  Afterwards, Trump was circumspect about what tests, precisely, he was asking for.\n \n\n   \n  “With others doing testing, I think it’s appropriate that we do also,” Trump said aboard Air Force One as he was returning to Washington.\n \n\n   \n  He said nuclear test sites would be determined later, and specified his message did not relate to China — even though he named the country specifically in his message. “It had to do with others,” he said vaguely.\n \n\n   \n  Some officials said Trump may have been prompted by Moscow’s test flights in recent days of nuclear-capable cruise missiles and torpedoes, though their existence was already known and the tests did not involve a nuclear detonation. There is also no US equivalent to those Russian systems that could be tested to demonstrate equivalence, because the US decided decades ago that developing those systems was unproductive, said a former Trump administration official who worked on nuclear issues.\n \n\n   \n  Neither China nor Russia have conducted a nuclear test in decades. While China has worked rapidly to expand its arsenal, it is not known to have conducted an explosive test since 1996.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing’s speedy buildup in nuclear weapons has nonetheless generated concern among administration officials, who regard the issue as yet another point of friction in an increasingly tense relationship. Xi presided over a flashy parade of China’s nuclear-capable missiles last month.\n \n\n   \n  “Russia has nearly completed their modernization of all of their nuclear forces, and China is modernizing, and they are growing their arsenal at a breathtaking speed,” Elbridge Colby, the US undersecretary of defense for policy, said during his confirmation hearing this year.\n \n\n   \n  Still, if Trump was ordering up the first test of a US nuclear explosive since 1992, it came as news to the military officer he nominated to oversee the nation’s vast arsenal of nuclear weapons.\n \n\n   \n  “I wouldn’t presume that the president’s words meant nuclear testing,” Vice Adm. Richard Correll, whom Trump tapped to head up US Strategic Command, said before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “I believe the quote was, ‘start testing our nuclear weapons on an equal basis,’” Correll went on. “Neither China or Russia has conducted a nuclear explosive test, so I’m not reading anything into it or reading anything out to it.”\n \n\n   \n  If confirmed to the position, Correll would be responsible for the more than 41,000 service members who look after components of the US nuclear weapons program, including submarines, ballistic missiles and Air Force bomber aircraft. He has served as the deputy commander of US Strategic Command since 2022 — so it’d be unusual if he didn’t know know about a change in the decadeslong moratorium on nuclear testing.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has not changed the nuclear modernization policy that was put into place during the final year of the Biden administration, with the aim of pivoting the strategic plan to deter China’s nuclear buildup. But carrying out a nuclear test could set back that modernization strategy because it would reorient the focus of the officials working on those ongoing efforts, according to former US officials who worked on nuclear issues.\n \n\n   \n  There are also concerns among those officials that Trump declaring the intent for US nuclear testing would actually benefit China — not the US.\n \n\n   \n  “The mere suggestion that the US may resume nuclear testing could give the green light to China to resume explosive testing, and the Chinese would benefit comparatively more than anyone else if testing resumed. There is no technical reason for the US to do this now. But for China, it could technically advance their capabilities,” a former senior US official said.\n \n\n   \n  Yet Trump has long approached nuclear weapons with a combination of morbid fascination and bombastic threats.\n \n\n   \n  In August, he announced he was ordering two nuclear submarines to be strategically positioned near Russia in response to what he said were aggressive remarks by Dmitry Medvedev, the country’s former president and current deputy chairman of its Security Council. He never clarified whether he was referring to subs with nuclear weapon capabilities, or merely nuclear-powered subs.\n \n\n   \n  In a particularly heated moment from his first term, Trump taunted North Korea’s Kim Jong Un — whose 2017 underground test is the last known example of explosive nuclear testing — for the relative size of his “nuclear button.”\n \n\n   \n  “I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!” Trump wrote on social media in 2018.\n \n\n   \n  He and Kim eventually improved relations and met in person three times — though Trump was never able to convince the despot to abandon his nuclear weapons.\n \n\n   \n  Now, Trump appears hopeful to begin tests quickly — though just how quickly may depend on his willingness to break international rules.\n \n\n   \n  “If the United States needed to conduct an immediate nuclear test to, say, verify that some of its weapons were working or for political purposes, it could violate a whole number of treaties that ban doing that in the atmosphere. And that could happen in a matter of weeks or maybe months,” said Jon Wolfsthal, a former senior director for arms control and nonproliferation at the National Security Council, who now is director of global risk at the Federation of American Scientists.\n \n\n   \n  “The United States has a test site just outside Nevada where we conducted these tests in the 1990s and before,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  “But it’s not poised to conduct testing anytime soon, and it takes years to scientifically instrument a test to make sure you’re getting the data out of it that you need. And I also assume that states like Nevada and others would sue to block the president’s ability to do this. So we’re several years away from being able to conduct explosive nuclear tests.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/shutdown-snap-food-stamps-trump-congress-analysis","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"10:51:00-04:00","title":"Bitter Washington blame game rages as pain grips needy Americans","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. government is in a prolonged shutdown that began in early October 2025 and has lasted for over 30 days, primarily due to a deadlock between Democrats and Republicans over whether to extend Obamacare subsidies.

And the government is more shut than ever.\n \n\n   \n  Washington woke Thursday to a whiff of rare hope that  behind-the-scenes efforts  were accelerating in the Senate to end a federal shutdown now imposing severe pain on millions of Americans.\n \n\n   \n  But the day ended with senators skipping town for the weekend — to join members of the House not seen inside the Beltway for so long it’s hard to remember what they look like.\n \n\n   \n  Trump made his first intervention in the shutdown drama since returning from a trip to Asia,  calling on Senate Republicans to end the filibuster  — the device that requires 60 votes to pass most major legislation and currently represents the only brake on his power that Democrats have in Washington.\n \n\n   \n  “It is now time for the Republicans to play their ‘TRUMP CARD,’ and go for what is called the Nuclear Option,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  Such a move would allow Republicans to open the government while bypassing Democratic demands. But it would open the possibility that Democrats could pass into law sweeping progressive reforms and roll back swaths of the conservative agenda if they control both chambers of Congress at some point in the future. Trump may not care what happens when he’s no longer president, but eliminating the filibuster would represent a fundamental political shift.\n \n\n   \n  This new wrinkle in Trump’s strategy will no doubt pile more pressure on Senate Majority Leader John Thune. And while Trump can shift his position from one moment to the next, his new gambit may indicate he’s more interested in crushing Democrats than seeking a way out of the increasingly damaging shutdown. Republican leaders in both parties have stated they don’t support ending the filibuster because of the implications for any future Democratic majority.\n \n\n   \n  What’s so galling in the current shutdown   is that both Republicans and Democrats insist they are keeping faith with their duties — taking care of the American people — but that the other side is willing to drive ordinary citizens to the brink of hunger or sickness.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Democrats triggered the shutdown, refusing to extend federal funding until Republicans agree to extend expiring  enhanced Obamacare subsidies , without which millions of citizens will see  the cost of health care rocket .\n \n\n   \n  Republicans are willing to talk — but only when the government is opened again. Their assurances aren’t being taken at face value since their president routinely ignores the terms of deals and Congress’ constitutionally sound decisions on how to spend taxpayer money.\n \n\n   \n  The result:  Vital SNAP benefits  that help feed more than 40 million people are within hours of running out. Federal workers deemed essential have slogged through demoralizing weeks without pay. And it’s no vacation for their furloughed colleagues either: Financial obligations aren’t shut down just because the government is.\n \n\n   \n  Little is evident on the horizon that could prevent the monthlong shutdown from becoming the longest on record next week.\n \n\n   \n  In the absence of meaningful progress, dismayed lawmakers spent the day venting and trading insults.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats accused Republicans of starving kids. Vice President JD Vance accused Democrats of putting extreme pressure  on air traffic controllers , implying they were risking the nation’s “extra safe” skies.\n \n\n   \n  Wyoming Republican Sen. Cynthia Lummis said that staying in town for another weekend waiting for Democrats to come to the table “is gonna be a waste of time.” Sen. Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat, told CNN’s Dana Bash he was shocked “at the level of cruelty” shown by his GOP colleagues.\n \n\n   \n  And renegade Pennsylvania Democratic Sen. John Fetterman has had it up to here with everyone. “It’s an absolute failure what occurred here for the last month,”  Fetterman told CNN . He also complained about his own party’s tactics. “We can’t even get our sh*t together and just open up our government,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    One judge says she won’t let people die\n \n\n   \n  Democrats might have some justification in arguing that Republicans and their health care policies and endless attempts to kill Obamacare set the stage for this crisis. But Republicans can also point to the great contradiction of the Democratic strategy: The shutdown has now become a test of which bloc of unfortunate Americans are hurting the most — those who risk losing health care or those who don’t have enough to eat.\n \n\n   \n  Shutdowns typically end when one party can’t bear the political price of the government staying closed. In many ways, these showdowns are Washington games that can define the course of presidencies and Congresses.\n \n\n   \n  But the fact that it’s now been a month and neither side is willing to blink is also a symptom of a broken political system and a Congress that can no longer do its basic constitutional task of funding the government. And any victory for either party at this point will be hollow, since it will be built on the suffering of citizens.\n \n\n   \n  One federal judge in Boston is doing what the judiciary often seems to do these days: stepping in where Congress has failed.  US District Judge Indira Talwani  signaled she will intervene in the dispute over the Trump administration’s refusal to use billions of dollars in emergency funds to fund food stamps under SNAP.\n \n\n   \n  “Right now, Congress has put money in an emergency fund for an emergency, and it’s hard for me to understand how this isn’t an emergency when there’s no money and a lot of people are needing their SNAP benefits,” Talwani said in the kind of plain English that lawmakers seem to shed when they get to Washington.\n \n\n   \n  “The idea that we’re going to do the absolutely most drastic thing, which is that there’s not just less money but no money, seems the farthest thing from” what Congress intended, Talwani said. “We’re not going to make everyone drop dead” from hunger.\n \n\n   \n    Is there any hope for a breakthrough?\n \n\n   \n  Sometimes in Washington, the darkest hour is the one before dawn. So maybe there’s a chance the vicious rhetoric is a smokescreen allowing everyone to vent before they compromise.\n \n\n   \n  But there’s another characteristic of modern Washington that may be more apt right now — the way that disaster always has to nearly strike before two parties mired in their ideological extremes find a sliver of common ground.\n \n\n   \n  But at some point, this shutdown will end. It has to.\n \n\n   \n  If the denouement does not come from a president who discovers a moral or political imperative to live up to his 2016 convention vow, “I alone can fix it,” it may emerge from a creative fudge in the Senate in which Republicans give a handful of Democratic senators political cover to vote to break the filibuster and reopen the government.\n \n\n   \n  Thune — who ditched his suave self-control on Wednesday to  rage at Democrats  in a Senate rant — struck one hopeful note when he said there was an uptick in bipartisan conversations this week. “We got members on both sides who are continuing to dialogue,” he told reporters.\n \n\n   \n  But Thune doesn’t yet have the political space to offer Democrats the kind of tangible deliverables they would need. “When they’re willing to produce the votes to open up the government, we’re going to talk,” he said, restating the sticking point.\n \n\n   \n  One possible endgame scenario is that the Senate could blur the sequencing of when the government reopens and talks get serious on Obamacare subsidies. But knowing how something might eventually end is easier than getting there.\n \n\n   \n  Therefore, in the absence of progress, everyone had to fill the space.\n \n\n   \n  “We are now beginning Day 30 of the Democrat shutdown,” said House Speaker Mike Johnson, of Louisiana. “There are millions of Americans … that are bracing themselves for further pain and hardship.”\n \n\n   \n  House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York accused the administration of enacting “policy violence” by refusing to extend Obamacare subsidies while offering a  $20 billion bailout  to Trump’s MAGA pal President Javier Milei in Argentina.\n \n\n   \n  Republican Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming said he wasn’t worried about his own air travel as air traffic control snarls, but did “worry about the flights of thousands and thousands of people.” Mixing transportation metaphors, he accused Democrats of being “way off the rails.”\n \n\n   \n  And Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York followed his warning on Wednesday that Trump “is a vindictive politician and a heartless politician and a heartless man” by accusing Republicans of bringing down “the specter of financial disaster” on Americans — including in red states — over health care.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not exactly promising.\n \n\n   \n  But Thune told reporters, “I’m always optimistic. Aren’t you?”\n \n\n   \n  That’s a tough one, senator.\n \n\n   \n   This article has been updated with new reporting as well as to correct Sen. Cynthia Lummis’ state, Wyoming. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/africa/tanzania-opposition-dispute-election-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"10:40:00-04:00","title":"What to know about a disputed election in Tanzania, where single-party rule is being challenged","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In Tanzania, a disputed presidential election has sparked widespread protests as opposition leaders allege that the ruling Chama cha Mapinduzi (CCM) party has used administrative, legal, and extrajudicial means—such as banning candidates, imprisoning activists, and banning social media—to ensure a one-sided outcome.

Source: AP\n \n   \n  Protests are spreading in  Tanzania  as electoral authorities count the votes in a disputed presidential election that rights groups, opposition figures and others say was clouded by a climate of fear in the months leading to election day.\n \n\n   \n  The military has been deployed alongside the police to quell riots in major cities since Wednesday’s election. The sight of soldiers patrolling the streets, sporadic gunfire and closed stores is rare in the usually peaceful country that many foreigners visit for its pristine coastal beaches and safari tourism.\n \n\n   \n  That’s partly because Tanzania’s first female leader, who has served as president since 2021, has sparked widespread anger for  running virtually unopposed  after her two main opponents were blocked or prevented from contesting.\n \n\n   \n  President Samia Suluhu Hassan, who seeks five more years as president, ran against 16 candidates from smaller parties. Critics say that’s a coronation, not a contest. Hassan is now the subject of a range of uncharitable cartoons, posted on social media, derided as a dictator and lampooned as being afraid of competition.\n \n\n   \n  Tundu Lissu, leader of the Chadema opposition group, has been jailed for months, charged with treason after he called for electoral reforms that he said were a prerequisite for free and fair elections. Another opposition figure, Luhaga Mpina of the ACT-Wazalendo group, was barred from standing.\n \n\n   \n    Political maneuvering\n \n\n   \n  At stake for the ruling Chama cha Mapinduzi party, or CCM, is its decades-long grip on power amid the rise of charismatic opposition figures who hope to lead the country toward political change.\n \n\n   \n  The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data, or ACLED, a nonprofit tracking violence and protest movements around the world, describes CCM as the “last of the hegemonic liberation parties,” trying to cling to power by blocking the opposition “through administrative, legal, and extra-legal means.”\n \n\n   \n  The pattern includes enforced disappearances, arbitrary arrests and extrajudicial killings, according to Amnesty International. In June, a United Nations panel of human rights experts cited  more than 200 cases of enforced disappearance since 2019 , saying they were “alarmed by reports of a pattern of repression” ahead of elections.\n \n\n   \n  Internet access has been on and off since Wednesday as the nation awaits official results.\n \n\n   \n  Tanzania’s president has “overseen an unprecedented crackdown on political opponents,” the International Crisis Group said in its most recent analysis. “The government has curbed freedom of expression, ranging from a ban on X and restrictions on the Tanzanian digital platform JamiiForums to silencing critical voices through intimidation or arrest.”\n \n\n   \n  Local police even appeared to be “conducting so-called online patrols,” it said.\n \n\n   \n  The political maneuvering by Tanzanian authorities is unprecedented even in a country where single-party rule has been the norm since the advent of multi-party politics in 1992.\n \n\n   \n  Government critics point out that previous leaders tolerated opposition while maintaining a firm grip on power, whereas Hassan is accused of leading with an authoritarian style that defies youth-led democracy movements elsewhere in the region.\n \n\n   \n  In Uganda, the opposition leader Bobi Wine, whose real name is Kyagulanyi Ssentamu, is the leader of what began as the “People Power” movement, which aims for a break with nearly four decades of the same leader. President Yoweri Museveni took his lowest-ever share of the vote in the 2021 election, marking the 43-year-old Wine as a formidable national leader.\n \n\n   \n  In Kenya, young people have been trying to hold President William Ruto accountable over official corruption and his alleged failure to keep campaign promises. Last year and earlier this year, they held demonstrations in the capital Nairobi that were so large and persistent that Ruto deployed the military to restore order.\n \n\n   \n  In  Mozambique  a year ago, violence erupted in the streets after the opposition figure Venâncio Mondlane brought his supporters to the streets of the capital Maputo following a disputed election.\n \n\n   \n  In  Madagascar  earlier in October, protests by mostly young people helped overthrow the government of President Andry Rajoelina, who fled the country after an elite group of the military joined crowds protesting water and electricity cuts.\n \n\n   \n    Tanzania is an outlier\n \n\n   \n  But Tanzania is different, an outlier in the region.\n \n\n   \n  A version of the governing CCM party, which maintains ties with the Communist Party of China, has ruled Tanzania since independence from Britain in 1961, a remarkable streak that Hassan is trying to extend as opposition leaders try to break CCM’s grip on the country.\n \n\n   \n  CCM is fused with the state, effectively in charge of the security apparatus and structured in such a way that new leaders emerge every five or ten years. Hassan herself was able to rise to the presidency as vice president without incident when her predecessor, John Pombe Magufuli, died suddenly after the start of his second term.\n \n\n   \n  The orderly transition sustained Tanzania’s reputation as an oasis of political stability and relative peace, a major reason for CCM’s considerable support, especially among rural voters.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/us/broadview-ice-facility-illinois-lawsuit","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"09:45:00-05:00","title":"Advocates allege ‘inhumane’ conditions at Chicago-area ICE facility in new lawsuit","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Advocacy groups, including the ACLU of Illinois and the MacArthur Justice Center, have filed a lawsuit alleging inhumane conditions and constitutional violations at the Broadview immigration detention facility in Chicago.

in new lawsuit \n       \n  By Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:45 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  Illinois advocates sued federal authorities Friday over alleged “inhumane” conditions at a Chicago-area  federal immigration  facility.\n \n\n   \n  Attorneys with the ACLU of Illinois and the MacArthur Justice Center say U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have denied people being held at the  Broadview facility  private calls with attorneys and have blocked members of Congress, faith leaders and journalists from  entering the building , creating a “black box” they say has allowed authorities to act “with impunity.”\n \n\n   \n  Agents have also allegedly coerced people held at the processing center to sign paperwork they don’t understand, leading them to unknowingly relinquish their rights and  face deportation , according to the lawsuit.\n \n\n   \n  Representatives of ICE and The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment Friday.\n \n\n   \n  Alexa Van Brunt, director of the MacArthur Justice Center’s Illinois office and lead attorney for the lawsuit, said community members are “being kidnapped off the streets, packed in hold cells, denied food, medical care, and basic necessities, and forced to sign away their legal rights.”\n \n\n   \n  “Everyone, no matter their legal status, has the right to access counsel and to not be subject to horrific and inhumane conditions,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Attorneys accuse ICE, DHS and U.S. Customs and Border Protection of violating detainees’ Fifth Amendment right to due process and First Amendment right to legal counsel, and have asked the court to force the agencies to improve the facility’s conditions.\n \n\n   \n  Advocates have  for months  raised concerns about conditions at the facility, which has drawn scrutiny from members of Congress, political candidates and activist groups. Lawyers and relatives of people held at the facility have called it a de facto detention center, where up to 200 people have been held at a time without access to legal counsel.\n \n\n   \n  DHS previously dismissed the claims, saying those held at the facility have proper meals, medical treatment and access to communication with family members and lawyers.\n \n\n   \n  The Broadview center has also drawn demonstrations, which have led to the arrests of numerous protesters. The protests are at the center of a separate lawsuit from a coalition of news outlets and protesters who claim federal agents violated their First Amendment rights by repeatedly using  tear gas  and other weapons on them.\n \n\n   \n  U.S. District Judge  Sara Ellis  sided with the coalition earlier this month, requiring federal agents in the Chicago area to wear badges and banning them from using certain riot control techniques against peaceful protesters and journalists. Later, Ellis also  required body cameras  for agents  who have them  after raising concerns about her initial order not being followed.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/tech/microsoft-amazon-meta-google-earnings-ai","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"10:05:00-04:00","title":"Big Tech Keeps Splurging on AI: Pressure Mounts for Returns","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Big Tech companies—Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, and Alphabet—are aggressively expanding their capital expenditures on AI infrastructure, including data centers and equipment, with projected spending reaching up to $125 billion from Amazon and $93 billion from Google in 2025.

The pressure is ramping up to show why \n       \n  By Lisa Eadicicco, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:05 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Silicon Valley’s mega AI spending spree isn’t slowing down anytime soon. But Wall Street’s patience to see a return might be wearing a little thin.\n \n\n   \n  That message rang clear when Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple and Google parent Alphabet all said this week that they’re forking over more   on capital expenditures, like   leases and equipment for data centers and infrastructure.\n \n\n   \n  Based on the way analysts grilled executives from companies like Meta, Alphabet and Google on earnings calls this week, they’re eager for signs that these massive investments will pay off in a big way.\n \n\n   \n    AI spending continues to soar\n \n\n   \n  Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta all grew their overall revenue year-over-year and surpassed Wall Street’s expectations. Microsoft and Google saw their cloud businesses expand by 40% and 34% respectively, while Amazon Web Services sales grew 20% year-over-year – a sign that companies are indeed relying on their services in the age of AI.\n \n\n   \n  And they’re continuing to pour tens of billions of dollars into AI infrastructure and data centers, an investment they call necessary for the internet’s next era.\n \n\n   \n  The dollar amounts involved are staggering.\n \n\n   \n  Google expects to   spend $91 to $93 billion in capital expenditures for 2025, up from the $85 billion it previously forecast. Microsoft sees that spending   up 74%, to $34.9 billion this year, largely lining up with the more than $30 billion it predicted for the quarter. Meta spent $19.37 billion, up from $9.2 billion a year ago and more than the $18.4 billion analysts expected.\n \n\n   \n  And Amazon estimates the 2025 bill will hit $125 billion – and   expects to increase that in 2026.\n \n\n   \n  Even Apple, which is not a major cloud provider, expects to increase its capital expenditure spending related to AI investments, Apple Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh said on the company’s Thursday earnings call.\n \n\n   \n  Existing data centers need to be upgraded to handle AI workloads, leading to the giant outlays, said Melissa Otto, head of research for investment research service S&P Global Visible Alpha.\n \n\n   \n  Tech giants justify that spending by saying demand is outstripping supply. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said that “as fast as we’re adding capacity right now, we’re monetizing it.”\n \n\n   \n    Wall Street wants big answers from Big Tech\n \n\n   \n  But Wall Street wants more than just promises of future returns. Meta shares fell as much as 13.5% on Thursday, while Microsoft’s were down more than 3%.\n \n\n   \n  Nearly every question on Meta’s earnings call focused on how the company views its AI investments translating into income, the timeline for new products and models coming out of its Superintelligence Lab and its general approach to AI.\n \n\n   \n  Zuckerberg called AI useful for powering virtual assistants and helping advertisers plan their campaigns. More than a billion people use Meta AI on a monthly basis, he said, adding that AI can lead to “all kinds of new products around different content formats.”\n \n\n   \n  “We expect to build novel models and novel products, and I’m excited to share more when we have it,” he said about the Superintelligence Lab’s efforts.\n \n\n   \n  On the Microsoft call, analysts wanted to know if clients will make good on promised purchasing commitments and whether the tech industry can really make money from global AI investments. Amy Hood, Microsoft’s chief financial officer, said its investments reflect business that’s already been booked, saying that demand is increasing.\n \n\n   \n  Google investors wanted to know how AI summaries and agents are changing how the company makes money from search. Google’s chief business officer said the company makes about the same money from ads   below and within the AI responses as with traditional search.\n \n\n   \n  The answers satisfied some analysts; UBS said it maintains its “conviction that AI-related stocks should drive further equity performance,” while CFRA Research said it came away from the quarter “more optimistic” about Google’s core business and that Meta “remains committed to becoming the leading AI lab.” Wedbush Securities’ Dan Ives said Microsoft is “hitting its next phase of monetization on the AI front.”\n \n\n   \n  But that’s as long as they keep growing the products that catapulted them to become the world’s largest tech companies in the first place. Investors are more likely to raise their eyebrows at all this spending if customers start shying away from Meta’s social media apps or Google’s search engine, according to Otto.\n \n\n   \n  “You’re seeing a pressure to accelerate innovation,” said SuRo Capital’s Evan Schlossman. “You have new space in AI that people believe will be extremely valuable, and so there is a rush to sort of fill that void.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/us/abby-zwerner-lawsuit-trial-shot","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"09:34:00-04:00","title":"Teacher shot by a 6-year-old student thought she was ‘on my way to heaven.’ What we learned from Abby Zwerner’s testimony","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Teacher Abby Zwerner was shot in the hand and chest by a 6-year-old student at Richneck Elementary School in Newport News, Virginia, on January 6, 2023.

    \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Abby Zwerner instinctively raised her hand toward her heart when she saw the 6-year-old holding the gun.\n \n\n   \n  After the bullet hit her, “I thought I was on my way to heaven or in heaven,” Zwerner  testified  Thursday during her civil case against a former school official accused of neglecting warning signs the student   had brought a gun to school.\n \n\n   \n  “I thought I was dying. I thought I had died,” Zwerner said with a catch in her voice as she recounted the moment she was shot in the hand and chest on January 6, 2023, while sitting at a reading table in her classroom at Richneck Elementary School in Newport News.\n \n\n   \n  The boy’s   “blank look” as he aimed at her is a memory Zwerner said she can’t shake.\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner has filed a $40 million  lawsuit  against ex-assistant principal   Ebony Parker, saying Parker failed to act when several people approached her with concerns the boy had brought a gun to school.\n \n\n   \n  Parker also faces  eight counts  of felony child neglect in the criminal trial against her next month.\n \n\n   \n  The case offers a window into what to expect for the upcoming criminal trial against Parker. Both trials raise questions about who is responsible when children with access to guns carry out school shootings, a pervasive problem across the country.\n \n\n   \n  As of Monday, there have been  64 school shootings  in the United States this year, 27 of which took place on K-12 school grounds.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we learned from Zwerner’s moving and highly anticipated testimony.\n \n\n   \n    Effects of shooting linger\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner’s devastating hand injury has left her unable to do everyday things like open a bottle of   water.\n \n\n   \n  “I was trying to open the bag of chips on my own multiple times, different ways — trying to hold it different ways,” she testified about a recent lunch with her attorney. “And I eventually asked you to open it.”\n \n\n   \n  Even after six surgeries, Zwerner’s hand will never be normal, an orthopedic surgeon testified this week.\n \n\n   \n  Previous testimony from doctors on her care team revealed Zwerner’s injuries were life-threatening after a bullet narrowly missed her heart. And the impacts extended beyond the physical damage, she testified.\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner struggled to describe how she now feels around people, even loved ones, but indicated she feels a “distance” and “numbness.”\n \n\n   \n  Psychiatrist Dr. Clarence Watson testified Thursday Zwerner has suffered post-traumatic stress disorder after the shooting.\n \n\n   \n  “She has lost the sense of being safe, something that she had not experienced before, even when she was feeling depressed or anxious … She now doesn’t want to go anywhere,” Watson said. “She had become socially withdrawn and isolated, pulled away from friends, didn’t want to be in public as much, and felt fear in places that she didn’t feel fear before.”\n \n\n   \n  Even a planned outing to the movies to see “Hamilton,” which features a duel scene with guns, became an overwhelming task that left her in tears, Zwerner said.\n \n\n   \n  When her mother asked her what she wanted to do instead, she felt resigned.\n \n\n   \n  “I remember saying or telling them, ‘nowhere, like I can’t go anywhere. I just want to stay home,’” Zwerner said.\n \n\n   \n    Defense tries to undercut teacher’s testimony\n \n\n   \n  During cross-examination Thursday, an attorney for Parker worked to undermine Zwerner’s claims that the shooting has limited her willingness to go out in public.\n \n\n   \n  The attorney presented evidence Zwerner had been emotionally ready to attend concerts since the shooting, including the Taylor Swift Eras tour.\n \n\n   \n  The attorney also sought to undermine claims Zwerner is physically hindered by her wounds, asking Zwerner how she successfully attended and graduated from cosmetology school, worked and frequented a gym if she had physical limitations.\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner was proud of graduating but was often in pain, she said. She has yet to get a job in cosmetology and can’t work in the field until her hand heals from her latest surgery, she said.\n \n\n   \n  Additionally, her doctor had cleared her to do light workouts and she tried her best to do that with weights, Zwerner testified.\n \n\n   \n  The defense also pressed Zwerner on whether there was more she could have done after learning of the possible gun threat.\n \n\n   \n  Another school staffer told her about the boy potentially having a gun and she did not inform Parker because she knew the other staffer was going to, Zwerner testified.\n \n\n   \n  Parker’s attorneys are trying to paint a picture that Zwerner may have been “a little bit at fault” for not acting on information that she had, said Darryl K. Brown, a law professor at the University of Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  “That can be the basis for the defendant not being held negligent and having to pay damages, even if the defendant is more at fault, or mostly at fault,” Brown said .   \n \n\n   \n    What’s next\n \n\n   \n  The jury will reconvene Monday morning in the ongoing civil trial — which could be a roadmap for what’s to come with the criminal litigation against Parker.\n \n\n   \n  Holding civil cases before criminal ones is “really unusual,” Brown said. It may be because Parker waived her right to a speedy trial, and because the defense wants it that way, he added.\n \n\n   \n  “I suspect that defense would want the civil trial to go forward first, because they’re not going to be able to avoid it, and it gives them a lot of information about what would come in at the criminal trial,” Brown said.\n \n\n   \n  While Zwerner’s pain and suffering have taken center stage in this trial, the upcoming   criminal trial would be more likely to touch on what action Parker failed to take, given her duty to protect children, Brown said.\n \n\n   \n  “The more important evidence for the prosecution would be from other witnesses and sources that reveal what the defendant knew with respect to the threat the child posed, and whether he had a gun,” the professor said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/travel/halloween-decorations-st-jude-fundraiser","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"09:00:00-04:00","title":"This Veteran’s Halloween Spirit Gave Him a New Purpose.

His backyard display of plastic skeletons, initially themed as a house under siege by a skeleton army, gained attention and inspired a fundraising initiative for St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. After a local news report highlighted the emotional impact of his display—especially when a St. Jude family thanked him in tears—Robertson created a Facebook group called 'Skeletons for St. Jude' to expand the campaign.

The result? $1 million for kids suffering with cancer \n       \n  By Krista Bo Polanco, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:00 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Jeff Robertson didn’t take Halloween decorations seriously until 2020, when he wanted to make his kids smile during the pandemic.\n \n\n   \n  Every year since, his yard in Holly Springs, North Carolina — and hundreds more across the country –— has been full of plastic skeletons of all sizes for a haunting but heartwarming cause, raising  more than $1 million  for St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.\n \n\n   \n  That first year, with his windows boarded up, the display’s theme was a house under attack by what Robertson called a “skeleton army” scaling the walls.\n \n\n   \n  When a local news crew covered it, the 54-year-old father of two and Army veteran saw a chance to do more than entertain.\n \n\n   \n  “I asked my kids how we could use that attention to help others,” he told CNN. “My son and daughter said, ‘Hey, let’s help St. Jude. We want to help sick children get out of the hospital so they can see all these neat Halloween decorations.’”\n \n\n   \n  So the family printed a simple sign on their front yard that said in part: If you like what you see, feel free to donate to St. Jude – a leading children’s hospital for kids with cancer and other diseases.\n \n\n   \n  Within days, Robertson said a car pulled up with an emotional couple and their young daughter in the backseat. The tearful father told Robertson that they’re a St. Jude family and wanted to thank him for raising money for pay for treatment for families like them.\n \n\n   \n  Robertson didn’t get their names and they never saw each other again. But that encounter changed everything for him.\n \n\n   \n  “I’d been looking for purpose after retiring from the service,” he said. “This little girl was going through such a tough time, but she saw these goofy plastic skeletons in my yard, it put her in an awesome place.”\n \n\n   \n  The family raised  over $8,000 in 2020  – and the next year, Robertson created a Facebook group called Skeletons for St. Jude to spread the idea nationwide.\n \n\n   \n  This spooky season, the group has more than 5,000 members, and over 1,000 partner homes across the country have joined the cause and raised funds. On October 21, they officially hit the $1 million mark.\n \n\n   \n  Robertson’s neighborhood in North Carolina looks forward to his epic display every year with scores of visitors stopping by every day all month long to soak in the skeleton spectacle.\n \n\n   \n  It takes Robertson a whole year to plan the theme and build new props. He’s accumulated 100 or so toy skeletons that he keeps in storage, and he adds onto the display every day until Halloween — so there’s always something new for visitors to see.\n \n\n   \n  This October, skeletons are sailing on a 25-foot phantom pirate ship that Robertson has positioned so it appears to have crashed through the first and second stories of his house.\n \n\n   \n  “The real focus isn’t on me,” Robertson said. “It’s on the thousands of people giving five or ten dollars here and there. That’s what made this a success.”\n \n\n   \n  Robertson is grateful knowing this money will help families focus on getting their kids better. And he says those families are motivating him to raise another $1 million in half the time.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/sport/college-football-coach-buyouts","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"09:22:00-04:00","title":"The money does not exist: Why the buyouts for college football coaches are setting off alarm bells","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article examines the growing financial crisis in college football caused by massive, guaranteed buyouts for fired head coaches, with over $169 million in liabilities across 10 FBS schools since September 2024.

\nUpdated: \n        9:22 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The placard attached to the podium read “Protecting the most vulnerable,’’ but on this particular Wednesday Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry took aim at a very specific apex predator: Big-time football.\n \n\n   \n  The governor, who was supposed to be talking about  food stamps that are nearing a crisis point due to the government shutdown , instead launched a verbal grenade directed squarely at the Louisiana State University Athletics Administration Building – aimed more specifically at the desk of athletic director Scott Woodward.\n \n\n   \n  Calling out not just the lack of success under football head coach Brian Kelly but the $53 million bill LSU now has to foot to give the coach his walking papers, Landry publicly defrocked Woodward, making it clear that the man in charge of LSU athletics would not be making the biggest hire for LSU athletics.\n \n\n   \n  “My role is about the fiscal effect of firing a coach under a terrible contract,’’ Landry said after being asked about his role in Kelly’s dismissal after reports indicated discussions about the dismissal went all the way to the governor’s mansion.\n \n\n   \n  “I care about what the taxpayers are on the hook on, and I was not happy about raising ticket prices while we were having a losing season and we were paying a coach $100 million and not getting results.’’\n \n\n   \n  He wasn’t done there.  Landry told ABC  on Thursday that he plans to have the state’s attorney general review the next head coach’s contract “to understand what the extent under which the state is ultimately liable.”\n \n\n   \n  The remarks drew plenty of eye rolls. This is Louisiana, where Huey Long used his own gubernatorial position to influence LSU football nearly a 100 years ago. Pigskin and politics regularly mix.\n \n\n   \n  But in this case, Landry’s public tongue lashing resounded well beyond the reaches of the bayou, earning nods of approval in plenty of other far-flung circles of college athletics.\n \n\n   \n  “Finally, someone said it out loud,’’ said a board of trustees member at another institution. “This is so irresponsible.’’\n \n\n   \n    Buyout season\n \n\n   \n  LSU, after all, is not alone.  Since Oklahoma State fired Mike Gundy  on September 23 through Kelly’s dismissal one month later, 10 FBS schools have ousted their head coaches. Combined the coaches are owed $169 million, all coming at a time when college athletics is facing unprecedented costs.\n \n\n   \n  In June, U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken approved the $2.8 billion settlement coming from the so-called House settlement, requiring colleges to directly share revenue with their athletes. The estimated House payouts this year is $20.5 million. That will only go up annually.\n \n\n   \n  It has left plenty of university administrators equal parts dismayed and disgusted at what they believe is nothing shy of fiscal malfeasance, with schools hamstrung by deals presented as security blankets for the university but offering only protection for the coaches.\n \n\n   \n  “No one is flying the plane,’’ a board member at one of the schools affected said. “There’s not even a plane. It’s a hot air balloon. Whatever way the wind blows, that’s the way college sports go.’’\n \n\n   \n  That college football is spending at an unprecedented pace is not new news. Arguing a very expensive need to keep up with the Joneses (or maybe more accurately the Sabans and Meyers) to succeed, coaches long have asked for bigger, better and more.\n \n\n   \n  Facility one-upsmanship, all in the name of attracting better recruits, led to practice facilities with mini-golf courses (Clemson), marble showers in the locker room (Oregon) and sensory deprivation tanks (Georgia). Then came more staff – to run the analytics and sports performance and nutrition and, in some cases, the head coach. Texas has not one, not two but three special assistants to the head coach.\n \n\n   \n  Finally, when simply ballooning coaching contracts was no longer enough, the deals also had to be guaranteed, lest another school poach your leader.\n \n\n   \n  At the start of the season, nine head coaches were making more than $10 million annually, according to the USA Today head coaches database, and 12 had buyouts totaling more than $40 million, topped by Kirby Smart’s $105 million owed should Georgia decide to can him.\n \n\n   \n  Except now, as some of those bills come due at the same time revenue sharing comes into existence, the very real question is no longer an existential crisis. Just where is the money coming from?\n \n\n   \n  “I have no idea,’’ said another board member at an affected school. “The money does not exist.’’\n \n\n   \n  That startling and yet very real revelation flies in the face of what has long been the presiding sentiment about college football: That it is the big money meal ticket for an athletics department.\n \n\n   \n  For years it was not bottom-line accurate —rare was the department that ran in the black – but at least true in theory. Thanks to TV rights packages and tens of thousands of fannies in the seats on fall Saturdays, college football did draw the biggest paycheck.\n \n\n   \n  Except somewhere along the line the spending steamrolled ahead of the profits.\n \n\n   \n    ‘No one has the answer’\n \n\n   \n  Consider two of the schools on the hook for two of the biggest coaching buyouts: Penn State, which owes  James Franklin $49 million  and LSU, on the hook for $53 million for Kelly.\n \n\n   \n  According to the KnightNewhouse College Athletics Database, in the last 10 years Penn State’s football spending has jumped 113% but the entire department’s revenues have grown only 83%. At LSU, football spending jumped 44% and revenues just 40%.\n \n\n   \n  In the same decade, football coaching salaries (the entire staff) jumped 106% in State College and 90% in Baton Rouge while ticket sales only added an additional 33% and 37% respectively and donor contributions jumped 53% and 66%.\n \n\n   \n  The money owed can be mitigated. Most contracts include what are called best efforts clauses, which means the ex-coach can’t hole up in Cabo and get his entire paycheck. He has to look for a job, and should he land one, the salary owed will be less the salary gained.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s like being divorced and paying alimony,’’ one of the board members joked. “You’re rooting for them to get remarried.’’\n \n\n   \n  But it is not simply the head coaches that need to be paid out.  The Advertiser i n Louisiana reported that offensive coordinator Joe Sloan, fired along with Kelly, is due $530,000. Penn State defensive coordinator Jim Knowles reportedly is in the first year of a three-year deal worth $3.1 million annually and offensive coordinator Andy Kotelnicki is making $2.4 million. It will be up to the next coach – who, by the way, will not come at a bargain-basement price – to decide if they stay on.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile Penn State last year was on the hook for more than $900,000 in football coaching severance per the KnightNewhouse database, presumably due to Mike Yurcich, Kotelnicki’s predecessor who was fired in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  Penn State athletic director Pat Kraft, who through a spokesperson declined comment for this story, has insisted that Franklin’s buyout is “an athletics issue. This is not the institution’s issue. We in athletics are covering the costs.”\n \n\n   \n  But from where? “No one has the answer,’’ one of the board members said.\n \n\n   \n    No signs of stopping\n \n\n   \n  Still, the race to the top of the money pile goes on.\n \n\n   \n  A pitch to turn to private equity for the Big Ten has at least temporarily stalled, in large part because of pushback from conference members USC and Michigan. Deep-pocketed donors are now being asked to foot the bill for coaching salaries, facilities improvements and – thanks to the House settlement – player contracts.\n \n\n   \n  Virginia Tech recently announced a planned $229 million investment in athletics over the next four years. Along with seeking donor support for $30 million of that annually, the university said there will be “limited increases in student fees.’’ In 2024, student fees generated $14.5 million for the athletic department.\n \n\n   \n  “That deal should terrify boards everywhere,’’ one of the trustees said.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the logic gleaned from the accounting books arguing to the contrary, spending is showing no signs of stopping.  Curt Cignetti has done wonders  at Indiana, elevating a program that ranked somewhere below historically dormant to No. 2 in the nation.\n \n\n   \n  He has coached 21 games at Indiana – 21 at the FBS level entirely. And last week the school inked him to an eight-year, $93 million deal. It’s all guaranteed.\n \n\n   \n  And less than 24 hours after the governor undercut Woodward at LSU, the athletic director was, to no one’s surprise, negotiating his exit strategy from the school. That leaves the school without a university president (William Tate left in May to take the same position at Rutgers), no football coach and no athletic director.\n \n\n   \n  According to Yahoo Sports, Woodward is owed somewhere in the neighborhood of $6.4 million. The school is expected to honor the terms – another buyout on the Bayou.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/europe/dutch-centrist-d66-party-election-wins-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"08:52:00-04:00","title":"Dutch Centrist D66 Party Confirmed as Election Winner, ANP Says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the Dutch general election of October 31, 2025, the centrist, pro-EU D66 party won the most votes, narrowly edging out the far-right Freedom Party (PVV) led by Geert Wilders.

9:07 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Iran appears to be stepping up the rebuilding of its ballistic missile program, despite the reintroduction last month of  United Nations sanctions  that ban arms sales to the country and ballistic missile activity.\n \n\n   \n  European intelligence sources say several shipments of sodium perchlorate, the main precursor in the production of the solid propellant that powers Iran’s mid-range conventional missiles, have arrived from China to the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas since the so-called  “snapback” mechanism  was triggered at the end of September.\n \n\n   \n  Those sources say the shipments, which began arriving on September 29, contain 2,000 tons of sodium perchlorate bought by Iran from Chinese suppliers in the wake of its  12-day conflict with Israel in June . The purchases are believed to be part of a determined effort to rebuild the Islamic Republic’s depleted missile stocks. Several of the cargo ships and Chinese entities involved are under sanctions from the United States.\n \n\n   \n  The deliveries come after more-than-a-decade-old UN sanctions were restored by the snapback mechanism – a provision for Iranian breaches of the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) deal to monitor its nuclear program.\n \n\n   \n  Under the sanctions re-imposed on Tehran last month, Iran shall not undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. UN member states must also prevent the provision to Iran of materials that could contribute to the country’s development of a nuclear weapons delivery system, which experts say could include ballistic missiles.\n \n\n   \n  States are also required to prevent the provision to Iran of assistance in the manufacture of arms. China, along with Russia, opposed the reimposition of the sanctions, saying it undermines efforts for a “diplomatic settlement of the Iranian nuclear issue.”\n \n\n   \n  While the shipped substance – sodium perchlorate – is not specifically named in UN documents on materials banned for export to Iran, it is a direct precursor of ammonium perchlorate, a listed and prohibited oxidizer used in ballistic missiles. However, experts say that the sanctions’ failure to explicitly prohibit the chemical may leave China room to argue that it is not in violation of any UN ban.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has followed the journeys of several cargo ships identified by the intelligence sources as being involved in the latest deliveries of sodium perchlorate from Chinese ports to Iran, using ship tracking data and the social media of their crew. Many of those vessels appear to have gone back and forth several times between China and Iran since the end of April. The sources say their crew seem to be employed by the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines and their regular social media posts provide a trail of their stops on the China to Iran journey.\n \n\n   \n  Among them is the MV Basht, already sanctioned by the US, which left the Chinese port of Zhuhai on September 15, arrived in Bandar Abbas on September 29 and since returned to China.\n \n\n   \n  Planet Labs satellite images provided to CNN by the Middlebury Institute of International Studies confirm that the Barzin was being loaded with cargo at Gaolan Port, China, on October 1, before departing for Iran. The images then show the Barzin docked at Rajaei Port in Bandar Abbas, Iran, from October 16 to October 19, where it was being unloaded.\n \n\n   \n  The Elyana left the Chinese port of Changjiangkou on September 18 and arrived in Bandar Abbas on October 12. Finally, the MV Artavand left the Chinese port of Liuheng and arrived in Bandar Abbas on October 12, with its AIS tracking system turned off to deliberately obscure its movements, according to Western intelligence.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not clear if the Chinese government is aware of the shipments. In response to a question from CNN about the transactions, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that, while he was “not familiar with the specific situation,” China has “consistently implemented export controls on dual-use items in accordance with its international obligations and domestic laws and regulations.”\n \n\n   \n  “We want to emphasize that China is committed to peacefully resolving the Iranian nuclear issue through political and diplomatic means and opposes sanctions and pressure,” the spokesperson continued, adding that Beijing viewed the return of sanctions under the snapback mechanism as “unconstructive” and a “serious setback” in efforts to “resolve the Iranian nuclear issue.”\n \n\n   \n  Similar shipments had previously been reported, but their intensification since the 12-day war – when the Israeli military targeted at least a third of the surface-to-surface launchers that fire Iran’s medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs) – suggests a renewed eagerness on the part of the Islamic Republic to arm itself.\n \n\n   \n  “Iran needs much more sodium perchlorate now to replace the missiles expended in the war and to increase production. I would expect large shipments to Iran as it tries to rearm, just as I would expect Israel and the US to race to replace the interceptors and munitions that were expended,” said Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Project at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies.\n \n\n   \n  The best way to consider the current moment, he told CNN, is as a pause in hostilities, as each side seeks to rearm.\n \n\n   \n  “Two thousand tons of sodium perchlorate are only enough for about 500 missiles.  That’s a lot, but Iran was planning on producing something like 200 missiles a month before the war and now must replace all the missiles that either Israel destroyed or it used,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    Long-standing ties\n \n\n   \n  China has long been a  diplomatic and economic ally  for sanctions-hit Iran, decrying “unilateral” US sanctions against the country and buying up most of Iran’s oil exports, despite not reporting purchases of Iranian oil for several years.\n \n\n   \n  That energy trade relies on a network of vessels that filter Iranian oil to independent refineries in coastal China, often through intermediary countries, according to analysts, who note this practice keeps refinement separate from Chinese state-owned enterprises that would be vulnerable to US sanctions. These so-called teapot refineries are known to work with what’s often referred to as a dark fleet of tankers that use concealing tactics to smuggle sanctioned goods.\n \n\n   \n  European security sources believe a similarly opaque system, involving front companies that are little more than fake numbers and billing addresses, has been used to keep the sodium perchlorate flowing to Iran. As have more legitimate companies, including two already sanctioned by the US back in April for their part in a “network procuring ballistic missile propellant ingredients on behalf of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).” Most of the companies involved are based in the northeastern Chinese port city of Dalian, according to information from the intelligence sources.\n \n\n   \n    Earlier shipments\n \n\n   \n  In February, CNN  reported the shipment  of 1,000 tons of sodium perchlorate to Iran from China. By April, the US had slapped sanctions on several Iranian and Chinese entities, including vessels believed to play a role in “a network procuring ballistic missile propellant ingredients on behalf of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).”\n \n\n   \n  Yet the shipments continued, the intelligence sources say, with the IRGC’s Self Sufficiency Jihad Organization acquiring another 1,000 tons of sodium perchlorate which left Taicang in China aboard the Hamouna on May 22 and arrived in Bandar Abbas on June 14 or 15. It set sail for the Iranian port less than a month after a massive explosion there on April 27, believed to have been caused by sodium perchlorate, killed 70 and wounded hundreds.\n \n\n   \n  The latest shipments represent much bigger quantities in a short space of time. The first of the 10 to 12 shipments that European intelligence sources have been tracking arrived in Iran on September 29, two days after the snapback mechanism – triggered in August by Germany, France, and the United Kingdom, the European partners to the JCPOA – restored UN sanctions. The others all left China after the sanctions were in place.\n \n\n   \n  Tong Zhao, a senior fellow with the nuclear policy program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said that China’s position on the legal status of the reimposition of sanctions may be related to how its authorities would view such shipments.\n \n\n   \n  “First and foremost, China – along with Russia and Iran – has denounced the legality of the snapback in a joint letter to the UN issued on October 18, indicating that Beijing likely does not consider itself bound by the reimposed measures,” according to Zhao.\n \n\n   \n  Had the snapback not been triggered, October 18 would have marked the official end of the 10-year JCPOA, at which point the option to reimpose previous UN sanctions and restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program would expire and the Security Council would close Iran’s nuclear file.\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, China joined with Russia in September to push for a six-month extension of the JCPOA, arguing that more time was needed for diplomatic efforts and pointing to what Beijing saw as signs that Iran wanted to engage with the international community on regulating its nuclear program. The UN Security Council  voted down  the China-backed resolution in September, one day before the snapback came into force.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing was one of the six countries – along with France, Germany, Russia, the UK and the US – that signed the JCPOA with Iran in 2015. In a meeting between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian in September, Xi reiterated China’s stance that it “attaches importance to Iran’s repeated pledge that it does not seek to develop nuclear weapons” and “respects Iran’s right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy.”\n \n\n   \n  Zhao also pointed to the fact that the export of sodium perchlorate is not explicitly banned under the pre-JCPOA sanctions regime that is now back in force. What the reinstated UN resolutions do prohibit, he added, is the provision by member states to Tehran of “items, materials, equipment, goods, and technology” which could contribute to Iran’s development of a nuclear weapon delivery system.\n \n\n   \n  So, while sodium perchlorate is not named, it “should fall under the broader catch-all controls on materials used in solid-fuel missile production,” he said, but noted that the fact that it is not explicitly prohibited may leave China and other countries with greater room for interpretation.\n \n\n   \n  “Beijing may be aware that such exports indirectly support Iran’s missile program,” Zhao said, “yet it may also view this as a matter of principle – asserting China’s sovereign right to make independent export-control decisions on items not expressly banned by the UN.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Simone McCarthy contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/food/wendys-problems-third-quarter-earnings-preview","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-04:00","title":"What’s wrong with Wendy’s?","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Wendy’s is facing a severe downturn in stock performance and sales, having lost nearly 50% of its value this year, with same-store sales projected to fall 5.8% in Q3 2025.

\n       \n  By Jordan Valinsky, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  For a logo with a trademark grin, Wendy’s has little to smile about nowadays.\n \n\n   \n  The burger chain’s stock has lost nearly 50% of its value this year. Wendy’s executive suite has contended with several departures, and it’s currently operating without a permanent CEO after its previous leader abruptly left after just a year-and-a-half on the job. Plus, a confusing mix of promotions hurt sales last quarter.\n \n\n   \n  “We are not happy with our sales performance,” Ken Cook, Wendy’s CFO and interim CEO, bluntly admitted on its most recent earnings call in August.\n \n\n   \n  The fast food industry is in a slump, and Wendy’s isn’t immune. Chief rivals McDonald’s and Burger King also reported sluggish sales earlier this year as consumers cut back spending. However,  both rebounded  over the summer and fall thanks to an increased focus on marketing and targeted promotions.\n \n\n   \n  Not so much for Wendy’s.\n \n\n   \n  US sales at stores open at least a year in the third quarter are forecast to fall 5.8% when the company reports earnings next week, according to Jim Salera, a research analyst for Stephens. That’s even worse than the 3.6% decline in the previous quarter.\n \n\n   \n  “Investors are really focusing on when the company can get same-store sales trends moving back in the right direction and we had seen little progress of that,” Salera told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Wendy’s is being forced to take action, recently announcing an aggressive turnaround plan that aims to reignite sales. However, revitalizing a 55-year-old chain is not easy.\n \n\n   \n  McDonald’s, which has nearly triple the number of locations in the United States, found recent success with new deals and  menu items . McDonald’s recent growth has also eaten away at some of Wendy’s market share.\n \n\n   \n  Wendy’s sits in a “more of an elevated position where it’s not just focused on price,” Salera said, and is focused on quality. After all, the chain prides itself on its “fresh, never frozen” tagline for its patties, which has been  in use since its founding in 1969 .\n \n\n   \n  “But as consumers that are trading down or in some cases just trading out entirely and just skipping (fast food) occasions, McDonald’s is leading a lot more with price than an operator like Wendy’s,” he   added.\n \n\n   \n    Back to square one\n \n\n   \n  Wendy’s recently announced a  “comprehensive strategic plan”  called “Project Fresh,” under the guidance of former Taco Bell CEO Greg Creed.\n \n\n   \n  “Wendy’s board of directors and management team are dissatisfied with the current valuation of the company and have been working to put the company on the right path to create value for our franchisees, employees and shareholders,” said Art Winkleback, chairman of Wendy’s board, in an October 9 press release.\n \n\n   \n  Plans include refreshed marketing to remind customers of its “rich heritage of quality, innovation and unique voice.” The company also intends to help franchisees improve profits and increase investments in restaurant technology, like digital menus, to “enhance the customer experience.”\n \n\n   \n  BTIG analyst Peter Saleh, however, doesn’t think Wendy’s plan is “tackling the root of the problem” and that its “issues go far deeper than some marketing changes or some menu adjustments.”\n \n\n   \n  Rather, he said that Wendy’s problems stretches back more than a decade to   a  remodel initiative  of its US restaurants that was meant to modernize the chain. Instead, the final product was “watered down a lot” from its initial plan because of several leadership changes.\n \n\n   \n  “Wendy’s is now starting to talk about kind of a multi-year plan to install digital menu boards, which have been around for over a decade,” Saleh told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  For comparison, around the same time, McDonald’s  remodeled a vast majority  of its US restaurants, adding digital kiosks and refreshed interiors. The work was largely completed by 2020.\n \n\n   \n  “The biggest problem (Wendy’s) have is not their food … it’s (their restaurants) are old and tired,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Salera agreed that Wendy’s has a “solid offering” with its food. The chain recently relaunched its chicken tenders to  capitalize on the trend  for crispy chicken, and he complimented the  revamped Frosty  offerings to establish it as a “unique Wendy’s asset.”\n \n\n   \n  He said that the brand’s plan of “focusing and skimming down the number of promotions or limited-time offers is a positive (move),” especially after the variety of deals in the “100 Days of Summer” promotion proved to be  too complex  for customers to understand.\n \n\n   \n  Additional details of Wendy’s plan will be revealed during its November 7 earnings call.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/media/disney-youtube-deal-biz-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"07:30:00-04:00","title":"Disney channels go dark on YouTube TV after media giants fail to resolve carriage dispute","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Disney has removed its channels — including ESPN, ABC, Disney Channel, FX, National Geographic, and Freeform — from YouTube TV following a failed negotiation over carriage fees.

channels have been﻿ removed from YouTube’s pay-TV platform after the two media giants failed to reach a new carriage agreement before Thursday’s midnight deadline passed.\n \n\n   \n  The blackout will leave subscribers unable to watch content from Disney networks, including ESPN, ABC, Disney Channel, FX, National Geographic and Freeform.\n \n\n   \n  The two companies remain in talks, although neither company indicated when customers can expect programming to resume.\n \n\n   \n  “Unfortunately, Google’s YouTube TV has chosen to deny their subscribers the content they value most by refusing to pay fair rates for our channels, including ESPN and ABC,” a Disney spokesperson told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “Without a new agreement in place, their subscribers will not have access to our programming, which includes the best lineup in live sports — anchored by the NFL, NBA, and college football, with 13 of the top 25 college teams playing this weekend.”\n \n\n   \n  In its own  statement , Google said the decision “directly harms our subscribers while benefiting their own live TV products, including Hulu + Live TV and Fubo.”\n \n\n   \n  “We know how disruptive it is to lose channels you enjoy, and we’re committed to continuing to work with Disney to reach an agreement,”  YouTube TV said on X  late Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  The blackout should come as little surprise to YouTube TV subscribers, who for the last week have seen announcements warning of a stalemate.  Since last Thursday , Disney has run public messages notifying YouTube TV customers of a possible blackout.\n \n\n   \n  At its core, this has been a showdown over financials.\n \n\n   \n  Disney wants higher carriage fees to reflect the value of its networks, such as ESPN. “We invest significantly in our content and expect our partners to pay fair rates that recognize that value,” a Disney spokesperson told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, YouTube  has said  Disney’s demands would “raise prices on YouTube TV customers and give our customers fewer choices.”\n \n\n   \n  The Disney battle is just the latest in a series of media showdowns this year for YouTube. The streaming giant has recently inked eleventh-hour deals with  Paramount ,  Fox  and  NBCUniversal .\n \n\n   \n  A  standoff with Televisa Univision  led to a blackout, with  President Donald Trump weighing in  on behalf of the Spanish-language broadcaster, which has publicly warmed to Trump in recent years.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/style/maurizio-cattelan-america-gold-toilet-sothebys","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"06:33:00-04:00","title":"How much would you pay for an infamous gold toilet?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article discusses the notorious gold toilet sculpture titled 'America' by artist Maurizio Cattelan, which was first exhibited in the Guggenheim Museum in 2016 and later stolen from Blenheim Palace in 2019.

Though the perpetrators  were convicted earlier this year , the fully functional, opulent toilet, titled “America,” was never found, believed to be cut up or melted down for the value of the gold itself, worth millions.\n \n\n   \n  But that isn’t the end of the saga for the satirical sculpture, which was once offered to President Donald J. Trump during his first term, in lieu of a Van Gogh painting requested by his administration (the counteroffer was  reportedly ignored) .\n \n\n   \n  Cattelan has previously stated he had made more than one edition of “America,” and now a second edition is making an unexpected, flashy debut on the art market next month.\n \n\n   \n  Sotheby’s in New York will sell the work, which has been in private (and anonymous) hands since 2017, on November 18. That also means the sculpture will be back on public view for a limited time, when the auction house installs it in the fourth-floor bathroom of its brand-new headquarters for 10 days leading up to the sale. This time, however, visitors will not be able to use it, per Sotheby’s. Officially that’s for security reasons, though one can guess why else.\n \n\n   \n  “The door will remain open,” said David Galperin, Sotheby’s head of contemporary art, laughing.\n \n\n   \n  Auctions typically have a set starting bid, informed by a number of market factors, as well as low and high sales numbers, estimated ahead of time. But the sale for this “America” will be worth its weight in gold — quite literally — as the starting figure will be its inherent value, fluctuating with the gold market right up until bidding begins. That will be somewhere in the $10 million range, according to the current value (with the price of gold lately  setting record highs ), plus whatever collectors deem its ascribed value to be.\n \n\n   \n  “The starting bid in accordance with the price of gold was really a way to lean into the very essence of the conceptual basis behind the artwork, which is largely to draw attention to the difference between a work’s artistic value, and a work’s inherent material value,” Galperin explained.\n \n\n   \n  It’s a “perfect foil” to Cattelan’s other equally infamous banana-on-a-wall, “Comedian,” which  sold for $6.24 million at Sotheby’s last fall , Galperin added. The duct-taped banana, worthless without Cattelan’s association, first debuted at Art Basel Miami on a bare white wall, originally priced at $120,000.  It has been eaten more than once .\n \n\n   \n  “If ‘Comedian’ was all about the intangibility of value and how we ascribe value to works of art, ‘America’ challenges that a step further by being in so many ways, intrinsically valuable, in a manner that so many works of art are not.”\n \n\n   \n  “America” is many things: a wry comment on the art world and the United States, as well as an object of torment for arts publicists and their lofty press statements. (The Guggenheim once described it as an opportunity for “unprecedented intimacy with a work of art.”) And this edition may actually be the only physical one in existence, according to Sotheby’s. Though the work is an edition of three, the auction house does not believe the third has been fabricated.\n \n\n   \n  Beyond the sculpture’s dramatic history, Galperin said “America” is an important 21st-century artwork, one with a direct lineage to landmark Modern art (see: Marcel Duchamp’s 1917 upside-down urinal “Fountain”), but with critical relevance to today.\n \n\n   \n  “Cattelan, for his entire career, has critiqued the system,” Galperin said, “whether it’s the viewers’ experience seeing art in a museum, the way that works of art move through the system, the way that they’re valued, the way that they change hands.\n \n\n   \n  “All of these concepts are things that artworks so rarely confront head on. His ability to do that and do it in such a legible way and impactful way is part of its success here.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/trump-nuclear-weapons-testing-experts-russia","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-04:00","title":"Trump says he wants to resume nuclear testing.

Here’s why experts are confused \n       \n  By Tom Foreman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A ghost of the Cold War is rising between the world’s superpowers, just in time for Halloween.\n \n\n   \n  In the wake of Russian President Vladimir Putin bragging about his country testing both a nuclear-powered torpedo and a new cruise missile, the president of the United States, Donald Trump, has fired back. In a lengthy post on his  Truth Social platform , Trump announced, “Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis. That process will begin immediately.”\n \n\n   \n  Now ,  nuclear watchdogs worldwide are wondering  what might come of Trump’s pronouncement  — and what he even means since the US hasn’t conducted a nuclear weapons test in decades.\n \n\n   \n  “First of all, every statement in that post is wrong,” said Matthew Bunn, a nuclear weapons expert at Harvard University. “It’s not true the United States has the world’s most nuclear weapons. It’s not true that other states are carrying out nuclear tests. (Trump) seems to think it’s the Department of Defense that carries out nuclear tests. It’s not. It’s the Department of Energy.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s own nominee to head the US Strategic Command seemed unclear of the president’s intent as he faced the Senate Armed Service Committee in a confirmation hearing Thursday. “Neither China nor Russia has conducted a nuclear explosive test,” Navy Vice Adm. Richard Correll said, “so I’m not reading anything into it or reading anything out.”\n \n\n   \n  The Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation defines nuclear tests as “generally controlled explosions of nuclear devise, such as bombs or warheads,” and Russia’s missile and torpedo tests do not meet that strict definition. \n \n\n   \n  What’s more, Jon Wolfsthal, who advised both Joe Biden and Barack Obama on nuclear matters, notes other nations are already conducting similar tests – along with the US. “Russia, the United States, China are all investing tens of billions of dollars on new nuclear delivery platforms – missiles, bombers, submarines,” Wolfsthal said. “We have returned to the arms race dynamics of the Cold War where each side believes nuclear weapons are important.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, if Trump truly wants to resume nuclear weapons testing, analysts say the complications are deep and wide. For starters, almost every nuclear-capable country in the world has voluntarily agreed to avoid such tests for decades. Russia ran its last test in 1990, the US in 1992 and China in 1996. North Korea is the only nation to conduct nuclear blasts this century, and that has contributed to Pyongyang’s status as an international pariah.\n \n\n   \n  Beyond the diplomatic risk of standing up a fresh set of tests in the US, there are technical challenges. Federal studies have shown staging such a test safely would likely require several years of preparation, and even then, it might yield little useful information. The US routinely tests nuclear weapons components so thoroughly that America is widely seen as holding a treasure trove of nuclear knowledge unmatched by any other country.\n \n\n   \n  Critics say if Trump ushers in a new era of testing, that will only open the door for any other nation with nuclear dreams to start catching up.\n \n\n   \n  “The country that would benefit the most would be China,” Bunn said.\n \n\n   \n  “It makes no sense from a strategic point of view for the United States,” said former Democratic congressman John Tierney, who now heads the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation.\n \n\n   \n  Nuclear weapons experts note that both Russia and China have stepped up their nuclear aspirations already. Some political analysts speculate that Trump is hoping to back them down with tough talk, a notion he seems to echo. “I’d like to see a denuclearization,” the president said. “We’re actually talking to Russia about that, and China would be added to that if we do something.”\n \n\n   \n  Neither the Defense Department nor the White House has offered a more complete explanation of the plan as of yet.\n \n\n   \n  But Tierney finds the president’s constantly shifting talk troublesome, to say the least. He fears in an already tense international environment, Trump is injecting more instability – which can prove explosive in its own way.\n \n\n   \n  “One day he wants everyone to get rid of their nukes,” Tierney says. “The next day he wants to start testing? It’s dangerous.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/entertainment/antoni-porowski-sexual-health","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"06:00:00-04:00","title":"Antoni Porowski Says Conversations Around Sexual Health Don’t Have to Be Awkward","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Antoni Porowski, best known as a member of 'Queer Eye,' emphasizes the importance of open and non-awkward conversations about sexual health, especially around STIs and HIV prevention.

awkward \n       \n  By Dan Heching, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:00 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Many years before he became the resident foodie and one fifth of the makeover dream team on “ Queer Eye ,” Antoni Porowski already had no problem having important and frank conversations.\n \n\n   \n  “I learned about STIs probably before I hit puberty,” he told CNN in a recent interview.\n \n\n   \n  When Porowski later called out his physician father   for broaching the subject of sexually transmitted infections when he was quite young, his dad’s response was, “Well you know what, you had to know and you were going to find out at some point anyway.”\n \n\n   \n  Porowski – whose mother, sister and grandfather also have medical backgrounds – grew up around science and having conversations about health, sexual and otherwise, and he says he feels privileged to have had that access to helpful information early on. It’s one of the reasons he’s partnering with pharmaceutical company Gilead to promote HIV prevention and having open discussions about sexual health.\n \n\n   \n  “The more you talk about it, anything that’s uncomfortable, the less precious it becomes. It loses its power,” Porowski said.\n \n\n   \n  Porowski’s involvement in the  campaign  comes at a time of  unprecedented  cutbacks on DEI programs, which among many other things contain efforts designed to help people realize and achieve sexual wellness through access to pre-exposure prophylaxis (or PrEP, drugs that prevents HIV infections, which are produced by companies including Gilead) and other information. Analysis of federal data by the  New York Times  in May found that Donald Trump’s administration had scrapped more than $800 million worth of research into the health of LGBTQ+ people.\n \n\n   \n  “With all of these unfortunate initiatives, I think it pushes us more towards stigmatization, because it helps fuel the taboo and negative understandings and perceptions of a lot of things,” Porowski said.\n \n\n   \n  “Often as we’re seeing in culture right now and in politics, the things that a lot of certain people are afraid of, they end up turning (it) into anger, and it then flips to taking away or minimizing rights because they just don’t get it,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  For Porwoski, the current political landscape and its challenges present an opportunity to “keep talking about this even more than we did.”\n \n\n   \n  “Because as much progress as we’ve made – progress isn’t linear, as I’m learning with a lot of things, especially politically,” he said. “The key for anything that is misunderstood or misperceived, I think it’s an opportunity to have a conversation about it.”\n \n\n   \n  Part of his understanding comes from his involvement on “ Queer Eye ,” which will soon premiere its tenth and final season. The show has long focused on the ongoing conversations between queer and non-queer people, and their efforts to understand one another.\n \n\n   \n  “People who we’ve met on the show who definitely leaned more on the conservative side knew us as concepts, before meeting us,” he said. “They have their ideas of what it’s like to be queer and that was it.”\n \n\n   \n  The way past that, he said, was to help them “realize that we’re someone’s kid.”\n \n\n   \n  To “get to know the person as an individual and not a concept” is “a good blanket statement for any type of intolerance or lack of embracing of diversity in our culture,” Porowski said.\n \n\n   \n  Making connections and having meaningful conversations is ultimately what Porowski comes back to, for both learning the value of tolerance and arming oneself with information for better health by having those meaningful conversations with a doctor.\n \n\n   \n  “Talk to a physician, ask the questions, that’s literally what they’re there for,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Porowski says that while he had the “great gift of being raised around science and trusting it,” he knows there are others who weren’t and don’t.\n \n\n   \n  He urges those people “who sit on the other end of the spectrum, of not trusting it” to “just shut up and put your curiosity hat on and ask questions.”\n \n\n   \n  “Ask things that you’re genuinely curious about, so that you can educate yourself,” he said. “I think we all have a responsibility to educate ourselves.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/americas/jamaica-hurricane-melissa-black-river-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"05:35:00-04:00","title":"'Hell on Earth': Ravaged by Hurricane Melissa, this once-vibrant Jamaican town is now in desperate need of help","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Black River, Jamaica, has been devastated by Hurricane Melissa, which brought a storm surge of up to 16 feet, flooding homes and infrastructure, resulting in at least two deaths.

But kids are shouting it for good reason \n       \n  By Scottie Andrew, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:38 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Not since 69 has a number caused this much disruption.\n \n\n   \n  “6-7,” pronounced “ six-seveeeeen ,” is haunting school halls across the country (including  South Park Elementary ), making it the Gen Alpha nonsense phrase of the moment. Kids are shouting it in classrooms when a teacher turns to page 67, when lunchtime is 6 to 7 minutes away or for no reason at all. It’s become  so  ubiquitous that Dictionary.com  named  it the word of the year.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s like a plague — a virus that has taken over these kids’ minds,” said Gabe Dannenbring, a seventh-grade science teacher in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. “You can’t say any iteration of the numbers 6 or 7 without having at least 15 kids yell, ‘6-7!’”\n \n\n   \n  It’s a joke without a punchline (or a setup, for that matter). 6-7 means nothing, but using it can make a student feel like a member of a bigger, cooler group of their peers.\n \n\n   \n  “It becomes a language game to them that, it would seem, only folks in their group know how to play,” said Gail Fairhurst, a University of Cincinnati professor who teaches leadership communication (and Gen Alpha speak).\n \n\n   \n   Skibidi toilets  and  rizzes  come and go. 6-7 is likely destined for the slang graveyard soon, now that adults are talking about it so much. But there’s something almost profound about its infinite interpretations, its refusal to be defined.\n \n\n   \n  “I think that’s part of what upsets people about it, and I think that’s part of what people like about it,” said Taylor Jones, a  linguist  and social scientist.\n \n\n   \n    An attempt at explaining 6-7 (but don’t worry, no one knows what it means)\n \n\n   \n  There may be no coherent explanation for 6-7, but here goes anyway: The number appears in the chorus of “Doot Doot (6 7),” a viral  song  by the Philadelphia rapper Skrilla. (In Skrilla’s case, according to Jones, 6-7 is likely a reference to the 10-67 police code, which is often used to report a death.)\n \n\n   \n  In December 2024, around the same time “Doot Doot” started taking off, high school basketball phenom Taylen Kinney appeared to create a gesture to accompany the phrase. In a  clip  shared by his Overtime Elite team, Kinney’s teammate asks him to rate a Starbucks drink out of 10.\n \n\n   \n  “Like a 6 … 6 … 6-7,” he says, adding an indecisive gesture, as though he were weighing two options in his palms.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly thereafter, Kinney started incorporating the song and gesture into his  TikToks , where he has over 1 million followers.\n \n\n   \n  The song started appearing in  sports highlight reels , including those for Charlotte Hornets point guard LaMelo Ball. (He stands at  6 feet, 7 inches , natch.) Ball  doesn’t seem annoyed  by the memes yet, but the NBA season hasn’t officially started, so there’s still time.\n \n\n   \n  A face of 6-7 emerged in March, when a  video  caught a young, overexcited spectator at an amateur basketball game shouting “6-7!” with the accompanying hand gesture. He became the embodiment of that annoying classmate who can’t stop spouting nonsense phrases. Somehow, the internet decided this stereotype’s name was Mason — and thus, Mason 67 has become another inside joke. (This “Mason” character has since become an icon of online analog horror,  per  Know Your Meme, but that’s another story.)\n \n\n   \n  So, if a kid uses any of the above explanations when you ask what the heck 6-7 is, they’re probably right. But most kids don’t even know where it came from, Dannenbring said.\n \n\n   \n  “Nobody knows what it means,” he said. “And that’s kind of the funny thing about it.”\n \n\n   \n  Its meaninglessness is partly due to what Jones calls “semantic bleaching,” where a phrase is divorced from its original context and comes to mean something entirely different (or, in this case, nothing).\n \n\n   \n  Using 6-7 comes down to a willingness to have fun, Jones said: “Do you have a little bit of whimsy? Or are you a party pooper?”\n \n\n   \n    Kids scream ‘6-7’ to belong (and that’s cool)\n \n\n   \n  Sure, it’s nonsense, but 6-7 serves a critical social function. It’s a shibboleth, or a phrase that signifies that one belongs to an “in” group, Jones said. People who don’t say it or get it are on the outs. And what kid doesn’t want to belong?\n \n\n   \n  “Language is a way for people to form community,” said Fairhurst. “Even if it’s a nonsense term, if they seem to know what it means, that can be a unifying force. And if somebody isn’t understanding the term, it can exclude people from that community, as well.”\n \n\n   \n  6-7 has also survived longer than other internet nonsense words — even that pesky “skibidi” — likely because “grown-ups are so angry about it,” Jones said.\n \n\n   \n  “The fact that you can get a big reaction from somebody for something just totally meaningless — that might give it longer longevity than it might otherwise have,” Jones said.\n \n\n   \n  Fed-up teachers are banning it from their classrooms or making exasperated TikToks about the number of times they’ve heard it in a single school day (for Dannenbring, the  record is 75 ). Shouting “6-7!” after it’s forbidden becomes a “way to show resistance,” said Fairhurst.\n \n\n   \n  Teachers are now playing defense by using 6-7 themselves. A Michigan middle school choir teacher successfully staved away cries of “6-7” by  incorporating  it into a warmup song that also includes “slay,” “Ohio” and “ rizz .”\n \n\n   \n  “Don’t scream at me … even though you get excited,” the teacher begs her class before they begin chanting “6-7, 6-7, 6-7, skibidi,” a chorus of little cringe cherubs.\n \n\n   \n  When instructing his students to open their textbooks to page 67, Dannenbring will suddenly adopt the timbre of his enthusiastic seventh graders, who immediately protest their teacher using a phrase that does not belong to him. (At 27, Dannenbring is an elder member of Gen Z. But a young teacher is still a teacher, and, therefore, too old to play.)\n \n\n   \n  “If you don’t play into it, yeah, it’s super disruptive,” Dannenbring said. “If you acknowledge it, then it gets over with in about 15 seconds.”\n \n\n   \n  And if  that  doesn’t shut down the conversation, he said he uses it incorrectly on purpose: “‘That’s so 6-7 of you.’”\n \n\n   \n  “The easiest way to kill it is for teachers to say that it’s cool,” Jones said.\n \n\n   \n  Comedian Josh Pray has started using it in front of his kids, working it into his  videos , desperate to reclaim a formerly innocuous number.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m trying to take our numbers back!” he said. “I’ll be 67 before they know it, and I don’t want to hear that specific tone all around me as a taunt to my age!”\n \n\n   \n    Maybe ‘6-7’ isn’t brainrot after all (you were a dumb kid, too)\n \n\n   \n  Fear not, parents — incessantly screaming “6-7!” is not enough to prove that your children are “ brainrotting .” Concerns about literacy falling and critical thinking skills diminishing are legitimate, but they’re being “projected onto normal, youthful behavior,” Jones said.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re rewriting our own history,” Jones said. “This is not anywhere near being a new phenomenon.”\n \n\n   \n  Every generation invents its own slang, and language evolves in ways most of us will never consciously perceive, Jones said. Kids will always come up with cool new phrases (like  “cool”! ), and adults will be left scratching their heads in confusion.\n \n\n   \n  Nonsense phrases like this aren’t inherently harmful, and 6-7 certainly isn’t going to bring about the end of the English language, Fairhurst said. But its popularity  could  be a benign symptom of our “post-truth” society, she said, where the meaning and specificity of communication matters less than people’s interpretation of it.\n \n\n   \n  “It seems like it’s sort of a relative of that kind of phenomenon, where we’re just using language to use language, and not because we see something particularly meaningful or particularly real about it,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps 6-7 is already on its way out — it’s survived for nearly a year, essentially a century in TikTok time. Some of Dannenbring’s students are starting to roll their eyes when they hear their classmates yelling it. Middle school teacher and comedian Philip Lindsay said he’s already hearing potential replacements in his classroom — “41,” for one, another similarly meaningless number that makes kids inexplicably giggle.\n \n\n   \n  “41 was started to try and dethrone 6-7,” Lindsay said. “6-7 just happened. 41 was pushed.”\n \n\n   \n  The way Dannenbring sees it, slang can get a lot worse than 6-7. Past trends have inspired students to stick pencils into their school-issued laptops to set them on fire or rip sinks straight off the walls of their school bathrooms.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve had those words before, like Skibidi toilet,” he said. “This one is  significantly  less annoying.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/poll-closing-times-election-results","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"06:10:00-04:00","title":"When polls close in Tuesday’s elections and when to expect results","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"This election night marks a pivotal moment in U.S. politics, with key races in Virginia, New Jersey, New York City, and California.

CNN\n \n   \n  Lamar Jackson made an emphatic return to  NFL  action on Thursday Night Football, throwing four touchdown passes to lead his Baltimore Ravens to a 28-6 win over the Miami Dolphins.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson had missed the past three Ravens games with a hamstring injury, with Baltimore struggling in his absence.\n \n\n   \n  But with the two-time NFL MVP back in the lineup, the Ravens looked much more like themselves, piling up 338 yards of offense, 229 coming in the second half.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson connected on touchdown passes to Rashod Bateman, Charlie Kolar and twice to Mark Andrews.\n \n\n   \n  And while he didn’t look as explosive when he chose to run the ball, the 28-year-old’s return seemed to open up the running game in general, with the team racking up 150 yards on the ground, including 119 for Derrick Henry on 19 carries.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s awesome,” Jackson afterwards. “It’s great to be back and get a dub.”\n \n\n   \n  It was the Dolphins, coming off a big win last week against the Atlanta Falcons, who took the lead in the first quarter with a field goal before Jackson capitalized on a fumble by Tahj Washington, connecting with Andrews for their first touchdown of the game.\n \n\n   \n  Baltimore extended its lead in the second quarter with Andrews’ second touchdown reception of the game, capping off an eight-play, 75-yard scoring drive.\n \n\n   \n  A Miami field goal just before halftime did reduce the deficit but the Dolphins failed to make any further inroads on offense after halftime, with Baltimore adding 14 points in the third quarter to ease to victory.\n \n\n   \n  “I just felt a little comfortable and our guys were ready to score,” Jackson – who finished with 204 yards on 18-of-23 passing – said. “Shoutout to the offensive line. They did great.\n \n\n   \n  “All phases, all skill positions, and our running backs, those guys were just locked in and wanted to put points on the board because we only scored twice in the first half.”\n \n\n   \n  In what was Jackson’s first action since September 28, he continued his excellent record against the Dolphins. The Florida native now has 1,405 passing yards, 18 passing touchdowns, one interception and a 142.9 passer rating in five starts against Miami, the highest by any single player (minimum 100 attempts) vs. a single opponent in history,  per NFL Research .\n \n\n   \n  His return to the field is timely for Baltimore which has now won two in a row to keep its season alive, improving to 3-5 on the year.\n \n\n   \n  The Ravens still face an uphill battle to make it to the postseason, but with Jackson back at the helm, that journey seems a little easier.\n \n\n   \n   According to the NFL , only four teams since the 1970 merger have made the playoffs after starting a season 1-5. But, since 1990, 21 teams have made the postseason with a 3-5 opening.\n \n\n   \n  For the Dolphins, it was another crushing defeat as they slip to 2-7 and the pressure ramps back up on head coach Mike McDaniel after their big win over Atlanta last time out.\n \n\n   \n  Like many of their games this season, the loss to the Ravens was punctuated by self-inflicted errors – Washington’s first-quarter fumble gave excellent field position to Baltimore, a false start by Larry Borom on fourth-and-1 ended a promising drive, Riley Patterson missed a close field goal and Malik Washington also fumbled in the fourth quarter.\n \n\n   \n  Miami produced its best performance of the season in Week 8 against the Falcons but Thursday’s outing will do nothing to quiet the talk around McDaniel’s future.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/style/fondation-beyeler-chanel-culture-fund","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"05:26:00-04:00","title":"Swiss art museum appoints first-ever botanical curator, backed by Chanel Culture Fund","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Fondation Beyeler in Switzerland has appointed Swiss academic Rahel Kesselring as its first-ever botanical curator, a role supported by the Chanel Culture Fund.

CNN\n \n   \n  The Fondation Beyeler, home to one of western Europe’s leading modern and contemporary art collections, is turning its gaze toward a novel type of gallery — its own gardens.\n \n\n   \n  Located near Basel, Switzerland, the museum has long been a popular cultural attraction for its art as well as its scenic setting. Designed by Pritzker Prize–winning architect  Renzo Piano , the flat-roofed, single-story gallery in Riehen is gently nestled among centuries-old trees and mossy lily ponds, surrounded by green fields and vineyards, at the edge of Germany’s Black Forest.\n \n\n   \n  Since opening nearly 30 years ago, the Fondation Beyeler has hosted many site-specific artworks that engaged directly with its natural environment. In 1998, the late artist  Christo  wrapped 178 trees on the property in fabric, and, more recently,  Olafur Eliasson  removed part of the building’s facade to effectively bring one of the outdoor ponds into the gallery itself. The Icelandic artist used a non-toxic dye to give the water a neon glow, describing the work as a “model for a future landscape where human and non-humans can live together” more harmoniously.\n \n\n   \n  This week, the institution is announcing a groundbreaking new role. In what is believed to be the first of its kind at a major art museum, the Fondation Beyeler has appointed Swiss academic Rahel Kesselring as its inaugural botanical curator. Her role will focus on the preservation of the site’s flora and fauna and on developing public programming within its gardens.\n \n\n   \n  The position — officially, the Chanel botanical curator — is supported by the Chanel Culture Fund, a philanthropic arm of the French luxury house that backs innovative cultural projects and initiatives around the world.\n \n\n   \n  Kesselring explained that her mission is to strengthen the dialogue between art and nature. “Plants are enormously important for our culture,” she said in a video interview. “They sustain us…we live in a world that has been fully built by plants. We have a deep connection to them, physically, culturally and historically.”\n \n\n   \n  Museum director Sam Keller called the appointment a reflection of the institution’s ethos. “Nature is not a backdrop to our work, but a living part of it,” he said in a statement. “This role affirms our commitment to caring for the whole ecology of this place with the same depth, imagination and responsibility we bring to everything we do.”\n \n\n   \n  Kesselring’s appointment  presents a new model for arts institutions — expanding the idea of curatorial expertise beyond the white walls of a gallery and into the living landscape.\n \n\n   \n  With the symptoms of climate crisis increasingly felt by people and businesses, including those within the art world, the Fondation Beyeler is making a statement by putting ecological stewardship on par with artistic curation. Kesselring hopes it will inspire broader change or, at least, more public engagement. “We need to rewrite our understanding of our relationship with nature,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Yana Peel, the president of arts, culture and heritage at Chanel, said during a video call that with no brick-and-mortar cultural institutions of its own (as is common for many luxury brands), the company has focused on contributing to others — seeking out ways to create impact on a project-by-project basis.\n \n\n   \n  “We have specifically not been sponsoring galas or parties or short-term projects,” she said, explaining that they want to focus on “transformational” work that is entirely non-transactional and not aimed at selling Chanel products. The initiative is about “wanting to have a positive impact on the world,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Chanel did not confirm how long it would be funding Kesselring’s role at the foundation but it’s understood to be a multi-year partnership, in keeping with the fund’s wider mission to focus on longer-term projects.\n \n\n   \n  Established five years ago, the Chanel Culture Fund has invested in 50 projects across 15 countries. Chanel is working with the Power Station of Art in Shanghai to support a significant renovation of the institution’s third-floor gallery, including the addition of the first contemporary art library in China, with the capacity to house 50,000 books. In Brazil, the fund partnered with the Pinacoteca de São Paulo on a new annual residency program to support women artists. And in the US, the organization is funding the Chanel Center for Artists and Technology at CalArts in Southern California.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/world/sudan-massacres-rsf-rebels-darfur-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"06:06:00Z","title":"Rebels Accused of Massacring Hundreds in Sudanese City as Videos of Atrocities Emerge","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In October 2025, multiple videos and satellite imagery confirm that the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) committed mass killings in El Fasher, Sudan, after seizing control of the city.

of people as videos emerge of atrocities and bodies in Sudanese city \n       \n  By Ivana Kottasová, Vasco Cotovio, Nada Bashir, Gianluca Mezzofiore, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:26 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  An elderly man sits on the floor, dozens of bodies lying around him, before a Sudanese rebel fighter approaches and shoots him.\n \n\n   \n  The apparent killing – captured on video shared online by the rebels themselves – took place at a university medical school in El Fasher in Sudan’s western Darfur region after the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF)  took over the city  on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has identified the location of the massacre as El Fasher University’s School of Medical Laboratory Science, just across the street from the Saudi Hospital where, according to reports cited by the World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday, more than 460 people were also killed.\n \n\n   \n  The Sudan Doctors Network, a professional organization, said the RSF “cold-bloodedly killed everyone they found inside the Saudi Hospital, including patients, their companions, and anyone else present in the wards.”\n \n\n   \n  Satellite images of the Saudi Hospital show signs of a massacre, with apparent clusters of bodies and blood-stained ground clearly visible.\n \n\n   \n  Reports of RSF fighters committing large-scale massacres began to emerge within hours of the Sudanese military’s  withdrawal from El Fasher  earlier this week.\n \n\n   \n  Those accounts have been corroborated by mounting evidence that includes videos and photos from the ground, survivor testimonies and satellite images.\n \n\n   \n  RSF chief Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, also known as Hemedti, acknowledged Wednesday that there had been “violations” in El Fasher, and said an investigative committee would be launched to investigate and “hold accountable any soldier or any officer who committed a crime.”\n \n\n   \n  In a separate statement, the RSF denied claims of killings at the hospital, describing them as “fabricated narratives with no connection to reality,” despite mounting evidence of atrocities.\n \n\n   \n  The grisly events in El Fasher come over two and a half years into a brutal civil war that has claimed the lives of more than 150,000 people.\n \n\n   \n  On one side is Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the country’s military ruler and the head of the Sudanese armed forces (SAF); on the other is Hemedti, the RSF chief and onetime al-Burhan deputy. The two men launched a coup together in 2021 before a power struggle between them descended into all-out war in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  The United Nations and the United States have both said the RSF and the SAF have committed war crimes and have faced western sanctions.\n \n\n   \n  The UN told CNN it believes about 120,000 people, half of them children, were trapped in El Fasher, which was the Sudanese army’s last stronghold in Darfur and had been under siege by the RSF for 18 months.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, then US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, during the Biden administration,  accused the RSF of committing genocide  against non-Arab ethnic groups in Darfur, saying there was evidence the group systematically murdered “men and boys – even infants – on an ethnic basis” and that it “deliberately targeted women and girls from certain ethnic groups for rape and other forms of brutal sexual violence.”\n \n\n   \n  Few eyewitness testimonies have emerged from El Fasher since its fall to the RSF. But humanitarian workers who’ve spoken to survivors fleeing the city related stories of summary executions and rapes, streets strewn with bodies and men and boys being prevented from leaving.\n \n\n   \n  Multiple videos shared online over the past three days show RSF fighters rounding up and killing large numbers of unarmed people. CNN was able to match the insignia worn by the fighters in several of the videos to the one used by the RSF.\n \n\n   \n  Most of the videos appear to have been filmed and shared by the rebels themselves.\n \n\n   \n  One video shows an unarmed man in civilian clothes on the ground, pleading for his life before a man addressed as commander.\n \n\n   \n  The fighter is seen shooting him multiple times. Dozens more bodies are clearly visible in the video.\n \n\n   \n  Another video shows at least eight men dressed in civilian clothes sitting on the ground next to each other before being killed in a quick succession.\n \n\n   \n  Several videos show executions and RSF fighters celebrating next to bodies by a berm, a raised bank of earth that was built around El Fasher during the siege to trap people inside the city.\n \n\n   \n  Other videos show armed RSF fighters driving through large swaths of land, apparently hunting civilians who are attempting to flee. In one video, the rebels are heard saying “catch the girls.”\n \n\n   \n  Conflict-related sexual violence has been reported by human rights groups as a major problem in Sudan and multiple humanitarian workers have told CNN that women and girls who have managed to escape El Fasher in recent days were victims of sexual violence and rape.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has geolocated several of the videos showing jubilant RSF forces inside El Fasher. Satellite images analyzed by the Humanitarian Research Lab at Yale School of Public Health and verified by CNN show clear evidence of the atrocities in El Fasher.\n \n\n   \n  Groups of bodies appear to be visible in satellite images of areas where RSF killings have been reported in recent days.\n \n\n   \n  The Yale researchers also say they have identified reddish patches on the ground consistent with blood in several locations, including outside the Saudi Hospital and near the berm around the city.\n \n\n   \n  The bodies and the reddish stains are only visible in the satellite images taken on Monday and Tuesday, after the RSF takeover.\n \n\n   \n  “The Rapid Support Forces have surrounded this city in an earth wall called a berm that’s as high as nine feet,” said Nathaniel Raymond, executive director of the Research Lab.\n \n\n   \n  “So the context here is these people are inside what we call a Kill Box. They have been walled in to be killed systematically, and right now the Rapid Support Forces are doing that,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Survivors fleeing the violence have told aid groups of summary executions and mass killings.\n \n\n   \n  Adam Rojal, the spokesperson for the General Coordination for Displaced Persons and Refugees in Darfur, told CNN he left the besieged city two weeks ago. He said that civilians are currently not allowed to leave and that the situation is “appalling.”\n \n\n   \n  “(People who fled) tell horrific stories about the suffering and abuses they have subjected to. The property of citizens has been confiscated, there are floggings, and attacks. I have seen the execution videos,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Manal bint Abi Suleiman, who fled El Fasher after the RSF takeover, said the attack on the area where she was sheltering started on Saturday. “The Rapid Support Forces entered and destroyed everything in front of them,” she said in a video testimony filmed by a volunteer helping refugees.\n \n\n   \n  “On the way, they harassed the people and beat some of them. They separated the young men from the women, and I don’t know where they took the men. God knows where they are now,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  In videos shared online, several other survivors have also referenced killings of both men and women and bodies lying in the streets.\n \n\n   \n  Save the Children’s deputy country director for Sudan, Francesco Lanino, told CNN that survivors who reached a refugee camp in Tawila in southern Darfur described the extreme danger they faced as they fled.\n \n\n   \n  “All the areas surrounding El Fasher are controlled by different militias, or different armed groups that are related to RSF or somehow part of RSF,” Lanino said.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not only RSF who are looking for civilians, looking for people to (rob), to abuse or kill,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The RSF has been supported by Arab groups and militias from across the Sahel region as well as the  Russian paramilitary group Wagner .\n \n\n   \n  The Sudanese government has also accused the United Arab Emirates of arming the group. The UAE has repeatedly denied the accusation, despite an expert panel appointed by the UN Security Council finding in a January 2024 report that the allegations were “credible.”\n \n\n   \n    Fears for the missing men\n \n\n   \n  The UN’s humanitarian team in Sudan said on Tuesday it has received “credible reports of widespread violations, including summary executions, attacks on civilians along escape routes, house-to-house raids and obstacles preventing civilians from reaching safety,” adding that “sexual violence, particularly against women and girls, continues to be reported.”\n \n\n   \n  Arjan Hehenkamp, the Darfur crisis lead for the International Rescue Committee, told CNN that many of the people fleeing El Fasher are in a “deplorable state.”\n \n\n   \n  “Many of them are sick and wounded… there’s many women, many elderly, but a big gap in terms of young men and adult men,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Hehenkamp spent several weeks at Tawila, providing help to people fleeing.\n \n\n   \n  “The big concern that we have right now is, where is the rest of the population of El Fasher? We haven’t seen the big numbers that we were expecting so far. So that is very disturbing,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Lanino told CNN that some 5,000 people managed to reach his team in Tawila in recent days.\n \n\n   \n  “The majority of these people coming from El Fasher are women and children. And according to their stories, the men are kidnapped or were killed on the way coming to Tawila because of their ethnic group, because they were men, and they were somehow stopped and targeted,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Sheldon Yett, UNICEF’s lead in Sudan, told CNN that violence has soared in the days following the RSF’s takeover.\n \n\n   \n  He said he’d spoken to women who fled El Fasher who said their male relatives were all either killed or detained by RSF.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking to CNN from the eastern city of Port Sudan after returning from an area near Darfur where people are seeking safety, Yett said the stories shared by survivors were “blood-curdling.” There were groups of women arriving alone, saying their male relatives have been killed or detained, he added.\n \n\n   \n  “(Fighters are) going house to house, raids, people being dragged out, just the most horrific stories. People are being held (to) ransom. They’re being told, basically, you pay or you die, call your relatives, get the money together,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The Sudan Doctors Network said that six medical staff, including four doctors, a pharmacist and a nurse, have been kidnapped by RSF fighters who are now demanding 100 million Sudanese pounds ($166,000) for each of them.\n \n\n   \n  The group has appealed to international organizations, including WHO, to intervene and “exert maximum pressure on RSF to release” the abductees.\n \n\n   \n  As more reports of alleged atrocities pour in, multiple international organizations, world leaders and human rights groups have called for an immediate ceasefire and quick independent investigations into the killings.\n \n\n   \n  Yett said that the fact that the fighters are filming themselves killing civilians and posting these videos online shows “a feeling of lack of accountability.”\n \n\n   \n  “We need to ensure there’s clear accountabilities here. I mean all violations of international law need to be investigated. We need to hold people accountable,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/economy/us-government-shutdown-economy-snowball","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"05:30:00-04:00","title":"As the shutdown drags on, here’s how it can drag down the economy","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The ongoing federal government shutdown, now the longest on record, is severely impacting the U.S. economy.

Employers, frozen by high economic and policy uncertainty, have held off making investments and adding workers. Some businesses have used this period to test the waters on  artificial intelligence  and other technologies – in turn putting to the test that “low-fire” descriptor by announcing mass layoffs in recent weeks.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re not creating any jobs of consequence, really,” Zandi said.\n \n\n   \n  Considering that backdrop, the tepid job gains can potentially turn into deeper job losses if safety nets become frayed, more paychecks are missed by federal workers and contractors, and spending pullbacks reverberate through the private sector, causing businesses to lay off workers or shut down, he said.\n \n\n   \n  A US Chamber of Commerce analysis released this week estimated that 65,500 small business contractors have billions of dollars in payments at risk because of the shutdown — $12 billion in payments for the month alone.\n \n\n   \n  Rate cuts and some greater clarity around trade deals and tariffs were supposed to fuel a rebound in hiring heading into 2026, noted Nicole Bachaud, labor economist at employment site ZipRecruiter.\n \n\n   \n  “However, tariffs are projected to dampen consumer spending before year’s end, and a prolonged shutdown could further erode consumer confidence,” she wrote in a note earlier this month. “This would delay hiring plans that might otherwise materialize, keeping the labor market stuck in place.”\n \n\n   \n  US consumer confidence during October dipped to its lowest level since April, when President Donald Trump announced a massive suite of steep tariffs on imported goods, according to The Conference Board’s latest index released this week.\n \n\n   \n    Health care and the care economy\n \n\n   \n  The expiration of the enhanced premium subsidies for Affordable Care Act coverage is at the  crux of the Congressional stalemate  to fund the federal government and end the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats are demanding that a short-term funding package include an extension of the enhanced assistance, while  Republicans say they won’t negotiate  until the government reopens.\n \n\n   \n  Open enrollment starts on November 1, and the more than 22 million Americans who use the federal health insurance marketplace are  expected to see their monthly premium leap  by 26% on average, according to a KFF analysis.\n \n\n   \n  Also on November 1, more than 65,000 children and families in 41 states and Puerto Rico are at risk of  losing access to Head Start programs , which provide early education and child development resources to low-income households.\n \n\n   \n  Any center closures could quickly increase financial hardship for lower-earnings families. Child care disruptions have been shown to  negatively impact labor force participation  (particularly  for women ), productivity growth and overall economic growth.\n \n\n   \n    Spending\n \n\n   \n  The lengthier the shutdown, the higher the probability for a greater drag on overall economic activity, said Joe Brusuelas, RSM US chief economist.\n \n\n   \n  “And this isn’t economic activity that is just deferred or delayed, you’re now creating a condition of economic activity that just simply doesn’t happen,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  There’s the job that doesn’t get filled, the trip that doesn’t get taken and the holiday spending that doesn’t occur.\n \n\n   \n  “At some point, things start to break because they’re just not getting done,” added Zandi, of Moody’s Analytics. “When this thing really metastasizes and takes out the broader economy is when it starts to affect confidence – consumer, business, investor confidence – the stock market takes notice and instead of going straight up, it starts to wobble and starts going down.”\n \n\n   \n  If the shutdown continues past Thanksgiving, “there’s no coming back from that quickly,” he said, adding that once it passes that “point of no return,” it will cause “damage that’s longer-lasting.”\n \n\n   \n  Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of US economic activity. It has remained  largely resilient , despite massive uncertainty and persistently high inflation.\n \n\n   \n  However, it’s likely done so because of an increasingly bifurcated, or  “K-shaped” economy . Wealthy consumers, buoyed in part by strong market gains, are driving more of the spending while lower- and middle-income households are facing increased strain.\n \n\n   \n    Prices and interest rates\n \n\n   \n  A drawn-out shutdown could inject further “crosscurrents” into an already  choppy price environment , Zandi said.\n \n\n   \n  On one hand, disruptions to government services and funding could affect trade and supply chains, driving up prices. On the other hand, a weakened economy would mean it’s harder for companies to raise prices, which could help keep overall inflation in check.\n \n\n   \n  “The net of all that, I think, is hard to know,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Still, the shutdown and its economic fallout could give the Federal Reserve one more reason to  continue cutting interest rates , he added.\n \n\n   \n  “The Fed’s putting a higher weight at this point on the weak job market than they are on inflation or financial conditions,” he said. “This [shutdown] would weaken the already fragile job market more.”\n \n\n   \n    The human impact\n \n\n   \n  The shutdown could very well exacerbate those struggles for many Americans, especially people on the margins.\n \n\n   \n  Most Americans are “not taking any solace from the fact that AI stocks are going stratospheric; they’re focused on having to make their credit card payment or the student loan monthly payment,” Zandi said. “The economy is fragile and, therefore, something like a government shutdown could become a bigger problem a lot faster than people might think so.”\n \n\n   \n  A lack of funding for safety net programs,  particularly the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program , could not only exacerbate hunger and hardship for tens of millions of Americans, but also threatens to destabilize local economies, especially in rural areas.\n \n\n   \n  “It just adds insult to injury on an economy that was already showing some cracks,” KPMG economist Swonk said. “Low- and middle-income households are really struggling, and inequality tends to stoke political divisions as well as political backlash. So, this is just feeding in to already a not very comfortable situation that we are in.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s hard when you see the struggles we’re already facing, but this is a man-made problem,” she added.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/business/k-shaped-economy","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"This burrito is everything you need to know about America’s economy","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the 'K-shaped' economy, where wealthier Americans continue to spend freely due to strong stock market performance, home appreciation, and job security, while lower-income consumers face financial strain from inflation, stagnant wages, and job insecurity.

To understand how both of those things can be true, consider the burrito.\n \n\n   \n  Chipotle on Wednesday reported miserable earnings and cut its sales-growth forecast for the third-straight quarter. The culprit: Young and lower-income consumers (Chipotle’s core customers) are cutting back on their spending, and they’re starting to skip the guac.\n \n\n   \n  Chipotle CEO Scott Boatwright on the company’s earnings call: “We’re not losing them to the competition; we’re losing them to grocery and food at home. And so, that consumer is under pressure. It is one of our core consumer cohorts. And so, they feel the pinch and we feel the pullback from them as well.”\n \n\n   \n  Boatwright said the company’s customer surveys showed many believed Chipotle was no longer affordable. People in households that bring in less than $100,000 a year drive about 40% of Chipotle’s sales.\n \n\n   \n  Another problem: 25- to 34-year-olds, who make up 25% of Chipotle’s sales, “pulled back meaningfully.”\n \n\n   \n  “I think there’s a component of a more discerning consumer, and I think most of it – the majority of it – is this massive pullback,” Boatwright said. “That household under $100,000 a year is pulling back.”\n \n\n   \n  At the same time, some consumers are spending like they’re from a completely different universe.\n \n\n   \n  Crocs CEO Andrew Rees noted that bifurcation on a call with analysts Thursday: “There is a portion of our North American consumers that are highly affluent. They’re buying Crocs, they’re buying other high-end brands and they are in great financial shape,” Rees said. “But there is a large portion of consumers who are nervous, they are in less-good financial shape and are being super cautious about their spending and certainly spending closer to need.”\n \n\n   \n  Or take Coke (to wash down your burrito). Coca-Cola’s Chief Operating Officer Henrique Braun on a call last week with analysts said Coke’s earnings were boosted by strong demand for the company’s premium brands: Topo Chico, Smartwater and Fairlife.\n \n\n   \n  But Braun highlighted a successful two-pronged corporate strategy, noting the tough environment for lower-income consumers hasn’t changed – despite the growth in its high-end brands. That’s why Coke is also cutting sizes (and prices) on the lower end to drive sales – to “really tackle not only affordability but premiumization as well,” Braun said.\n \n\n   \n  “When we look from a consumer point of view, we continue to see divergency in spending between the income groups,” Braun said. “The pressure on middle- and low-end income consumers is still there.”\n \n\n   \n    The ‘K-shaped’ economy\n \n\n   \n  Economists call that phenomenon a “ K-shaped ” economy: Wealthier people are spending like nothing’s wrong. Lower-income people are making significant changes to preserve their finances.\n \n\n   \n  Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell  addressed that concept  Wednesday in a media briefing.\n \n\n   \n  “On the K-shaped economy … if you listen to the earnings calls or the reports of big public consumer-facing companies, many, many of them are saying there is a bifurcated economy there and that consumers at the lower end are struggling and buying less and shifting to lower-cost products,” Powell said. “But at the top, people are spending, at the higher income and wealth.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s not all anecdotal: Last month, Moody’s Analytics reported that the country’s top earners  are accounting for a growing share of overall spending .\n \n\n   \n  What’s causing that divide?\n \n\n   \n  Wealthier Americans are generally invested in the surging stock market, which has gained 17% this year. They have more job security than lower-income workers. And they own homes, which  keep appreciating  in the tight-supply market.\n \n\n   \n  By contrast, less-affluent Americans are living paycheck to paycheck, and their wages aren’t keeping up with inflation. If they lose their jobs, the cruddy labor market is preventing them from finding a new one – the number of Americans on unemployment insurance for multiple weeks recently surged to a  four-year high . And rents, until recently, had jumped as demand for rentals explodes – because so few homes have been on the market.\n \n\n   \n    What happens next?\n \n\n   \n  A K-shaped economy can be difficult to repair. America’s economy has been increasingly bifurcated for quite some time – with the exception of a few years following the pandemic.\n \n\n   \n  During those post-pandemic years, government support for workers gave lower-income Americans a leg up. For the first time in a generation, the wealth gap narrowed.  Wages outpaced inflation , especially for lower-income workers. Interest rates were low, and homeowners refinanced like crazy to lock in historically low mortgage costs.\n \n\n   \n  But it was short-lived. The sugar rush of government stimulus checks wore off, and the economy resumed its previous trajectory. Mortgage rates rose to multi-decade highs. And, concerning for people who are getting left behind, the US government began pushing safety-net programs in the opposite direction, reducing benefits and increasing hurdles to access support.\n \n\n   \n  Those actions could widen that “K” in the future. Wider than you have to open your mouth to eat a Chipotle burrito.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/china/xi-trump-us-china-deal-analysis-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"04:50:00-04:50","title":"After Trump Trade Meeting, It’s Advantage Xi","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following a brief but pivotal meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping at Gimhae International Airport in South Korea, a temporary truce in U.S.-China trade tensions was reached.

4:50 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As the dust begins to clear around a  less-than-two hour meeting  between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and President Donald Trump at an airbase in South Korea on Thursday, it’s clear that China’s leaders have stacked up another win for their hardball strategy with the United States.\n \n\n   \n  The meeting did not secure a broad trade deal, but rather a return to an uneasy truce built on a handful of agreements meant to keep the relationship steady as the two sides move toward one.\n \n\n   \n  Xi walked away with a 10% reduction in 30% tariffs newly imposed by Trump on Chinese goods this year – in exchange for   ramping up efforts to control its role in the US fentanyl crisis. He also secured US agreement to put on hold a new rule that would have vastly expanded the number of Chinese companies blacklisted from buying sensitive American tech.\n \n\n   \n  Trump averted Beijing imposing an expanded set of restrictions that could have hamstrung global industries reliant on China’s rare earths minerals. China will also ramp up purchases of US soybeans and other agricultural products, US officials said. Both sides also paused port fees targeting each other’s shipping sectors and will extend a truce on more elevated tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  On paper, it looks like a reasonable exchange – and one that delivers, at least for now, what both leaders (and the wider global economy) wanted: stability after a tumultuous year of sparring between the world’s economic heavyweights.\n \n\n   \n  But for Beijing, the agreements – which came with a side of effusive praise from Trump for Xi – are also a clear confirmation of the success of its strategy in how to handle Trump 2.0.\n \n\n   \n  That’s because Beijing has been able to win valuable concessions on tariffs and export controls, while primarily conceding measures they only put out as retaliation against those from the US in the first place.\n \n\n   \n  Take soybeans, a key American export that saw Chinese purchases plunge this year over trade frictions.\n \n\n   \n  China agreed to purchase a minimum of 25 million metric tons of American soybeans annually for the next three years, US agricultural secretary Brooke Rollins  said  after the talks.\n \n\n   \n  But that baseline is still 1.8 million metric tons less than China’s soybean purchases last year, before the tensions, according to  US data .\n \n\n   \n  China’s highly nationalistic and censor-curated internet clocked all this on Friday, when social media commenters praised how “China really nailed this tariff war,” and observed that “Trump finally dealt with the mess Trump created.”\n \n\n   \n    China’s game plan\n \n\n   \n  The outlook is not all rosy for China.\n \n\n   \n  Even as tariffs from this year’s US trade spat have been whittled down to 20%, Chinese exporters still face what on average amounts to nearly 50% duties on their goods, with pre-existing duties factored in. That rate remains among the highest imposed on any country by the US. Washington meanwhile has seen  real progress  on its goal to narrow their trade deficit.\n \n\n   \n  And, while the deal has yet to be inked, Beijing may have made some true concessions on the fate of the social media app TikTok, after changing its tune on staunch opposition to a US law requiring the app’s Chinese owner ByteDance to sell its US business.\n \n\n   \n  China also remains blocked from accessing the highest-end US chips, a key weapon in the high-stakes AI race playing out between the two countries.\n \n\n   \n  But on the tech front, Beijing’s ability to push back by at least a year the new US rule which would have vastly expanded the number of Chinese companies blacklisted from buying sensitive American technologies, is a major boon for Chinese firms.\n \n\n   \n  The now-suspended US effort to close loopholes could have ensnared some 20,000 more companies than are already on the list, according to  an analysis  by business intelligence firm WireScreen.\n \n\n   \n  That’s another win for Beijing’s strategy of using its near-total grip on the global rare earths supply chain as leverage against the US – a tactic it also deployed during a tariff escalation earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  And on China’s side, agreeing to defer for at least a year its expanded export control regime on rare earth minerals, which it announced as retaliation for the US blacklist expansion, is unlikely to be seen as a major setback in Beijing.\n \n\n   \n  As one Chinese scholar, foreign policy analyst Shen Dingli, told CNN earlier this month, those measures were a “nuclear” option that Beijing knew wasn’t symmetrical – “but if China doesn’t use this weapon, China has little left to bargain with.”\n \n\n   \n  Whether Xi and Trump can manage to keep the detente as they work toward a broader deal and expected visits to each other’s countries in 2026 is the next big question.\n \n\n   \n  Canada, after all, knows first-hand that a trade truce struck with Trump  can quickly collapse. \n \n\n   \n  A range of pitfalls, both foreseeable and unexpected, in the US and China’s expansive rivalry could derail the newly-reached stabilty – and whatever deal is ultimately reached is  unlikely to address the deep-seated, structural issues between the two. \n \n\n   \n  But as Trump took off from South Korea’s Gimhae International Airport on Thursday, to return to a US stuck in the quagmire of a frozen government,   Xi stayed on  to join an international summit and tout China as a beacon for globalization, it’s clear the balance of power between them has shifted.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/top-election-campaign-ads","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"The Top 10 Fall Campaign Ads of the 2025 Elections","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During the final weeks of the 2025 off-year election cycle, voters in key states like California, Virginia, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania were flooded with campaign ads highlighting critical issues such as redistricting, energy costs, personal conduct, and abortion rights.

\nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Voters in Virginia, New Jersey, California and Pennsylvania have been inundated with campaign ads this year, with each state hosting critical off-year elections that offer a preview of the issues and arguments both parties are grappling with ahead of next year’s midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  Here are the ads getting the most spending during the critical final weeks of the off-year campaigns.\n \n\n   \n   (Note: Ads are ranked by committee spending between September 1 and October 27. CNN limited the list below to one advertisement per committee.) \n \n\n   \n    1. ‘Threatens,’ from opponents of California Democrats’ redistricting\n \n\n   \n  The top ad of the fall campaign season comes from the leading group opposing California Democrats’ redistricting push, “No on Prop 50: Stop Sacramento’s Power Grab.” Funded largely by Charles Munger Jr.,  a longtime supporter  of nonpartisan redistricting and heir of legendary investor Charles Munger, the group’s ad urges Californians to “protect your vote and democracy” and “vote No on Prop 50.” About $5 million has been spent on the ad so far, according to media tracking firm AdImpact. Opponents of the redistricting push have been splintered and  many are increasingly pessimistic  about Tuesday’s election.\n \n\n   \n    2. ‘Texts’ from Jason Miyares, Virginia’s Republican attorney general\n \n\n   \n   Violent text messages  sent by Jay Jones, the Democratic nominee for attorney general in Virginia, emerged as a lightning rod in Virginia’s off- campaigns, as Republicans have leaned into sharp criticism of Jones and linked him to other Democrats. “Can you trust Jay Jones to protect your children?” asks one ad from incumbent Attorney General Jason Miyares, Jones’ Republican opponent.\n \n\n   \n    3. ‘Obama,’ from Gavin Newsom’s allied group for California redistricting\n \n\n   \n  Newsom, who has  staked significant political capital  on his state’s redistricting fight,  called in the 44th president  to help. “California, the whole nation is counting on you,” Barack Obama says in the ad.\n \n\n   \n    4. ‘Stick it to Trump,’ from Tom Steyer, backing California Democrats\n \n\n   \n  Financier Tom Steyer, a liberal mega-donor  who ran for president in 2020  and is eyeing California’s 2026 governor race,  waded into his state’s redistricting fight  earlier this month with a $12 million ad buy.  “You want to stick it to Trump? Vote yes on Prop 50,” one of his ads says. Steyer gave a boost to Democrats’ messaging campaign while also raising his profile ahead of a potential statewide run next year.\n \n\n   \n    5. ‘Predators,’ from supporters of Mikie Sherrill, Democrat running for New Jersey governor\n \n\n   \n  Sherrill’s allies are running a spot accusing GOP nominee Jack Ciattarelli of “voting against legislation that would protect children and young adults in cases of domestic and sexual violence,” according to a review of his record while serving in the state assembly compiled by  the New Jersey Independent . The ad warns, “Jack Ciattarelli should never be governor of New Jersey.” Ciattarelli’s campaign did not respond to requests for comment on the ad.\n \n\n   \n    6. ‘Day One,’ from Sherrill’s gubernatorial campaign\n \n\n   \n  One of Sherrill’s top campaign ads highlights her pledge to declare a state of emergency on utility costs on day one. Energy bills have  been a top issue  for New Jersey voters this year, with spiking utility rates and soaring demand on an aging grid. In New Jersey, residential rates have climbed by up to 20%, and the tri-state Regional Plan Association  found  that “increased demand from data centers is attributed to about two-thirds of the increased prices.”\n \n\n   \n    7. ‘Same But Worse,’ from Sherrill opponents\n \n\n   \n  Republicans, too, have honed in on energy bills as a key issue in the New Jersey’s gubernatorial race. Ciattarelli has argued Sherrill would continue policies from the outgoing administration of Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy that he says contribute to the crunch. “More of the same, but worse,” Ciattarelli’s ad argues.\n \n\n   \n    8. ‘Protect Your Rights,’ from Democrats in Pennsylvania’s state supreme court vote\n \n\n   \n  It’s been 20 years since a Pennsylvania Supreme Court justice lost a retention election. This fall,  three of the state’s liberal justices  are on the ballot. and Republicans are pressing for the chance to potentially flip the ideological balance of the battleground state high court. An ad from a Democratic group supporting the justices links the retention elections to abortion, saying the state Supreme Court is “our last line of defense.”\n \n\n   \n    9. ‘Speaking,’ from Abigail Spanberger, Democrat running for Virginia governor\n \n\n   \n  Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic nominee for governor of Virginia, has plastered voters’ screens with versions of an attack ad seizing on an unflattering moment from her rival, GOP nominee Winsome Earle-Sears. The ad splices clips of Earle-Sears declaring to a booing crowd, “I am speaking,” with criticism of Republican policies. “Winsome Earle-Sears is so far right, she’s wrong for Virginia,” the ad closes, echoing a Spanberger campaign refrain. (Earle-Sears  recently aired an ad  nodding to the “I am speaking” moment in which she says to the camera, “They pick your worst day.”)\n \n\n   \n    10. ‘Extreme Silence,’ from Spanberger opponents\n \n\n   \n  Earle-Sears and her Republican allies in the Virginia governor race have made transgender policies a focal point of their attack ads, criticizing Spanberger over her support for the Equality Act and pressing her for answers on youth sports and school bathrooms. An ad from one of the groups, Restoration of America PAC, claims Spanberger “is as extreme as it gets.” Spanberger has argued local school districts should decide their own youth participation policies.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/middleeast/israel-receives-remains-hostages-gaza-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"13:02:00-04:00","title":"Israel receives remains of two deceased hostages held in Gaza","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israel received the remains of two deceased hostages, Amiram Cooper and Sahar Baruch, held by Hamas in Gaza, via the Red Cross.

The remains were transferred to Israel via the Red Cross and taken to the country’s national forensics laboratory for identification.\n \n\n   \n  The deceased hostages were identified as Amiram Cooper and Sahar Baruch, according to a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office.\n \n\n   \n  Cooper, 84, was one of the founder of Kibbutz Nir Oz near the border with Gaza. He was kidnapped by Hamas on October 7, 2023. His family was notified in June 2024 that he was killed in captivity. The circumstances of his death remain unclear, but the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said he was was killed in captivity around February of last year.\n \n\n   \n  Cooper was the last remaining hostage from Nir Oz, one of the communities hardest hit during the initial attack two years ago, whose body had not been returned. “We will always remember Amiram as a man of people and of words, a pioneer with values, a person of initiative and ideas who so deeply loved the kibbutz and its members,” the kibbutz said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Baruch, 25, was also taken hostage during the October 7 attack from his mother’s home in Kibbutz Be’eri. Baruch’s brother and grandmother were killed in the attack. Two months later, Baruch was killed in Gaza during a failed rescue attempt. “In this difficult and painful moment, we hope the family can find a measure of comfort in the closing of a horrific circle of 755 days and nights,” the kibbutz said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Thursday’s transfer leaves the bodies of 11 deceased hostages remaining in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  “The effort to bring back our hostages continues uninterrupted and will not cease until the return of the last hostage,” the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  The transfer of the remains comes just two days after Israel carried out punishing strikes in Gaza in response to the Hamas killing of an Israeli soldier in Rafah on Tuesday afternoon. The Israeli strikes killed more than 100 Palestinians, including at least 46 children, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, marking by far the deadliest day in Gaza since the ceasefire went into effect nearly three weeks ago.\n \n\n   \n  Even so, Hamas and Israel said they were still committed to the US-brokered ceasefire agreement. The transfer of two more sets of remains from Hamas to Israel on Thursday marked the strongest indication yet that the deal had not collapsed, despite the severe test it faced just days earlier.\n \n\n   \n  US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that “nothing’s going to jeopardize” the Gaza ceasefire. He threatened to “take out Hamas very easily.”\n \n\n   \n  The latest transfer appeared to proceed without the issues that have plagued recent attempts to return the remaining deceased hostages to Gaza. Hamas announced on Tuesday it was set to hand over one set of remains before saying under Israeli bombardment hours later that it would not transfer the remains.\n \n\n   \n  On Monday evening, Hamas handed over remains of deceased hostage Ofir Tzarfati, whose body had been recovered by Israel in Gaza two years earlier. Tzarfati was not among the remaining deceased hostages to be returned under the ceasefire, prompting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to accuse Hamas of a “clear violation” of the deal.\n \n\n   \n  The IDF then released video it said showed Hamas staging the discovery of the remains in Gaza City and turning over the remains to the Red Cross. In a statement, the Red Cross said, “It is unacceptable that a fake recovery was staged, when so much depends on this agreement being upheld and when so many families are still anxiously awaiting news of their loved ones.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional development.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/style/oakland-california-museum-theft","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"11:45:00-04:00","title":"Over 1,000 Items Stolen from California Museum’s Collection in Early Morning Heist","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A major burglary occurred on October 15, 2025, at an off-site storage facility of the Oakland Museum of California, where over 1,000 historical and cultural items—including jewelry by Florence Resnikoff, Native American baskets, and 20th-century memorabilia—were stolen.

\n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:45 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  Police in California are investigating the theft of more than 1,000 items from a museum’s collection including metalwork jewelry, Native American baskets and everyday items like athletic trophies that tell the story of the Golden State.\n \n\n   \n  The burglary occurred in the early morning hours of Oct. 15 at an off-site storage facility of the Oakland Museum of California, Oakland Police said in a news release Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Lori Fogarty, the museum’s director, said Thursday the investigation was going public because the artifacts might show up at flea markets, antique stores or pawn shops.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re not just a loss to the museum,” she said. “They’re a loss to the public, to our community and we’re hoping our community can help us bring them home.”\n \n\n   \n  Fogarty said it appeared to be a crime of opportunity, and not a targeted art theft.\n \n\n   \n  “We think the thieves found a way to enter the building, and they grabbed what they could easily find and snatch and get out of the building with,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Stolen items include neckpieces by the late artist and metalsmith Florence Resnikoff, a pair of scrimshaw walrus tusks and Native American baskets. But she said much of it was historical memorabilia from the 20th century such as campaign pins and athletic awards.\n \n\n   \n  The mission of the Oakland Museum of California is to document the art, history and natural environment of California, and its collection includes works by California artists from the late 18th century to the present, a well as artifacts, photographs, natural specimens and sound recordings. The museum has mounted shows dedicated to the Black Power movement and student activism.\n \n\n   \n  John Romero, a retired Los Angeles Police Department captain who led the department’s commercial crimes unit, told the  Los Angeles Times  that the items may already have been sold since the burglary occurred two weeks ago. He expects detectives are looking at resale platforms such as Craigslist and Ebay, and networks that specialize in historic or collectible antiques.\n \n\n   \n  “These people are interested in fast cash, not the full appraisal value,” he told the Times. “They need to get rid of it quickly.”\n \n\n   \n  In January 2013, an Oakland man broke into the museum itself and got away with a California Gold Rush-era jewelry box. Fogarty said the the item was traced to a pawn shop with help from the public, and she hopes the community can help again.\n \n\n   \n  The Oakland Police Department declined to provide further details, but said in its news release that police are working with a unit of the Federal Bureau of Investigation that specializes in art crime, including theft, forgery or antiquities and cultural property trafficking.\n \n\n   \n  The theft occurred four days before thieves made off with  priceless Napoleonic jewels  from the world’s most-visited museum, the Louvre, in broad daylight. Authorities have  made arrests  but the jewels have not been recovered.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/fbi-fires-agent-trump-investigations","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"12:05:00.000Z","title":"FBI fires special agent who helped oversee Trump investigation, sources say","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The FBI has fired special agent Aaron Tapp, who previously oversaw key investigations into former President Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election, including the 'Arctic Frost' probe into fake electors.

Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The FBI has fired a special agent who previously helped oversee public corruption cases, including an investigation that became part of former special counsel Jack Smith’s probe into President Donald Trump, according to two sources familiar with the matter — another apparent casualty of the Trump administration’s retribution push.\n \n\n   \n  Aaron Tapp, the special agent in charge of the FBI’s San Antonio office, was previously the deputy assistant director of the Criminal Investigative Division at FBI headquarters. There for a time he had oversight of probes into Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election.\n \n\n   \n  One of these investigations — known as Arctic Frost — focused on the fake electors scheme, in which Trump allies sought to have Trump electors counted as electoral college votes from states that Joe Biden won.\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks, Republicans have released FBI records showing details of the Arctic Frost investigation and accused Smith and FBI leaders of political motives in using grand jury subpoenas to obtain phone records of nine GOP lawmakers. The records, obtained in 2023, covered four days surrounding the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot . The FBI didn’t obtain the contents of the calls. Smith has denied any political motives and said the subpoenas were routine investigative tools.\n \n\n   \n  Tapp has been with the FBI for more than 20 years, according to his bio on the FBI’s website.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the FBI’s headquarters and San Antonio field office for comment.\n \n\n   \n   Three former senior FBI officials summarily fired  in August are suing FBI Director Kash Patel and the Trump administration, alleging that their terminations were part of a White House-directed purge driven at least in part by social media bullying from MAGA loyalists, CNN reported last month.\n \n\n   \n  Brian Driscoll, the former acting FBI director for a month at the start of the second Trump administration; Steven Jensen, who Patel installed as assistant director in charge the Washington field office; and Spencer Evans, who led the Las Vegas field office, allege that Patel has politicized the FBI to protect his own job.\n \n\n   \n  “Patel not only acted unlawfully but deliberately chose to prioritize politicizing the FBI over protecting the American people,” the lawsuit states.\n \n\n   \n  The 68-page complaint provided first-hand accounts from top FBI officials of the tumultuous first few weeks of Trump’s second term. Driscoll and other senior officials resisted efforts to try to fire or otherwise punish all FBI agents or employees for simply having worked on criminal investigations of Trump, the complaint says.\n \n\n   \n  Patel and other officials, during Senate confirmation hearings, had dismissed any plans for political retribution, despite Trump’s repeated threats during his campaign rallies to do exactly that.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/polls-election-major-races","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"What do the polls say about the key races this election?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article provides an analysis of key 2025 off-year election races, using polling data to assess voter sentiment and political dynamics.

election? \n       \n  By Ariel Edwards-Levy, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  We’re just days away from 2025’s off-year elections. Beyond how the races themselves turn out, the contests will be a valuable source of data to analyze – and perhaps overanalyze – ahead of next year’s midterms.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s an overview of what the polls suggest about the four big races we’re watching this year.\n \n\n   \n  A note: Polls are a valuable tool for understanding the electorate, but they’re most useful when they’re treated as estimates rather than attempts to predict the future with pinpoint precision. Often, what they tell us about the broader political environment is more valuable than the exact margin that any specific survey finds for a race.\n \n\n   \n    Virginia statewide races\n \n\n   \n   Virginia’s election for governor  takes place in the shadow of an unpopular GOP administration in Washington, DC.  A Washington Post-Schar School poll  asked voters to describe the most important issue in the race. The share who responded with negative comments about President Donald Trump or Republicans came second only to concerns about economic issues and the cost of living.\n \n\n   \n  The Post-Schar poll, which found Democrat Abigail Spanberger with a 12-point lead over Republican Winsome Earle-Sears among likely voters, joins  other recent   surveys  in the state that show Spanberger with a stable advantage in the race. There’s much more uncertainty in the other statewide races, particularly the campaign for attorney general, where polls show support for Democrat Jay Jones facing some erosion after  the publication of text messages  in which he fantasized about killing a legislative colleague.\n \n\n   \n    New Jersey governor\n \n\n   \n   New Jersey’s gubernatorial race  is a tale of two incumbents: Trump is unpopular there as well, but the state’s outgoing Democratic governor, Phil Murphy, also draws closely divided ratings for his time in office. Many recent surveys of the race, including polls from  Quinnipiac University ,  F ox News,   Fairleigh Dickinson University  and the  Rutgers-Eagleton Poll , have found Democrat Mikie Sherrill with an edge among likely voters, hovering around the 50% mark, while her opponent, Republican Jack Ciattarelli, stands closer to 45%.\n \n\n   \n  Quinnipiac’s latest poll, like several others, found that Ciattarelli’s supporters were more likely than Sherrill’s to express strong enthusiasm about their chosen candidate, although Sherrill’s favorability ratings remained higher overall.\n \n\n   \n    New York City mayor\n \n\n   \n   New York City’s multi-candidate mayoral race  poses a unique challenge for pollsters. Surveys of likely voters, however, have been largely consistent in showing Democrat Zohran Mamdani with a double-digit lead over his nearest rival, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, with Republican Curtis Sliwa in third. They differ on the precise scope of Mamdani’s advantage, although most have found him shy of clearing a majority of support in the race.\n \n\n   \n  In polls released Thursday by  Marist College  and  Fox News , Mamdani was buoyed by positive favorability ratings and broad support among younger voters, while older voters broke for Cuomo.\n \n\n   \n    California redistricting\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps nowhere is the role of national politics as clear as in California, where  voters are weighing Proposition 50 , a ballot measure to temporarily enact a new congressional map drawn by Democrats in response to Republican-driven redistricting in other states.\n \n\n   \n  A mid-October poll from  CBS/YouGov  found 62% of likely voters in support of Proposition 50, while  an October Public Policy Institute of California poll  put that support at 56%. It’s worth noting that  past research has found  that polling sometimes overshoots support for initiatives that implement new changes – whether liberal or conservative – because some voters default to preferring the status quo.\n \n\n   \n  Half of likely voters said in the CBS/YouGov poll that their decision had more to do with national issues and politics than with state or local issues. Broad majorities of likely voters supporting Proposition 50 said their choice was driven by the desire to oppose Trump, to oppose national Republicans and to support national Democrats.\n \n\n   \n    A note on the state of polling\n \n\n   \n  How have polls been performing lately? A  new postmortem report on 2024 election polling , released Wednesday by the American Association for Public Opinion Research, found that polling in last year’s election was significantly more accurate than it was in 2020 or 2016 even as it continued to underestimate Republican vote shares for the third straight presidential cycle. (Polls in the 2022 and 2018 midterms both saw smaller directional errors.)\n \n\n   \n  As the report also noted, polls last year weren’t always able to estimate the ways that turnout changed between 2020 and 2024. That bears mentioning because all of these surveys reflect pollsters’ best estimations about who’s likely to end up voting in an off-year election – and how much that might differ from four years ago, at the start of former President Joe Biden’s administration.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/sport/wnba-players-union-cba-extension","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"10:17:00-04:00","title":"WNBA and players union agree to 30-day extension for CBA negotiations, AP source says","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The WNBA and its players union have agreed to a 30-day extension of their collective bargaining agreement negotiations, pushing the deadline to November 30, 2025.

agreement, a person familiar with the decision said Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  The league offered on Tuesday to push back the deadline and on Thursday the union accepted, the person told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because no official announcement has been made.\n \n\n   \n  The current CBA was set to expire on Friday and tensions have been rising in recent weeks as the sides try to work toward a new deal.\n \n\n   \n  The new Nov. 30 deadline gives the sides more time to come up with a new deal that would be transformational for the players in terms of salary. In 2019, when the last CBA deal had expired, the sides agreed to a 60-day extension and eventually ratified the current CBA in January 2020.\n \n\n   \n  The Athletic was the first to report the extension.\n \n\n   \n  The sides have had meetings over the past few days, including in New York on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Had an extension not been reached by Friday, the sides would have had three options: let things continue as is, have the players go on strike or the owners lock them out. A strike or lockout didn’t really make sense for either side to do.\n \n\n   \n  Players have already been paid for the past season and they have health insurance through April 30, 2026. There are no major events for the league on the immediate horizon until an expansion draft for new teams Portland and Toronto. The expansion draft for Golden State took place last December.\n \n\n   \n  The players exercised their right to opt out of the current CBA last year with hopes of getting, among other things, increased revenue sharing, higher salaries, improved benefits and a softer salary cap.\n \n\n   \n  The WNBA’s offers to this point have clearly not been to the players’ liking, although it is unclear how far apart the sides are in terms of salary parameters. WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert said during the WNBA Finals that the league — like the players — wants a “transformative deal” done with significant increases to salary and benefits.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/andrew-cuomo-mamdani-nyc-mayor-race","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"20:54:00-04:00","title":"In his last stand, Andrew Cuomo zigzags between optimism and despair about NYC race","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the final stretch of the 2025 New York City mayoral campaign, Andrew Cuomo relaunched his bid after a primary defeat, emphasizing his 11 years as governor and experience in crisis management to counter Zohran Mamdani’s progressive platform.

Andrew Cuomo zigzags between optimism and despair about NYC race \n       \n  By Gloria Pazmino, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:54 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Through the final days of this year’s campaign for New York City mayor, Andrew Cuomo has at times lived up to the nickname he earned in the early days of his political career: the prince of darkness.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo  relaunched his mayoral campaign  after his shocking Democratic primary loss, telling New Yorkers he was in it to win it in a video he filmed standing on a tree-lined sidewalk under the July sun. He would acknowledge he needed to embrace social media and address voter concerns about affordability.\n \n\n   \n  Over the four months that followed, Cuomo zigzagged between optimism about his candidacy and despair about the  possible mayoralty of Zohran Mamdani . He has described his run as the last chance New Yorkers will have to save the city from Mamdani’s  democratic socialism , once referring in a debate to the 34-year-old Mamdani as a “kid” and warning that his ideas were radical and unrealistic.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo’s final general election ad leans on his executive experience and also questions whether Mamdani has enough.\n \n\n   \n  “Life in New York is tough right now,” he says in the ad. “Candidates who need on-the-job training can’t fix it.”\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of Tuesday’s election, early voting numbers were up dramatically ahead of the same point in 2021, reflecting the interest New Yorkers have in a mayoral race unlike any in recent memory. The latest Quinnipiac University poll had 43% of likely voters backing Mamdani versus 33% for Cuomo and 14% for Republican Curtis Sliwa.\n \n\n   \n  And in a  new Marist Poll of likely New York City voters  released Thursday, Mamdani had 48% support over Cuomo’s 32% and Sliwa’s 16%. Indeed, every major poll on the race has found Mamdani with a double-digit lead over Cuomo, though the vast majority have found Mamdani below 50% support, according to Jennifer Agiesta, CNN Director of Polling and Analytics.\n \n\n   \n  With the exception of Fox’s survey earlier this month, every high-quality poll on the contest conducted since the Democratic primary has found Mamdani’s support landing between 43 and 48 percent. While Cuomo has made up some ground over that time, with his support rising from the mid-20s in early polls to consistent low-30s support, he continues to lag well behind the frontrunner.\n \n\n   \n  Yet in the past week, aides to Cuomo have pointed to the early voting surge as evidence that his standing in the polls is not as bad as it seems.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo suggested on Wednesday that New Yorkers were just tuning into the race.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve been focusing on it, but people have been living their lives. You now get down to the last week, they’re starting to focus,” Cuomo said. “You’re talking about a general election where many normal New Yorkers are going to vote and I think there’s gonna be a big turnout because (Mamdani) frightens New Yorkers.”\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani’s backers remain far more enthusiastic about their choice than are Cuomo’s supporters, according to the Quinnipiac poll.\n \n\n   \n  The survey also found a rise in how many New Yorkers have an unfavorable view of Mamdani (45% favorable to 41% unfavorable versus earlier in October when those figures stood at 43% favorable to 35% unfavorable).\n \n\n   \n  Still, 54% of New Yorkers had unfavorable views of Cuomo versus just 34% favorable.\n \n\n   \n  In the final stretch of the campaign, Democrats who previously supported Cuomo, political observers and even former aides of the governor were astounded after he  laughed with a radio host  who suggested Mamdani would “cheer” another 9/11. Cuomo  later said  he believed the host’s comments were offensive as Mamdani accused him of playing to Islamophobia.\n \n\n   \n  Days later, during an appearance on Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show,” host Jon Stewart joked with Mamdani about their back-and-forth.\n \n\n   \n  “You are clearly in the front-runner position right now – I can tell because they have gone 9/11 on you,” Stewart said eliciting laughter from the crowd.\n \n\n   \n  “The closing argument,” Mamdani responded.\n \n\n   \n    Cuomo reframes his legacy\n \n\n   \n  With every post and campaign stop, Cuomo tried a new media strategy while leaning into the legacy items of his 11 years as governor, including  legalizing same-sex marriage  and  raising the minimum wage . In doing so, Cuomo argued that he is the mayoral race’s original progressive.\n \n\n   \n  “I was a crazy liberal,” Cuomo said during an appearance on SiriusXM’s “Andy Cohen Live” show. “Now, the party’s moved so far left, they call me a moderate.”\n \n\n   \n   Cuomo resigned  in 2021 amid an investigation into sexual harassment allegations that he has denied and questions about how he handled Covid-19 in nursing homes.\n \n\n   \n  He won an endorsement Wednesday from US Rep. Tom Suozzi, a Long Island Democrat whose district includes parts of Queens.\n \n\n   \n  “I cannot back a declared socialist with a thin resume to run the most complex city in America,” Suozzi  wrote on X . “We need leaders who will fight crime, not undermine the police. Who will create jobs, not harm the economy. Who will keep taxes down, not make it more expensive for middle class families to live here.”\n \n\n   \n    Embracing his inner influencer\n \n\n   \n  As his campaign apparatus tried to catch up on social media, Cuomo was dismissing its significance in public.\n \n\n   \n  Standing on the debate stage, Cuomo poked fun of Mamdani’s social media fluency, holding his hands up in the air, rocking side to side while moving his hands in a talking motion.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a TikTok dance,” Cuomo said.\n \n\n   \n  Even as he mocked the videos that helped propel his opponent, Cuomo admitted they were effective. He has started posting videos of him meeting with New Yorkers that some Mamdani allies think are copying the Democratic nominee’s style.\n \n\n   \n  “He was very effective on it. His mother’s a film director, filmmaker. He’s an actor slash rapper. They did highly produced videos that were very effective. And that’s his sweet spot,” Cuomo said on Cohen’s show.\n \n\n   \n  He appeared recently at a “Cool Girls for Capitalism” event held in a swanky Tribeca members-only club known as Maxwell Social, where hosts doled out pink T-shirts and stickers emblazoned with the group name.\n \n\n   \n  At a “Young Professionals For Cuomo” fundraiser hosted by the independent candidate’s daughters, attendants got a chance to secure T-shirts showing a cartoon Cuomo surrounded by friendly iconography – a Statue of Liberty, the Star of David, a cross, a pretzel and a smiling apple.\n \n\n   \n    Experience, experience, experience\n \n\n   \n  Much like he did in the primary, Cuomo continued to lean on his experience, trying to draw a contrast between himself and Mamdani, who has served three terms in the State Assembly.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo focused on public safety, appealing to fears that  Mamdani’s police reform agenda  would lead to an increase in crime and demoralize police officers.\n \n\n   \n  The former governor has proposed hiring more officers and argued homeless people should be moved off the streets. A former housing secretary under President Bill Clinton, Cuomo said the city had suffered through years of inept governments who could not get projects off the ground.\n \n\n   \n  On the day of Hurricane Sandy’s anniversary in New York City, Cuomo was once again on the trail reminding voters of his experience and what he believed is at stake.\n \n\n   \n  “You need experience. You need the ability. You need the wisdom to know what to do because literally lives depend on you,” Cuomo said.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, Cuomo got the endorsement of former Mayor Michael Bloomberg who was in office on the day Hurricane Sandy devastated the city.\n \n\n   \n  Bloomberg, who also endorsed Cuomo in the primary and donated millions to a Cuomo Super PAC, reiterated his support for the governor and highlighted his experience.\n \n\n   \n  “Being Mayor of New York City is the second toughest job in America, and the next mayor will face immense challenges,” Bloomberg wrote in a post on X. “Andrew Cuomo has the experience and toughness to stand up for New Yorkers and get things done.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s David Wright contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/zohran-mamdani-nypd-idf-video","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"20:42:00Z","title":"Mamdani Explains to CNN’s Anderson Cooper Why He Said the IDF Had Laced the NYPD’s Boots","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Zohran Mamdani, a Democratic mayoral nominee in New York City, has faced intense scrutiny over a 2023 statement in which he claimed the NYPD’s boots were laced by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), a remark later clarified as referencing joint training exercises between the NYPD and IDF.

The Israel Defense Forces, or IDF, are the armed forces of Israel.\n \n\n   \n  “We have to make, not specifically that example all the time, but just to say that for working-class people who have very little time, who have so many stresses, who are under so many pressures, there isn’t that much time for symbolism,” he then said. “We have to make it materially connected to their life.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN’s Anderson Cooper played that clip Tuesday and asked Mamdani what he meant.\n \n\n   \n  “It was a reference to training exercises that have taken place between the NYPD and the IDF,” Mamdani said.\n \n\n   \n  “So do you still believe that the NYPD is basically working hand in glove with the IDF?” Cooper asked.\n \n\n   \n  “No, what I’ve made very clear is those are training exercises that are of concern to me,” Mamdani replied. “And what my focus is, is on working with the NYPD to actually deliver public safety for New Yorkers across the five boroughs.”\n \n\n   \n  It wasn’t immediately clear whether Mamdani would seek as mayor to end any training exercises or other cooperation between the NYPD and Israel. But the clip – and Mamdani’s explanation of it – became the latest instance during the mayoral campaign where the Democratic nominee had to answer for his past criticisms of both Israel and the police.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani has apologized for some of his comments about law enforcement, including social media posts in which he called the police racist, wicked and corrupt. Seeking to reassure voters concerned about public safety, he has said he would seek to retain NYPD Commissioner  Jessica Tisch , though he acknowledged in an earlier interview with CNN’s Gloria Pazmino that he hadn’t spoken to Tisch about staying on.\n \n\n   \n  But he has not backed down on his criticisms of Israel, referring to its war in Gaza after Hamas’ October 7 attacks as a genocide. He has said that as mayor, he would seek to carry out an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n \n\n   \n  While Americans are  increasingly skeptical  of Israel’s actions in Gaza, Mamdani’s criticisms have caused anger within parts of New York’s Jewish community, the largest outside Israel. He has  sought to reassure  Jewish voters that he would fight antisemitism and provide requested security at synagogues.\n \n\n   \n  While the NYPD does not have international posts in the traditional sense, the department runs an “International Liaison Program” that stations detectives across more than a dozen countries around the globe with the purpose of developing contacts with local law enforcement and engaging in counterterrorism exercises, according to the New York City police foundation that helps fund the program.\n \n\n   \n  The program, which critics say has expanded for years with little oversight, was started after 9/11 as law enforcement professionals sought to learn more about overseas terrorism.\n \n\n   \n  Over the years, the NYPD has continued to deploy senior law enforcement officers around the world, including to Israel, where they share in intelligence and training exercises.\n \n\n   \n  The NYPD did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/uk/salem-britain-witches-pardon-campaign-scli-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"12:01:00Z","title":"Salem’s witches were pardoned, but Britain’s weren’t.

There’s now a movement to change that \n       \n  By James Frater, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:01 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  While the women accused in the infamous  Salem witch  trials in colonial America have long since been pardoned, the convictions of hundreds of British women executed under similar laws officially still stand. Now, one local authority in southern England is campaigning to change that.\n \n\n   \n  Decades before Salem, hysteria over witchcraft was already sweeping through England – and perhaps nowhere more fervently than in the southeast, such as in the neighboring counties of Kent and Essex, which border London.\n \n\n   \n  Between 1560 and 1700, more than 500 women were tried for witchcraft in the southeast region, according to UK Parliament estimates. Of those, 112 were executed.\n \n\n   \n  But one trial in Maidstone, Kent, in 1652 stands out for its scale and public fascination.\n \n\n   \n  On July 30 that year, a court convened near where Maidstone Town Hall stands today. Thirty-two people faced charges ranging from theft and murder to witchcraft, Claire Kehily, councillor for Maidstone Borough Council, told CNN. Six women, accused of bewitching to death a 10-day-old infant, her mother, and a 3-year-old child, became the focus of the town’s attention, she said.\n \n\n   \n  In the summer of 1652, the town was “abuzz with excitement,” Kehily explained.  “People came down from London to witness what was going on. It was the biggest thing we’d had here for a long time.”\n \n\n   \n  The accused were held in a small, dark jail that once stood on the ground floor of the courthouse, now tucked away in the attic of the rebuilt Town Hall.\n \n\n   \n  The trial’s notoriety was such that a special pamphlet was published shortly after, titled “A Prodigious and Tragic History of the Arraignment, Trial, Confession, and Condemnation of Six Witches,” of which Maidstone Council has a rare replica.\n \n\n   \n  The document describes bizarre and unverified claims – including one woman swelling “into a monstrous and vast bigness” before the court and another allegedly bearing “a visible teat under her tongue.”\n \n\n   \n  Three women were convicted after failing a crude test: a pin thrust into their arms. The court account said the women “did not feel it, neither did it draw blood.”\n \n\n   \n  Two others confessed to being impregnated “not by any man, but by the devil,” according to the document.\n \n\n   \n  All six were convicted of “the execrable and diabolical crime of witchcraft” and sentenced to death.\n \n\n   \n    Spectacle of execution\n \n\n   \n  Their execution took place at Penenden Heath, now a tranquil park with soccer fields and woodland.\n \n\n   \n  “They were dragged on hurdles – basically carts – to the heath,” Tony Harwood, a councillor for Maidstone Borough Council, told CNN. “Thousands came to watch. Public executions were entertainment, but also a tool of control.”\n \n\n   \n  “These were women of all ages,” Harwood continued. “Very vulnerable individuals who had no idea what was going on or why they had been put into this situation. You just have to understand the absolute terror of these events – and that is partly what’s behind it. The powers that be wanted to instil terror.”\n \n\n   \n  Harwood described the horror and spectacle of the scene. “Public executions – they were public participation events. Thousands of people would attend. There were crime waves around them: pickpocketing, thefts, lots of complaints. That’s why the execution spot at Penenden Heath was moved several times – because of the impact from the many thousands of sightseers who came to watch,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “There would have been people who were just there for the show. There would have been people who were appalled by what was going on. There would have been people who were excited by it.”\n \n\n   \n  After the executions, the bodies were discarded without ceremony. “When roads were widened or housing built, human remains have often been found,” Harwood added.\n \n\n   \n  A small stone plaque on the edge of Penenden Heath that commemorates these women – alongside the plaques for the many other people executed at this site – is the only mark of the atrocities that took place.\n \n\n   \n    Seeking justice, centuries later\n \n\n   \n  Though the frenzy surrounding witchcraft in England faded in the decades following the Maidstone trial, and all laws criminalizing witchcraft have long since been repealed, the convictions of those women – and hundreds like them – still stand.\n \n\n   \n  Now, nearly 400 years later, Maidstone Borough Council is calling for change.\n \n\n   \n  Stuart Jeffery, leader of the council, has written to Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood, urging the British government to introduce legislation that would grant a general pardon to those executed under the Witchcraft Act of 1562, including the women hanged at Penenden Heath in 1652.\n \n\n   \n  “Justice is timeless,” said Harwood. “These terrible wrongs carried out between 1542 and the mid-18th century echo through the ages. They cannot just be painted over.”\n \n\n   \n  “We need to set the record straight. These were innocent, vulnerable individuals who were brutally judicially murdered – often for political or personal gain. That injustice will echo down the ages.”\n \n\n   \n  Kehily said that the trials were “a very early form of violence against women and girls. It still happens. They were scapegoats.”\n \n\n   \n  “By highlighting it, we remind people that this has happened – and we need to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  “To address a wrong that has been made,” Kehily said, “is to try and get it right, to learn from history, and to bring it to the fore. This hasn’t gone away.”\n \n\n   \n    Precedents for pardon\n \n\n   \n  Maidstone’s campaign follows similar efforts elsewhere in the United Kingdom to confront historical injustices.\n \n\n   \n  In Scotland, then-First Minister Nicola Sturgeon issued a formal apology in 2022 to the thousands of people – mostly women – who were accused and executed under the country’s Witchcraft Act between the 16th and 18th centuries. The apology came after a sustained campaign by historians and activists who argued that the victims were persecuted for being poor, vulnerable, or simply different.\n \n\n   \n  There is also precedent for legislative pardons.\n \n\n   \n  In 2013, Queen Elizabeth II posthumously pardoned Alan Turing, the World War II codebreaker convicted under laws criminalizing homosexuality, and in 2017 the UK government extended the pardon to thousands of other gay and bisexual men convicted under similar statutes. Known as the “Turing Law,” it marked a significant step in acknowledging the injustice of discriminatory legislation.\n \n\n   \n  Councillors in Maidstone hope that a similar approach can be taken to address the legacy of the Witchcraft Act.\n \n\n   \n  “This is about justice,” Harwood said. “We’ve seen the government take steps to right past wrongs. Now it’s time to do the same for the women who were judicially murdered under the guise of witchcraft.”\n \n\n   \n  A Home Office spokesperson told CNN the government would respond to the council’s letter “in due course.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/health/autism-covid-pregnancy","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"20:06:00-04:00","title":"Autism diagnosis rates higher among children born to mothers who had Covid-19 during pregnancy, study suggests","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A new study from Massachusetts General Hospital and the Mass General Brigham health system, analyzing over 18,000 births from March 2020 to May 2021, finds that children born to mothers who had a laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 infection during pregnancy are significantly more likely to be diagnosed with neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism.

Previous studies have suggested that male fetal brains are more susceptible to maternal immune responses, according to the authors of the new study, and the third trimester is a “critical window for brain development.”\n \n\n   \n  The most common diagnoses included disorders in speech and motor function development and autism. About 2.7% of children born to mothers who had Covid-19 while pregnant were diagnosed with autism, compared with about 1.1% of others, according to the study, published Thursday in the journal Obstetrics and Gynecology.\n \n\n   \n  The new findings are “particularly notable in light of their biological plausibility,” the researchers wrote. They build on previous research that identified potential pathways for a maternal Covid-19 infection to affect the developing fetal brain even without direct transmission.\n \n\n   \n  “Parental awareness of the potential for adverse child neurodevelopmental outcomes after COVID-19 in pregnancy is key. By understanding the risks, parents can appropriately advocate for their children to have proper evaluation and support,” Dr. Lydia Shook, maternal-fetal medicine specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital and lead author of the study, said in  a news release .\n \n\n   \n  About 1 in 31 children in the US was diagnosed with autism by age 8 in 2022, according to a  report  published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that was published in April. The increase — up from 1 in 36 children in 2020 — continues a long-term trend that experts have largely attributed to better understanding of and screening for the condition.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, the US Department of Health and Human Services launched a “massive testing and research effort” to determine “what has  caused the autism epidemic .”\n \n\n   \n  In a news conference in September on the “ cause of autism ,” President Donald Trump — flanked by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other federal health leaders – said that use of  Tylenol during pregnancy  can be associated with a “very increased risk of autism,” despite decades of evidence that it is safe.\n \n\n   \n  Kennedy also has a history of comments linking autism and vaccines, despite strong evidence that the two are not connected.\n \n\n   \n  The timeframe of the new study – early in the pandemic, before vaccines were widely available – meant that ​the researchers were able to “isolate the association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and offspring neurodevelopment in an unvaccinated population.” About 93% of the mothers included in the assessment had not received any doses of Covid-19 vaccine. Strong infection-control policies at that time also helped reduce the potential for unreported or undetected Covid-19 cases, the researchers said.\n \n\n   \n  “These findings highlight that COVID-19, like many other infections in pregnancy, may pose risks not only to the mother, but to fetal brain development,” Dr. Andrea Edlow, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at Mass General Brigham and senior author of the new study, said in a news release. “They also support the importance of trying to prevent COVID-19 infection in pregnancy and are particularly relevant when public trust in vaccines – including the COVID-19 vaccine – is being eroded.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/tech/amazon-layoffs-andy-jassy-ai-culture","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"19:33:00-04:00","title":"Amazon Says It Didn’t Cut 14,000 People Because of Money.

Amazon’s quarterly sales grew 13% year-on-year to $180 billion.\n \n\n   \n  Jassy explained that as Amazon added headcount, locations and lines of business in recent years, “you end up with a lot more people than what you had before, and you end up with a lot more layers … sometimes without realizing it, you can weaken the ownership of the people that you have who are doing the actual work.”\n \n\n   \n  Amazon’s headcount peaked at more than 1.6 million in 2021; it ended last year with around 1.5 million employees, according to SEC filings.\n \n\n   \n  “It can lead to slowing you down as a leadership team,” he said. “We are committed to operating like the world’s largest startup, and … that means removing layers.”\n \n\n   \n  Although Amazon said this week that the layoffs were more about staying “nimble” in anticipation of future AI efficiencies, the layoffs have nonetheless spurred fears about technology replacing human workers. Amazon ( AMZN ) shares climbed 13% after-hours following the earnings report.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/us/mississippi-police-drug-trafficking-charged","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"19:46:00-05:00","title":"Two Mississippi Sheriffs and 12 Officers Charged in Drug Trafficking Bribery Scheme","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Federal authorities have indicted 20 individuals, including two Mississippi sheriffs — Washington County Sheriff Milton Gaston and Humphreys County Sheriff Bruce Williams — for allegedly accepting bribes to provide safe passage for drug traffickers transporting 25 kilograms of cocaine through the Mississippi Delta region into Memphis, Tennessee.

Thursday announced indictments against 20 people, including 14 current or former Mississippi Delta law enforcement officers, who allegedly took bribes to provide safe passage to people they believed were drug traffickers.\n \n\n   \n  The yearslong investigation swept across multiple counties in the Mississippi Delta region of Mississippi and Tennessee. Two Mississippi sheriffs, Washington County Sheriff Milton Gaston and Humphreys County Sheriff Bruce Williams, were among those arrested.\n \n\n   \n  Some bribes were as large as $20,000 and $37,000, authorities said at a news conference.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s just a monumental betrayal of public trust,” US Attorney Clay Joyner said.\n \n\n   \n  The indictments say law enforcement officers provided armed escort services on multiple occasions to an FBI agent posing as a member of a Mexican drug cartel. The indictments allege the officers understood they were helping to transport 25 kilograms (55 pounds) of cocaine through Mississippi Delta counties and into Memphis. Some of the officers also provided escort services to protect the transportation of drug proceeds.\n \n\n   \n  Gaston and Williams are alleged to have received bribes in exchange for giving the operations their “blessing,” one indictment said. It also alleged that Gaston attempted to disguise the payments as campaign contributions, but did not report them as required by law.\n \n\n   \n  Federal officials said the investigation into the alleged crimes began when people who had been arrested complained about having to pay bribes to various individuals.\n \n\n   \n  “Law enforcement is only effective when the community they protect can trust the law enforcement officers are honestly serving the community’s interests,” Robert Eikhoff, special agent in charge of the FBI’s Jackson Field Office, said. “This type of corruption strikes at the heart of the community.”\n \n\n   \n  Nineteen of the 20 people indicted are also charged with violating federal gun laws.\n \n\n   \n  Court records show that the federal defender’s office is representing 16 of the 20 people charged, including the two sheriffs.

Tate Reeves said in a statement that he was disappointed to learn of the allegations.\n \n\n   \n  “The law must apply equally to everyone regardless of the title or position they hold,” he wrote. “Know that if you betray the people’s trust in Mississippi, you will face consequences.”\n \n\n   \n  Multiple Mississippi law enforcement agencies and sheriffs have faced federal scrutiny in recent years.\n \n\n   \n  In 2024, the former Hinds County Sheriff Marshand Crisler was  convicted  of accepting $9,500 in bribes and knowingly providing ammunition to a convicted felon.

Senate Democrats triggered the shutdown by withholding support for a temporary funding bill to force Republicans to extend subsidies, which are now expiring. As a result, tens of millions of Americans face sharply rising health care costs — with premiums increasing by 26% on average — and the risk of losing vital SNAP food assistance. Federal workers, including air traffic controllers, are being forced to work without pay, and military personnel face massive pay gaps despite a $130 million donation.

Lisa Murkowski said this week, berating her colleagues in both parties for failing to act. “We’re pretending that people are not being impacted by this shutdown.”\n \n\n   \n  Senate Democrats triggered the showdown, withholding support for a temporary government funding bill last month in an attempt to force Republicans to guarantee extensions for  expanded subsidies  for millions of  Affordable Care Act health plans .\n \n\n   \n  “They are completely and totally uninterested in solving or addressing, decisively, the Republican health care crisis that they’ve created,” House Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on “The Source” Wednesday night.\n \n\n   \n  “On November 1, when open enrollment begins, it’s going to be crystal clear to tens of millions of Americans, across the country, that their premiums, copays and deductibles are about to dramatically increase,” Jeffries said.\n \n\n   \n  But Republican leaders are standing firm. They’re offering to discuss extending the credits, but only when Democrats agree to open the government.\n \n\n   \n  A pitiful lack of trust between the parties, the unwillingness of either side to accept the political cost of a climbdown and Trump’s stunning indifference to his own shuttered government led to this stalemate.\n \n\n   \n  And the ramifications of the shutdown are getting quickly worse as the political duel becomes a test of which unfortunate Americans can bear the most pain.\n \n\n   \n  In one of the most critical developments, tens of millions of Americans, including children, elderly citizens and those with a disability are set to lose vital food assistance under the  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). \n \n\n   \n  The blow of soaring health care premiums is also being laid bare. Millions are getting notices showing Obamacare costs shooting up by an average of 26% and in some cases much higher, in the absence of the expiring enhanced subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  “Which pain point is the worst?” Collins asked Jeffries, referring to Americans hit by rising Obamacare premiums and those facing the potential loss of SNAP benefits. “None of this pain that Republicans have inflicted on the American people is acceptable,” Jeffries replied.\n \n\n   \n  The pressure on government workers — those forced to work without pay and colleagues who are locked out of their jobs — is also worsening.\n \n\n   \n  Flight disruptions are mounting as staff shortages emerge among air traffic controllers, who already operate  under acute stress . The controllers’ mental and emotional challenges are rising since they are  working without pay  — but still face housing, transport and childcare costs.\n \n\n   \n  A new crisis speed bump looms over paying military personnel. Trump accepted a  $130 million donation  from a fellow billionaire to fill the gap left by drained federal funds after reallocating Pentagon funds to meet a first wave of salary payments. But the gift won’t come close to paying wages for 1.3 million military members.\n \n\n   \n  Federal employees, who are spread throughout the 50 states, are getting increasingly desperate. Their financial obligations don’t just go on hold because the government can’t pay them.\n \n\n   \n    Will the misery being inflicted on Americans change political calculations?\n \n\n   \n  Conditions are therefore dropping into place for the spiking of pain that normally translates into political pressure that causes one party to flinch.\n \n\n   \n  The food stamps expiration could be a catalyst. Democrats accuse the administration of refusing to divert available funding to meet the shortfall. But the Agriculture Department insists it can’t tap a $6 billion contingency fund to pay the benefits.\n \n\n   \n  The disagreement set up a callous scenario as lawmakers squabble over what is more important — feeding the nation’s neediest people or ensuring that millions of families can continue to get health care. It’s a shameful spectacle that epitomizes a political system rendered inoperable by years of polarization and cynicism in both parties and a government that fails in its basic function to help citizens.\n \n\n   \n  As misery multiplies, the question becomes which party changes its calculus first.\n \n\n   \n  ► Will Democrats, who have stayed remarkably united during the drama, begin to see cracks, especially among moderate lawmakers, those who have competitive reelection races, or others who are retiring and can buck their party’s activists?\n \n\n   \n  ► Can Republican leaders keep their lawmakers, especially the often-fractious House GOP conference, in line? Will they risk political fallout from all this misery inflicted on voters already hit by rising inflation and grocery prices, given they have a monopoly on power in Washington?\n \n\n   \n  ► And will Trump, who has managed to defray some of the traditional pressure points during a shutdown, finally discover a political or moral imperative to end it?\n \n\n   \n    A hint of hope as senators talk\n \n\n   \n  A glimmer of hope shone late on Wednesday when details emerged of a  dual-track negotiation between frustrated Democratic and Republican senators . One goal would be to resolve the health-care impasse and reopen the government for a few weeks. The group also hopes to reach a separate long-term agreement to fund certain key departments — including the Department of Agriculture, which funds food stamps — through next year.\n \n\n   \n  Disagreements in Congress often end with creative fudges and concurrent steps that allow both sides to argue they didn’t fold. But there is no guarantee this approach will work. Senate Majority Leader John Thune’s office told CNN he remains unwilling to discuss Obamacare policy changes until the government is open.\n \n\n   \n  A few weeks ago, the closure of the federal government lacked the sweeping impact that helped earlier shutdowns seize the nation’s attention. But that’s beginning to change. The normally unruffled Thune erupted on the Senate floor Wednesday at Democratic Sen. Ben Ray Luján, who complained about SNAP benefits potentially expiring. “This isn’t a political game,” Thune snapped. “These are real people’s lives that we’re talking about. And you all just figured out, 29 days in, that, oh, there might be some consequences.”\n \n\n   \n  Democratic rhetoric is just as harsh.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer tried Wednesday to exact a political price from Trump. “Every single president was not so cruel and heartless to hold those hungry children, hungry elderly, and hungry veterans as hostages,” Schumer said. “Donald Trump is picking politics over the lives of hungry kids. He is weaponizing hunger.”\n \n\n   \n  The vitriol may offer an opening for the president because the shutdown — now just a week out from a new record — won’t end until he gets involved. He could turn his absence for most of the last week to his advantage by inserting himself into the bitterness between Democrats and Republicans to broker a resolution. After all, Trump is often more tempted more by the chance to make a deal and declare victory than by any rigid ideology. And he’s already signaled willingness to talk about expiring health-care subsidies. He could pose as the president who fed the hungry, paid the troops and made the skies safe again. This, however, would mean breaking with some of the harder-line elements in his own administration and offering Democrats a face-saving off-ramp.\n \n\n   \n  The conundrum for Democrats is how they engineer a way out of the crisis that they can present as a victory to base voters desperate to hit back at Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Early in the shutdown, the party succeeded in making Obamacare subsidies a national issue. And after nearly a year of internal mourning over the disastrous 2024 congressional and presidential elections, they found surprising unity in the shutdown. Sometimes, just picking a fight can give a party definition.\n \n\n   \n  But as the pain for millions of Americans mounted, the political clarity over health care blurred. And competing claims emerged. Everett Kelley, the president of the  American Federation of Government Employees  union that represents a wide swath of federal workers, who always opposed a shutdown, warned that it was time for the government to reopen. “I think that it’s vitally important to have health care for everyone … However, I don’t think that this should be built on the backs of federal employees,” he told CNN’s Jake Tapper.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats are also increasingly wrestling with the possibility that blame for the shutdown could blow back against them. After all, when they held the power in government, they faulted Republicans for using federal funding as a political lever. CNN’s Kasie Hunt pointed out the inconsistency to Democratic Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona on Tuesday. “That’s an easy answer. It’s Donald Trump. You’re talking about norms in the time of Donald Trump. It’s also normal not to tear down the East Wing,” Gallego said. He added: “It’s all out the window. When you’re dealing time with Donald Trump, this is the man that is extorting people. … We’re not going to go back and play by the norms when we know what’s on the line.”\n \n\n   \n  Republicans face their own risks.\n \n\n   \n  House Speaker Mike Johnson’s refusal to bring the House back to Washington looks like weakness. And he hasn’t been able to silence dissent in his conference, including from  Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene , who keeps accusing her party of negligence over the health care issue. The political equation could shift for Republicans next week if Trump is rebuked in  bellwether elections in Virginia and New Jersey .\n \n\n   \n  And leaving kids hungry could be a disaster. That’s one reason  Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley introduced a bill to fund SNAP benefits  until the end of the shutdown. Schumer said his party would vote for it. But Republican leaders will be loath to make a move that could alleviate pressure on Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  If millions of Americans going hungry doesn’t break open the deadlock, the shutdown could drag on even longer. The next potential off-ramp may come in the weeks leading up to Thanksgiving with the horrible prospect of an air travel nightmare at the busiest time of the year.\n \n\n   \n   This article has been updated with new reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/health/listeria-outbreak-prepared-meals","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"19:19:00-04:00","title":"More illnesses, deaths reported in listeria outbreak tied to recalled pasta salads, meals sold nationwide","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A listeria outbreak linked to contaminated precooked pasta from Nate’s Fine Foods Inc. has led to 27 reported illnesses, 25 hospitalizations, six deaths, and one fetal loss across 18 states.

7:19 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Two additional deaths have been reported in a listeria outbreak that’s been linked with recalled ready-to-eat pasta salads and prepared meals sold at major grocery chains including Trader Joe’s, Sprouts Farmers Market, Kroger and Walmart, health officials said Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Seven new illnesses have been reported in three states over the past month, bringing the case count to 27 illnesses reported from 18 states. There have been 25 hospitalizations, six deaths and one fetal loss.\n \n\n   \n  The  US Food and Drug Administration,  the US Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are investigating the outbreak, which has been linked to Listeria monocytogenes contamination in precooked pasta supplied by Nate’s Fine Foods Inc.\n \n\n   \n  Nate’s Fine Foods said in  a statement  in late September that it’s cooperating with the federal agencies’ investigation. “Our top priority is ensuring the safety of the people who enjoy our products, and we will continue to take all appropriate steps until this matter is resolved. … Nate’s Fine Foods sincerely apologizes for the concern this may cause. We remain fully committed to transparency and to taking every necessary step to protect the health and trust of our consumers.”\n \n\n   \n  The affected pasta has been used in a variety of prepared meals and deli salads sold under various brands. Several products have been recalled:\n \n\n   \n  The FDA says that consumers should check their refrigerators and freezers for these products and that they should not be eaten. If customers are unsure whether they have purchased contaminated products, they should contact the retailer.\n \n\n   \n  Consumption of food contaminated with  Listeria monocytogenes  can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions. These symptoms can sometimes be preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal problems.\n \n\n   \n  The FDA says that symptoms “usually start within two weeks after eating food contaminated with Listeria but may start as early as the same day or as late as 10 weeks after.”\n \n\n   \n  The agency also warns that the infection is most likely to affect pregnant women and newborns, adults 65 or older and people with weakened immune systems. Although pregnant women typically have fever, fatigue and muscle aches, serious cases may lead to stillbirth, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn.\n \n\n   \n  Consumers who have symptoms of listeriosis are advised to seek medical care right away.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/james-comey-wants-to-know-doj-lies","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"17:40:00Z","title":"James Comey’s lawyers want the DOJ to tell him what, exactly, they think he lied about","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"James Comey, former FBI Director, is facing charges of making false statements and obstructing Congress stemming from a 2020 Senate hearing where he answered questions from Republican Senator Ted Cruz.

 7:31 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Hurricane Melissa brought devastation and death to the Caribbean as it tore through the region as one of the most powerful Atlantic storms in more than 150 years.\n \n\n   \n  Torrential downpours and forceful winds unleashed widespread destruction along the storm’s path in Jamaica, Cuba and the Bahamas. At least 30 people have died, though the full toll of the catastrophic storm may take days or weeks to be determined.\n \n\n   \n  As the hurricane headed toward Bermuda early Thursday, emergency officials in countries along Melissa’s path have begun to pick up the pieces – clearing roads to reach isolated communities in need of relief.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew Holness, the prime minister of Jamaica, traveled to some of the hardest-hit areas of the island nation Wednesday to survey the significant damage caused by punishing winds and widespread flooding.\n \n\n   \n  “Despite the difficulties, the Jamaican spirit shines through as a strong reminder that we are a resilient nation with the capacity to triumph over adversity,” he wrote  on social media .\n \n\n   \n    Path of destruction\n \n\n   \n  In the Caribbean, hotter-than-average waters paired with minimally disruptive winds higher in the atmosphere to create the perfect fuel and prime conditions for Melissa to strengthen.\n \n\n   \n  Melissa rapidly  intensified , jumping from a 70 mph tropical storm on Saturday morning to a 140 mph Category 4 hurricane Sunday morning.\n \n\n   \n  By Tuesday, Melissa had morphed into a high-end Category 5 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 185 mph, tying it with  four other hurricanes  as the second-strongest storm recorded in the Atlantic since records began in 1851.\n \n\n   \n  As it headed toward Jamaica, where it slammed into the coast as a Category 5 storm on Tuesday, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) warned it expected the situation to be “catastrophic.”\n \n\n   \n  “For Jamaica, it will be the storm of the century for sure,” WMO tropical cyclone specialist Anne-Claire Fontan said.\n \n\n   \n  Overnight Tuesday into Wednesday, it crossed into eastern Cuba, still a formidable Category 3 hurricane by the time it made landfall in the province of Santiago de Cuba.\n \n\n   \n  By the time it reached the Bahamas on Wednesday, Hurricane Melissa had been downgraded to a Category 1, but its broad wind field continued to drive torrential flooding rain, damaging winds and dangerous storm surge at the coast.\n \n\n   \n  More than 735,000 people were  evacuated in Cuba  as Melissa approached, according to President Miguel Díaz-Canel, while in the Bahamas, preliminary estimates show 1,485 residents were evacuated before all flights were suspended ahead of the approaching storm.\n \n\n   \n  Evacuation orders were also issued for six islands in the Bahamas.\n \n\n   \n  Other countries, including the Dominican Republic and Haiti, also felt the cataclysmic impacts of Melissa.\n \n\n   \n    Devastation left behind\n \n\n   \n  Across the Caribbean, officials painted a consistent picture of the destruction Melissa left behind.\n \n\n   \n  “The conditions here are devastating. ‘Catastrophic’ is a mild term based on what we are observing here,” Richard Solomon, the mayor of the southwest Jamaican city of Black River, where Hurricane Melissa made landfall, said in a  video  posted by the Jamaica Constabulary Force.\n \n\n   \n  Around 140,000 people were cut off as the storm pummeled the island, the government has said.\n \n\n   \n  A CNN crew observed residents and military personnel push more than a dozen ambulances past storm debris in the town of Santa Cruz as the medical convoy headed to a coastal area in western Jamaica, which was hit hard.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities in Jamaica have recovered at least four bodies in the badly hit St. Elizabeth Parish in the aftermath of Hurricane Melissa, a source in the government told CNN on Wednesday. The Jamaica Constabulary Force confirmed eight more deaths on Thursday in Westmoreland, Hanover and St. James.\n \n\n   \n  Three people also died during storm preparations.\n \n\n   \n  Holness  declared  the country a disaster area   Tuesday, as he sought to deter price gouging.\n \n\n   \n  “We must… continue to proactively maintain stability, protect consumers, and prevent any exploitation at a time when citizens are securing food, water, and supplies,” Holness said.\n \n\n   \n  Around 77% of the country was  left  without electricity after Melissa crossed, a spokesperson said. The country’s infrastructure has taken a battering, leaving it “severely compromised,” according to Desmond McKenzie, Jamaica’s minister of local government and community development.\n \n\n   \n  Around 25,000 tourists remained in Jamaica as the country emerged from the storm, Dana Morris Dixon, minister of education, skills, youth and information, said in a  statement .\n \n\n   \n  In the already  beleaguered  country of Haiti, 23 people have died and 13 are missing, the country’s Civil Protection Agency said Wednesday. Twenty of the deaths, including 10 children, happened when a flooded river in Petit-Goâve burst its banks, the agency said, revising an earlier death toll of 25 reported by the mayor.\n \n\n   \n  Steven Guadard, who lives in Petit-Goâve, told the  Associated Press  the storm killed his entire family.\n \n\n   \n  “I had four children at home: a 1-month-old baby, a 7-year-old, an 8-year-old and another who was about to turn 4,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel said Hurricane Melissa had wrought “significant” damage on the island.\n \n\n   \n  “It has been a highly complex night, with significant damage reported,” Díaz-Canel wrote on X. “I urge our people to remain vigilant, to uphold discipline, and to continue taking all necessary precautions.”\n \n\n   \n    Recovery efforts\n \n\n   \n  Several international efforts have already been launched to aid in the recovery efforts.\n \n\n   \n  The United Kingdom said on Wednesday it was  deploying  £2.5 million ($3.3 million) in emergency humanitarian funding.\n \n\n   \n  China’s ambassador to Cuba shared a video on  social media  showing hundreds of boxes labeled as “family kit” being transported from a warehouse.\n \n\n   \n  US President Donald Trump on Wednesday authorized “an immediate US response” to mobilize support for affected communities in the Caribbean, according to a  statement  released by the State Department.\n \n\n   \n  Within hours, Secretary of State Marco Rubio “deployed a regional Disaster Assistance Response Team, including urban search-and-rescue teams, to assess needs and provide search and recovery assistance,” the statement read.\n \n\n   \n  “The State Department is collaborating with UN agencies, NGOs, and host governments to deliver food, water, medical supplies, hygiene kits, temporary shelter, and search and rescue support.”\n \n\n   \n  The Jamaican government launched an  official website  for relief and recovery efforts, where users can access updates on flooding locations or blocked roads and locate shelters.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/elise-stefanik-plans-bid-new-york-governor","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"18:33:00Z","title":"Elise Stefanik Plans to Launch Bid for New York Governor","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Elise Stefanik, a Republican U.S. Representative and key ally of former President Donald Trump, is preparing to launch a campaign for New York governor in 2026.

EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  GOP Rep.  Elise Stefanik  plans to launch a bid for New York governor in November and has hired a number of key senior aides, a source familiar with the planning told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Stefanik, who served in House GOP leadership, is one of  President Donald Trump’s  key allies on Capitol Hill and has long been foreshadowing a challenge to New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul in 2026.\n \n\n   \n  The New York Republican has told allies that she plans on formally entering the race shortly after New York City’s mayoral election on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Axios was  first to report  on Stefanik’s plans.\n \n\n   \n  With more than a combined $13 million cash on hand, Stefanik has tapped a number of former Trump advisers and longtime aides who worked in finance, communications and operations roles to help launch her campaign.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s 2024 campaign strategist, Tony Fabrizio, will be Stefanik’s pollster; the senior adviser who ran a key pro-Trump super PAC, Chris Grant, will serve as an adviser for Stefanik; and another Trump 2024 campaign official, Tim Sale, will also join the campaign, the source told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Stefanik’s longtime adviser Alex deGrasse will serve as the campaign’s chief strategist and CFO while Stefanik’s chief of staff, Patrick Hester, will also be involved, the source added.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, the Trump administration  pulled  Stefanik’s nomination to be US ambassador to the United Nations amid concerns over slim margins in the US House of Representatives.\n \n\n   \n  Fellow New York GOP Rep. Mike Lawler had been weighing a gubernatorial bid as well but ultimately  announced  his plans to remain in the House after Trump had  made it clear  that he would prefer for the two-term congressman to remain in the narrowly divided House rather than risk losing his competitive GOP seat.\n \n\n   \n  As she has prepared for a gubernatorial bid, Stefanik has positioned herself to take on Hochul on multiple fronts, from her views on immigrants to her endorsement of Zohran Mamdani for mayor of New York City. In a congressional hearing in  June , the pair clashed over Trump’s deployment of the National Guard to California.\n \n\n   \n  Stefanik questioned Hochul over New York’s sanctuary policies for undocumented immigrants, providing a potential preview of next year’s gubernatorial race in the Empire State.\n \n\n   \n  In May during a CNN interview when asked about a potential match up against Stefanik, Hochul  said , “I look forward to that fight. No matter who it is, it’s not settled yet, but I say bring it on.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/justice-department-black-lives-matter","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"18:15:00Z","title":"Justice Department Investigating Fraud Allegations in Black Lives Matter Movement, AP Sources Say","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Justice Department is investigating whether leaders of the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation defrauded donors who contributed tens of millions of dollars during 2020 racial justice protests.

The recent burst of investigative activity is also unfolding at a time when civil rights groups have raised concerns about the potential for the Trump administration to target a broad variety of progressive and left-leaning groups that have been critical of him, including those affiliated with BLM, the transgender rights movement and anti-ICE protesters.\n \n\n   \n  Spokespeople for the Justice Department declined to comment on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  One of the people said the investigation had been initiated during the Biden administration but is getting renewed attention during the Trump administration. A second person confirmed that allegations were examined in the Biden administration.\n \n\n   \n  The foundation said it  took in over $90 million in donations , following the 2020 murder of George Floyd, a Black man whose last breaths under the knee of a White Minneapolis police officer sparked protests across the US and around the world.\n \n\n   \n  Critics of the nonprofit foundation, and of the BLM movement broadly, have accused organizers of not being transparent about how it was spending the donations. That criticism grew louder after BLM foundation leaders in 2022 confirmed they used donations to purchase  a $6 million Los Angeles-area property  that includes a home with six bedrooms and bathrooms.\n \n\n   \n  Leaders previously have denied wrongdoing and publicly released tax documents. No prior investigations into the nonprofit’s finances have yielded proof of impropriety.\n \n\n   \n  Leaders of the foundation have received subpoenas. In a statement emailed to the AP on Thursday, the foundation said it “is not a target of any federal criminal investigation.”\n \n\n   \n  “We remain committed to full transparency, accountability, and the responsible stewardship of resources dedicated to building a better future for Black communities,” the foundation said in the statement.\n \n\n   \n  The Black Lives Matter movement first emerged in 2013 after the acquittal of George Zimmerman, the neighborhood watch volunteer who killed 17-year-old  Trayvon Martin  in Florida. But it was the 2014 death of Michael Brown at the hands of police in Ferguson, Missouri, that made the slogan “Black lives matter” a rallying cry for progressives and a favorite target of derision for conservatives.\n \n\n   \n  Movement founders and organizers pledged to build a decentralized organization governed by the consensus of BLM chapters. But as the movement’s influence grew, so did the number of organizations that became affiliated with BLM. In 2020, a tidal wave of public contributions in the aftermath of protests over Floyd’s murder came mainly to the BLM foundation, although other organizations were resourced from those funds.\n \n\n   \n  Leaders of the foundation  opened up about finances and organizational structure in 2022 , revealing detailed accountings of expenditures. The latest Form 990 filing shows the BLM foundation had $28 million in assets for the fiscal year ending June 2024.\n \n\n   \n  The investigation is being run out of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Central District of California, in Los Angeles. The top prosecutor there, Bill Essayli, was  disqualified from several cases  earlier this week after a federal judge concluded that the Trump appointee has stayed in the temporary job longer than allowed by law. It’s not clear whether Essayli’s disqualification will impact the BLM investigation. He effectively remains the office’s top prosecutor with a different title of First Assistant United States Attorney.\n \n\n   \n  Essayli had previously served as a Republican assemblyman in California, where he took up conservative causes and criticized the state’s Covid-19 restrictions. He has been outspoken against state policies to protect immigrants living in the country illegally, and he has aggressively prosecuted people who protest Trump’s ramped up immigration enforcement across Southern California.\n \n\n   \n  As a private practice attorney, he characterized BLM as a “radical organization” while defending a White couple charged in 2020 with a hate crime after they were videotaped defacing  a BLM mural in Martinez, California .\n \n\n   \n  At the time,  city-sanctioned BLM murals had been painted on roadways  in cities throughout the US in an expression of solidarity with the racial justice movement. Essayli told a San Francisco CBS TV affiliate his clients were simply expressing their political viewpoints and that they disagreed with taxpayer funds being used to “sponsor a radical organization, Black Lives Matters.”\n \n\n   \n  The couple took plea deals to resolve the case in 2022.\n \n\n   \n  At the height of the Floyd-sparked reckoning on racial injustice, some state officials vowed their own investigations in the foundation’s finances, citing their responsibility to protect residents who may have donated to BLM. But most of those probes were resolved without official action.\n \n\n   \n  In 2022, Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita filed a lawsuit against the BLM foundation for failing to comply with an investigation into the organization’s finances. Soon after, a representative of the foundation responded with the necessary information and documentation, a spokesperson for the attorney general’s office said, and the lawsuit was dismissed.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/us/release-chicago-immigration-daughter-cancer","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"17:46:00-05:00","title":"Chicago father of child fighting cancer released on bond by immigration judge","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Chicago man, Ruben Torres Maldonado, a 40-year-old painter and home renovator, was detained on October 18, 2025, at a Home Depot store under Operation Midway Blitz, a federal immigration enforcement initiative.

     Saturday, November 1, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         For Alicia Spradley, it all started with a quick prayer. Spradley from Chicago had seen the news that federal food aid was pausing at the start of November due to the government shutdown. With local food banks  already stretched thin , she worried that her neighbors might soon go hungry. So, on Monday night, she closed her eyes and asked, \"What can I do to help?\" A few hours later, she came across a post on a Facebook community group about becoming a \"grocery buddy\" — someone who buys groceries for a stranger or anyone at risk of losing their food benefits. Without hesitation, Spradley wrote her own callout, offering support. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) said funding has run dry for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — better known as SNAP or food stamps — past October. For nearly 42 million Americans who rely on the assistance, that means their debit-like EBT cards are at risk of not being refilled this month. Some states have committed funding to help fill the gap, but it's unclear how long the support can last. On Friday,  a federal judge ruled  that the USDA must use emergency funds to keep SNAP going and ordered an update by Monday. It remains unclear how the Trump administration will respond. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In response to the limbo, there has been a wave of people nationwide on social media participating in an informal grocery buddy system until benefits are restored. Some \"buddies\" are sending gift cards, while others are shopping and dropping off groceries. In her neighborhood of Rogers Park, Spradley said more than two dozen people replied to her offer — some asking for help themselves, others pointing to friends or neighbors who need the support. \"I did not think that in just a short period of time that we would get that much interest,\" said Spradley, who also runs Plate & Pathways, a small nonprofit that works to combat food insecurity. SNAP is the largest anti-hunger program in the country. Most of its recipients are seniors, people with disabilities and families with children. Similarly, Spradley said many of the people who asked for her help were elderly or working families who struggled to find the time to visit a local food pantry. \"I'm glad that people have the courage to reach out and ask for help,\" she said. Hannah Coburn, a night-shift nurse in Spokane, Wash., felt the same way when she posted a callout on her private Facebook account. At first, most of the replies were from friends cheering on the idea. Then, a message popped up in her inbox: It was from an acquaintance she had met a few times at roller derby events. \"She said that it was really hard for her to reach out,\" Coburn said. \"It didn't even occur to me that she would be someone who would lose that.\" According to Coburn, the acquaintance said she had some money set aside for groceries but ended up using the funds for unexpected car repairs. Coburn's takeaway is that anyone could be relying on SNAP benefits and sometimes, the only way to find out who needs help is to offer it first. \" I hope that more people see that and get an idea of like, 'Oh, I could do something and maybe it could be helping somebody that I actually know,' \" she said. Others say they were motivated to step in because they had experienced financial hardship firsthand. Karie Fugett, an author from Dothan, Ala., said she grew up on food stamps and, later in life, faced periods of living in her car and not knowing where her next meal would come from. \"I am lucky right now to be able to afford groceries, afford my rent, all of that, but I haven't forgotten that in the past that wasn't the case and that people helped me,\" she said. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Fugett is currently supporting two families on SNAP, totaling over $1,000. To do so, she said she plans to tap into funds that she saved to build her future house. \"I'll just figure out how to get that money back later,\" she said. \"I don't need it in this moment and other people need things in this moment, so that's a priority to me.\" Fugett also expressed frustration that families are at risk of going hungry as a result of lawmakers unable to reach an agreement to end the government shutdown. \"It's especially upsetting that it's because the people that we voted into office are not doing their job,\" she said. While grocery buddies offer immediate help, SNAP changes could cause long-term woes In North Carolina's Outer Banks, Micah Iverson, a product manager and musician, said he recently dropped off groceries for a single mother of four children in his community. The experience gave him a new perspective. \"I've never bought baby diapers before,\" he said. \"They're very expensive, in case you didn't know.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Iverson paid for the woman's groceries using a $300 gift card that he won at a trivia game. The night that he went to unload the bags into the woman's car, Iverson said they both were holding back tears. \" She kind of stopped me at the end and was like, 'I really didn't know what I was gonna do, so thank you,'\" he said. Although his gift card only lasted for one grocery trip, Iverson said he plans to check in and help out with groceries in a few weeks if SNAP remains stalled. \" We'll do this just until something changes,\" he said. The lapse in federal food and nutrition assistance isn't necessarily short-lived. Since the  One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed in July , SNAP has faced budget cuts and stricter eligibility rules. Starting this month, states must comply with new work requirements to qualify for the aid — a change that could leave  2.4 million people without benefits . Spradley in Chicago has been grappling with how to be a grocery buddy long-term. \" We're trying to figure this out as a community to make sure that we are not leaving anybody out and we are just coming up with things as we go,\" she said. Earlier this week, Spradley said she met with a mother who was panicking over how to feed her seven children this month. She handed the woman some cash — pooled from her wallet and donations — and what happened next surprised her. \" She's like, 'Anything that you know I can do to help you guys, let me know,'\" she said. \"And it just moves me because here is this person in need and they are still trying to be of service to the community.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/tech/apple-earnings-q4-iphone-17-sales","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"18:13:00Z","title":"Apple Reports Strong iPhone 17 Sales and Record Earnings, Signals AI-Driven Growth","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Apple reported fourth-quarter earnings showing a record $49 billion in iPhone sales and $102.5 billion in total revenue, slightly below Wall Street expectations.

30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Apple reported fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday that provided an early glimpse into how the iPhone 17 lineup may be catching on so far.   \n \n\n   \n  Apple’s earnings for the quarter that ended in September met analysts’ expectations on revenue but slightly missed on iPhone sales.   iPhone sales in the fourth quarter were $49 billion, up from $46.2 billion compared to the same period a   year ago but slightly lower than the $50.1 billion Wall Street was expecting. Overall revenue was $102.5 billion, an increase from $94.9 billion a year ago.\n \n\n   \n  Apple says both revenue and iPhone sales   numbers represent a record for the fourth   quarter. Services revenue, another closely watched metric ,  also hit an   all-time record at $28.8 billion, an increase from roughly $25 billion a year ago.\n \n\n   \n  During Apple’s earnings call on Thursday,   CEO Tim Cook said the company expects the December quarter’s revenue “to be the best ever for the company and the best ever for the iPhone,” suggesting strong iPhone 17 sales.\n \n\n   \n  Apple shares were up around 3% in after-hours trading.\n \n\n   \n  Wall Street is looking for assurance that Apple’s biggest revenue driver is still growing despite concerns that the company is behind in the AI race. Analysts had estimated strong demand for the iPhone 17 lineup, which Apple launched in late September.\n \n\n   \n  However, overall sales in China   shrunk compared to a year ago, with the company generating $14.5 billion in revenue in the region. In 2024, Apple earned $15 billion during the same period. Cook said on Thursday that he expects iPhone revenue to return to growth in China in the current quarter based on how the iPhone 17 is being received.\n \n\n   \n  Thursday’s results paint an early picture of iPhone sales since its fourth quarter ended on September 27, eight days after the iPhone 17 launch. Still, it’s possible that sales slowed in the July and August months as consumers waited for the iPhone 17.\n \n\n   \n  The iPhone 17 series outsold its predecessor by 14% in its first 10 days in the United States and China, according to  Counterpoint Research , with the base iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro Max being the most in demand. The iPhone Air, touted as the thinnest iPhone ever, is seeing “muted customer interest” according to UBS, which has been tracking retail wait times for new iPhones.\n \n\n   \n  Apple’s iPhone business is always under a microscope as the company’s largest revenue driver. But the tech industry is particularly paying close attention, prompted by speculation that another AI-powered gadget may eventually supplant the smartphone.\n \n\n   \n  While analysts previously grilled Apple about its AI strategy on recent earnings calls, Wall Street was more interested in the factors driving iPhone demand and the impact of tariffs. Apple said it expects to incur $1.4 billion in tariff-related costs this quarter.\n \n\n   \n  But Cook said he sees “opportunities on the App Store” for AI when asked about whether the rise of chatbots and AI apps will change how consumers use apps. He also said Apple Intelligence — a suite of AI-powered features for the iPhone and the company’s other products — is motivating people to upgrade their iPhones.\n \n\n   \n  “I would say that Apple Intelligence is a factor, and we’re very bullish on it becoming a greater factor, and that’s the way that we look at it,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Apple delayed an update to Siri earlier this year that would have brought it closer to OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini. Rivals like Google, Microsoft and Samsung,   meanwhile, continue to pour billions into their AI infrastructure.\n \n\n   \n  The earnings come in what has been a challenging year for Apple.\n \n\n   \n  The company has been impacted by   President Donald Trump’s trade war and has faced pressure from the Trump administration to make its iPhones domestically. Earlier this year it committed to investing $600 billion toward expanding its US operations. But Thursday’s earnings, along with the company surpassing a $4 trillion market capitalization earlier this week, represent a turnaround.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5592332","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"17:07:00-04:00","title":"Photos: Food banks scramble to get ready as SNAP funding deadline looms","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the U.S. government shutdown continues, 42 million SNAP recipients could lose access to food on November 1, 2025, due to the failure to refill EBT card balances.

But it was unclear hours after the rulings Friday afternoon how much assistance may be provided or when it might come. U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani in Boston ruled the Trump administration has until Monday to decide whether to pay at least partial SNAP food benefits. She declined to issue a temporary restraining order to force the administration to act before the funds run out tomorrow, finding that resuming payments at some point can still avoid irreparable harm to SNAP recipients. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In Rhode Island, U.S. District Chief Judge John J. McConnell Jr. granted a temporary restraining order while saying ending SNAP payments would harm not only people, but also local economies. The judge said the Trump administration \"must distribute\" aid from emergency reserves as soon as possible. He also said it must submit a plan on how it would comply with his order, or \"at least an update,\" by noon on Monday,  Ocean State Media reported. It is not yet clear how the two court orders would impact the flow of benefits, which are set to run out Saturday. Hours after the rulings, President Trump posted on social media that he has directed government lawyers to find a way to pay SNAP benefits. \"If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding, just like I did with Military and Law Enforcement Pay,\" he wrote. However, it's not clear what sort of legal direction the administration was seeking. The Trump administration had said it did not have enough money to pay November's SNAP benefits because of the government shutdown and that it lacked legal authority to use contingency funds set aside for emergencies. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Talwani acknowledged her order would leave millions of people without assistance starting Saturday. She issued her decision in a case filed by two dozen Democratic-led states that sued over the administration's decision to suspend the nation's largest anti-hunger program for the first time in its history. The judge said the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers SNAP, must use emergency funds to keep SNAP going. She also said other money is legally available but left the decision of how much benefits to distribute up to the administration. In Rhode Island, McConnell issued his decision in a lawsuit filed by eight cities and nonprofit and business groups.

Here's what that means across the country \n         By The NPR Network \n        \n           Updated Friday, October 31, 2025 • 7:34 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         The federal government shutdown has dragged into another week, and Republicans and Democrats appear no closer to ending it. Many  federal workers have missed paychecks , including  air traffic controllers , who are working unpaid.  Meanwhile,  uncertainty remains  for  tens of millions of people  who rely on  federal food and nutrition benefits  like Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, previously known as food stamps. The benefits had been set to expire on Saturday due to the government shutdown. Two federal judges on Friday ordered the Trump administration to use emergency funding to provide the benefits. But it was unclear after the rulings how much assistance may be provided or when it might come. Read the latest about the pair of SNAP rulings   and also, learn  how some food banks are bracing for SNAP funding to lapse The  Agriculture Department says  it will reopen about 2,100 county offices despite the government shutdown to  help farmers get access to $3 billion of aid . At the same time  many American farmers  say the Trump administration's trade policies have them on the brink. As the shutdown continues, here's the latest on what we know. Jump to state-specific impacts. Why did the federal government shut down? A  partisan argument  over if and when lawmakers need to act to extend subsidies for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces led to the current shutdown. Some  24 million people  — who don't have insurance through their jobs or a public program like Medicaid — use the system to buy health plans.  Prominent Republican lawmakers have claimed the Democrats are looking to provide tax dollars to help pay for the health care of undocumented immigrants. That is  not true . Democrats in the Senate  refused to vote  for the Republican short-term funding bill that passed the House but did not include an extension of the health care tax credits. Democrats are also hoping to repeal cuts to health care programs that were put in place as part of the GOP  spending and tax bill  that passed over the summer. NPR's Deirdre Walsh reports that some Democrats say Nov. 1 could be a  key date in talks to loosen the current gridlock . That date marks the beginning of open enrollment for people getting coverage through the ACA, when subscribers could  see big premium increases  unless the subsidies that have been helping people pay for coverage since 2021 are extended. Read more about more about the health care fight behind the shutdown here. Plus, why Democrats are casting the government shutdown as  a health care showdown . —  Selena Simmons-Duffin , NPR What about WIC and SNAP benefits ? There are no SNAP food benefits available for millions of people as of Nov. 1. It's the first time the country's largest anti-hunger program has been suspended since it began six decades ago.  On Friday,  two federal judges said this pause is likely unlawful , and the Trump administration must use emergency funds to keep the program going. But it's not clear exactly how or when that may happen. $5.5 billion in emergency funds also falls short of SNAP's November budget, which is $9 billion. That means even if the administration restarts funding, people may not get the full amount of food assistance they are eligible for. Cities and states across the country are tapping emergency funds and ramping up food donations to help the 42 million SNAP recipients. A separate nutrition program is also at risk. The Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) provides nutrition education, breastfeeding support, and other healthcare screenings for 7 million people. Last month the Trump administration shifted $300 million to keep WIC going a few more weeks. Some states are now using emergency funds to keep clinics open and benefits available, but the National WIC Association says those funds are  running out quickly . —  Jennifer Ludden , NPR Read more on the impact of this potential lapse across the country, here.  — and you can  read more here about how food banks are bracing for it   What about Head Start? Beginning Nov. 1,  more than 65,000 children will be at risk of losing access to Head Start , the federal early-learning program for low-income families. That's because federal funding for individual Head Start programs cannot be disbursed while the government is shut down. Among the states  hit hardest  by this Nov. 1 deadline: Florida, Georgia, Missouri and Ohio. Nationally, Head Start serves roughly 750,000 infants, toddlers and preschool-age children, providing not just childcare and early learning but also free meals, health screenings and family support. Local Head Start programs are funded annually, though at different times of the year. Some programs get their money on Oct. 1, others on Nov. 1 and so on. If the shutdown lasts until December, says Tommy Sheridan of the National Head Start Association, still more programs would see their funding run out. Without federal funding, Sheridan says, some programs will have to close immediately. Others have the resources to stay open at least another week, in hopes that politicians in Washington can resolve their differences. —  Cory Turner  and  Kadin Mills , NPR What the shutdown means for federal workers Altogether,  about 1.4 million civilian federal employees  across the country are going without pay,  according to the Bipartisan Policy Center , a think tank in Washington, D.C. Of those, roughly half are furloughed, which means they are not working and not getting paid, but expect to return to work once the federal shutdown is over. The other half have been deemed essential and so are continuing to work. By law federal workers are supposed to get back pay once the shutdown ends, but   the White House has tried to cast doubt on that. The Senate has  failed to advance a pair of competing measures  to pay at least some federal employees during the government shutdown.  The Trump administration has managed to move money around to ensure that some people get paid, including active duty military and law enforcement officers with the Department of Homeland Security. Many other federal workers are also still getting paid as usual during the shutdown. Salaries for some federal employees, including the vast majority of those at the Department of Veterans Affairs, do not come out of appropriations that Congress must approve every year. Are government workers being laid off during the shutdown? The Trump administration has been following through on threats to   further slash the size of government during the shutdown, seeking to layoff roughly 4,000 workers earlier this month. Some unions that represent workers are fighting back in court ;  the federal judge overseeing the case on Tuesday  indefinitely halted  the Trump administration's shutdown layoffs, noting human toll. The order applies to federal employees in programs or offices where the plaintiff unions have members or bargaining units. How is the shutdown impacting active duty military?  The White House has identified additional funding for the latest round of military paychecks despite the shutdown, according to a spokesperson for the Office of Management and Budget. The spokesperson says that the agency is using around $5 billion from a military housing fund, a military research and development fund and a Defense Department account used for building ships. NPR asked if part of the money is also coming from a $130 million donation made by a billionaire Trump ally, but the OMB did not respond. The Trump administration  earlier this month found unused research and development funds to pay many active military members  so they wouldn't miss a full paycheck earlier this month, according to a Pentagon official not authorized to speak publicly.  Military families are already seeking additional assistance from food banks and other groups to help with paying bills. USPS is 'open for business as usual' \"U.S. Postal Service operations will not be interrupted,\" according to a  statement by USPS . The postal service is primarily self-funded and doesn't depend on the appropriations process to continue running as usual. IRS furloughs nearly half its staff A  contingency plan  from the Treasury Department says that slightly more than half of the IRS' approximately 74,000 workers remain on the job and will continue to work for the foreseeable future. Some IRS employees  were issued  reduction in force, or RIF, notices  on Friday and posted screenshots of those notices informing them of their last day, Dec. 9. The contingency plan says nearly all of those employees who continue to work will be paid using sources other than annual appropriations, which are on hold during the shutdown. Tasks will include completing and testing systems to handle next year's tax-filing season, and maintaining computers to prevent the loss of data. —  Scott Horsley ,  Andrea Hsu  and  Stephen Fowler , NPR National Nuclear Security Administration furloughs 1,400 employees On Oct. 20, the National Nuclear Security Administration, which oversees the nation's nuclear weapons, said it is furloughing approximately 1,400 employees. The agency is responsible for overseeing thousands of warheads that are not currently deployed on missiles, bombers and submarines. According to an Energy Department spokesperson, the furloughs are due to the \"Democrat shutdown.\" Roughly 400 employees remain on the job providing security and safety oversight. And the office responsible for moving nuclear weapons around the country remains funded until next week. —  Geoff Brumfiel , NPR In addition, Nevada Public Radio is reporting  more than 1,000 nuclear contractors in Nevada  could receive notices by the end of the month, because their work relies on the federal government remaining open. Teachers and schools won't be directly impacted, but federal education functions might Eighty-seven percent of Department of Education employees  have been temporary furloughed , as detailed in agency shutdown contingency plans. At the same time, the administration is trying to use a new round of layoffs to gut multiple offices inside the department, including the Office for Civil Rights and the office responsible for overseeing special education, according to multiple sources within the department. This latest reduction-in-force (RIF) cut at least 121 staffers responsible for overseeing roughly  $15 billion  in special education funding and for making sure states provide special education services to the nation's more than 7.5 million children with disabilities. The courts  have halted  those layoffs. If they're ultimately allowed to go through, multiple sources told NPR the special education office would be left with just a handful of top executives and support staff. In addition, many Department of Education employees who were furloughed  were surprised to see  a message blaming Democrats for the government shutdown inserted into their out-of-office replies. A federal workers union is  suing the Trump administration  for inserting the language into employees' out-of-office email messages. —  Shannon Bond  and  Cory Turner , NPR The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) for 2026 went live as scheduled at the start of October. As WPR's  Corrinne Hess  reports, the U.S. Department of Education says that  student financial aid programs will continue , despite the shutdown. National Parks are a mixed bag Across the country, the National Park Service (NPS) have  brought their operations to a halt . That includes the National Zoo and other Smithsonian facilities. NPR's Alana Wise  reports that the Smithsonian assured the public  that animals would still be cared for during the zoo's closure.  Animal cams  are considered nonessential and will be turned off for the remainder of the shutdown. As  KQED's Sarah Wright and Carly Severn reported , a contingency plan for the NPS says that park roads, lookouts and trails \"will generally remain accessible to visitors\" for the duration of the shutdown, but other services such as regular road and trail condition updates would not be provided. Concerns have also been raised about the safety and responsibility of keeping parks open without having a robust number of employees available to conduct critical services. The Salem, Mass. visitor center will be open through Halloween thanks to community support WBUR's Andrea Shea reports  that local leaders in Salem, Mass., learned a National Park Service visitor center and its bathrooms would be closed during their busiest tourist season so they took action on a plan to keep them open. Shea reports that  NPS agreed to let Salem reopen the center if the community covered costs  through Halloween weekend. Annie Harris — CEO of the non-profit Essex Heritage that helps staff and run the facility — sent out a flurry of emails including to the mayor. Within 48 hours businesses and non-profits raised $18,000 — keeping the center open until Nov. 2. Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security benefits will continue Social Security,   VA  and other benefits will continue. But employees at Social Security field offices earlier this month said the  government shutdown  has left them  unable to carry out an important service for some recipients . As NPR's Ashley Lopez reports, workers say they are unable to provide benefit verification letters to people calling in to request them. These  official letters  act as a sort of income verification and are therefore key to obtaining aid like housing assistance, fuel assistance and help from nonprofits. In an Oct. 21 email to users answering commonly asked questions about how shutdown impacts, SSA noted the online portal can still be used to access benefit verification letters. Some furloughed employees at the Labor Department were brought back to work, in order to complete the September inflation report, which is a key ingredient used to calculate the cost of living adjustment that Social Security recipients will receive next year. Last week,  the SSA said the payments to recipients will increase by 2.8% next year , or an increase of about $56 per month starting in January. Read more on  how a fight over health policy led to the government shutdown  from NPR's Selena Simmons-Duffin. ICE will mostly continue uninterrupted Immigration cases and enforcement are proceeding as usual during the government shutdown, with a few small exceptions. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin confirmed that the employees in the Office of Detention Oversight, which inspects immigration detention centers, is currently not working. \"We hope Democrats will open up the government swiftly so that this office can resume its work,\" McLaughlin said. According to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, DHS law enforcement, including ICE agents, will be paid for work done during the shutdown. \"More than 70,000 sworn law enforcement officers across DHS including those serving in CBP, ICE, Secret Service, TSA and other critical mission areas will be paid for all hours worked during the shutdown period,\"  Noem posted on X  last week. \"By Wednesday, October 22, law enforcement officers will receive a \"super check\" — which covers the 4 days lost, their overtime, and their next pay period.\" The U.S. Coast Guard, which is housed within DHS, will continue to be paid,  according to Noem ; funds will be appropriated in the reconciliation bill earlier this year. —  Ximena Bustillo , NPR If you're flying soon … Air traffic controllers and most Transportation Security Administration employees are considered \"essential workers\" and have to stay on the job. This week they officially missed their first full paycheck since the shutdown began.  Travelers across the U.S. are beginning to feel the impacts of the government shutdown, as air traffic control staffing shortages  disrupt flights across the country . Air traffic controllers  helped to end the last government shutdown , and could help end this one as well. According to NPR's Joel Rose, the Transportation Department says  there has been an uptick in the number of controllers  who are calling in sick. The Transportation Department says that federal subsidies for rural air travel will continue through Nov. 18,  reports Alaska Public Media's Eric Stone . The department previously said it had enough funding to continue the program through Sunday. Read more on  what a shortage of air traffic controllers could do to bring an end to the shutdown, here   The impact of the shutdown looks different in different parts of the country Some states across the country are uniquely positioned to feel the impact of the government shutdown.

November 1, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         More than 40 million Americans who rely on federal food assistance woke up to uncertainty on Saturday over whether their aid is secure or when it will resume in full. A federal judge in Rhode Island on Friday ordered the White House to use contingency funds to pay for those benefits. But it was unclear how that decision would correspond with  a separate decision  by a judge in Massachusetts telling the administration it had until \"no later than Monday\" to come up with a way to use emergency funds to pay for aid. The impasse over funding the government means that the nearly 1 in 8 U.S. residents who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, to buy groceries may be facing at least a temporary lapse in benefits. Following Friday's decisions, President Trump said he had directed government lawyers to find a way to pay for SNAP, and that he instructed them to seek further clarity on the rulings. He cautioned, however, that even with immediate guidance, benefits \"will unfortunately be delayed while States get the money out.\"  SNAP, formerly known as food stamps, is the  country's largest anti-hunger program . \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       A coalition of Democratic governors and attorneys general are suing the federal government to keep the payments flowing, arguing the benefits cannot legally be cut off. The Trump administration says it's not legal to extend the benefits using emergency funds — though the administration extended benefits during a shutdown in the first term. As congressional gridlock continues,  states are exploring what they can offer their residents  who've just lost their food aid. Eyes turning to food banks   Food bank administrators are warning that the loss of November SNAP benefits could lead to a public health crisis. Jason Riggs, the director of advocacy and public policy at Roadrunner Food Bank of New Mexico, likens it to the recession 17 years ago and the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"This is a huge increase in need, but that's where comparisons end,\" he said. \"When [those] happened, there was a robust SNAP program, with all its flaws, doing what it is designed to do. And that's the difference with what's happening right now — there will not be SNAP. There will just be the same kind of catastrophic need for food.\" More than 21% of New Mexico residents receive SNAP benefits, the highest rate in the nation. People are  turning to food banks to help fill in the assistance gap , but administrators caution they aren't designed to act as a safety net for a government program. \"It's very daunting,\" Riggs told NPR. \"SNAP can provide nine times the amount of meals as the entire nationwide food bank network.\" Central Texas Food Bank CEO Sari Vatske said shutdowns aren't like other food crises. \"In a situation during a natural disaster where we could rely on our sister food banks for support, with this government shutdown, we are all experiencing the same need,\" she said. Businesses that partner with grocery retailers and restaurants to take surplus or near-expired food and sell it at a heavy discount, like Too Good To Go and Flashfood, are trying to reach people affected. Flashfood CEO Jordan Schenck said the organization has seen a spike in downloads in the last few days. \"That started as [the SNAP cliff] really became more prevalent in the media. We've definitely seen more traffic,\" Schenck told NPR. The view from Capitol Hill   One month into the shutdown, there is no concrete off-ramp. The Senate left D.C. on Thursday for the weekend, ahead of two major pain points of the shutdown coming into sharper relief on Saturday: the SNAP cliff, and the start of open enrollment for health insurance plans sold on the exchanges as part of the Affordable Care Act. Health care has been at the center of Congressional Democrats' shutdown strategy. They have demanded that Republicans negotiate with them to  extend the enhanced subsidies , which were boosted during the pandemic. They are set to expire at the end of the year. If nothing changes, Americans who purchase healthcare via the exchange could see their  premiums skyrocket . At a Thursday town hall with Maryland Democrats, including Sen. Angela Alsobrooks, Democratic constituents urged the party to hold the line. \"I think they should hold out as long as possible,\" said Maryland voter Christina Thompson. \"It's clear whose shutdown this is. Republicans hold all the leverage and all the cards. And if we back out now, then we're just showing again the party has no backbone.\" Republicans have maintained throughout the month-long shutdown that Democrats must first vote alongside them to fund the government, before addressing the health care subsidies. The typically subdued Senate Majority Leader John Thune R-S.D.,  reproached Democrats  on the floor Wednesday after they tried to pass a measure that would fund SNAP and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC). \"This isn't a political game,\" Thune said, raising his voice. \"These are real people's lives we're talking about and you all just figured out 29 days that, oh there might be some consequences?\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-96140","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"13:19:00-04:00","title":"Dodgers force World Series to decisive Game 7 by holding off Blue Jays 3-1","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Toronto Blue Jays 3-1 on Friday night, forcing a decisive Game 7 in the 2025 World Series.

Yamamoto was not quite as sharp as in his Game 2 four-hitter, the first World Series complete game in a decade. He lasted six innings and allowed an RBI single in the third by George Springer, who returned after missing two games with an injury to his right side. Rookie relievers Justin Wrobleski and Roki Sasaki combined for six outs before starter Tyler Glasnow came out of the bullpen to escape a ninth-inning jam and rescue the Dodgers. Glasnow needed only three pitches to do it. With runners on second and third and nobody out, he got Ernie Clement to pop up his first delivery on the infield for an easy out. Andrés Giménez then hit a line drive to left field that Kiké Hernández turned into a game-ending double play. Hernández caught the ball on the run in shallow left-center and fired to second base, where Miguel Rojas made a tough pick of a one-hop throw to double off Addison Barger. \"I was playing a little more shallow than the card wanted me to. But given the situation, really fast guy at second base, I was like, you know what? I'm going to play really, really shallow. If he hits it over my head, kudos to him. I feel like his pop is more to the pull side,\" Hernández said. \"Somehow I was able to hear that the bat broke even with that crowd. The crazy thing is I had no idea where the ball was because it was in the lights the whole time. But given the situation in the game, the World Series on the line and how good I was hitting tonight, I was like, it's going to hit me in the face — but I'm not stopping. I'm not pulling up. And at the very end, the ball came out of the lights and went into my glove.\" It was the first 7-4 game-ending double play in postseason history, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. \"I gave him a really hard throw to catch. I think it was a better pick than it was a play on my end,\" Hernández said. Sasaki plunked Alejandro Kirk with an 0-2 pitch to begin the inning, and Barger hit a ground-rule double to left-center that got wedged at the bottom of the wall. That's when Dodgers manager Dave Roberts summoned Glasnow. \"I just felt right there, Roki wasn't as sharp and I felt right there, Glas is a guy who has swing-and-miss stuff and I just wanted to bet on him,\" Roberts said. \"He's been chomping at the bit to make an impact.\" Max Scherzer will start Game 7 on Saturday night for the Blue Jays. The three-time Cy Young Award winner also started the last World Series Game 7, getting a no-decision when Washington won the 2019 title over Houston. \"These guys are really good at kind of just turning the page,\" Toronto manager John Schneider said. \"That will take a while to kind of unpack. That's a wild ending. I love the way we played.\" Glasnow had been lined up to potentially start for the Dodgers, seeking to become the first team to win consecutive titles since the New York Yankees won three straight from 1998-2000. Two-way star Shohei Ohtani also could be used as an opener. \"I think right now, there's no wrong answer,\" Roberts said. \"He's certainly going to be a part of the pitching plan, and with Shohei, it could be two innings, but it could be four innings. So I'm not sure where we're going to slot him. We're going to have to talk to him first on where he feels most comfortable.\" Los Angeles kept alive its bid for a third title in six seasons and its hopes to be recognized as a dynasty. \"Man, we live for Game 7, so here we go,\" Roberts said. Yamamoto, a 27-year-old right-hander in his second season with the Dodgers after winning three MVP awards in Japan, was coming off the first consecutive postseason complete games since 2001. He allowed one run and five hits with six strikeouts and a walk, stranding two runners in the sixth when he struck out Daulton Varsho with a splitter on his 96th and final pitch. Yamamoto is 4-1 with a 1.56 ERA in five postseason starts and has a 1.20 ERA in his two Series outings. Kevin Gausman lost to Yamamoto for the second time despite matching a Series record by striking out eight in the first three innings behind a dominant splitter. Tommy Edman doubled with one out in the third for the Dodgers' first hit. Ohtani was intentionally walked for the fifth time in the Series and Will Smith hit an RBI double off the left-field wall on a high splitter. Freddie Freeman walked, bringing up Betts. The three-time World Series champion entered just 3 for 23 in the Series and had been dropped from second to third in the lineup for Game 5. He was moved down another slot to cleanup Friday, his lowest in the batting order since 2017. Behind 1-2 in the count, Betts fouled off two pitches and laced Gausman's third straight fastball between shortstop and third for a 3-0 lead. That ended an 0-for-13 stretch with the bases loaded for the Dodgers that dated to the Division Series. \"Honestly, man, I know it hasn't been great for me,\" Betts said. \"But this year really hasn't been great. I just want to be there to help the boys. I came up in a big spot. ... I just was able to find a way to lock in.\" Seeking their first World Series title since 1993, the Blue Jays wore powder blue uniforms at home for the first time since September after getting wins with them in Games 4 and 5 in LA. Toronto scored when Barger doubled to start the third and came around on Springer's two-out single. Gausman gave up three runs and six hits in six innings, getting 15 swings and misses with his splitter. Sasaki, a starter turned reliever as the Dodgers tried to shore up their bullpen, escaped a two-on, one-out jam in the eighth by retiring Bo Bichette on a foulout and Varsho on a groundout. Up next Scherzer and Glasnow started Game 3, won by the Dodgers 6-5 in 18 innings. A 41-year-old right-hander, Scherzer will become the fourth pitcher to start multiple World Series winner-take-all Game 7s after Bob Gibson (1964, '67, '68), Lew Burdette and Don Larsen (both 1957 and '58). Scherzer allowed two runs over five innings for Washington against Houston in 2019, and the Nationals rallied for a 6-2 win. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5551126","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Could Smaller Families 'Rewild' the Planet — and Make Humans Happier?","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the growing global trend of smaller families, driven by women's choices to delay or forgo motherhood, which has led to declining birthrates and population decline in many developed nations.

    \n        \n           Heard on  Weekend Edition Saturday \n        \n      \n\n         Families in the U.S. and around the world are having fewer children as people make profoundly different decisions about their lives. NPR's series  Population Shift: How Smaller Families Are Changing the World  explores the causes and implications of this trend. On a late autumn day, John Davis hiked through what looks like wild forest in New York's Champlain Valley, surrounded by flaming red maple trees and yellow birch. A bird flushed noisily through the undergrowth. \"Look there, a ruffed grouse,\" he said, his delight obvious.     This place is an example of what Davis calls \"rewilding,\" which means the footprint of human activity has begun to fade.   \"It simply means stepping back and letting nature unfold as it will,\" he said. \"Some of this was farmed as recently as the 1990s. Probably used for sheep pasture and certainly for logging. You're seeing old stone walls.\" Populations in many countries are beginning to age rapidly and gradually decline, in large part due to individuals choosing to have fewer children.   It's a trend that alarms many experts, and politicians, who say the fabric of whole communities could unravel, but many activists, researchers and economists also see big upsides. This part of New York state, Essex County, has  lost about 6% of its population  since 2010 due to out-migration and the declining birthrate.     Davis, who works for an organization called the Rewilding Institute, says the pivot toward fewer people is allowing landscapes like this one to heal. \"I have a perhaps unpopular view on human population, I believe we are too many and we consume too much,\" he said. \"We need to encourage a small family ethic, especially among affluent people.\" Upsides: More choice and a huge decline in teen pregnancy The global population has doubled to more than 8 billion since the 1970s. Davis thinks that growth turbocharged consumerism and accelerated climate change and the loss of wildlife habitat.  \"I love kids, we all love kids,\" Davis said. \"But if we could encourage small families, we'd have a better chance addressing not just the extinction [of species] and climate crisis, but also problems of poverty and inequity.\"  That hope is being tested, as the \"small family ethic\" championed by Davis and other activists arrives in much of the world.   Since the 1970s, researchers say family size dropped by more than half, from about five children per woman on average to roughly two,  according to the latest United Nations data .   Actual population decline has already begun in about half the G7 industrialized countries that make up much of the world's economic activity.   Every one of those countries, including the U.S. has  fallen below the so-called \"replacement rate\"  of births needed to maintain a stable population over the long term.   Without  large-scale immigration, the U.S.  will join the list of countries losing population in the coming decades. Experts say the trend is driven in large part by women choosing to delay having children, having fewer kids, and in many cases, deciding not become mothers at all. \"I just really wanted to do other things with my life,\" said Marian Starkey, who told NPR she and her husband opted not to have children.   \"Most of my friends here don't have children.  People have made the decision they also want to do other things with their lives than raise children.\"  Starkey works with a group called Population Connection that advocates in favor of policies that support this shift toward smaller families and gradual depopulation.   According to Starkey, fewer people will mean a healthier environment, but she also thinks the trend is good news for humans.   \"The smaller families are, the more time and wealth there is to invest in each child, making sure all of your kids get an education, which does not happen in all parts of the world, especially for girls,\" she said. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Many experts are voicing deep concerns about this population shift. They say it's not clear how economies and family structures that have relied for decades on steady growth will function as communities age and begin to decline.   \"I think this has huge implications for which we're not prepared as a society,\" said Martina Yopo-Díaz, a sociologist at the Catholic University in Santiago, Chile, who studies population loss,  in a July interview with NPR . \"Key social systems, from the economy to the labor market to pensions, are based on the principle that there will be new generations to replace the old ones. But now we see that that principle is no longer something that we can, you know, take as given.\" But NPR also found experts who who view this as a hopeful moment, part of a decades-long trend with benefits for the environment, families and women. Claudia Goldin, an economist at Harvard University, said fears about declining population are overblown. She says there's evidence people are happier when free to decide for themselves if and when to have kids.   \"To have the number of children they want to have, and to have them at the right time in their lives, is certainly a benefit to couples,\" she said.   None of the advocates for lower population interviewed by NPR favor efforts that force people to have fewer kids, like China's infamous \"One Child\" policy, which ended in 2016. Instead they support access to reproductive freedom, family planning information, and contraception. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Goldin and other experts said the biggest single upside to the trend toward smaller families may be improvements in the lives of women and girls.  Research shows delaying motherhood  and having fewer children  often leads to more education, more financial security  and better health.  \"The ability of women to decide how many children to have and when to have them, it's something that is a very positive development in the history of mankind,\" said Vladimíra Kantorová, the lead population scientist at the United Nations.   Kantorová points to the fact that much of the falling birthrate in the U.S. and around the world reflects a plunge in teen and child pregnancy. \"Adolescent child bearing has declined everywhere, so this is something that is really a success story,\" she said. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Those who see advantages in this population shift generally agree that smaller families and declining birthrates will bring serious policy challenges. Finding workers, maintaining a strong economy and weaving a sense of community could be more difficult in many areas.  One question is how to fund the social safety net and healthcare for rising numbers of elderly, when there are fewer young people. John Davis says he doesn't have answers to all those challenges but he's hopeful people will find ways to navigate this transition.   \"If the smartest young minds in the world were dedicated to figuring how a declining population could support its elders, we would achieve that goal,\" he said. \"I think we'd have a happier world, for people and wildlife.\"  \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5593453","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-20:00","title":"Election Day is Tuesday: 5 Questions About What the Results Might Mean","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The 2025 off-year elections are being closely watched as a barometer of public sentiment toward President Trump and the Republican Party, particularly among independents.

     Election Day is Tuesday. Here are 5 questions about what the results might mean \n         By Domenico Montanaro \n        \n           Saturday, November 1, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Off-year elections are often a referendum on the president and his party. And this year, of course, that means President Trump and Republicans. Trump is unpopular, particularly with independents, who will be key in swing districts in next year's midterm elections. So the narratives and the margins coming out of the Nov. 4 elections will matter — and offer some clues as to how the landscape for 2026 begins to take shape. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Here are five questions to consider when thinking about Tuesday's elections: 1. How much of a drag is Trump? Republicans lost 40 House seats during Trump's first midterm in 2018. Just before that election, Trump's approval rating, according to Gallup, was  40 %. Now, it's an almost identical  41 %. Democrats have certainly been trying to use Trump a lot in the 2025 elections, mentioning him often in ads, and trying to tie their Republican opponents to him. Republican candidates in these elections have largely steered clear of the president. Partially, that's because the most closely watched elections Tuesday are taking place in states that lean left — governors' races in Virginia and New Jersey, the New York mayor's race and the fight over a ballot initiative in California. But these elections have a history of moving in the direction of the party opposite of the president's. That's because they're among the first chances for voters aligned with the party out of power to register their frustration. It's why, for example, the governor's race in Virginia has gone to the opposition party in 11 of the last 12, dating back to 1977. (The exception was Democrat Terry McAuliffe during Obama's presidency.) It's a necessary, perennial caveat that too much shouldn't be made out of off-year elections and what they mean for midterms, but Tuesday's elections will be the first major electoral sign of the political mood in the county — and what voters think of the president. 2. Will Democrats have a chance at counterbalancing Republican redistricting efforts?  Maybe the most important election Tuesday is one in California when  voters decide on Proposition 50. The state is currently mandated to redraw congressional districts by an independent commission. But voting in favor of Prop 50 Tuesday would temporarily overturn that requirement and give Democrats the chance to try and offset gains Trump is trying to make in redrawing  in red states like Texas . This will also be an early test of Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a likely 2028 presidential candidate. The \"No\" campaign has run ads urging people to stop Newsom's \"power grab.\" Newsom himself has run ads for the \"Yes\" campaign and opponents have pulled back the millions they had been promising to spend. A sign of the direction this is headed Tuesday? 3. Are Latinos shifting away from Republicans? Trump made inroads with Latinos in the 2024 presidential election. In fact, he did better with Latinos than any Republican in history, according to exit polls. But there have been signs in polling during this second Trump term that they are slipping from the president and the GOP. That's come amid Trump's mass deportations that have rounded up far more than the hardened criminals Trump's administration promised — and Trump's lack of focus on getting prices down, a key reason many switched sides to vote for Trump. One place to watch as an indicator is New Jersey. Though Trump lost the state in 2024, he made significant improvements, particularly in counties with heavy Latino populations. For those playing at home, the counties to watch here include Passaic (45% Latino, per the Census), Hudson (41%), Cumberland (36%) and Union (35%). Trump improved in all of them from his 2020 national loss to 2024 win. He was the first Republican to win Passaic since 1992. He won it by about 3 points after losing it by 16 points four years earlier and 22 points in 2016. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       4. What messaging lessons do Democrats take out of Tuesday?  There are very different candidates running in these elections. And they are likely to serve as different examples over the next year of how to run — or not — as a Democrat. For New York mayor, for example,  Zohran Mamdani has captured  the imaginations of progressives with his focus on affordability. But he's also become a lightning rod on the right for his criticisms of Israel and past tweets calling for defunding the police. He has since disavowed the idea of defunding the police and says safety is a top priority. How he does Tuesday — and, more importantly, how he governs, if he wins — could indicate whether Democrats nationally run with his message and style, or if they prefer the more reserved approach of their gubernatorial candidates in Virginia and New Jersey. Abigail  Spanberger in Virginia  is running on \"tradition\" and \"service,\" and Mikie  Sherrill in New Jersey  stresses her military credentials. But the truth is Democrats are in the wilderness, and there's no perfect way to run. First of all, candidates have to be authentic, true to themselves. Few will be able to replicate Mamdani's knack for using social media. And Mamdani can't invent being a CIA officer (Spanberger) or Navy helicopter pilot (Sherrill). What his campaign has exposed most is that a focus on affordability with a clear message and a lack of condescension toward a younger generation has been key for winning over younger progressives. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Of course, not everywhere is New York and progressives aren't a majority of voters. That's something Democrats, in particular, have to balance as the party has traditionally had a wider range of views and identities. 5. What will the elections mean for the shutdown?  The country is careening toward the longest government shutdown in American history. There is no real end in sight, but Tuesday's results may have an impact. Health care has been a major reason for this shutdown. Democrats want to extend subsidies before they expire at the end of the year so tens of millions of people don't see their premiums go way up. Republicans are refusing to negotiate until the government is reopened, but Democrats are skeptical they would negotiate in good faith at all. During the  longest shutdown in history in 2019 , polling clearly showed a majority blaming Trump for the shutdown. That put pressure on Trump to come to the table. But this time around, even though Republicans are getting  more of the blame , it's not as overwhelming as six years ago. And that has the two sides in a stalemate. Tuesday could shake that up, especially if there are definitive results in one direction or the other. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5582617","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00Z","title":"How One Legal Team is Building Support for People with Cognitive Disabilities","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Noah Cox, a lawyer in the Los Angeles County Public Defender's Office, noticed that many of his clients with cognitive impairments struggled to communicate and understand basic concepts.

November 1, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         A few years ago, Noah Cox noticed something about some of the people he represented in court. They struggled to communicate, think logically or problem solve. \"I wanted to know their account of what happened, and I'd ask them questions. And many of them would struggle with a basic explanation,\" says Cox, a lawyer in the Los Angeles County Public Defender's Office. \"It seemed like they were having challenges related to some sort of intellectual ability.\" What Cox was seeing was indicative of a broader trend: Studies show people with  intellectual and developmental disabilities  are overrepresented in the nation's prisons and jails. He set out to break that pattern, forming a team within the public defender's office known as the neurocognitive disorder team. It's a pioneering effort built on the premise that prison is not always the right place for people with these types of disabilities. 'A cycle of being involved in the system' There are many reasons why someone might experience a cognitive impairment, including conditions such as Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, Down Syndrome, a traumatic brain injury, or an intellectual disability, which can limit learning and everyday tasks. But many of Cox's clients were never diagnosed with any sort of disability. That doesn't surprise Leigh Anne McKingsley, senior director of disability and justice initiatives for The Arc, a nonprofit that advocates for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. \"Often the disability goes unrecognized,\" McKingsley says. \"They could have gone through their school system not ever really passing much, but it never got documented.\" She says it can be easy for people like this to fall through the cracks. That can lead to trouble. Compared to the general population, people with intellectual and developmental disabilities are  more likely to be the victims of violent crimes . But that can go in the other direction, too. \"Often people with intellectual disabilities are misunderstood, and that can lead to this cycle of being involved in the system,\" McKingsley says. A person with this kind of impairment may not understand consequences or be able to discern who's a friend and who isn't. They can be highly suggestible, McKingsley says, and more easily led during a police interrogation. \"They go into a system that doesn't address their disability. They probably come out much worse and more likely to commit more crime or get involved with people that will,\" she says. 'I wasn't aware' Jimmy is 56, and a native of East LA. He's wirey, with tattoos on his neck and glasses that are a little too big for his face. NPR is not using his last name because he and his family worried about the stigma of his criminal record. For as long as he can remember, he has been getting in trouble – with family, with teachers, with the police. \"I wasn't aware of anything, that anything was even wrong,\" he says. \"It took me a while to understand things.\" Jimmy has been homeless, struggled with substance abuse, and been in and out of prison most of his life. He came to Cox's office on a burglary charge. It was a third strike, meaning he already had two violent felonies on his record and would now face a harsher sentence. \"I remember meeting Jimmy,\" Cox says. \"He was trying very hard to tell me something that was very important to him. But I could not understand what he was trying to say.\" Cox asked the judge to appoint a neuropsychologist to evaluate Jimmy. His initial testing showed weak cognitive skills, and an IQ low enough to indicate impairment. \"It became apparent that this was somebody who had a developmental disability, who had not been identified when he was young,\" Cox says. 'They were actually trying to help' Cox, along with a small team of paralegals, interns and social workers, wanted to make the argument that a diversion program, an alternative to prison, would be more appropriate for Jimmy. Being diagnosed with a developmental disability, defined as beginning in childhood, would make Jimmy eligible for California's regional centers, a network that provides support to people with these conditions. Access to such support could improve his chances at diversion. So the team gathered as many records as they could, and interviewed Jimmy's family to get a sense of his childhood. \"They were actually trying to help him. And it was very new to us,\" his sister Sylvia says. Sylvia has always known something was different about her brother. He was late to crawl and speak. He couldn't remember how to adjust the bathtub water temperature. He struggled in school. She says he started getting in trouble with police before he even hit his teen years. \"I think it was a self-fulfilling prophecy for him. The more he was labeled bad, I think the more he became bad,\" she says. After all the interviews and tests, Jimmy was diagnosed with a mild intellectual disability, one he'd had since he was a child. He was 54 years old. 'I'm not frustrated anymore' Skeptics of diversion say they can be too lenient on offenders. But Ricardo Garcia, the public defender who leads the LA County office, says if done right, it can address a person's underlying issues, whether they're related to mental health, substance abuse, or a cognitive disorder. \"You give them purpose and you teach them the skills for self-determination,\" Garcia says. \"It's not telling individuals how to live their life better. It's showing them options so they become aware and can decide for themselves with all the best information available to live the life that most people want to live.\" Jimmy is now a third of the way through his two-year diversion plan. He lives in a group home, attends therapy, and most days he comes to LA's Ladera Park as part of a day program that works with adults with disabilities. His days are looking a lot different than they used to. \"I go to my therapy. I come to this program. I'm busy all the time,\" Jimmy says. \"All I can say is that it offers more than prison has to offer me, because I've just changed my life completely. I don't even use drugs anymore. I'm not homeless anymore. I'm not frustrated anymore. I've traded in my life for a new one.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5584119","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-04:00","title":"Too many rats?

Birth control is one city's answer \n         By Ari Daniel \n        \n           Saturday, November 1, 2025 • 7:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         In Somerville, Massachusetts just outside of Boston, everyone has a horror story about the rats. Adeline Lining says they ruined Christmas for her last year.  She had received a delivery of Bartlett pears. \"They were on my porch for two hours,\" she says. \"And then my neighbor texted me a picture and was like, 'You probably don't want these anymore.' No, I don't want them anymore because there were rats inside the box feasting on my Christmas pears. They are directly responsible for ruining Christmas,\" she says. Then there's Donine Williams who says that a couple years back, rats got under her deck, chewed through the subfloor, and nested in the insulation. \"I could smell the urine and their poo,\" she says. \"I can still smell it.\" And Andrew Jefferies can't un-remember the noises he heard at his last apartment. \"All night in the summer, the rats would scream\" as they rifled through his trash, he says. He requested new trash cans but they chewed right through them. Matter-of-factly, he concludes \"rats are crazy.\"  Now, the city of Somerville is trying to control these rats (and perhaps save Christmas in the process) by introducing a safer form of rodent birth control. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"I have no illusion that we can  actually outsmart the rats ,\" says Williams. \"But if we could just reduce them, that would be good.\" City officials agree and they've launched a field trial to evaluate the new approach. A ratty world Rats aren't just nuisances. They cause real problems. \"Rats can carry diseases — mostly leptospirosis [and] hantavirus,\" says  Alicia Privett , Somerville's Environmental Health Coordinator — aka the  city's rat czar . \"They also are one of the leading causes of property damage.\" That's because they chew through wires, fencing, decks, and even cinderblock to keep their incisors trim. In addition, rats create extensive underground tunneling. According to  Sam Lipson , the Senior Director of Environmental Health in Cambridge, Mass., when the one-mile red line subway extension was built between Harvard and Porter Squares in the 1980s, the digging unearthed thousands of rat tunnels. \"You gotta admire their tenaciousness, their ability to adapt,\" allows Privett. Even so, she says, \"they're like my ultimate nemesis.\" Public servants Privett and Lipson have thrown all sorts of things at the problem, trying to keep rat numbers down and their vandalism contained. But homeowners and renters don't always follow best practices like improving sanitation and reducing the animals' shelter and food options. Plus, the whiskered bandits outwit traps. And they penetrate supposedly impenetrable containers. \"You can try as much as you can to get rid of them and sometimes they'll still find a way 'cause they're just so scrappy,\" says Privett. \"In my opinion, I don't think anything's rat proof.\" Even attempts at poisoning can backfire when pets or birds of prey eat the rats or the bait and get sick or die. Rat birth control For all these reasons, Somerville is trying something else — an anti-fertility chemical that targets the mature eggs in female rats. \"It basically stops the pregnancy before it starts,\" says Lipson, who's overseeing the field trial of the product at several sites in Cambridge and Somerville. He says the birth control doesn't lead to permanent infertility. Rather, it acts on the rats only while it's circulating in the bloodstream. \"You need to have a steady supply or diet of this in order to have an effect on the local population,\" says Lipson. The goal, however, is not total eradication. \"That is not going to happen,\" he says. The idea is if the overall population can be lowered, other efforts to minimize rat activity will be more successful. This is why Lipson and his colleagues are testing whether this chemical, when dispensed in bait boxes in a dense and variable urban environment, might lead to less overall rat activity. \"And if we find that it does, I think we'll make that part of our city strategy,\" he says. Fighting the rat-riarchy The field trial relies on community volunteers. Privett and  Dave Power  — Cambridge's rat czar — lead four residents on an orientation in south Somerville. \"We just appreciate the extra hands,\" he says. \"I'll show y'all how to check for rodent activity in the area and on the properties,\" says Privett, including cut throughs under fences, telltale trails in the grass, scattered food waste, and signs of burrowing. She walks through how to examine the bait boxes that are scattered across a handful of people's yards in this part of Somerville. \"You just push in and it'll pop up,\" she explains. Over the course of about a year, the city will gauge whether the approach helps. At the very least, the volunteers will help encourage their neighbors to comply with other measures that help reduce rat numbers. \"That education component is the thing that I'm looking forward to the most,\" says Privett. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"We really want to raise levels of knowledge and consciousness among residents and property owners,\" Lipson adds. \"When the level of discourse around rat control goes up, we expect there to be greater awareness of doing the right thing.\" \n         \n         Transcript \n         MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:   No one wants rats scurrying around their neighborhood, but they are a cunning and ever-evasive foe. Now a community near Boston is trying a different approach - rat birth control. Reporter Ari Daniel has more. ARI DANIEL, BYLINE: I'm outside a school in Somerville, Massachusetts, with a few locals. And it seems like everyone's got a horror story about the rats here - like Adeline Lining. ADELINE LINING: I get, like, the beautiful Bartlett pears every Christmas. And this year, they were on my porch for two hours. And then my neighbor texted me a picture and he was like, you probably don't want these anymore. No, I don't want them anymore because there were rats inside the box feasting on my Christmas pears. DANIEL: It was a delivery. LINING: Yeah, it was a delivery. DANIEL: And they ruined Christmas. LINING: They did. ANDREW JEFFERIES: Rats are crazy. DANIEL: Andrew Jefferies says he can't unremember (ph) the noises he heard at his last apartment. JEFFERIES: All night in the summer, the rats would, like, scream. DANIEL: As they, like, bathed in your trash? JEFFERIES: Yeah. We, like, requested new trash cans. They ate through, like, the bottom and the top. DANIEL: Besides being nuisances, the rodents cause real problems. Alicia Privett is Somerville's environmental health coordinator, aka the city's rat czar. ALICIA PRIVETT: Rats can carry diseases, mostly leptospirosis, hantavirus. And then they also are one of the leading causes of property damage. DANIEL: Due to the way they chew through wires, fencing, decks, even cinder block to keep their incisors trim, not to mention their extensive underground tunneling. One local health official told me when the subway was extended a mile in the '80s in neighboring Cambridge, the digging unearthed thousands of rat tunnels. PRIVETT: They're, like, my ultimate nemesis. You got to admire their tenaciousness, their ability to adapt. DANIEL: People like Privett have thrown all sorts of things at the problem, trying to keep rat numbers down and their vandalism contained. But residents don't always follow best practices. And the rats? They outwit our traps, penetrate so-called impenetrable containers. PRIVETT: In my opinion, I don't think anything's rat-proof 'cause they're just so scrappy. DANIEL: And even attempts at poisoning can backfire when pets or raptors eat the rats or the bait and get sick or die. So Somerville is trying something else - an antifertility chemical that targets female rats. SAM LIPSON: So it basically stops the pregnancy before it starts. DANIEL: Sam Lipson is the senior director of environmental health in Cambridge, and he's overseeing a field trial of the chemical in Cambridge and here in Somerville. Lipson says the birth control doesn't lead to permanent infertility, only while it's circulating in the rat's bloodstream. The goal, however, is not total eradication. LIPSON: That is not going to happen. The idea of bringing the sea level down is sort of the way I think about it because other types of bait and efforts to minimize rat activity are going to be way more successful if you can bring the overall population down. DANIEL: So Lipson and his colleagues are testing whether this chemical, when dispensed in bait boxes in a dense and variable urban environment, might lead to less overall rat activity. LIPSON: And if we find that it does, I think we'll make that part of our city strategy. PRIVETT: All right, let's go get this started. DANIEL: The field trial relies on community volunteers, and Alicia Privett's leading four of them on an orientation. PRIVETT: We're going to head over this way. DANIEL: She walks through how to look for rodent activity and check the bait boxes that are in a handful of people's yards in this part of Somerville. PRIVETT: You just push in, it'll pop up. (SOUNDBITE OF BAIT BOX OPENING) DANIEL: Over the course of a year or so, the city will gauge whether the approach helps. Donene Williams, a longtime resident of Somerville, is one of the volunteers. Her job will be to search out evidence of rats and fill the boxes with the antifertility bait. DONENE WILLIAMS: I have no illusion that we can actually outsmart the rats, but if we could just reduce them, that would be good. DANIEL: She calls her involvement a form of resistance.

researchers unravel a dinosaur mummy mystery \n         By Bill Chappell \n        \n           Saturday, November 1, 2025 • 6:02 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         You might not think a paleontologist looking for 66-million-year-old fossils would need to ask a rancher about his great-grandmother's job in the Wyoming badlands. But that's what Paul Sereno, a paleontologist at the University of Chicago, did when he was trying to track down a historic site where a famous dinosaur mummy was found in 1908. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Sereno's work, published in the journal   Science , brings new clarity about the appearance of the duck-billed  Edmontosaurus annectens , a massive herbivore from the Cretaceous period. Sereno and his team's painstaking work reveals the dinosaur's hooves and spiky tail in exquisite detail. They studied how a fragile clay template can create dinosaur \"mummies.\" But first they had to find them. \"It involved sleuthing archives and finding photographs from these original excavations that no one knew of, and then also talking to ranchers,\" Sereno says of the research. \n       \n       Youtube Video \n       Looking for a post office  Sereno was hunting for the spot where the famed collector Charles Sternberg discovered a dinosaur mummy in the rough terrain of eastern Wyoming. He managed to find historical photos and a note from Sternberg recounting his path to the site, back in the era of horse-drawn carriages. There were references to Warren, Wyo., — a town that, Sereno says, \"doesn't exist on any map.\" So, he asked around at nearby ranches. \"One of the ranchers had a great-grandmother that was the postmaster of Warren, Wyoming,\" Sereno says. In those days, the post office was on a ranch, he adds. \"And from that, I can calculate a distance to one of the mummies that were found in 1908,\" Sereno says. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The area has come to be known as \"the mummy zone,\" where a very thick layer of river sand captured dinosaurs' bodies and preserved valuable information about them. As technicians removed grains of sand from the  Edmontosaurus  specimens, Sereno was fascinated by what they found. \"A mummy is actually a mask of the body, very thin, like the clay you'd put on your face to clean out your pores,\" he says of their specimens. \"And that's what's trapped in the sediment, and not a replacement of the actual skin.\" Vital details about the large dinosaur were captured in fragile clay templates, just one-hundredth of an inch thick. \"For once, we know what a large dinosaur looks like from head to toe,\" Sereno says. \"We've got the bill at the front end, the hooves ... and samples of everything in between, including the crest on the back, the spikes on the tail. We know it, and you could depict it, and it's accurate.\" \"With one exception,\" he adds. \"We don't know the color.\" The two specimens include an adult nicknamed \"Ed Sr.\" and a late juvenile dubbed \"Ed Jr.\" — \"the only juvenile dinosaur mummy ever discovered,\"  according to the university . \"The feet are beautiful\" Sereno's study quickly caught the eye of other experts on the duckbill dinosaur, including Clint Boyd, the paleontology program manager for the North Dakota Geological Survey. His agency has its own  Edmontosaurus  specimen (\"Dakota the Dinosaur Mummy\"), so I asked Boyd what he thinks of Sereno's study. \"The feet are beautiful,\" Boyd says, adding that the new study jibes with much of his agency's work. Both Boyd and Sereno say that some of the terminology in their field could confuse a layperson. They stress that these mummies are nothing like Egyptian mummies, for instance. And when they say  Edmontosaurus  had hooves, they warn not to think of   a horse hoof. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"What they're talking about is a hoof like what you see on like a rhino, which absolutely that's what it looks like,\" Boyd says, describing a prominent nail in the front of fleshy pads. Boyd says that while Sereno's specimens are different from what he and his colleagues are working on, the new paper resolves important questions and will help drive new research. \"It's a very thorough study, which is great,\" Boyd says. \"We needed a very good baseline for understanding at least one set of dinosaur mummies in order to then have a reference point to start comparing back to other specimens. So this has been a very long-needed addition to the science.\" Kindling an interest in paleontology This isn't Sereno's first dinosaur rodeo. He's  made big discoveries before . His email address doesn't even use his name; instead, it just says, \"dinosaur.\" The mummy study closes a meaningful loop in Sereno's own life. He notes that the prize specimen that sparked his search, unearthed back in 1908, sits in the  American Museum of Natural History  in New York — and it was a visit to that spot, decades ago, that made a huge impact on a Sereno. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"That's when I decided to be a paleontologist,\" he says of standing next to that exhibit. \"Little did I know my career would end up taking me back to where that mummy was discovered by Charles Sternberg more than a century ago.\" Sereno has a message for young fans of dinosaurs and paleontology: \"If you're an enthused kid, thinking, maybe we found everything. No, we have not.\" Plenty of work remains to make new discoveries and solve more mysteries about how dinosaurs lived, he says. \"For the next two generations, we're going to be finding more things about the deep past and about dinosaurs and other creatures than ever,\" Sereno says. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5535839","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"04:44:00-04:00","title":"As young women turn to social media for birth control advice, doctors try to counter misinformation","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As young women increasingly turn to social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram for advice on birth control, doctors and researchers are alarmed by the spread of misinformation — including claims that hormonal birth control causes infertility, cancer, or mental health issues — despite decades of scientific evidence showing its safety and effectiveness.

       \n      \n\n         Charlotte Freed first got a hormonal IUD when she was a teenager. She wasn't sexually active at the time, but she wanted to be protected from pregnancy before she started college. This was also a time when she experienced anxiety, depression and fatigue. But it wasn't until a friend of hers quit her birth control, and recommended a book on the topic, that Freed started wondering if the two could be related. \"It was really upsetting and almost like a little disturbing that no doctor had ever brought it up,\" said Freed, now 27. At that point, Freed had had an IUD for about eight years. \"I kind of just [wanted] to, like, meet myself in a way that I hadn't since I was 16, 17,\" she said. \"And, you know, maybe I would experience some changes in my mental, emotional, physical well-being that I didn't even really know were a possibility.\" So Freed took out her IUD. Social media is full of stories from women like Freed quitting or questioning hormonal birth control — but not because they want to get pregnant. Some are concerned about effects on their mood and mental health. Others say doctors dismissed their complaints about weight gain, nausea and decreased sex drive. But doctors and researchers say  misleading and inaccurate claims  about birth control — which decades of  research  has  shown to be safe and effective  — abound on social platforms. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       They worry that some women may be making key decisions about family planning based on those dubious claims, which could lead to unintended pregnancies and create more confusion around the drugs. Dr. Jennifer Lincoln tries to combat that misinformation. She's an OBGYN based in Portland, Ore. who makes videos debunking common myths that circulate online. Myths like: \"'Birth control is bad for you. It gives you infertility, it causes cancer, it makes you not attracted to your partner. It causes abortions,' – you name it, somebody on social media has said it,\" Lincoln said. \"And what makes me really sad is that there's so many people who go to TikTok for like — that's their Google search now.\" A  2024 study  analyzed posts about birth control on TikTok, and found that nearly half of posts on the topic were discouraging women from taking it. Skepticism drives social media content Conservative podcast host Alex Clark urges her listeners to reconsider hormonal birth control, which she says is overprescribed, and calls it a band-aid that can mask more serious underlying issues, like endometriosis and polycystic ovary syndrome, which can affect fertility long term. \"I feel like women haven't been given true informed consent when it comes to the hormonal birth control pill,\" Clark said. \"I don't think that they're being told that hormonal birth control isn't going to actually cure or solve any hormonal issues or women's health issues. It helps suppress symptoms, but that doesn't mean that it's actually curing anything.\" Clark took the pill for nearly 10 years before stopping. Now she steers her listeners toward non-hormonal options like condoms and cycle tracking, which tend to have  higher failure rates. \"I think if women were told the truth about hormonal birth control in general, that they would choose other options,\" Clark said. \"I think just the more educated women become on it that they're just going to say, 'Yeah, nah, I'm good.' I think they're just going to choose something else.\" Dr. Jennifer Lincoln believes her colleagues should do more to explain the facts around birth control. She said social media is filling a vacuum that gets created when doctors rush their patients through appointments or brush off concerns about symptoms. \"The medical field owns so much of why people are going to these forums and Reddit and Tik-Tok for information and are really buying it because…we have failed them,\" Lincoln said. \"We have either brushed off their concerns – I mean, you could spend all day just talking about how so many women's issues do not get adequately funded or addressed – but we know that oftentimes they might be met with, 'that's not a real side effect.' We have a huge role in this.\" Freed said she doesn't feel like she had all the information needed to make an informed decision about her birth control as a teenager. Her high school health class, she said, spent one day on \"sex ed,\" and she was sick that day and missed the lesson. And her doctors had no answers to her questions about whether her IUD could be affecting her mood. \"When asking about side effects, it would just be that, 'You know, there's a possibility that your period goes away. And there's a possibility that you get ovarian cysts' — these types of things that are easier to track,\" she said. \"It's not malicious, but it's just connected to the fact that women are under-researched in the health field.\" Dr. Wanda Ronner is a professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine. She said the medical field has become more \"corporatized\" in a way that makes it harder for doctors to give patients the information they need. \"You get your 10 minutes and that's it,\" Ronner said. \"And, you know, the back end explanations are coming from maybe the physician's nurse – If you have a good nurse, that will spend time with the patient explaining things, calling them, or even doing it through the portal. I think it's a very frustrating landscape for young people because they have so much information [available to them on the internet]. And who do you listen to? You know, who do you go to?\" A \"lose-lose situation\" for women When Charlotte Freed took out her IUD, she did notice improvements in her mood — she had more energy, she felt more connected to her body, and she got reacquainted with her cycle — though she said she'll never really know if it was \"correlation or causation.\" She said stopping birth control gave her more information about her body at a \"baseline level\" But then, Freed was going abroad for graduate school, and she couldn't take the risk of getting pregnant in a foreign country. She considered getting a copper IUD — which does not contain hormones — but was worried about the physical side effects that method can cause. \"Thing that sucks about being a woman is like – either the trade off is, you know, the possibility of having a child when you don't want to, the possibility of like hormones kind of messing up your personality or, you know, giving increasing anxiety, depression, fatigue, whatever, or, having horrible cramps and bleeding for 12 days straight,\" she said. \"So it really is just like, it's a lose-lose situation.\" Ultimately, Freed got a new hormonal IUD put in. But she's considering taking another break. \n         \n         Transcript \n         LEILA FADEL, HOST:   As part of NPR's Population Shift series, we've been spending this week looking at how families make decisions about if and when to have children - decisions made possible in part because of hormonal birth control. Now there's a growing social media trend that shows women quitting their hormonal birth control, even though they're not ready to become parents. Doctors are worried that some women are making decisions based on inaccurate medical information they see online. Lexie Schapitl reports on how TikTok and Instagram have become the new WebMD for family planning. LEXIE SCHAPITL, BYLINE: Charlotte Freed (ph) first got a hormonal IUD as a teenager. She wasn't sexually active at the time, but she wanted to be protected from pregnancy before she started college. This was also a time when she experienced anxiety, depression and fatigue. But it wasn't until years later, when a friend of hers quit her birth control and recommended a book on the topic, that Freed started wondering if these things could be connected. CHARLOTTE FREED: It was really upsetting and almost, like, a little disturbing that no doctor had ever brought it up. And honestly, I was like, I kind of just want to, like, meet myself in a way that I hadn't since I was, you know, 16, 17. SCHAPITL: So Freed took out her IUD. Social media is full of stories about women like Freed quitting or questioning hormonal birth control, but not because they want to get pregnant. Some are concerned about effects on their mood and mental health. Others say doctors dismissed their complaints about weight gain, nausea and decreased sex drive. But doctors and researchers say misleading and inaccurate claims about birth control, which decades of research has shown to be safe and effective, abound on social platforms. And they worry those claims are turning some women off the medication and could lead to unintended pregnancies. FRANZISKA HAYDANEK: It's important to kind of look at the difference between disinformation and misinformation. SCHAPITL: Franziska Haydanek is an OB-GYN who uses social media to educate her followers about different birth control methods. HAYDANEK: I think it's totally appropriate that people share their negative experiences with any sort of surgery, medication, whatever. What's not OK is when it's, like, done purposely, and that's when we get into the disinformation. SCHAPITL: A 2024 study analyzed posts about birth control on TikTok and found that nearly half of the posts on the topic were discouraging women from using it. Stats like that motivated Jennifer Lincoln, an OB-GYN based in Portland, Oregon, to start debunking false claims on Instagram - claims like... JENNIFER LINCOLN: That birth control is bad for you. It gives you infertility. It causes cancer. It makes you not attracted to your partner. It causes abortions. You name it, somebody on social media has said it. SCHAPITL: And Lincoln worries that young people are using social media like a search engine for medical advice. LINCOLN: And it might be somebody who says that who has a blue check mark, who even has doctor in their name, but they might not be a medical doctor. And they're selling you something, or, you know, they're promising you something that has made up for the gap in the health care system. ALEX CLARK: I feel like women haven't been given true informed consent when it comes to the hormonal birth control pill. SCHAPITL: That's conservative podcast host Alex Clark. She argues birth control is overprescribed and used as a Band-Aid that can mask more serious underlying issues. Clark took the pill for nearly 10 years before stopping. Now she steers her listeners toward options like condoms and cycle tracking, which do not contain hormones and have much higher failure rates. CLARK: I think that if women were told the truth about hormonal birth control in general, that they would choose other options. I think just the more educated women become on it, that they're just going to say, yeah, nah, I'm good. I think they're just going to choose something else. SCHAPITL: Dr. Jennifer Lincoln believes her colleagues should do more to explain the facts around birth control. She says social media is filling a vacuum that gets created when doctors rush their patients through appointments or brush off concerns about symptoms. LINCOLN: The medical field owns so much of why people are going to these forums and Reddit and TikTok for information and are really buying it because they have been - we have failed them. SCHAPITL: When Charlotte Freed took out her IUD, she did notice improvements in her mood. She had more energy. She felt more connected to her body, and she got reacquainted with her cycle. Then she was going abroad for graduate school, and her calculation changed. FREED: Either the trade-off is, like, the possibility of having a child when you don't want to, the possibility of, like, hormones kind of messing up your personality or increasing anxiety, depression, fatigue, whatever. So it's a lose-lose situation. SCHAPITL: She decided she couldn't take the risk of getting pregnant in a foreign country. Ultimately, Freed got a new IUD for now.

Schools \n         By Melissa Ann Pinney , NPR Staff \n        \n           Saturday, November 1, 2025 • 9:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Melissa Ann Pinney photographed the everyday moments of adolescence inside Chicago Public Schools during a seven-year artist residency. Her series  Becoming Themselves  portrays students, especially those marginalized and underrepresented, as they navigate identity, community and the many transformations of growing up. We interviewed Pinney about the making of her series and the stories behind some of her favorite images. The interview has been edited for clarity and length. What drew you to photograph inside Chicago Public Schools? I was invited by Artists in Public Schools, an organization that pairs artists for residencies in schools all over the city, to photograph Bell School and Ogden International Schools. It was an incredible opportunity to photograph and immerse myself in often overlooked communities of children and teens in Chicago. Since I was in my teens and photographing my own family, childhood and adolescence has been a focus of my work.  Girl Ascending , my 2010 monograph, explored the social lives and coming-of-age rituals of my daughter, Emma, her friends and teammates. The possibilities inherent in widening the scope of my work beyond these established personal connections was exciting. When you first started, what kinds of images or stories did you hope to capture? I'm interested in photography as a process, one of paying close attention to the richness and mystery already present in the everyday world. I capture what's happening in the moment, and the story reveals itself afterwards in contemplation of the work itself. This is an opportunity to make what I think of as real pictures — images that reward sustained and repeated viewings and eschew stereotype and cliché. I had no idea what to expect in the schools, but through trial and error, I found opportunities to make pictures as I became part of the school community. I never know what the students will do next — their beauty, their compassion and their conflicts are unrehearsed. The teens collaborate in the art-making by welcoming me into their world. My photographs are both documents of a time and place and works of art. References to contemporary culture, to history and to ideas of representation are all embedded in the pictures. When I began photographing students in three different Chicago public schools, I had no idea of what was to come — how the project would evolve and shift through an ongoing global pandemic, a renewed focus on systemic racial and gender inequities and rampant gun violence. Now it's a document of a historic time. How much time did you spend working on  Becoming Themselves ? This project is ongoing and still evolving since 2018, when I started photographing in Bell School.  In Their Own Light  was the first book of my early pictures from an elementary, middle and several high schools. In  Becoming Themselves,  I   focus solely on two high schools — Ogden International High School and Senn High School — between 2019 and 2025. What was the most challenging part of this project? It is very hard to witness the grief and ongoing trauma many students experience as part of their everyday lives, especially when we hear that a student in the community has been shot and killed. Tragically, eight students I photographed died that way. The trauma of gun violence reverberates everywhere. What's the story behind one of your favorite photographs? With her My Little Pony leggings and arms loaded with jewelry, Lizzie Williams clearly stood out in the hallway crowded with students at their lockers gathering their coats and bags. I introduced myself and asked if Lizzie wanted to make a portrait. We went to the old gym for its brilliant light and huge south-facing windows. In the midst of working out Lizzie's pose and position, the boys basketball team starting running laps around the gym, casting shadows onto the wall where Lizzie stood. At first I was annoyed by this unexpected disruption, but I soon realized that, far from an unwelcome distraction, the shadows suggest another level of mystery and complexity. I'm grateful for serendipity! The DePaul University Art Museum added this photograph and six others from the project to their permanent collection last spring. A class of Senn students, many of whom are represented in the photographs, took a field trip to the museum to see the works. Were there any moments that surprised you during the process? Many moments surprised me. One day early last fall, a student I hadn't met before asked me to take his picture. I was happy to do so and we found a place by the windows with some light. When I looked through my lens, I suddenly recognized Axle, a student I'd first met two years before, when he transferred to Senn. I had photographed him several other times. Axle had transformed himself radically with a new short hair cut and different style of dress. I am always surprised and moved when a student tells me that the project made a positive impact on their life. Travion Williams, at Ogden International High School, said he was shy, self-conscious and unsure of himself when we made his portrait in 2019. Travion's portrait was one of the 84 portraits installed on panels in the school's front lobby in the summer of 2020. Classes would be completely online that fall, but outdoor sports were still allowed. When the cross country team started practicing, Travion discovered that his friends and teammates recognized and admired him. It changed the way he saw himself. It's rewarding when I'm told by a student that my work is important to them. As my ties to the community have deepened — I've come to understand the meaning this project holds for me and for the students themselves, who tell me they feel truly \"seen\" by participating in the project. The students have profoundly affected the ways I understand the lives of others; my relationships now transcend school to include family events, parties and baby showers. I couldn't have predicted the strong connections I would develop with some of the students, who keep in touch even years after they've graduated. When I brought Sophiat Agboola a print of her portrait, she told me it was inspiring. Surprised, I asked in what way it was inspiring and to whom — I couldn't guess. Sophiat said she had occasionally been made fun of for wearing her natural hair; her portrait had given her the confidence to do so. Of course, the pandemic surprised me. And the fact that a project I expected to last one year could still be challenging and rewarding after seven was a complete surprise, too. Do you have any memorable anecdotes or encounters from your time in the schools ? I photographed Jakolbi Lard only once, at prom in 2019, drawn by the broken heart he had shaved in to his hair. In January 2022, I learned that Jakolbi had been shot and killed. Jakolbi's death and the passage of time bring a different perspective to the broken heart shaved into his scalp. Now I see the wings formed by the mirror frame behind Jakolbi's back. Jakolbi's mother, Patricia Lard, told me that rather than being heartbroken, he was the heart-breaker. She brought Jakolbi's daughter, Jamyah, to an exhibition that included Jakolbi's portrait in 2023. She believes that exhibiting Jakolbi's portrait honors his life. Ms. Lard thanked me for \"... seeing in her Sun (sic) what the world did not.\" Has working in schools changed how you think about education or childhood? The students have a lot more agency than kids in my generation or even my daughter's generation did. These students are free to define themselves through their chosen teams and clubs, their dress, sexual orientation, pronouns and sometimes taking on a new name. There's a freedom in the acceptance and allowance for difference I see and a closeness in the physical camaraderie between many of the students. I started reading the news more closely when I began this project. CPS (Chicago Public Schools) and the CTU (the Chicago Teachers Union) are frequently in the headlines. It's clear that Chicago's past is linked to its present by a history of events affecting the city in housing, education, racial and gender equity and immigration. All of these issues flow through the permeable wall between the city and the public schools. What do you hope viewers take away from seeing these images? I hope these pictures encourage a deeper consideration and appreciation of the radiant young people in our public schools that goes far beyond the stereotypes. I intend these portraits to honor and commemorate those who are vulnerable and often underrepresented. Melissa Ann Pinney is an artist based in Chicago.

These state policies may have helped \n         By Kadin Mills \n        \n           Saturday, November 1, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         After nearly doubling during the pandemic, the rates of chronic absenteeism in K-12 schools are finally showing steady signs of improvement. A student is considered chronically absent when they miss at least 10% of a school year. In most states, that means missing about 18 days a year, regardless of whether the absences were excused. \"Thousands of students have returned to schools, which means that states are putting in the work,\" said Carl Felton, III, a policy analyst at EdTrust, a nonprofit that advocates for underrepresented students. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Felton is the author of a  new report  that looks at how policies in 22 states plus Washington, D.C., have helped improve student attendance. He said there are several things states are doing right, including collecting and publishing reliable data, and investing in early interventions and outreach programs instead of punitive practices. \"The things that we want to see happen are happening,\" he said. Multiple  data analyses  have shown the rates of chronic absenteeism  skyrocketed  during the pandemic, from 15% in 2019 to 28% in 2022 according to  one report  from the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington, D.C., think tank. Research  has linked  chronic absenteeism with lower academic achievement and a higher likelihood of dropping out of high school. Changing punitive practices and investing in more support  One of the areas Felton looked at was punitive practices. He said states need to ban corporal punishment entirely and ban harsh penalties like suspensions for minor infractions because they can harm the relationship between students and educators, and they can make students feel unsafe or unmotivated to come to class. Several states, including many in the South, still allow corporal punishment in schools, and according to  federal data , more than 69,000 K-12 public school students received corporal punishment during the 2017-18 school year. ( More recent federal data  reflects a time during which many K-12 students were learning remotely, during the pandemic, and shows a drop in corporal punishment.) \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"In order for a student to want to be in the school environment they need to know that they are cared for and that the adults in the building have their best interests at heart,\" Felton said. \"You can hold students accountable without harming them.\" He said research-backed services like after-school programs and mental health supports help to create a positive school climate: \"These are the practices that we know can reduce chronic absenteeism because they address root causes.\" Felton found some states, like Connecticut and Maryland, have invested millions of dollars in wrap-around services like mental health support and at-home visits. California has invested billions of dollars in that effort. \"Not until you reach people, are you really able to address problems,\" Felton said. \"We need to prioritize investments and policies that focus on engaging students and families, and making sure they get the support they need to show up daily.\" In many places, data collection also needs improvement  In his report, Felton highlights the importance of collecting high quality data on absenteeism – without it, he said, there's no way to direct funding and programs toward the populations that are most at risk, including students of color, students from low-income backgrounds, students with disabilities and English language learners. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"If the funding is not reaching the student groups that are most chronically absent, then states and [state education agencies] need to rethink their strategy and investment.\" The frequency of data collection also plays a role, Felton said. In many states, attendance data is published quarterly or even annually, making it hard for schools to respond in real time when students aren't coming to class. Connecticut publishes attendance data every month, and is among the states with the lowest rates of chronic absenteeism. Still, only about half of the states Felton examined require teachers to take daily attendance  and  have clearly defined standards for how long students must be in school before they're marked present. Felton said that needs to change. \"Students and families need to know what measurement they're being held accountable to so that they won't be chronically absent,\" he said. According to Felton, a clear metric would also help teachers and school administrators better support their students and families. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5591978","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"20:59:00-04:00","title":"Trump says Senate should scrap the filibuster to end the government shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump is urging the Senate to eliminate the filibuster to bypass Democratic opposition and end a 30-day federal government shutdown that began on October 1, 2025.

It requires 60 votes in a full Senate to overcome a filibuster, giving Democrats a check on the 53-seat Republican majority that led to the start of the Oct. 1 shutdown when the new fiscal year began. Trump's call to terminate the filibuster could alter the ways the Senate and congressional dealmaking operate, with the president saying in his post that he gave a \"great deal\" of thought to the choice on his flight back from Asia on Thursday. Trump spent the past week with foreign leaders in Malaysia, Japan and South Korea, finishing his tour by meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. The president declared the trip a success because of a trade truce with China and foreign investment planned for American industries, but he said one question kept coming up during his time there about why did \"powerful Republicans allow\" the Democrats to shut down parts of the government. His call to end the filibuster came at a moment when certain senators and House Speaker Mike Johnson believed it was time for the government shutdown to come to an end. It's unclear if lawmakers will follow Trump's lead, rather than finding ways to negotiate with Democrats. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       From coast to coast, fallout from the dysfunction of a shuttered federal government is hitting home: Alaskans are stockpiling moose, caribou and fish for winter, even before SNAP food aid is scheduled to shut off. Mainers are filling up their home-heating oil tanks, but waiting on the federal subsidies that are nowhere in sight. Flights are being delayed with holiday travel around the corner. Workers are going without paychecks. And Americans are getting a first glimpse of the skyrocketing health care insurance costs that are at the center of the stalemate on Capitol Hill. \"People are stressing,\" said Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, as food options in her state grow scarce. \"We are well past time to have this behind us.\" While quiet talks are underway, particularly among bipartisan senators, the shutdown is not expected to end before Saturday's deadline when Americans' deep food insecurity — one in eight people depend on the government to have enough to eat — could become starkly apparent if federal SNAP funds run dry. Money for military, but not food aid The White House has moved money around to ensure the military is paid, but refuses to tap funds for food aid. In fact, Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" signed into law this summer, delivered the most substantial cut ever to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, projected to result in some 2.4 million people off the program. At the same time, many Americans who purchase their own health insurance through the federal and state marketplaces, with open enrollment also beginning Saturday, are experiencing sticker shock as premium prices jump. \"We are holding food over the heads of poor people so that we can take away their health care,\" said Rev. Ryan Stoess, during a prayer with religious leaders at the U.S. Capitol. \"God help us,\" he said, \"when the cruelty is the point.\" Deadlines shift to next week The House remains closed down under Johnson for the past month. Senators are preparing to depart Thursday for the long weekend. Trump returns late Thursday after a whirlwind tour of Asia. That means the shutdown, in its 30th day, appears likely to stretch into another week if the filibuster remains. If the shutdown continues, it could become the longest in history, surpassing the 35-day lapse that ended in 2019, during Trump's first term, over his demands to build the U.S.-Mexico border wall. The next inflection point comes after Tuesday's off-year elections — the New York City mayor's race, as well as elections in Virginia and New Jersey that will determine those states' governors. Many expect that once those winners and losers are declared, and the Democrats and Republicans assess their political standing with the voters, they might be ready to hunker down for a deal. \"I hope that it frees people up to move forward with opening the government,\" said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D. GOP cut SNAP in Trump's big bill The Republicans, who have majority control of Congress, find themselves in an unusual position, defending the furloughed federal workers and shuttered programs they have long sought to cut — including most recently with nearly $1 trillion in reductions in Trump's big tax breaks and spending bill. Medicaid, the health care program, and SNAP food aid, suffered sizable blows this summer, in part by imposing new work requirements. For SNAP recipients, many of whom were already required to work, the new requirements extend to older Americans up to age 64 and parents of older school-age children. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Republicans now \"have the nerve\" to suggest it's a political strategy to withhold food aid. \"We are trying to lift up the quality of life for the American people,\" Jeffries of New York said about his party. \"The American people understand that there's a Republican health care crisis,\" he said. \"The American people understand Republicans enacted the largest cut to nutritional assistance in American history when they cut $186 billion from their one, big, ugly bill.\" During the summer debate over Trump's big bill, Johnson and other Republicans railed against what they characterized as lazy Americans, riding what the House speaker calls the \"gravy train\" of government benefits. The speaker spoke about able-bodied young men playing video games while receiving Medicaid health care benefits and insisted the new work requirements for the aid programs would weed out what they called \"waste, fraud and abuse.\" \"What we're talking about, again, is able-bodied workers, many of whom are refusing to work because they're gaming the system,\" Johnson said in spring on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\" \"And when we make them work, it'll be better for everybody, a win-win-win for all,\" he said. What remains out of reach, for now, is any relief from the new health care prices, posted this week, that are expected to put insurance out of reach for many Americans when federal subsidies that help offset those costs are set to expire at the end of the year. Democrats have been holding out for negotiations with Trump and the Republicans to keep those subsidies in place. Republicans say they can address the issue later, once the government reopens. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5593444","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"11:31:00-04:00","title":"Presidents once avoided shutdown travel.

avoided shutdown travel. This term, Trump has been a frequent flier \n         By Tamara Keith \n        \n           Updated Saturday, November 1, 2025 • 11:31 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         With the government shutdown dragging into its second month and growing more painful by the day, President Trump is spending the weekend in Florida. Saturday he's golfing. On Friday night, he hosted a glitzy gathering at his Mar-a-Lago resort, where guests dressed in sequins, fedoras, feathers and long pearl necklaces. The Great Gatsby-inspired theme for the event was \"A Little Party Never Killed Nobody.\" This isn't an isolated trip for the president. He has spent nearly two full weeks outside of Washington since the shutdown began. There are  missed paychecks  for federal workers,  travel disruptions  and SNAP food assistance is  at risk for millions  of Americans. The White House and Republicans in Congress blame Democrats in the Senate for refusing to support a short-term funding bill that would reopen the government. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"They've lost their minds,\" Trump said of Democrats from Air Force One on his way to Florida. \"All they have to do is say the government is open, and that's the end of it.\" Trump spent less than 24 hours in Washington, D.C. this week. Most of the week,  he was in Asia , on a three country trip that started in Malaysia. He was greeted there by a brass band and brightly clothed dancers. Trump got in on it too, doing his signature  Trump dance , swaying with clenched fists. This lengthy foreign trip, Trump's second time overseas during this shutdown, marked a significant break with how past presidents, including Trump himself, have approached government shutdowns. They have typically avoided the bad optics of skipping town during a crisis. In 1995, President Clinton canceled a planned trip to Japan during the government shutdown so he could stay at the White House for talks with Republicans who controlled both the House and Senate. \"We spent a number of days in the Oval Office basically negotiating … trying to see if we could find a way to resolve it,\" said Leon Panetta, who was Clinton's chief of staff at the time. \"Because the last thing we wanted to do was to have the government shut down. That, unfortunately, is no longer the case.\" During a lengthy shutdown in 2013, then-President Obama canceled a four-nation Asia trip. And in 2019, President Trump had a trip planned to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \"If the shutdown continues, I won't go,\" Trump said. The shutdown continued. And he didn't go. Back then, though, Trump was talking about negotiating. He was trying to get border wall funding added to a government funding bill. \"Look, this is really something that should be bipartisan,\" Trump said as that shutdown dragged on. \"And we'll see if it is. I hope it is.\" 2019 versus 2025 That shutdown lasted 35 days, the longest on record. An NPR analysis finds that during that period, Trump only left Washington for six days. He traveled to: Iraq to greet the troops around Christmas Dover Air Force Base in Delaware for the dignified transfer of Americans killed in an attack in Syria Camp David in Maryland for a day The U.S.-Mexico border to make the case for border wall funding New Orleans to speak to the American Farm Bureau There were no visits to Mar-a-Lago resort. This time is quite different. Since the start of the shutdown on October 1, Trump has seemingly made no adjustments to his travel plans and normal routines. His travels have included: Two trips to Florida Golfed twice at his course near Washington, D.C. Israel and Egypt to mark the signing of the Gaza ceasefire agreement Stops in Malaysia, Japan and South Korea during a six day trip Not counting his golf outings in Virginia, Trump spent all or part of 14 days outside of Washington during the first 31 days of the shutdown. Republicans say there is nothing to negotiate until the government reopens Just before Trump returned to the White House from Asia, Vice President JD Vance held a press conference to reassert the administration's position. \"We are not going to give in on policy demands under the threat of hostage taking,\" he said. There would be no negotiations until Democrats vote to reopen the government. \"We need five more reasonable Democrats to put the American people first and reopen the government. That's all that we're asking,\" Vance said. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       And it isn't just Trump. The GOP-controlled House of Representatives was away the entire month of October. The Senate has voted 13 times on the same funding bill, failing each time because of a lack of support from Democrats. Senators went home for the weekend on Thursday, with many of them encountering flight delays related to the shutdown. Democrats, who in the past have supported bills like the temporary funding measure Trump and Republicans are insisting on, say they want to negotiate. But, so far Republicans are sticking with their position that there is nothing to negotiate until the government is open. \"Trump can behave however he wants in this situation,\" said Doug Heye, who was deputy chief of staff to a top house Republican during the 2013 government shutdown. \"Whether he's going to events in foreign countries or just sort of living life, none of that interferes with what the core argument is, which is Republicans saying, 'we've done our job, Democrats step up and do yours.' To do anything different would actually cut against their own messaging.\" Also, he said, Trump clearly isn't all that concerned with political risk from looking like he isn't engaged in ending the shutdown. Even if Trump keeps teasing a 2028 run  for an unconstitutional third term , the president  is governing like he has nothing to lose, said Heye. \"He is YOLO [you only live once] and he is going to do what he wants, wherever he wants and he is going to push the boundaries as far as he can, because whatever he talks about, he's not going to be on the ballot again,\" said Heye. But Panetta, who served in congress and multiple Democratic administrations, sees it differently. He says what's happening now is an abdication of a basic responsibility to govern. \"We've elected these people and they're not there. They've left Washington. They're going on trips,\" said Panetta. \"They're basically walking away from the very responsibility that they should be exercising as elected officials. I mean, that's what's depressing about all of this.\" White House spokesperson Anna Kelly defended the president's travel as good for the country. \"While Democrats flail, President Trump won't stop delivering historic wins for our country while simultaneously finding creative ways to pay our troops and reduce the suffering as a result of Democrats' far-left priorities,\" Kelly said of Trump's Asia travels. NPR's Sam Gringlas, Saige Miller and Anusha Mathur contributed to this report.   \n         \n         Transcript \n         SCOTT DETROW, HOST:   President Trump is in Florida today. That wouldn't be particularly notable, except there is a government shutdown that is creating more and more real-world consequences, including that impending lapse in SNAP benefits. This is not an isolated trip for the president. NPR senior White House correspondent Tamara Keith reports Trump has spent nearly two weeks outside of Washington since the shutdown began October 1. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: When President Trump arrived in Malaysia earlier this week, he was greeted by a brass band and dancers. Trump got in on it, too, as described in this color commentary that went out on the White House video feed. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: In rare, lighthearted moment, President Donald Trump has joined the Malaysian dancers, moving to the cheerful rhythm of the ensemble. KEITH: It was the start of a weeklong trip to Asia that included stops in three countries, but it also marked a significant break with how past presidents, including Trump himself, have approached government shutdowns. They have typically avoided the bad optics of skipping town during a crisis. In 1995, President Clinton canceled a trip to Japan during a shutdown. Republicans controlled Congress at the time. Leon Panetta was Clinton's chief of staff. LEON PANETTA: We spent a number of days in the Oval Office basically negotiating with both Speaker Gingrich and majority leader Bob Dole because the last thing we wanted to do was to have the government shut down. KEITH: During the 2013 shutdown, then-President Obama canceled a four-nation Asia trip. And in 2019, President Trump had a trip planned to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: If the shutdown continues, I won't go. KEITH: The shutdown continued, and he didn't go. That shutdown lasted 35 days, the longest on record. An NPR analysis finds that during that period, Trump only left Washington for six days, and there were no visits to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. This time is quite different. During the monthlong shutdown, Trump has gone to Florida twice, golfed at his club in Virginia,and visited the Middle East and Asia - 13 days on the road so far with more to come. The White House position on negotiating is different now, too. Vice President Vance spoke to the press yesterday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JD VANCE: We're not going to give in on policy demands under the threat of hostage taking. KEITH: He said Republicans won't negotiate with Democrats until they vote to reopen the government. The GOP-controlled House of Representatives has been gone all month. The Senate voted 13 times on the same funding bill and failed each time without enough Democratic support. Democrats say they want to negotiate. Doug Heye was a House Republican aid during the 2013 government shutdown, and he doesn't fault the president for leaving now. DOUG HEYE: Whether he's going to events in foreign countries or just sort of living life, none of that interferes with what the core argument is, which is Republicans saying, we've done our job - Democrats, step up and do yours. To do anything different would actually cut against their own messaging. KEITH: But Leon Panetta, who served in Congress and multiple Democratic administrations, sees it differently. PANETTA: They're basically walking away from the very responsibility that they should be exercising as elected officials. I mean, that's what's depressing about all of this. KEITH: White House spokesperson Anna Kelly defended the president's travel, saying he secured massive investments in the U.S. economy.

— South Africa’s government on Friday criticized the U.S. refugee policy shift that gives priority to Afrikaners, the country’s white minority group of Dutch descent. The Trump administration on Thursday announced a ceiling of 7,500 refugees to be admitted to the United States, a sharp decrease from the previous 125,000 spots and said Afrikaners would be given preference over other groups. U.S. President Donald Trump has claimed that there is a “genocide” against Afrikaners in South Africa and that they are facing persecution and discrimination because of the country’s redress policies and the levels of crime in the country. It’s one of the contentious issues that has seen diplomatic relations between South Africa and U.S. hit an all-time low , with Trump suspending all financial aid to South Africa and setting one of the highest tariffs for the country’s exports to the U.S. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); The South African government’s international relations department said Friday that the latest move was concerning as it “still appears to rest on a premise that is factually inaccurate.” “The claim of a ‘white genocide’ in South Africa is widely discredited and unsupported by reliable evidence,” spokesman Chrispin Phiri said.

The U.S. notice, which signifies a huge policy shift toward refugees, mentioned only Afrikaners as a specific group and said the admission of the 7,500 refugees during the 2026 budget year “justified by humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest.” Trump’s asylum offer for Afrikaners has sparked divisive debate in South Africa, but has been largely rejected even by many in the Afrikaner community. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); This week, a group of prominent Afrikaners including politicians, activists, writers and businesspeople penned an open letter rejecting the notion that Afrikaners needed to emigrate from South Africa. “The idea that white South Africans deserve special asylum status because of their race undermines the very principles of the refugee program. Vulnerability — not race — should guide humanitarian policy,” they wrote in the widely publicized letter. However, some Afrikaner groups continue to be very critical of the South African government’s handling of crime and redress policies even though they reject the “white genocide” claim. An Afrikaner lobbyist group, Afriforum, on Thursday said that it doesn’t call the murder of white farmers a genocide, but raised concerns about white people’s safety in South Africa. “This does not mean AfriForum rejects or scoffs at Trump’s refugee status offer — there will be Afrikaners that apply and they should have the option, especially those who have been victims of horrific farm attacks or the South African government’s many racially discriminatory policies,” AfriForum spokesman Ernst van Zyl said. While it’s unclear how many white South Africans have applied for refugee status in the U.S., a group of 59 white South Africans were granted asylum and were received with much fanfare in May."},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5590943","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"06:00:00-04:00","title":"In redistricting vote, some Californians fear losing out, others want to face Trump","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a pivotal redistricting vote on November 4, 2025, California voters are deciding whether to pass Proposition 50, a measure that would redraw congressional district lines to potentially create five new Democratic seats.

But an election Tuesday will determine  whether the state redraws congressional  lines and divides people here into districts likely to elect Democrats to the U.S. House. \"We want to keep our communities that are alike together, right? And so if we get sucked into Sacramento or, you know, somewhere, we don't share the same needs, right?\" says Amanda Cortez, a Republican who serves on the Loomis Town Council.

California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom set it in motion after Texas Republicans moved to get the edge in five seats in their state. Republicans in California could pay the price. Mike Murray, another Republican voter in the third Congressional district that Loomis is in, says the ballot proposal will dilute his community's voice by splitting the county into three separate districts. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"If we wanted to live in an urban community with the problems and the benefits of an urban community, we would.

Democrats see a chance to counter Trump's national agenda But for proponents, mainly Democrats, California's special election is all about Congress and the Trump administration. \"To the extent that voters care about having a check on President Trump, well, you need a Democratic House to do that, is the argument that Democrats are making,\" Schickler added.

Laura Fitzgerald  covers California state politics for CapRadio. \n         \n         Transcript \n         SCOTT SIMON, HOST:   In just over a week, voters in California face a question that could determine who controls Congress after the 2026 midterm elections. They're deciding if the state should redistrict, giving Democrats an edge to win five more seats in the narrowly divided U.S. House. Now, this vote comes in response to President Trump encouraging Texas to redraw lines to favor Republicans. CapRadio's Laura Fitzgerald reports from a part of California where Republicans could lose out. LAURA FITZGERALD, BYLINE: Loomis, California, is a suburban town of about 7,000 people outside of Sacramento. It's a red area, represented by a Republican in Congress. But under the redistricting map on the ballot in the November 4 election, voters there would be divided and drawn into districts likely to elect Democrats. Amanda Cortez is a Republican on the town council organizing opposition. AMANDA CORTEZ: We want to keep our communities that are like together, right? And so if we get sucked into Sacramento or, you know, somewhere, we don't share the same needs, right? CORTEZ: This area has lots of single-family homes on either side of a major freeway and faces suburban issues, like traffic getting in and out, rapid development and high gas prices. Mike Murray (ph) also lives in the area, and he's involved in his county's Republican club. He's voting no on the measure, called Prop 50, because he says his future votes for Congress will be swamped by the Democratic votes in nearby Sacramento. MIKE MURRAY: If we wanted to live in an urban community with the problems and the benefits of an urban community, we would. But we choose to live here. And when we choose to live here, we hope that somebody will represent us and our way of life. FITZGERALD: Usually, states redistrict at the start of the decade, when the census comes out, but California Republicans could end up paying the price for the redistricting battle that President Trump has set off around the country now. Murray says, for him, this isn't about national politics or redistricting in other states. MURRAY: My concern has always been on our community and our representation. When things are wrong in other places, doing things wrong here, it's not the way to go. Hey, this is something you teach your kids. Two wrongs don't make it right. FITZGERALD: But Trump did get Texas to write a new map that could flip five more seats to Republican candidates. So California's Democratic leaders say they drew their map to flip five seats for Democrats and counter Texas. Eric Schickler is a co-director at the Institute of Governmental Studies at the University of California Berkeley. He says opponents to California's redistricting are concerned it'll sideline the state's Independent Redistricting Commission that's helped give their communities a voice. ERIC SCHICKLER: The basic argument made by opponents of Prop 50 is that the nonpartisan process, you know, has worked well for the state. It's given rise to more competitive elections. FITZGERALD: But for proponents, mainly Democrats, it's about Congress and the Trump administration. SCHICKLER: To the extent that voters care about having a check on President Trump - well, you need a Democratic house to do that, is the argument that Democrats are making. FITZGERALD: In the town of Truckee, a blue dot in the same red congressional district as Loomis, Democrats were wrapping up a meeting to organize for Prop 50. Cyan Samone sees redistricting as a chance to counteract Trump's immigration crackdown. (CROSSTALK) CYAN SAMONE: I have a lot of friends who are immigrants from different countries who have left authoritarian regimes. And you see the patterns, and you just don't want to see that happen here. And I don't want to have to see people who fled terrible situations having to run again. FITZGERALD: Her husband, Ben Woodard (ph), says redistricting could mean Democrats are able to elect a representative that'll pay more attention to what his community needs. BEN WOODARD: I think that the Democratic Party representative would do that and would look over our interests, like, you know, the cuts to Medicare definitely impacted rural health care. FITZGERALD: The proponents appear to have the upper hand heading into the November 4 election. It's a state where most voters are Democrats, and they see this election as part of a national struggle.

Here's what to know \n         By Michelle Andrews \n        \n           Friday, October 31, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         This year's Obamacare open enrollment period, which starts Saturday in most states, is full of uncertainty and confusion for the more than  24 million people  who buy health insurance through the federal and state Affordable Care Act marketplaces. The fate of the enhanced premium tax credits that make coverage more affordable for  92% of enrollees  remains up in the air, with the prospect of significantly  higher premiums looming . But there are steps marketplace shoppers can take to ensure they make the right choices for the upcoming plan year. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       1. Understand how we got here In 2021, as part of a COVID-era relief package, the ACA premium tax credits were enhanced to lower costs for previously eligible people and expand eligibility to people with incomes over 400% of the federal poverty level (which amounts to  about $63,000  for one person in 2025). But those enhancements, which were extended in 2022,  will expire  at the end of 2025 unless Congress acts. The debate over whether to extend them again has been at the center of a political battle of wills between Republicans and Democrats in Congress, a fight at the heart of the now month-old  government shutdown. The financial implications for many marketplace enrollees are huge. Average out-of-pocket premium payments for subsidized enrollees are projected to more than double if the enhanced tax credits expire, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. \"The longer this goes on, the more damage is done,\" said  Cynthia Cox , a vice president and the director of the Program on the ACA at KFF. \"If someone logs on Nov. 1 and sees their premium doubling, they might just walk away.\" That would be a mistake, marketplace experts agree. What is clear, though, is that buyers need to beware and be informed. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       2. Follow the news It can be frustrating to track day-to-day Capitol Hill machinations. But that may be your best source for up-to-date information. Congress could make a deal to extend the enhanced subsidies anytime during the next few days, weeks or months -- or not. Either way, it could affect your enrollment decision. So, pay attention. Don't count on the marketplace or your insurer to notify you about what you should expect to pay. \"Many state marketplaces have hit delay\" on sending consumers notices of net premiums, which take premium tax credits into account, said  Sabrina Corlette , a co-director of Georgetown University's Center on Health Insurance Reforms. The federal government doesn't send enrollees notices about plan premiums for the coming year for the  28 federally facilitated  marketplaces. For 2026, it has said that health plans can also  opt not  to. 3. Update your account information and don't auto-enroll Log in to your marketplace account and update your income, household size, and any other details that have changed. This year, it's particularly important to provide an accurate estimate of your anticipated income for 2026. A provision in HR 1, sometimes called the  One Big Beautiful Bill Act ,  eliminated the caps  on what many people were required to repay if they underestimated their projected income and received more premium assistance than they should have. Next year, people will have to repay the entire excess amount. In the past few years, it's been possible to put your ACA insurance on auto-pilot with  automatic reenrollment  in your current or a similar plan. Given the uncertainty around premiums, this is not a good year to do that, enrollment specialists say. This is especially true for people who, without a deal in Congress, will no longer qualify for subsidies next year, specifically those whose incomes are over 400% of the federal poverty level. 4. Shop based on sticker prices When people see their projected premiums, assuming Congress hasn't reached a deal to extend the enhanced credits, many will be shocked. Health insurance premiums on the marketplaces are expected to increase, on average, 26% next year,  according to KFF . That's the largest rate increase since 2018. Until now, people have largely been shielded from those increases by the enhanced premium tax subsidies that nearly all enrollees receive. Here's how it works: Most people with ACA marketplace plans are responsible for paying a portion of their premium based on a sliding income scale, and the government pays the rest. According to an analysis by KFF, if the enhanced credits are not renewed, a family of four with $75,000 in income, for example,  will be responsible  for paying $5,865 in annual premiums for a benchmark silver plan in 2026 — more than double the $2,498 it'll pay if they are renewed. When evaluating a plan, focus on the listed price. If it's not affordable without the enhanced tax credits, it's not a good buy. \"People need to make a decision based on what is in front of them,\" Cox said. If you can't afford the sticker price without the enhanced credits, consider enrolling in a less generous plan with a lower premium but a higher deductible, Cox said. Bronze plans must provide comprehensive coverage, including covering preventive care at no cost, and may cover some doctor visits before the deductible. \"In most cases, it makes more sense to have a bronze plan than to be uninsured,\" she said. The Trump administration has been promoting  catastrophic plans  as a more affordable option for people who face financial hardship, including those who don't qualify for subsidies because their incomes are either less than 100% or more than 400% of the federal poverty level. Similar to bronze plans, catastrophic plans cover a set of essential health benefits, provide free preventive care, and must cover at least three doctor visits before people reach their deductible. But catastrophic plan deductibles are the highest of any type of marketplace plan: $10,600 for individuals and $21,200 for families in 2026. \"They are expensive relative to what they cover,\" said  Jennifer Sullivan , director of health coverage access at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, noting premiums can cost several hundred dollars. 5. Come back, check, and recheck If you're dismayed at premium prices on your first pass, \"don't slam the computer shut and decide that there are no options for you,\" Sullivan said. \"Congress might still act and things might change radically.\" Lawmakers could restore the enhanced premium tax credits right up to the end of the year, or later. In a majority of states, including the 28 that use the federal government's centralized marketplace, open enrollment lasts until Jan. 15. There are also other key dates to remember. In most states, people  must enroll  by Dec. 15 for coverage starting Jan. 1, and by Jan. 15 for coverage starting Feb. 1, though some states have later deadlines. 6. Wait to pay your premium Premium payments are generally due before the plan takes effect, although marketplaces and insurers have flexibility to extend deadlines, Corlette said. They might allow people extra time to make a first payment, for example. \"We've seen that in the past. State officials and insurance companies have gotten creative to try and keep people in coverage,\" she said. But if there is a last-minute deal and someone has already paid their premium for January coverage and received a lower tax credit than the deal provides, they should still be able to receive the higher credit. \"There are ways to make people whole,\" Corlette said, although how that might happen this enrollment period is unclear.

November 1, 2025 • 9:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         KAMPALA, Uganda — Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu Hassan won the country's disputed election with more than 97% of the vote, according to official results announced early Saturday, in a rare landslide victory in the region. Hassan appeared at an event in the administrative capital, Dodoma, to receive the winner's certificate from electoral authorities. In remarks afterward, she said the result showed Tanzanians voted overwhelmingly for a female leader. After the election, \"it's time to unite our country and not destroy what we've built over more than six decades,\" she said. \"We will take all actions and involve all security agencies to ensure the country is peaceful.\" Hassan took power in 2021. As vice president, she was automatically elevated when  her predecessor, John Pombe Magufuli, died  months after the start of his second term. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The result is likely to amplify the concerns of critics, opposition groups and others who said the election in Tanzania was not a contest but a coronation after Hassan's two main rivals were barred or prevented from running. She faced 16 candidates from smaller parties. The Oct. 29 election was marred by violence as demonstrators took to the streets of major cities to protest the poll and stop the counting of votes. The military was deployed to help police quell riots. Internet connectivity has been on and off in the East African nation, disrupting travel and other activities. The protests spread across Tanzania, and the government postponed the reopening of universities, which had been set for Nov. 3. There was a tense calm in the streets of Dar es Salaam, the commercial capital, on Saturday. Security forces manning roadblocks asked to see the identity cards of those who went out. Tanzanian authorities have not said how many people have been killed or injured in the violence. A spokesman for the U.N. human rights office, Seif Magango, on Friday told a U.N. briefing in Geneva by video from Kenya that credible reports of 10 deaths were reported in Dar es Salaam, alongside Shinyanga and Morogoro towns. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Friday he was concerned by the situation in Tanzania and urged all parties to \"prevent further escalation.\" The foreign ministers of the U.K., Canada and Norway in a joint statement cited \"credible reports of a large number of fatalities and significant injuries, as a result of the security response to protests.\" Tundu Lissu, leader of the Chadema opposition group, has been jailed for months,  charged with treason  after he called for electoral reforms that he said were a prerequisite for free and fair elections. Another opposition figure, Luhaga Mpina of the ACT-Wazalendo group, was barred from running. At stake for the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi, or CCM, party was its decades-long grip on power amid the rise of charismatic opposition figures who hoped to lead the country toward political change. Still, a landslide victory is unheard of in the region. Only President Paul Kagame, the authoritarian leader of Rwanda, regularly wins by a landslide. Rights groups including Amnesty International warned of a pattern of enforced disappearances, arbitrary arrests and extrajudicial killings in Tanzania ahead of the polls. In June, a United Nations panel of human rights experts cited more than 200 cases of enforced disappearance since 2019, saying they were \"alarmed by reports of a pattern of repression\" ahead of elections. Hassan oversaw \"an unprecedented crackdown on political opponents,\" the International Crisis Group said in its most recent analysis. \"The government has curbed freedom of expression, ranging from a ban on X and restrictions on the Tanzanian digital platform JamiiForums to silencing critical voices through intimidation or arrest.\" The political maneuvering by Tanzanian authorities is remarkable even in a country where single-party rule has been the norm since the advent of multi-party politics in 1992. Government critics point out that previous leaders tolerated opposition while maintaining a firm grip on power, whereas Hassan is accused of leading with an authoritarian style that defies youth-led democracy movements elsewhere in the region. A version of the governing CCM party, which maintains ties with the Communist Party of China, has ruled Tanzania since its independence from Britain in 1961, a streak that Hassan extends with her victory. CCM is fused with the state, effectively in charge of the security apparatus and structured in such a way that new leaders emerge every five or 10 years. The orderly transitions within CCM have long sustained Tanzania's reputation as an oasis of political stability and relative peace, a major reason for the party's considerable support across the country, especially among rural voters. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/trump-letitia-james-halligan-sarcone-subpoenas-3fded8db4424c388c4a6383c81536a7d","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"01:22:00+00:00","title":"New York AG Letitia James Challenges Trump Administration’s Legal Investigation","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"New York Attorney General Letitia James is challenging the legitimacy of acting U.S. Attorney John Sarcone, arguing that he was improperly appointed by U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and that the subpoenas he issued—related to lawsuits against President Donald Trump and the National Rifle Association—are retaliatory and politically motivated.

She argued Sarcone lacked authority to issue the subpoenas because he was improperly appointed by the Trump administration. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi appointed Sarcone to serve as the interim U.S. attorney for the Northern District of New York in March. With the expiration of the 120-day interim term, Bondi designated him as first assistant U.S. attorney for the district, essentially improperly extending his role as acting U.S. attorney, according to James. James’ lawyers in the mortgage fraud case have said they intend to challenge the appointment of the prosecutor, Lindsey Halligan, on similar grounds. The indictment in that case followed the resignation of Erik Siebert as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. Siebert was replaced with Halligan , a White House aide and former Trump lawyer who had never previously served as a federal prosecutor, and presented James’ case to the grand jury herself."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-drone-fuel-pipeline-8a66ccb8bf59f1dc045266a088efe67e","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"10:23:51+00:00","title":"Ukrainian Forces Strike Key Russian Fuel Pipeline Amid Escalating Conflict in Pokrovsk","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ukrainian forces launched a significant strike on the Koltsevoy fuel pipeline in the Moscow region, destroying all three fuel lines and severely disrupting Russia’s military logistics.

military intelligence said Saturday, a claim that came amid a sustained Russian campaign of massive drone and missile attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure . The operation was carried out late Friday, according to a statement on the Telegram messaging channel. The agency, which is known by its acronym HUR, described it as a “serious blow” to Russia’s military logistics. HUR said its forces struck the Koltsevoy pipeline, which spans 400 kilometers (250 miles) and supplies the Russian army with gasoline, diesel and jet fuel from refineries in Ryazan, Nizhny Novgorod and Moscow. The operation, which targeted infrastructure near Ramensky district, destroyed all three fuel lines, HUR said. The pipeline was capable of transporting up to 3 million tons of jet fuel, 2.8 million tons of diesel and 1.6 million tons of gasoline annually, HUR said. “Our strikes have had more impact than sanctions,” said Kyrylo Budanov, the head of HUR, referring to international sanctions on Russia imposed over its all-out war and the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Moscow strains to take key eastern city Meanwhile, Russia’s defense ministry on Saturday claimed its forces defeated a team of Ukrainian special forces that were rushed to the eastern front-line hotspot of Pokrovsk in a bid to stop Russian troops from pushing further into the city.

Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed last week that his forces had encircled the city’s Ukrainian defenders. But Ukraine’s army chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi, said Saturday that while the situation in Pokrovsk remains “hardest” for Ukrainian forces, who are trying to push Russian troops out of the city, there is no encirclement or blockade as Moscow has maintained. “A comprehensive operation to destroy and push out enemy forces from Pokrovsk is ongoing. The main burden lies on the shoulders of the units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, particularly UAV operators and assault units,” Syrskyi said in a statement on Telegram. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy acknowledged on Friday that some Russian units had infiltrated Pokrovsk, but insisted that Ukraine is weeding them out. Zelenskyy said that Russia had deployed around 170,000 troops in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, where Pokrovsk lies, in a major push to capture the city and claim a major battlefield victory . freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Putin is trying to persuade the United States, which wants him to seek a peace deal, that Ukraine can’t hold out against Russian military superiority.

Friday and stopped a judge from trying to get daily updates from a Border Patrol official about the government’s immigration crackdown in the Chicago area. The court said the order from U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis put her “in position of an inquisitor rather than that of a neutral adjudicator” and would have turned her into a supervisor of Greg Bovino, a violation of the separation of powers. Ellis, concerned about allegations of excessive force and the use of tear gas against protesters, wanted daily updates from Bovino, starting Wednesday. But the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals intervened that day and suspended the order before further freezing it Friday. Meanwhile, Illinois advocates in a different case Friday sued federal authorities for what they described as “inhumane” conditions at a Chicago-area immigration facility . freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Attorneys with the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois and the MacArthur Justice Center say U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have denied people being held at the Broadview facility private calls with attorneys and have blocked members of Congress, faith leaders and journalists from entering the building , creating a “black box” they say has allowed authorities to act “with impunity.” Related Stories Illinois lawmakers approve ban on immigration arrests near courthouses 2 MIN READ Down but not out, the Ravens eye a second-half resurgence after Lamar Jackson’s return 3 MIN READ The Latest: Trump administration must fund SNAP payments during the shutdown, judges rule 14 MIN READ Agents have also allegedly coerced people held at the processing center to sign paperwork they don’t understand, leading them to unknowingly relinquish their rights and face deportation , according to the lawsuit.

She said people are held only briefly before being transferred to detention facilities. “Any claims there are subprime conditions at the Broadview ICE facility are false. All detainees are provided with 3 meals a day, water, and have access to phones to communicate with their family members and lawyers,” the statement said. “No one is denied access to proper medical care. There is a privacy wall around the toilet for detainees.” Attorneys accuse ICE, DHS and U.S. Customs and Border Protection of violating detainees’ constitutional rights to due process and access to a lawyer and have asked the court to force the agencies to improve the facility’s conditions. The 76-page lawsuit paints a bleak picture of the facility, which attorneys say is “extremely cramped” and “smells strongly of feces, urine, and body odor,” while insects were found in the sinks and clogged toilets led to urine on the floor.

Several people said they were detained at the processing center for durations ranging from a couple days to three weeks. Advocates have for months raised concerns about conditions at the facility, which has drawn scrutiny from members of Congress, political candidates and activist groups. Lawyers and relatives of people held there have called it a de facto detention center, saying up to 200 people have been held at a time without access to legal counsel. The Broadview center has also drawn demonstrations, which have led to the arrests of numerous protesters.

government. Azruddin Mohamed, one of Guyana’s wealthiest citizens, was recently indicted by a federal grand jury in Florida on charges including money laundering, bribery, tax evasion and wire and mail fraud. Mohamed is the leader of the We Invest in Nationhood party, which won 16 of the 65 parliamentary seats in the Sept. 1 general election. He appeared in court Friday and was later released on $750 bond and ordered to return to court in early November for a second extradition hearing.

judge ruled Friday. U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly in Washington, D.C., sided with Democratic and civil rights groups that sued the Trump administration over his executive order to overhaul U.S. elections. She ruled that the proof-of-citizenship directive is an unconstitutional violation of the separation of powers, dealing a blow to the administration and its allies who have argued that such a mandate is necessary to restore public confidence that only Americans are voting in U.S. elections. “Because our Constitution assigns responsibility for election regulation to the States and to Congress, this Court holds that the President lacks the authority to direct such changes,” Kollar-Kotelly wrote in her opinion. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); She further emphasized that on matters related to setting qualifications for voting and regulating federal election procedures “the Constitution assigns no direct role to the President in either domain.” Related Stories Canadian prime minister says he told Ontario’s premier not to run anti-tariff ad that upset Trump 2 MIN READ With bombs and bravado, Trump puts his own stamp on Reagan’s ‘peace through strength’ mantle 5 MIN READ FBI raid at Idaho horse track shows how immigration is a top focus across law enforcement 5 MIN READ Kollar-Kotelly echoed comments she made when she granted a preliminary injunction over the issue. The ruling grants the plaintiffs a partial summary judgment that prohibits the proof-of-citizenship requirement from going into effect. It says the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, which has been considering adding the requirement to the federal voter form, is permanently barred from taking action to do so. In a statement, Sophia Lin Lakin of the ACLU, one of the plaintiffs in the case, called the ruling “a clear victory for our democracy. President Trump’s attempt to impose a documentary proof of citizenship requirement on the federal voter registration form is an unconstitutional power grab.” The White House disagreed with the judge’s ruling in a statement late Friday. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); “President Trump has exercised his lawful authority to ensure only American citizens are casting ballots in American elections,” said Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson. “This is so commonsense that only the Democrat Party would file a lawsuit against it. We expect to be vindicated by a higher court.” While a top priority for Republicans, attempts to implement documentary proof-of-citizenship requirements for voting have been fraught. The U.S. House passed a citizenship mandate last spring that has stalled in the Senate, and several attempts to pass similar legislation in the states have proved equally difficult. Such requirements have created problems and confusion for voters when they have taken effect at the state level. It presents particular hurdles for married women who have changed their name, since they might need to show birth certificates and marriage certificates as well as state IDs. Those complications arose earlier this year when a proof-of-citizenship requirement took effect for the first time during local elections in New Hampshire . In Kansas, a proof-of-citizenship requirement that was in effect for three years created chaos before it was overturned in federal court. Some 30,000 otherwise eligible people were prevented from registering to vote. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Voting by noncitizens also has been shown to be rare . The lawsuit brought by the DNC and various civil rights groups will continue to play out to allow the judge to consider other challenges to Trump’s order. That includes a requirement that all mailed ballots be received, rather than just postmarked, by Election Day . Other lawsuits against Trump’s election executive order are ongoing. In early April, 19 Democratic state attorneys general asked a separate federal court to reject Trump’s executive order.

Trump pushed his Republican Party to get rid of the Senate rule that requires 60 votes to overcome objections and gives the minority Democrats a check on GOP power. In the chamber that’s currently split, 53-47, Democrats have had enough votes to keep the government closed while they demand an extension of health care subsidies. Neither party has seriously wanted to nuke the rule. “THE CHOICE IS CLEAR — INITIATE THE ‘NUCLEAR OPTION,’ GET RID OF THE FILIBUSTER,” Trump said in a late night social media post Thursday. Trump’s sudden decision to assert himself into the shutdown now in its 31st day — with his highly charged demand to end the filibuster — is certain to set the Senate on edge. It could spur senators toward their own compromise or send the chamber spiraling toward a new sense of crisis. Or, it might be ignored. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Republican leaders responded quickly, and unequivocally, setting themselves at odds with Trump, a president few have dared to publicly counter.

John Curtis of Utah posted on X Friday morning, responding to Trump’s comments and echoing the sentiments of many of his Senate Republican colleagues. “Power changes hands, but principles shouldn’t. I’m a firm no on eliminating it.” Debate has swirled around the legislative filibuster for years. Many Democrats pushed to eliminate it when they had full power in Washington, as the Republicans do now, four years ago. But ultimately, enough Democratic senators opposed the move, predicting such an action would come back to haunt them. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Little progress on shutdown Trump’s demand comes as he has declined to engage with Democratic leaders on ways to end the shutdown, on track to become the longest in history . He said in his post that he gave a “great deal” of thought to his choice on his flight home from Asia and that one question that kept coming up during his trip was why “powerful Republicans allow” the Democrats to shut down parts of the government. But later Friday, he did not mention the filibuster again as he spoke to reporters departing Washington and arriving in Florida for a weekend at his Mar-a-Lago home. While quiet talks are underway, particularly among bipartisan senators, Trump has not been seriously involved. Democrats refuse to vote to reopen the government until Republicans negotiate an extension to the health care subsidies. The Republicans say they won’t negotiate until the government is reopened. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said on CNN that Trump needs to start negotiating with Democrats, arguing the president has spent more time with global leaders than dealing with the shutdown back home. From coast to coast, fallout from the dysfunction of the shuttered federal government is hitting home. SNAP food aid is scheduled to shut off . Flights are being delayed . Workers are going without paychecks. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); And Americans are getting a first glimpse of the skyrocketing health care insurance costs that are at the center of the stalemate. “People are stressing,” said Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, as food options in her state grow scarce. “We are well past time to have this behind us.” Money for military, but not food aid The White House has moved money around to ensure the military is paid, but refuses to tap funds for food aid. In fact, Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” signed into law this summer, delivered the most substantial cut ever to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program , known as SNAP, projected to result in some 2.4 million people off the program. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said Friday the agency cannot release contingency funds to keep SNAP running, but two judges ruled nearly simultaneously Friday that the administration must continue to fund the food aid program. How quickly that might happen remains to be seen, as further consultation with the courts is expected on Monday. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Trump, in a social media post, said administration lawyers will be asking the courts “to clarify how we can legally fund SNAP as soon as possible.” “If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding,” Trump said. “We are holding food over the heads of poor people so that we can take away their health care,” said Rev. Ryan Stoess during a prayer with religious leaders earlier this week at the U.S. Capitol. “God help us,” he said, “when the cruelty is the point.” Deadlines shift to next week The House remains closed under Johnson with no plans to resume the session, and senators left for the weekend and are due back Monday. The next inflection point comes after Tuesday’s off-year elections — the New York City mayor’s race , as well as elections in Virginia and New Jersey that will determine those states’ governors. Many expect that once those winners and losers are declared, and the Democrats and Republicans assess their political standing with the voters, they might be ready to hunker down for a deal. If the shutdown continues into next week, it could surpass the 35-day lapse that ended in 2019, during Trump’s first term, over his demands to build the U.S.-Mexico border wall. ___ Associated Press writers Matt Brown and Josh Boak in Tokyo contributed to this report."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/obama-trump-new-jersey-virginia-governors-race-86e8607e89a103e5e7d3b70bb6fc3fae","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"04:05:26+00:00","title":"Obama to Headline Democratic Rallies in Virginia and New Jersey Ahead of Key Elections","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Former President Barack Obama is headlining rallies in Virginia and New Jersey to mobilize Democratic voters, particularly Black voters, ahead of key gubernatorial elections that may reflect broader national political trends under Donald Trump’s second presidency.

(AP) — Former President Barack Obama will headline rallies Saturday for Democrats running for governor in Virginia and New Jersey , corralling voters ahead of elections that may signal the national mood 10 months into Donald Trump’s second presidency and a year ahead of midterm elections that could reshape it. Republicans in those states are stumping as well on the final weekend of campaigning before Tuesday’s elections, but without the national star power. And on the west coast, California advocates are making a final push ahead of a statewide referendum over whether to redraw the state’s congressional map in Democrats’ favor. The effort backed by Gov. Gavin Newsom is part of a national redistricting battle that began when Trump urged GOP-run states to help him keep a friendly House majority in 2026. Obama, the Democrat whom Trump succeeded when he first assumed the presidency, will appear first Saturday with Virginia’s Democratic gubernatorial nominee Abigail Spanberger in Norfolk. Obama then travels to New Jersey for an evening rally with Democratic gubernatorial nominee Mikie Sherrill in Newark. Both events put the nation’s first Black president in areas where Black voter turnout is key for Democratic victories. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Virginia Republican nominee Winsome Earle-Sears , the current lieutenant governor, and New Jersey Republican Jack Ciattarelli , a former state lawmaker, have busy itineraries, as well. The Virginia contest ensures the election of the first woman to lead the Commonwealth since its 1776 founding. If elected, Earle-Sears would be the first Black woman elected governor of any state. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Democrats need strong Black turnout Democratic Virginia House Speaker Don Scott brushed off questions about whether Obama was needed to help turn out Black voters who are key to Democrats’ coalition of voters, saying his popularity spans racial lines. “Black folks and white folks are inspired by his leadership. They’re inspired by the way that he governed himself,” said Scott, Virginia’s first Black state House speaker. Obama’s campaign swing affirms how popular the 64-year-old remains among his party’s base more than eight years removed from the White House. Yet it underscores Democrats’ lack of current top leaders and surrogates, with Republicans holding all levers of federal power and a cadre of Democratic governors and lawmakers vying for status as national figures. And, Scott’s protests aside, the visit highlights pressure on Democrats to maximize their diverse coalition after Trump chipped away in 2024 at Democrats’ usual advantages among Black and Hispanic voters. Trump lost Virginia and New Jersey but narrowed the margins in both states from his 2020 loss to Democrat Joe Biden. Republicans believe New Jersey, especially, is ripe to continue that trend for Ciattarelli. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Trump isn’t on site but he’s in the conversation Trump endorsed Ciattarelli and has said — without naming Earle-Sears — that he backs the GOP candidate for Virginia governor. The president conducted a phone rally for Ciattarelli. He has not campaigned in person for either nominee, despite traveling multiple times in recent months to his golfing resort in New Jersey. That reflects the tightrope Republicans must walk: Trump remains intensely popular among the most conservative voters but has a more precarious standing with the rest of the electorate. Spanberger and Sherrill have tried to capitalize. “Jack won’t say one bad word about the president,” Sherrill charged in a debate with Ciattarelli. Ciattarelli countered that “no matter who sits in the White House, my job is to stand up for the 9.3 million citizens of the state, and I will.” He then played up his Trump ties. “It’s best to have a relationship with whoever occupies the White House,” he said. Earle-Sears aligns herself with the president, and according to AdImpact data, Spanberger’s biggest advertising investment has gone to spots that try to tie Earle-Sears to Trump. The lieutenant governor will lead GOP turnout rallies Saturday in Republican-rich small towns, first in Abingdon in the southwest corner of Virginia, then in Purceville, in the state’s northernmost reaches near the Pennsylvania border. Ciattarelli has stops in Woodbridge, Westfield and Fairfield, an itinerary that puts him in the exurbs of Newark, then across the state in a considerably less densely populated, more Republican swath. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); The economy and shutdown overshadow the governor’s races Spanberger and Sherrill, both center-left Democrats who helped the party retake the U.S. House in the 2018 midterms during Trump’s first term, have emphasized economic arguments. They’ve pledged to tackle rising consumer costs and blasted Trump for failing to reduce prices as he promised in the 2024 campaign. In New Jersey, however, Ciattarelli has blamed Democrats for higher energy costs because outgoing Gov. Phil Murphy has been leading the state for two terms. The Democratic candidates have blasted the Republicans’ federal domestic policy and tax cut bill. In Virginia, Spanberger has highlighted Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency and, to a lesser degree, the ongoing federal shutdown — both of which have a disproportionate impact in a state that has more than 300,000 federal employees, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Earle-Sears has tried to pin the shutdown on Spanberger, arguing the former congresswoman should use her leverage with Virginia’s Democratic U.S. senators. Both senators have voted against the GOP’s spending extension bill as Democrats demand Republicans address looming health care cuts. Additionally, the contests could offer some clues as to whether social issues carry any less weight with voters than in previous elections. Spanberger and Sherrill herald their support for abortion rights, Spanberger doing so in the last Southern state to make the procedure widely accessible. Earle-Sears counters with a focus on transgender policies, trying to frame Spanberger as out of step with mainstream voters in the same way Trump used the issue against Democrat Kamala Harris in 2024. California will have an immediate midterm impact While results in Virginia and New Jersey will be mere guideposts for the 2026 midterms, California stands to have the most immediate impact on the national landscape. Voters there are deciding whether to override a nonpartisan redistricting commission and approve a new congressional map that is intended to send five more Democrats to Washington. It’s a direct counter to neutralize Texas’ plan, already approved, that was drawn to tilt five seats in that state to the Republican column. And more states have followed suit, putting the national map itself in flux in an unprecedented mid-decade scramble years after the usual post-census redistricting process. Republicans began the current Congress with just a 220-215 advantage in the House. That means just a few seats could determine whether Trump enjoys outright GOP control in Washington for the duration of his presidency or faces a new Democratic majority that, if patterned after his first term, blocks his agenda, opens an investigation of his administration and considers articles of impeachment."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/apec-south-korea-trump-xi-0b9c657bd8b45f4c780b534fdf100201","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"00:12:56+00:00","title":"South Korea and China Agree on Economic Ties, Push for North Korea Talks at APEC Summit","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"South Korean President Lee Jae-myung and Chinese President Xi Jinping met in Gyeongju during the APEC summit to strengthen bilateral relations, with Lee requesting China to play a constructive role in persuading North Korea to return to nuclear disarmament talks.

China has been long suspected of avoiding fully implementing U.N. sanctions on North Korea and sending clandestine aid shipments to help the North stay afloat and continue to serve as a bulwark against U.S. influence on the Korean Peninsula. The North Korea item in the Lee-Xi meeting drew an irritated response from Pyongyang. North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Pak Myong Ho on Saturday slammed South Korea for talking about “its daydream” of realizing North Korea’s denuclearization. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Lee, an advocate of reconciliation with North Korea , said earlier Saturday he would take “more active preemptive steps” to lower military tensions with the North, stressing that peace on the Korean Peninsula is essential to prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region.

Their joint statement declared that the APEC leaders “acknowledge the global trading system continues to face significant challenge.” “We reaffirm our shared recognition that robust trade and investment are vital to the growth and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region,” it says. Jeonghun Min, a professor at South Korea’s National Diplomatic Academy, said the statement avoided direct language supporting “free and open trade,” which would not have received backing from the United States, but still endorsed economic cooperation and multilateralism at the core of APEC’s mission. “It wasn’t possible to leave that out entirely,” said Min. The joint declaration also said that APEC members remain committed to the Putrajaya Vision 2040, a new 20-year growth vision adopted in 2020 that calls for a trade environment that’s “free, open, fair, non-discriminatory, transparent and predictable.” APEC leaders discuss AI and population issues While the summit’s opening session on Friday focused on ways to boost trade and investment, Saturday’s meeting had cooperation in the field of artificial intelligence, demographic challenges and cultural industries on its agenda. APEC leaders also issued two separate statements on Saturday. One called for a coordinated approach to the changes brought by AI, which they described as a potential economic catalyst that also poses challenges in rapidly evolving digital environments. The other urged cooperation to address declining birth rates, aging populations and accelerated urbanization. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Trump, known for his dismissal of multilateralism, had quickly left South Korea after the agreement with Xi, leaving the Chinese president to steal the limelight at the APEC summit. On Friday, Xi told the summit that China would support global free trade and supply chain stability — an apparent effort to position his country as an alternative to Trump’s protectionist policies. In written remarks sent to a CEO summit held in conjunction with APEC, Xi said that “investing in China is investing in the future.” Established in 1989, APEC champions free and open trade and investment to promote regional economic integration.

Stephen Bryant, 44, will be the third man this year to die by South Carolina’s newest execution method. His execution is set for Nov. 14. Bryant is being put to death for killing a man in his home. Investigators said he burned Willard “TJ” Tietjen’s eyes with cigarettes after shooting him and painting “catch me if u can” on the wall with the victim’s blood. Prosecutors said he also shot and killed two other men he was giving rides to as they were reliving themselves on the side of the road during a few weeks that terrorized Sumter County in October 2004. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Court fight likely after objections to last firing squad death Bryant’s decision to die by being shot by three volunteers from 15 feet (4.6 meters) away means there will likely be a court fight about the execution over the next two weeks.

They suggested Mahdi was in agonizing pain for three or four times longer than experts say he would have been if his heart had been hit directly. They released photos from the autopsy and questioned why there only appeared to be two bullet entrance wounds when three people fired.

Since 1977, only three other prisoners in the U.S. have been executed by firing squad. All were in Utah, most recently Ronnie Lee Gardner in 2010. Bryant’s execution will be the seventh in South Carolina since executions restarted in September 2024. All the others have chosen execution by lethal injection. The state also has an electric chair. Investigators say Bryant terrorized Sumter County in 2004 Bryant admitted to killing Willard “TJ” Tietjen after stopping by his secluded home in rural Sumter County and saying he had car trouble. Tietjen was shot several times. Candles were lit around his body. Someone took a potholder made by his daughter when she was child, dipped the corner in blood and wrote “victem 4 in 2 weeks. catch me if u can” on the wall, authorities said. Tietjen’s daughter called him several times, getting more worried when he didn’t answer. On the sixth call, she testified a strange voice answered and said he had killed Tietjen. Prosecutors said Bryant also killed two men — one before and one after Tietjen. He gave the men rides and when they got out to urinate on the side of lonely, rural roads he shot them in the back. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Bryant’s lawyers said he was troubled in the months before the killing, begging a probation agent and his aunt to get him help because he couldn’t stop thinking about being sexually abused by four male relatives when he was a child. Bryant tried to help himself through the pain by using meth and smoking joints he sprayed with bug killer, his defense attorneys said. A total of 41 men have died by court-ordered execution in the U.S. this year, and at least 18 more are scheduled to be put to death during the remainder of 2025 and next year. Bryant’s death will be the 50th execution in South Carolina since the death penalty was reinstated 40 years ago."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/29/rfk-jr-walks-back-trump-administrations-claims-linking-tylenol-and-autism","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"23:36:41+00:00","title":"RFK Jr walks back Trump administration’s claims linking Tylenol and autism","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Robert F.

Pregnant women are advised to consult a doctor before taking the medication.\n\nThe World Health Organization reiterated the point in September, noting that “no consistent association has been established” between the medication and autism, despite “extensive research”.\n\nBut claims to the contrary have already prompted efforts to limit the availability of Tylenol, a popular brand of acetaminophen, a fever- and pain-reducing medication.\n\nOn Tuesday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton launched a lawsuit accusing Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue, the companies behind the over-the-counter pain reliever, of deceptive practices.\n\nIn doing so, he reiterated misinformation shared by President Donald Trump and government officials like Kennedy.\n\n“By holding Big Pharma accountable for poisoning our people, we will help Make America Healthy Again,” Paxton said in a statement, giving a nod to Kennedy’s MAHA slogan.\n\nThe suit alleges that Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue violated Texas consumer protection laws by having “deceptively marketed Tylenol as the only safe painkiller for pregnant women”.\n\nIt was the latest instance of scientific misinformation being perpetuated by top officials. Both Trump and Kennedy have repeatedly spread scientific misinformation throughout their political careers.\n\nTrump linked autism and the painkiller during a news conference in September, without providing reputable scientific findings to back the claim.\n\n“[Using] acetaminophen – is that OK? – which is basically, commonly known as Tylenol, during pregnancy can be associated with a very increased risk of autism,” Trump said on September 22. “So taking Tylenol is not good. I’ll say it. It’s not good.”\n\nKennedy has offered his own sweeping statements about Tylenol and its alleged risks, despite having no professional medical background.\n\n“Anyone who takes this stuff during pregnancy, unless they have to, is irresponsible,” he said in a cabinet meeting on October 9.\n\nKennedy also mischaracterised studies on male circumcision earlier this month. He  falsely  said the studies showed an increase in autism among children who were “circumcised early”.\n\n“It’s highly likely because they’re given Tylenol,” he added.\n\nKenvue stressed in a statement on Tuesday that acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women, noting that high fevers and pain are potential risks to pregnancies if left untreated.\n\n“We stand firmly with the global medical community that acknowledges the safety of acetaminophen and believe we will continue to be successful in litigation as these claims lack legal merit and scientific support,” Kenvue said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/1/canadas-carney-says-he-apologised-to-trump-over-reagan-anti-tariff-ad","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"14:39:03+00:00","title":"Canada’s Carney says he apologised to Trump over Reagan anti-tariff ad","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Canada’s Prime Minister Mark Carney apologised to US President Donald Trump over a commercial produced by Ontario that misrepresented former President Ronald Reagan’s views on tariffs.

the results this week at the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress in Berlin and  published  in the peer-reviewed journal, Nature.\n\nThe results, they say, reveal that the mRNA vaccines do not just prevent infection – they also “wake up” and prompt the body’s immune system to fight tumours.\n\nThe discovery has come at a time when US President Donald Trump’s administration has  slashed funding  for mRNA research.\n\nSo, why is this being touted as groundbreaking? What does it mean for cancer patients? And how did the COVID-19 pandemic become the medium for this unlikely discovery?\n\nUnlike traditional vaccines, which used weakened or inactive parts of a virus to trigger the immune system to build a defence, mRNA vaccines deliver a small strand of genetic code known as “messenger RNA” directly into the body’s cells.\n\nThe cell reads this blueprint as an instruction to manufacture a spike protein which mimics that of the virus, and display it on its surface, effectively waving a red flag that alerts the immune system to build a defence.\n\nThe body then creates antibodies and memory cells trained to recognise and attack that protein spike if it ever appears again.\n\nThis is an area of research which has been going on for some years, most notably by paediatric oncologist Elias Sayour, the Stop Children’s Cancer/Bonnie R Freeman Professor for Pediatric Oncology Research at the University of Florida, in the United States.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic presented a particular opportunity to study the implications of mRNA for cancer treatment as the world moved en masse to vaccinate the population.\n\nWhen Sayour’s former student, oncologist Adam Grippin, examined clinical data of more than 1,000 patients treated between August 2019 and August 2023 at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, he found a striking pattern.\n\nPeople who had received a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine within 100 days of starting immunotherapy lived significantly longer than those who received the same medical treatment but did not have the vaccine.\n\nFor patients with advanced lung cancer, the median survival rate nearly doubled if they had the vaccine, rising from 20.6 months to 37.3.\n\nMore strikingly, the survival improvements were most pronounced in patients with immunologically “cold” tumours – meaning that the mRNA vaccine appeared to “wake up” the immune system in patients with these harder-to-treat cancers – turning “cold” tumours into ones the immune system could more easily recognise and attack.\n\nThe researchers noted that their findings were consistent across varying factors, such as different vaccine manufacturers, doses and time of vaccination.\n\nThe researchers also compared the survival rates in a smaller group of patients receiving immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma, the most advanced stage of a type of skin cancer. In the study, 43 patients had an mRNA COVID vaccine and 167 did not.\n\nPatients who did not receive the vaccine had a median survival of just more than two years. By contrast, those who were vaccinated before starting treatment had not yet reached their median survival point more than three years into follow-up, the research found.\n\nThe researchers discovered that mRNA vaccines work like an alarm for the body’s defence system.\n\nWhen the vaccine is given, it puts the immune system on alert, making it more likely to notice cancer cells that it might have ignored before. Once the immune system is activated, it begins to attack these cells.\n\nBut cancer cells fight back. They produce a protein called PD-L1, which works as a shield that “hides” them from the immune system. However, there are drugs known as immune checkpoint inhibitors that can block this shield.\n\nWhen both the vaccine and these drugs are used, it creates the ideal situation – the immune system is active and alert, and the cancer’s defences are down, Grippin explained.\n\nWhile the researchers said that they do not yet fully understand the mechanisms, the findings suggest that mRNA vaccines can be used to re-programme immune responses to cancer.\n\nThese findings are preliminary. If, however, the study is validated in clinical trials, it could have huge implications for the treatment of cancer.\n\n“These vaccines produce powerful anti-tumour immune responses that are associated with massive improvements in survival for patients with cancer,” Grippin said.\n\n“The implications are extraordinary – this could revolutionise the entire field of oncologic care,” said Sayour. “We could design an even better nonspecific vaccine to mobilise and reset the immune response, in a way that could essentially be a universal, off-the-shelf cancer vaccine for all cancer patients.”\n\nGrippen, who co-led the study with Steven Lin, professor of radiation oncology, said his team is launching a Phase 3 clinical trial to confirm the initial results and investigate whether COVID mRNA vaccines should be made part of the standard of care for patients.\n\nIn the mouse experiments, researchers found that injecting an mRNA COVID vaccine directly into a tumour made dendritic cells – a type of white blood cell – more alert.\n\nOnce the dendritic cells picked up on presence of the tumour, they sent out signals that attracted T cells to come and attack it. In some mice, this helped slow the growth of the cancer.\n\nBut there’s a big catch. Not everyone naturally has T cells that are capable of killing cancer cells. For some people, their immune system can tell that a tumour is dangerous, but their specific T cells do not know how to destroy it.\n\nThat’s one reason why immunotherapies – treatments that boost the immune system to fight cancer – work for some patients but not for others.\n\nHaving an mRNA COVID vaccine will not make your body produce new tumour-fighting T cells. What it might do, based on this early research, is make dendritic cells more likely to notice a tumour and effectively deploy the T cells."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/23/why-has-pakistans-hpv-vaccine-campaign-faced-a-backlash","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"08:09:33+00:00","title":"Why has Pakistan’s HPV vaccine campaign faced a backlash?","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pakistan launched a national HPV vaccination campaign in September 2025 to immunize over 13 million girls aged 9 to 14, aiming to combat cervical cancer — which kills eight women daily.

2025-10-23T08:09:33+00:00\n\nTitle: Why has Pakistan’s HPV vaccine campaign faced a backlash?\n\nIn September, Pakistan launched its first-ever national human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine campaign, aiming to immunise more than 13 million girls aged nine to 14 in its first phase.\n\nHPV is the most common cause of cervical cancer, which kills eight Pakistani women every day, according to Dr Dapeng Luo, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) in Pakistan. The United Nations health agency has set a goal of  eradicating cervical cancer  globally by 2030.\n\nBut the vaccine has met resistance in Pakistan, as conspiracy theories about inoculations have circulated.\n\nHere is more about what HPV is, how it causes cervical cancer, and why the vaccine rollout in Pakistan has faced a backlash.\n\nHPV is a common group of viruses that enter the body via skin-to-skin contact, typically through a cut or abrasion.\n\nThere are more than 100 types of HPV, and they are often spread through sexual contact.  Infection can be hard to identify because many people who have contracted an HPV have no symptoms at all, and it can take many years for cancer to develop.\n\nSome types of the virus eventually cause warts on the genitals or other parts of the body. These may appear flat or bumpy.\n\nMore than 95 percent of the 660,000 cervical cancer cases recorded each year worldwide are caused by HPV, according to the WHO. In Pakistan, more than 5,000 new cases of cervical cancer are reported every year, it said.\n\nSome strains of HPV can cause different types of cancer, such as cervical cancer, vulvar cancer or vaginal cancer. However, cervical cancer typically develops 20 years after the onset of the HPV infection.\n\nWhile the body’s immune system can clear away many strains of HPV within two years of infection, certain strains are more persistent. When the body’s immune system is unable to fight off the more persistent HPV strains, the virus interferes with normal cell growth, causing cells to become abnormal and potentially leading to a pre-cancerous state. If this is left untreated, cancer can develop.\n\nSufferers of cervical cancer do not experience symptoms in its early stages. Hence, women aged 30 to 65 are advised to have a pap smear every three years, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nPakistan’s HPV vaccine campaign began on September 15. While the first phase was scheduled to run until September 27, it was later extended to October 1.\n\nSome 49,000 government health workers – all women – have been trained by the WHO to administer the vaccines across the country. The WHO and Pakistan’s government partnered to conduct this training with funding support from GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, a public-private partnership that works to improve access to immunisations.\n\nIn advance of the first phase, vaccine centres were set up in public buildings such as schools. Health workers also went door-to-door to administer the HPV vaccine.\n\nA single dose of Cecolin, an HPV vaccine developed in China, was administered free of charge. While most HPV vaccines require either two or three doses, WHO confirmed in October last year that Cecolin could be used as a single dose.\n\nIn the first phase of the rollout in Pakistan, girls between the ages of nine and 14 from Sindh, Punjab, Pakistan-administered Kashmir and the Islamabad Capital Territory received the single-dose vaccine.\n\nPakistan’s federal health minister, Syed Mustafa Kamal, said at a launch ceremony for the vaccine on September 16 in Islamabad, “I urge all parents to ensure their daughters and sisters are vaccinated. Do not fall prey to negative campaigns. This vaccine is safe, effective and essential for protecting our girls.”\n\nKamal told Al Jazeera that when the vaccine campaign started, there was a lot of criticism and scepticism towards it. “A few unknown people had spread some fake videos and fake information.”\n\nHe said that during the first four days of the campaign, the response to the vaccine was negative. “The refusals were very high, so much so that there are schools which had committed before [to serve as vaccination centres], but refused our workers entry into the school.”\n\nOn the fifth day, Kamal got his own daughter publicly vaccinated during a ceremony at the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) office in Karachi. During the event, Kamal told journalists: “I have never brought my family into the public eye in my 30-year political career. But to put an end to these baseless rumours, I have taken this step.”\n\nHe said that after this, the refusals went down and acceptances went up. He added that this upward trend of acceptance and vaccine administration continued till the end of the campaign.\n\n“It was noticed that after clarifying rumours, people started to get vaccine. Especially, schools were requesting to send teams as parents were agreeing to get their daughters vaccinated,” Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho, the health minister of Sindh province, told Al Jazeera in a written statement.\n\nThe initial reluctance is why, she said, the vaccination campaign was extended by four days.\n\nThe Cecolin vaccine does not contain the live HPV virus. Instead, it contains recombinant L1 capsid proteins, laboratory-made proteins that mimic the outer shell of the virus but do not have any viral DNA and therefore cannot cause infection.\n\nOther countries have used the US-manufactured Gardasil HPV vaccine, which also does not contain the live HPV virus and contains recombinant L1 capsid proteins.\n\nThe government says that this particular age group of girls was selected per the recommendations of the WHO’s National Immunisation Technical Advisory Groups (NITAGs), responsible for providing evidence-based recommendations for immunisation.\n\n“As per WHO, the immune response generated by the body after the vaccine jab is maximum at this age of 9-14 years, and the child gets the best and long-term protection. Hence, this particular age group,” Pechuho said.\n\n“Currently, the vaccine is available free of cost for 9-14-year-old girls only. There have been talks at the federal ministry level to make this vaccine available commercially so others [boys, women and teenage girls, etc] can benefit, as well.”\n\nIn September, Sana Ali Manzoor and her husband – who say they are strongly in favour of vaccinations for their children – took their 11-year-old daughter to be vaccinated at her private school campus in Karachi after school hours. The whole process took about 20 minutes.\n\nManzoor said she heard about the vaccine rollout via a mobile application operated by her daughter’s school, Haque Academy, which is located in the upmarket neighbourhood of Defence Housing Authority. Parents were invited to register on the mobile app and accompany their children for the vaccination.\n\nManzoor, a lactation specialist who supports new mothers, said approximately 30-40 other children were also present when her daughter received her vaccination.\n\n“So we went to school, and there were two or three tables set up. The health workers were there. They first checked if our name was on the list. After that, we went and got the vaccination done. And then right after that, there was a manual card entry filling that was done, then they gave us the card.”\n\nShe described the process as “very organised”. Manzoor says she was encouraged by friends, including a paediatrician and a gynaecologist, to get the HPV vaccine for her daughter. She has also had her children vaccinated against chickenpox, which she travelled to Dubai to get.\n\nThe rollout has not hit its target, authorities say — though they insist that despite this, the campaign counts as a success.\n\n“Around 13 million girls were supposed to be vaccinated in the first phase of the HPV vaccine campaign. So far, 9.2 million have been vaccinated, which is 78 percent of the total target,” Pechuho said.\n\nIn the southern province of Sindh, the estimated target for the HPV campaign was 4,081,279 girls. Sixty-six percent of the total target was reached, with 2,674,210 girls vaccinated.\n\nThe low take-up is down to a general hesitancy towards vaccines in Pakistani society, experts say. Compounding this, specific concerns about the HPV vaccine have been fuelled by misinformation, particularly online.\n\nThe vaccine will eventually roll out to other provinces, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2026, and Balochistan and Gilgit-Baltistan in 2027. The government has not yet announced when the next phase will begin.\n\n“Every age girl will be vaccinated periodically,” Kamal, the federal minister, said. He added that the government hopes to vaccinate boys and men against HPV once girls and women have been vaccinated.\n\nWhile vaccine hesitancy is a global phenomenon, in Pakistan it was aggravated by the CIA’s use of a fake hepatitis B vaccination campaign in Pakistan’s Abbottabad as cover for a manhunt for fugitive al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.\n\nThe vaccine campaign, carried out in collaboration with a local doctor, was used to covertly collect blood samples to find links to bin Laden and his family. The plan was to compare the DNA of any of bin Laden’s children to that of his sister, who had died in Boston in 2010. The al-Qaeda leader was eventually killed in a military operation in Abbottabad by US Marines in 2011.\n\nIt was never revealed whether the CIA obtained any DNA from bin Laden’s family. However, news outlets at the time said that one source suggested the operation had not succeeded. In 2014, the White House promised that the CIA would never again use a false vaccination campaign for espionage. However, mistrust towards vaccines persisted.\n\nThis was apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic, when vaccines were free, but according to a recent study, 30 percent of people in Pakistan did not want to get vaccinated. An opinion piece, co-written by a Pakistani doctor and published on the website of GAVI, said: “Misconceptions that the [COVID] vaccine could lead to infertility, death or be tied into shadowy foreign agendas circulated rapidly through social media and community gossip.”\n\nManzoor said she has herself noticed “anti-vaxxer” sentiment among some of her clients. She recalled advising a young mother not to bring her unvaccinated newborn into her house, explaining that it is not a sterile environment. The young mother responded, “It’s fine, we don’t believe in such things.”\n\nThe HPV vaccine has faced especially heated pushback in Pakistan.\n\nSome argue that, as HPV is a sexually transmitted infection, it is not required in Pakistan, where consensual sex before marriage is not only culturally frowned upon, but is also illegal.\n\nA Pakistani user wrote on X, “Cerv. Cancer is spread via Sexual contact which is NOT IN PAKISTAN for 9-14 year old – only in west.”\n\nAnother user wrote, referring to the vaccine, “its common in societies where women has multiple sex partners!”\n\nManzoor said that she had her daughter vaccinated because, to her, it made sense to ensure that her daughter remains safe from the virus.\n\n“It’s not even about being sexually active, it’s even about, God forbid, molestation. It’s not always consensual,” Manzoor said.\n\nIn 2023, Islamabad-based NGO Sahil reported that, on average, one child was sexually abused every two hours in Pakistan. According to the  World Population Review , 5,867 rape cases were reported in Pakistan in 2023.\n\nAnother conspiracy theory circulating online is that the HPV vaccine causes infertility. There is no evidence to support this claim. Pakistan, with a population in excess of 250 million, is the fifth most populous country in the world, according to World Population Review. While  birthrates  in the country have declined, much like the rest of the world, Pakistan’s current birthrate is 3.32, well above the replacement rate of 2.1 required to maintain current populations.\n\nIn May 2020, a peer-reviewed US study found no evidence of increased infertility among women who received the HPV vaccine. However, this study was conducted in the US, and the sample was inoculated with a different vaccine – Gardasil.\n\nOther rumours, along with pictures and videos, have spread online. A video which attracted more than 340,000 views on X this year shows girls in school uniforms collapsing, with the caption asserting that these girls became sick after “forced vaccinations”.\n\nIn fact, the video was filmed last year and shows a scene in which police are clashing with protesters over electricity taxes in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Tear gas shells fired by the police are what caused the girls at the school to collapse.\n\n“The vaccine has an excellent safety profile. It has been around for almost two decades now. It doesn’t contain any virus, but the active component is the HPV L1 protein,” Pechuho said.\n\nIn an assessment of Cecolin published last year, the WHO said that “the vaccine was safe and showed a good immunogenicity”.\n\nIt can cause a few mild side effects, Pechucho said. “Most common side effects are related to any other vaccine, like fever, pain at the injection site and, rarely, allergic reactions,” he said.\n\nKamal too insisted that the most common side effect is a fever, which subsides in a day or two with the help of over-the-counter medicines.\n\n“People used to die of diseases like polio and tuberculosis. They’re not dying today because we now have vaccines. People are not dying of COVID because we have vaccines. The world has moved to prevention,” Kamal said.\n\n“The point of an effective healthcare system is to prevent people from becoming patients. And people will be safe from becoming patients when they take preventative measures and get their children vaccinated.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/29/jamaica-declares-disaster-after-monstrous-melissa-ravages-island","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"07:27:00+00:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa hits Cuba after killing dozens in Haiti, Jamaica","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record, devastated Haiti, Jamaica, and Cuba in October 2025, resulting in at least 32 deaths.

after it first caused devastation in Haiti and Jamaica, leading to the deaths of at least 32 people.\n\nTwenty of the reported deaths on Wednesday came after a river burst its banks in the southern coastal Haitian town of Petit-Goave, flooding and collapsing dozens of homes.\n\nThe mayor of the town, Jean Bertrand Subreme, said that people were still trapped under the rubble of their homes.\n\n“I am overwhelmed by the situation,” Subreme said, as he pleaded for help from the government.\n\nThree other deaths were reported from Melissa in Haiti. Eight people were killed in Jamaica, including a baby killed after a tree fell in the western side of the island, according to State Minister Abka Fitz-Henley. One person was also reported to have been killed in the Dominican Republic.\n\nThe storm was one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record when it hit Jamaica on Tuesday, according to the US National Hurricane Center.\n\nAs it crossed Cuba on Wednesday, it weakened to a Category 2 storm from its previous Category 5 classification. It is projected to move into the Bahamas later on Wednesday, where dozens of people have been evacuated from the south east of the archipelago.\n\nJamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness had declared Jamaica a “disaster area” after Hurricane Melissa barrelled across the island.\n\nThe hurricane ripped off the roofs of homes, inundated Jamaica’s “bread basket”, and felled power lines and trees, leaving most of its 2.8 million people without electricity.\n\n“It’s not going to be an easy road, Jamaica,” said Desmond McKenzie, deputy chairman of Jamaica’s Disaster Risk Management Council. “I know persons … are wondering what their futures are going to be like.”\n\nMelissa took hours to cross over Jamaica, a passage over land that diminished its winds, before it ramped back up as it  continued  towards Cuba.\n\nThe governor of Cuba’s Granma, Yanetsy Terry Gutierrez, said that parts of the province, including in the provincial capital Jiguani, were “under water”.\n\nOfficials in Cuba have also reported collapsed houses, blocked mountain roads, and roofs blown off.\n\nThe Jamaican government had lifted the tropical storm warning by Wednesday, but officials are struggling to assess the damage.\n\n“There’s a total communications blockout on that side,” said Richard Thompson, the acting director general of Jamaica’s Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management, referring to the south and southwest of the island.\n\nMcKenzie said that four hospitals had been damaged and one was left without power, forcing the evacuation of 75 patients.\n\nHeavy damage was also reported in Clarendon, in Jamaica’s south, and Saint Elizabeth, in the southwest, where a landslide blocked main roads in the town of Santa Cruz, and winds ripped off part of the roof of a school used as a shelter.\n\n“I never saw anything like this before in all my years living here,” said one resident of the town, Jennifer Small.\n\n“The entire hillside came down last night,” said another, Robert James.\n\nPrime Minister Holness said on Tuesday that his government was mobilising quickly to start relief and recovery efforts by Wednesday morning.\n\nEven before Melissa slammed into Jamaica, seven deaths – three in Jamaica, three in Haiti and one in the Dominican Republic – were caused by the hurricane.\n\nA roof was completely torn off a building at a section of the Savanna La Mar Public General Hospital due to the passage of Hurricane Melissa.

So many homes, so many people have been displaced,” she said.\n\n“We did prepare, but there wasn’t much that we could have done.”\n\nTrout Hall Rd,  Clarendon #TrackingMelissa   #HurricaneMelissa   #Jamaica   @CVMTV   pic.twitter.com/bTop93pOvp\n\n— Giovanni R. Dennis (@GiovanniRDennis)  October 28, 2025\n\nIn Kingston, Lisa Sangster, a 30-year-old communications specialist, said her home was devastated by the storm.\n\n“My sister … explained that parts of our roof were blown off and other parts caved in and the entire house was flooded,” she told the AFP news agency. “Outside structures like our outdoor kitchen, dog kennel and farm animal pens were also gone, destroyed.”\n\nMathue Tapper, 31, told AFP that those in the capital were “lucky”, but he feared for people in Jamaica’s more rural areas.\n\n“My heart goes out to the folks living on the western end of the island,” he said.\n\nAlthough Jamaica and Cuba are used to hurricanes,  climate change  is making the storms more severe.\n\nBritish-Jamaican climate change activist and author Mikaela Loach said in a video shared on social media that Melissa “gained energy from the extremely and unnaturally  hot seas  in the Caribbean”.\n\n“These sea temperatures are not natural,” Loach said. “They’re extremely hot because of the gases that have resulted from burning fossil fuels.”\n\n“Countries like Jamaica, countries that are most vulnerable to climate disaster, are also countries that have had their wealth and resources stripped away from them through colonial bondage,” Loach added.\n\nSpeaking at the United Nations General Assembly in September, Holness urged wealthy countries to increase climate financing to assist countries like Jamaica with adapting to the effects of a warming world.\n\n“Climate change is not a distant threat or an academic consideration. It is a daily reality for small island developing states like Jamaica,” he said.\n\nJamaica is responsible for just 0.02 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, which cause global warming, according to data from the World Resources Institute.\n\nBut like other tropical islands, it is expected to continue to bear the brunt of worsening climate effects."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/1/cuba-charges-former-economy-minister-gil-of-espionage-financial-crimes","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"07:55:59+00:00","title":"Cuba charges former economy minister Gil with espionage, financial crimes","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Cuba's attorney general has charged former economy minister Alejandro Gil with a wide array of financial and espionage-related crimes, including embezzlement, tax evasion, money laundering, and violations of classified document rules, following a two-year investigation.

trade and investment that “benefits all”, concluding a summit dominated by  an agreement  between the leaders of the United States and China to call a truce in their trade war.\n\nThe declaration by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) leaders on Saturday came after US President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, earlier agreed to lower the temperature in the heated  US-China rivalry  during a high-stakes summit held on the sidelines of the event.\n\nTrump departed South Korea on Thursday after his talks with Xi, their first face-to-face meeting since 2019, leaving the Chinese leader to take centre stage at the two-day economic forum.\n\nXi, who has cast China as a defender of multilateralism and free trade, told the opening of the event on Friday that countries needed to work together as they faced an “increasingly complex and volatile” global environment.\n\nIn their declaration, the APEC leaders said “robust” trade and investment were vital to the region’s growth, and stressed their commitment to “deepening economic cooperation to navigate the evolving global environment”.\n\nAPEC, whose 21 members include the US, China, Japan and South Korea, will advance economic integration that is “market-driven” and enhance “experience sharing, capacity building, business engagement”, the declaration said.\n\nThe leaders also pledged regional cooperation on artificial intelligence and demographic challenges arising from falling birth rates.\n\nSpeaking before the declaration, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, the summit’s host, warned that economies were navigating an era of mounting global uncertainty.\n\n“The free trade system is experiencing strong turbulence, global economic uncertainty is deepening, and momentum for trade and investment is weakening,” Lee said.\n\nSaturday’s statement notably did not directly reference multilateralism or the World Trade Organization, a reminder of the fraying consensus on free trade amid rising populism worldwide.\n\nDeborah Elms, head of trade policy at the Hinrich Foundation in Singapore, said it was “probably a miracle” that the leaders had been able to agree on a joint statement.\n\n“Given the strong positions of some APEC economies, getting any agreed language into a document was a fraught exercise,” Elms told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Normally, these are wrapped up well in advance. This one hung in the balance to the last minute as officials swapped out wording to find an acceptable compromise.”\n\nXi, who a day earlier held meetings with his Japanese, Canadian and Thai counterparts, later on Saturday joined Lee for their first bilateral summit since the South Korean leader’s election in a  snap poll  in June.\n\nIn opening remarks, Lee expressed hope that South Korea and China would “strengthen strategic communication” to resume dialogue with nuclear-armed North Korea, which has repeatedly dismissed Seoul’s efforts at rapprochement.\n\n“The importance of peace and stability in the region cannot be overstated,” Lee said.\n\nLee also called for the sides to work together for “shared prosperity” as they moved from a “vertical” model of economic ties to a “horizontal and mutually beneficial one”.\n\nXi described China and South Korea as “important neighbours that cannot be moved apart” and “inseparable cooperation partners”, as he called on the sides to manage their differences through “friendly consultations”.\n\nLee has pledged to pursue a more balanced policy towards China than his conservative predecessor, Yoon Suk Yeol, who was impeached for briefly declaring martial law last year.\n\nSouth Korea, like other countries in the region, has had to walk a fine line between the US, its security guarantor, and China, its biggest trading partner.\n\nThe US stations about 28,500 troops in South Korea and is treaty-bound to come to its defence if it is attacked, a legacy of Washington’s support for the country in its 1950-53 war with North Korea.\n\nSouth Korea sent nearly one-fifth of its exports to China in 2024, with the value of its shipments hitting $133bn.\n\nThe US was the country’s second-largest export destination, with shipments of $127.8bn.\n\nSouth Korea’s relations with China have been tested by a series of disputes in recent years, most notably a spat over the US’s 2017 deployment of a THAAD missile defence system in the country.\n\nRob York, director for regional affairs at the Hawaii-based Pacific Forum, said Lee wants South Korea’s most important relationships to “remain stable, which means lowering tensions with China, preventing a drastic decline in US relations and capitalising on the diplomatic heavy lifting his predecessor did with Japan.”\n\n“For now, that will mean striking a friendly note with both Chairman Xi and President Trump, even as he takes steps behind the scenes to lessen dependencies on the US for security and to counter PRC hybrid war operations in South Korea related to maritime issues and technology theft,” York told Al Jazeera, referring to China’s official name, the People’s Republic of China.\n\n“Initial signs suggest Lee is serious about tackling those issues but will try to do so discreetly – there really isn’t much to be gained right now in having those issues erupt in public.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/30/jamaica-haiti-and-cuba-take-stock-after-hurricane-melissa-destruction","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"07:33:17+00:00","title":"Jamaica, Haiti and Cuba take stock after Hurricane Melissa destruction","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, a Category 5 storm, struck the northern Caribbean, causing catastrophic damage and loss of life across Jamaica, Haiti, and Cuba.

devastation of Hurricane Melissa as dozens of deaths are reported in Jamaica, Cuba and Haiti.\n\nThe hurricane – at Category 5, the  strongest  on record to hit Jamaica directly – ripped across the Caribbean islands on Tuesday and Wednesday, killing at least 25 people in Haiti, eight in Jamaica and one in the Dominican Republic.\n\nThe United States-based National Hurricane Center said early on Thursday that Melissa’s eye was expected to move away from the southeastern and central Bahamas before passing west of Bermuda.\n\nAlthough the storm was downgraded to Category 1, the lowest strength on the Saffir-Simpson scale, it was still packing winds of 155km/h (100mph) with even higher gusts, the NHC reported.\n\nIn Haiti, where roughly 12,000 people remained in emergency shelters, families grappled with the rising death toll. Twenty people were reported dead in the southern coastal town of Petit-Goave alone, where a river burst its banks and collapsed dozens of homes.\n\nResident Steven Guadard told The Associated Press news agency that Melissa killed his entire family: “I had four children at home: a one-month-old baby, a seven-year-old, an eight-year-old and another who was about to turn four.”\n\nAlthough no deaths were tallied in Cuba, more than 735,000 evacuated residents slowly returned home as the military helped to rescue people in isolated communities.\n\nRecovery efforts were rolling out across Jamaica’s western parishes, where Melissa ripped roofs from homes, felled trees, flooded hospitals, and cut off electricity and water.\n\nYet even as Prime Minister Andrew Holness pledged a “credible and strong” recovery strategy, residents pleaded for help.\n\nSylvester Guthrie, a resident of the hard-hit parish of St Elizabeth, was left with only his bicycle.\n\n“I don’t have a house now,” Guthrie told the AP. Although he has land in another location, he said, “I am going to need help.”\n\nThe centre of Melissa did not cross over Jamaica’s capital, Kingston, allowing emergency relief flights ferrying water, food and other supplies to start landing at Norman Manley International Airport after it reopened late on Wednesday.\n\nAs the prime minister took a helicopter tour of the damage, the Jamaica Public Service utility kicked off a damage assessment as the majority of the island’s 2.8 million residents were left without electricity. It warned them to avoid downed power lines “at all costs”.\n\nTo the island’s west, parishes, including St James and St Elizabeth, were rocked by torrential floodwaters, powerful winds and landslides.\n\nIn the historic port town of Black River, the hurricane levelled homes, destroyed historic buildings and flooded medical care facilities, destroying the “entire infrastructure”, Holness said in a video update from the town.\n\nTo the north, heavy construction equipment crawled through the mud-soaked streets of St James Parish to clear blockages and push aside felled trees. Video footage showed dazed residents wandering around outside to assess the damage.\n\nThe United States and the United Kingdom have pledged support."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/27/ngos-note-28-new-carbon-bomb-projects-since-2021","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-27","timeOfPublication":"12:50:39+00:00","title":"NGOs note 28 new ‘carbon bomb’ projects since 2021","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Between 2021 and 2024, 28 new 'carbon bomb' fossil fuel projects have been launched globally, despite international climate commitments to phase out fossil fuels.

28 new ‘carbon bomb’ projects since 2021\n\nTwenty-eight new “carbon bomb” projects have launched across the globe over the past five years, according to a report issued by NGOs.\n\nDespite global efforts to phase out the use of fossil fuels, known to have  catastrophic climate effects , the report, published on Monday by a quartet of environmental nonprofits, details that dozens of new fossil fuel extraction projects that will pump out enormous emissions have been started since 2021.\n\nCarbon bombs were defined in a 2022 research article as oil, gas or coal facilities capable of generating more than a billion tonnes of CO2 over their lifetime.\n\nAt that time, the NGOs Lingo, Data for Good, Reclaim Finance, and Eclaircies counted 425 such projects worldwide.\n\nThe report said some 365 projects are still producing more than one billion tonnes each, with the fall from the 2021 total due to operations that have either cut their output or been re-evaluated.\n\nThat is despite the International Energy Agency having said in 2021 that launching new oil and gas projects was incompatible with reaching climate targets set out in the Paris Agreement.\n\nThe landmark agreement reached in 2015 included the aim of keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) compared with the pre-industrial era.\n\nTwo years later, at COP28, countries around the world agreed to begin a phase-out of fossil fuels.\n\nDespite that, between 2021 and 2024, the world’s 65 largest banks financed more than $1.6 trillion to the companies involved in the projects pinpointed in the report.\n\nBarclays Bank is the most involved in supporting companies behind carbon bombs, providing $33.7bn to 62 companies, including Eni, ExxonMobil and TotalEnergies.\n\n“Major global banks are exacerbating climate change and future emissions by continuing to give carte blanche to these fossil fuel companies that are destroying the planet,” said Louis-Maxence Delaporte, energy research manager at Reclaim Finance, one of the NGOs involved in the study.\n\nChina accounts for 43 percent of “carbon bombs”. Russia accounts for 9 percent, the United States for 5 percent.\n\nWestern oil majors  have the most such projects, although Saudi Arabia’s Aramco and China’s CHN Energy produce the most total emissions.\n\nThe report also identified more than 2,300 smaller extraction projects, approved or launched since 2021, whose potential emissions exceed five million tonnes of CO2 each, equivalent to the annual emissions of a city like Paris.\n\nCombined, the potential CO2 emissions from all these projects are 11 times greater than the global “carbon budget” remaining to keep global warming below 1.5C (2.7F) compared with the pre-industrial era, according to the authors’ calculations."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/21/what-caused-amazons-aws-outage-and-why-did-so-many-major-apps-go-offline","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"02:23:04+00:00","title":"What caused Amazon’s AWS outage, and why did so many major apps go offline?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"An outage at Amazon Web Services (AWS) on October 20, 2025, began at 07:11 GMT due to a technical error during a software update to DynamoDB’s API, which disrupted the Domain Name System (DNS) and prevented applications from connecting to server addresses.

caused Amazon’s AWS outage, and why did so many major apps go offline?\n\nA  major outage  at the Amazon Web Services (AWS) on Monday disrupted a large portion of the internet, taking down apps, websites and online tools used by millions of people around the world, before services were eventually restored.\n\nThe hours-long  breakdown  of the cloud system that supports a portion of the internet revealed just how much of modern-life depends on the infrastructure – from banking apps and airlines to smart home devices and gaming platforms.\n\nHere is what we know:\n\nAt about 07:11 GMT, Amazon’s cloud service experienced a major outage, meaning some of its systems stopped working, which disrupted many popular apps and websites, including banks, gaming platforms and entertainment services.\n\nThe problem started in one of AWS’s main data centres in Virginia, its oldest and biggest site, after a technical update to the API – a connection between different computer programmes – of DynamoDB, a key cloud database service that stores user information and other important data for many online platforms.\n\nThe root cause appears to have been an error in the update that affected the Domain Name System (DNS), which helps apps find the correct server addresses. A DNS works like the internet’s phone book, turning website names into the numeric IP addresses that computers use to connect to servers.\n\nBecause of the DNS issue, apps could not find the IP address for DynamoDB’s API and were unable to connect.\n\nAs DynamoDB went down, other AWS services also began to fail. In total, 113 services were affected by the outage. By 10:11 GMT, Amazon said that all AWS returned to normal operations, but there was a backlog “of messages that they will finish processing over the next few hours”.\n\nAt the time of publication, Downdetector, a website that tracks internet outages based on user reports, was still showing problems with platforms such as OpenAI, ESPN and Apple Music.\n\nUpdated look at the total impact of the AWS Outage up to this point! https://t.co/Bgpm1fFGtf   pic.twitter.com/TAAxjagNl6\n\n— Downdetector (@downdetector)  October 20, 2025\n\nA cloud is a way of storing and using data or programmes over the internet instead of on your computer or other physical storage devices.\n\nWhen people say something is “in the cloud”, it means the files, apps or systems are running on powerful computers (called servers) in data centres owned by companies like Amazon (AWS), Google or Microsoft, not on your personal device.\n\nIn this case, AWS allows companies to rent computing power and storage. It supplies the technology that runs websites, apps and many online services behind the scenes.\n\nOne of AWS’s core services is DynamoDB, a database that stores important information for companies, such as customer records. On Monday, Amazon reported that customers were unable to access their DynamoDB data.\n\nAWS is the biggest cloud service provider in the world.\n\nCloud outages are not rare, but they have become more noticeable as more companies rely on these services every day.\n\n“The fallout impacted people across a number of different spheres,” Joshua Mahony, the chief market analyst at Scope Markets, told Al Jazeera. [But] of course this kind of comes with the territory with tech companies; the key is they can resolve it quickly, and it doesn’t cost them a lot of money.”\n\nHe said Amazon would likely weather the storm from the incident.\n\n“You’re looking at something that is relatively contained,” he said. “Amazon Web Services has cornered 30 percent of the market alone. Their users are not going to suddenly jump ship. Their businesses are deeply ingrained.”\n\nThe outage affected dozens of websites, including Snapchat, Pinterest and Apple TV, according to Downdetector.\n\nOther communication apps were also affected including: WhatsApp, Signal, Zoom and Slack; gaming services such as Roblox, Fortnite and Xbox; and places like Starbucks. Etsy also experienced issues.\n\nIn the United States, people were having issues with financial apps too, including Venmo.\n\nSome users said their Ring doorbells and Alexa speakers stopped working, while others could not access the Amazon website or download books on their Kindles.\n\nThe language app Duolingo and creative tool Canva were among those reporting errors on their websites, and several media organisations were hit, including the Associated Press news agency, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal.\n\nBanks, the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, and AI firm Perplexity also reported issues, along with US airlines Delta and United.\n\nWhen AWS had its outage, it was not just Amazon’s tools that were affected. Thousands of other companies that use AWS for storage, databases or web hosting were also hit. These companies include many major apps that rely on AWS to run key parts of their systems.\n\n“Whenever we see these headlines, the first thought that goes through everybody’s mind, that sends a shiver up the spine, is, ‘Is this one of those cyberattacks? Is this a military or intelligence-led thing that has led to this disruption?’ And in this case, it’s not,” Bryson Bort chief executive of the cybersecurity company Scythe told Al Jazeera.\n\n“In fact, most of the time, it isn’t. It’s usually human error.”\n\nAWS  acknowledged  the outage and said engineers were “immediately engaged” to fix the problem.\n\nAWS said it worked on “multiple parallel paths to accelerate recovery”. It also reported that the main issue had been fully resolved, though some users continued to face minor delays as systems recovered.\n\nThe company also said it would publish a detailed post-event summary explaining what happened."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/27/jamaica-braces-as-hurricane-melissa-strengthens-offshore","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-27","timeOfPublication":"06:45:50+00:00","title":"Officials warn Hurricane Melissa could be ‘catastrophic’ for Jamaica","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, a rapidly intensifying Category 5 storm, is on a direct path toward Jamaica, threatening catastrophic damage due to its slow movement, extreme rainfall, and high wind speeds.

Jamaica\n\nPeople in Jamaica have been urged to take shelter as  Hurricane Melissa  continues to strengthen offshore, with heavy rains and tropical storm-strength winds already hitting parts of the island.\n\nThe hurricane, which has intensified to a Category 5 storm, was about 160km (100 miles) south of Jamaica on Monday and on course to hit the western flanks of the island early Tuesday. Moving at just 7km/h (4mph), the storm could cut a particularly punishing path, bringing landslides and storm surges as it crawls across the country, officials warned.\n\nStill, on Monday, Evan Thompson, the principal director of the Meteorological Service of Jamaica, said a slight chance remained that the storm could miss the island.\n\n“Of course, all of us are hoping for that and praying for that,” Thompson said. “But at the same time, we have to be practical. Right now, the projected path takes it to the southwestern part of Jamaica, impacting either eastern Westmoreland or extreme western Saint Elizabeth.”\n\nCurrently, the storm is projected to travel northeast across the island, exiting along the coast of Saint Anne Parish, Thompson said.\n\nCategory 5 is the highest on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, with sustained winds exceeding 250km/h (157mph). Up to about one metre (40 inches) of rainfall could hit parts of Jamaica as the storm passes directly over the island, threatening flash flooding and landslides.\n\n“I don’t want to encourage fear or worry, but I do expect you to become concerned about what is taking place,” Thompson said.\n\n“If you think that you are free from [the worst of the storm], think again, because the heavy rains will affect you, the strong winds reaching tropical storm force could still continue to affect you as we go through the day on Tuesday.”\n\nIn an earlier webcast, US National Hurricane Center (NHC) Deputy Director Jamie Rhome said the potential for extreme rain, coupled with the slow speed of the storm, could “create a catastrophic event” in Jamaica.\n\n“You need to just be wherever you’re going to be and be ready to ride this out for several days,” Rhome said.\n\nJamaica’s government ordered mandatory evacuations late on Sunday for Port Royal in Kingston; Portland Cottage and Rocky Point in Clarendon; Old Harbour Bay in Saint Catherine; and Taylor Land, Bull Bay, New Haven and Riverton City in Saint Andrew.\n\n“Many of these communities will not survive this flooding,” Desmond McKenzie, minister of local government, said at a news conference. “Kingston is low, extremely low … No community in Kingston is immune from flooding.\n\n“There is nothing more we can do as a government but to beg and beseech persons to heed the warning. And if it will help, I will go on my knees,” he said.\n\n“This is one bet you cannot win. You cannot bet against Melissa,” McKenzie warned, advising that people could go to more than 650 shelters that are open across the country.\n\nThe AFP news agency spoke with Winston Moxam as he hurried to prepare his home for the approaching storm.\n\n“I lose my roof, I lose a whole lot of things,” Maxim said, adding that he was particularly worried by warnings that the storm could be worse than 1988’s Hurricane Gilbert, which left more than 40 dead in Jamaica and killed hundreds more around the Caribbean and in Mexico.\n\nJamaica’s two main airports, the Norman Manley International Airport and Sangster International Airport in Montego Bay, as well as seaports, were closed.\n\nAfter passing over Jamaica, the storm is forecast to head north and cross over eastern Cuba on Tuesday night, while continuing to bring rains and heavy winds to Haiti and the Dominican Republic.\n\nMelissa has already been blamed for at least four deaths in Haiti and the Dominican Republic this week, as its outer bands brought heavy rains and landslides.\n\nThe Dominican Republic’s emergency operations centre has placed nine of 31 provinces on red alert due to a risk of flash floods, rising rivers and landslides.\n\nThe Cuban government issued a hurricane warning for the provinces of Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guantanamo, and Holguin. It also sent a tropical storm warning to the province of Las Tunas.\n\nAlthough Jamaica is used to hurricanes,  climate change  is making tropical storms more frequent and severe, including by causing heavier rainfall and slower-moving storms, due to warming oceans and air temperatures.\n\nWith a population of less than three million people, Jamaica is responsible for just 0.02 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to data from the World Resources Institute. But as an island nation, it is expected to continue to bear the brunt of worsening climate effects.\n\nSpeaking at the United Nations General Assembly in September, Jamaica’s Prime Minister Andrew Holness urged wealthy countries to increase climate financing to assist countries like Jamaica with adapting.\n\n“Climate change is not a distant threat or an academic consideration. It is a daily reality for small island developing states like Jamaica,” he said.\n\nMelissa is the 13th named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from early June to late November.\n\nThe last major hurricane to affect Jamaica was Beryl in early July 2024, which was an abnormally strong storm for the time of year.\n\nBeryl brought downpours and strong winds to Jamaica as it moved past the island’s southern coast, leaving at least four people dead."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/1/deadly-temple-stampede-in-indias-andhra-pradesh","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"12:45:57+00:00","title":"Temple stampede in India’s Andhra Pradesh kills at least 9","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A stampede at the Sri Venkateswara Swamy temple in Kasibuga, Andhra Pradesh, killed at least nine people, including eight women and a young boy, and injured several others.

2025-11-01T02:47:10+00:00\n\nTitle: G7 slams Russian attacks on energy, as Ukraine decries ‘nuclear terrorism’\n\nThe energy ministers of the Group of Seven nations (G7) have issued a joint statement condemning Russia’s attacks on Ukraine’s energy system, after authorities in Kyiv described Moscow’s  most recent barrage  as akin to “nuclear terrorism”.\n\nIn a Friday statement, the G7 energy ministers – representing Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States – said Russia’s attacks “continue to inflict devastating social, environmental, and economic consequences on the Ukrainian people”.\n\n“Russia’s recent attacks on Ukraine’s natural gas infrastructure have created risks to communities and human lives, weakening civilian infrastructure and the energy security of the Ukrainian people,” it said.\n\nThe G7 statement said it continues to support the reconstruction of Ukraine’s energy sector “through direct financial assistance, credit facilities, risk insurance, policy and resource alignment, as well as setting conditions for long-term private sector investment”.\n\nOver recent weeks, Ukraine has accused Russia of repeatedly attacking critical civilian energy infrastructure ahead of the bitterly cold winter months in order to inflict suffering on its population.\n\nMost recently, Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said Moscow’s “goal is to plunge Ukraine into darkness”, after a wave of Russian attacks hit energy facilities in central, western, and southeastern regions of the country on Thursday, killing seven people.\n\n“Russia continues its systematic energy terror – striking at the lives, dignity, and warmth of Ukrainians on the eve of winter,” Svyrydenko said.\n\n“To stop the terror, we need more air defence systems, tougher sanctions, and maximum pressure on the aggressor,” she added.\n\nOn Friday, Ukraine’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs denounced what it said were “targeted strikes” by Russian forces on substations critical to supplying external power for Ukraine’s nuclear power stations.\n\n“Deliberate strikes on civilian energy facilities that directly affect the safe operation of nuclear installations bear the hallmarks of nuclear terrorism and constitute a grave violation of international humanitarian law,” it said.\n\nKyiv announced nationwide limits on electricity supplies to retail and industrial consumers following Thursday’s attacks, while water supplies and heating were also disrupted in some regions.\n\nThe United Nations’ International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) also said three Ukrainian nuclear power plants were forced to reduce output due to the assault.\n\n“The dangers to nuclear safety continue to be very real and ever-present,” IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi warned.\n\n“I once again call for maximum military restraint in the vicinity of nuclear facilities,” he added.\n\nMoscow denies it targets civilians. It claims its strikes are simply a response to Ukraine’s attacks on Russian civilian infrastructure.\n\nMoscow and Kyiv regularly accuse each other of  targeting one another’s energy sites , as well as engaging in military activity that compromises safety at Ukraine’s four working nuclear plants.\n\nThe Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, seized by Russian forces in the early weeks of Moscow’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, has become a  prime concern  for the IAEA as fighting rages nearby.\n\nOn October 23, the Russian-installed administration of Zaporizhia said it had repaired a damaged high-voltage line and restored external power to the plant.\n\nIt had been without external electricity for 30 days and relying on backup diesel generators since September 23, when its last remaining external power line was  severed in attacks  that each side blamed on the other.\n\nEurope’s largest nuclear plant, with six reactors, Zaporizhzhia, currently produces no electricity, but needs external power to cool the nuclear fuel and avoid any catastrophic nuclear incidents."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/28/record-rains-drive-flooding-in-vietnam-submerging-ancient-city","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"14:12:41Z","title":"Record rains drive flooding in Vietnam, submerging ancient city","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Record-breaking rainfall in central Vietnam, especially in the historic cities of Hue and Hoi An, has triggered severe flooding and landslides, with water levels in the Huong and Bo rivers exceeding historical highs set in 2020.

its record-keeping.\n\nThe newspaper VNExpress reported that water levels in the Huong and Bo rivers, which flow through Hue, reached 5.25m (17.2 ft) on Monday afternoon, shattering the previous historical high recorded in 2020.\n\nAs of Tuesday morning, water levels from both rivers have receded, but Hue remains submerged by more than one metre (3.3ft) of water.\n\nImages showed a wide area of the ancient city, including the palace grounds, under murky waters.\n\nAuthorities in Hue were quoted by the state news agency Vietnam News as saying that the rain and flooding may last until Friday.\n\nThe area was designated a world heritage site in 1993 by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).\n\nThe heavy rain also triggered a massive landslide of red mud on Tuesday morning about 3km (1.9 miles) long in coastal Quang Ngai province, leaving about 1,700 people isolated, authorities said.\n\nAs of Tuesday, more than 8,600 people in four central provinces were evacuated due to risks from severe flooding and landslides.\n\nHeavy flooding has also forced the state-run Vietnam Railways Corp to suspend services between the capital Hanoi and the business hub Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nThe government said in a separate report that more than 306,000 households and businesses in Hue, Danang and Quang Tri provinces were suffering from blackouts.\n\nScientists warn that storms are becoming increasingly powerful as the planet warms due to human-induced climate change.\n\nThis month’s rainfall comes after  Typhoon Bualoi  battered the country in September, leaving at least 13 people dead and 20 others missing.\n\nAccording to the General Statistics Office, natural disasters — mostly storms, floods and landslides — left 187 people dead or missing in the country in the first nine months of 2025, with total economic losses estimated at more than $610m."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/26/hurricane-melissa-now-category-3-threatens-heavy-floods-in-jamaica-haiti","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-26","timeOfPublication":"05:51:09+00:00","title":"Hurricane

Melissa  has rapidly strengthened into a major Category 4 with potentially catastrophic consequences, as it dropped torrential rain in the northern Caribbean and threatened disastrous flooding and landslides in Jamaica and southern Haiti.\n\nMelissa could intensify to a Category 5 as it nears Jamaica, forecasters said on Sunday, when making landfall in the Caribbean island in the coming day or two.\n\n“I urge Jamaicans to take this weather threat seriously,” said Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness. “Take all measures to protect yourself.”\n\nMelissa was centred about 200km (125 miles) south-southeast of Kingston, Jamaica, and about  455km (280 miles) west-southwest of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, late Saturday night.\n\nIt had maximum sustained winds of 185 kilometres per hour (115 miles per hour), the hurricane centre said.\n\nAuthorities in Jamaica said on Saturday that the Norman Manley International Airport in Kingston will be closed. They did not say whether they will close the Sangster airport in Montego Bay, on the western side of the island.\n\nMore than 650 shelters were activated in Jamaica. Officials said warehouses across the island were well-stocked and thousands of food packages prepositioned for quick distribution if needed.\n\nMelissa was expected to unleash punishing rains of up to 76 centimetres (30 inches) on Jamaica and southern Hispaniola – Haiti and the Dominican Republic – according to the hurricane centre.\n\nIt should be near or over Cuba by the middle of the week. The Cuban government on Saturday afternoon issued a hurricane watch for the provinces of Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guantanamo and Holguin.\n\nThe erratic and slow-moving storm has killed at least three people in Haiti and a fourth person in the Dominican Republic, where another person remains missing.\n\n“Unfortunately for places along the projected path of this storm, it is increasingly dire,” Jamie Rhome, the centre’s deputy director, said earlier on Saturday. He said the storm will continue to move slowly for up to four days.\n\nIn Haiti, there were also reports of rising river levels, flooding and a bridge destroyed due to breached riverbanks in Sainte-Suzanne, in the northeast.\n\n“The storm is causing a lot of concern with the way it’s moving,” said Ronald Delice, a Haitian department director of civil protection, as local authorities organised lines to distribute food kits. Many residents are still reluctant to leave their homes.\n\nThe storm has damaged nearly 200 homes in the Dominican Republic and knocked out water supply systems, affecting more than half a million customers. It also downed trees and traffic lights, unleashed a couple of small landslides and left more than two dozen communities isolated by floodwaters.\n\nThe Bahamas Department of Meteorology said Melissa could bring tropical storm or hurricane conditions to islands in the Southeast and Central Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands by early next week.\n\nMelissa is the 13th named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to November 30."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/1/demonstrators-call-for-governors-resignation-after-deadly-rio-police-raid","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"04:48:03+00:00","title":"Demonstrators call for governor’s resignation after deadly Rio police raid","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hundreds of demonstrators in Rio de Janeiro’s Vila Cruzeiro favela protested after a deadly police raid on the Complexo de Alemao and Penha favelas killed at least 121 people, including four police officers.

governor’s resignation after deadly Rio police raid\n\nHundreds of protesters have marched through one of the favelas targeted in the deadliest police raid in Rio de Janeiro’s history, calling for Rio state Governor Claudio Castro to resign.\n\nThe vocal group of demonstrators gathered on Friday in Vila Cruzeiro, part of the Penha complex of favelas that came under assault, to voice their fury at this week’s police operation that killed at least 121 people, including four police officers.\n\nSome 2,500 police and soldiers stormed the favelas – low-income and crowded neighbourhoods built on steep hillsides – across Rio on Tuesday, targeting notorious gang Comando Vermelho (Red Command) in the Complexo de Alemao and Complexo da Penha favelas.\n\nThe officers, backed by armoured vehicles and helicopters, drew retaliation from gang members, sparking scenes of chaos across the city.\n\nThe stated objective was to capture gang leaders and challenge Red Command’s territorial expansion. The group has increased its control over the city’s favelas and other areas in recent years.\n\nAuthorities initially claimed only  64 people had been killed , but the next day, residents found dozens of bodies in a nearby wooded area.\n\nLocals, politicians, activists, along with grieving mothers who lost their sons in previous operations, voiced their anger as they gathered in Vila Cruzeiro, where days earlier, residents had laid out dozens of dead bodies following the raid.\n\nMuch of the fury was directed towards Rio state’s right-wing Governor Castro, with protesters calling him an “assassin”.\n\n“Out with Castro, stop the massacres!” protesters chanted, demanding the governor’s resignation or that he be sent to prison.\n\n“Assassinating young people in favelas isn’t public policy. It’s a massacre,” said local councilwoman Monica Benicio.\n\nCastro deemed the operation a “success” against “narco-terrorists”, claiming those killed were criminals who resisted police. The state government claimed that of the 99 suspects identified so far, 42 had outstanding arrest warrants, while at least 78 had extensive criminal records.\n\nOne sign at Friday’s protest read, “120 lives lost is not a success,” while another declared, “Castro has blood on his hands.”\n\nMany also condemned the state in which the bodies were found. At least one body was reportedly decapitated, while others were found with puncture wounds or tied up.\n\nThe death toll, the highest ever in a Rio police operation, prompted condemnation from rights groups and the United Nations. Human Rights Watch denounced the “disastrous operation” and called for Brazilian authorities to “ensure a prompt, thorough, and independent investigation of each of the killings”.\n\nBrazil’s Supreme Court and lawmakers have also ordered Castro to provide detailed information on how the operation was carried out. Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes has scheduled a hearing with Castro and the heads of the military and civil police on November 3.\n\nCastro has accused the administration of leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of being soft on crime, saying the federal government has abandoned Rio in its fight against gangs.\n\nAmid the criticism, Lula said on X on Friday that he had submitted a bill to parliament proposing a minimum 30-year prison sentence for gang members."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/1/republicans-push-back-against-trumps-call-to-end-the-senate-filibuster","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"00:13:47+00:00","title":"Republicans push back against Trump’s call to end the Senate filibuster","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has called for the elimination of the Senate filibuster to end a 31-day government shutdown, arguing it allows Republicans to obstruct Democratic policies.

the Senate filibuster\n\nPresident Donald Trump has thrown himself into the ongoing debate over the United States government shutdown, calling on the Senate to scrap the filibuster and reopen the government.\n\nBut that idea was swiftly rejected on Friday by Republican leaders who have long opposed such a move.\n\nThe filibuster refers to a Senate rule that requires 60 votes to overcome objections. Currently, that rule gives the minority Democrats a check on Republican power in the Senate.\n\nIn the chamber that’s currently split 53 to 47, Democrats have had enough votes to keep the government closed while they demand an extension of healthcare subsidies. Yet, neither party has seriously wanted to nuke the rule.\n\n“THE CHOICE IS CLEAR – INITIATE THE ‘NUCLEAR OPTION,’ GET RID OF THE FILIBUSTER,” Trump said in a late-night social media  post  Thursday.\n\nTrump’s  sudden decision  to assert himself in the now 31-day-long shutdown – with his highly charged demand to end the filibuster – is certain to set the Senate on edge. It could spur senators towards their own compromise or send the chamber spiralling towards a new sense of crisis. Or, it might be ignored.\n\nRepublican leaders responded quickly, and unequivocally, setting themselves at odds with Trump, a president few have dared to publicly counter.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune has repeatedly said he is not considering changing the rules to end the shutdown, arguing that it is vital to the institution of the Senate and has allowed Republicans to halt Democratic policies when they are in the minority.\n\nThe leader’s “position on the importance of the legislative filibuster is unchanged”, Thune spokesman Ryan Wrasse said Friday.\n\nA spokeswoman for Wyoming Senator John Barrasso, the number-two Republican, said his position opposing a filibuster change also remains unchanged.\n\nAnd former Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who firmly opposed Trump’s filibuster pleas in his first term, remains in the Senate.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson also defended the filibuster Friday, while conceding “it’s not my call” from his chamber across the Capitol.\n\n“The safeguard in the Senate has always been the filibuster,” Johnson said, adding that Trump’s comments are a reflection of “the president’s anger at the situation”.\n\nEven if Thune wanted to change the filibuster, he would not currently have the votes to do so in the divided Senate.\n\n“The filibuster forces us to find common ground in the Senate,” Republican Senator John Curtis of Utah posted on the social media platform X on Friday morning, responding to Trump’s comments. “Power changes hands, but principles shouldn’t. I’m a firm no on eliminating it.”\n\nDebate has swirled around the legislative filibuster for years. Many Democrats pushed to eliminate it when they had full power in Washington, as the Republicans do now, four years ago.\n\nBut ultimately, enough Democratic senators opposed the move, predicting such an action would come back to haunt them.\n\nTrump’s demand comes as he has declined to engage with Democratic leaders on ways to end the shutdown, on track to become the longest in history.\n\nHe said in his post that he gave a “great deal” of thought to his choice on his flight home from Asia, and that one question that kept coming up during his trip was why “powerful Republicans allow” the Democrats to shut down parts of the government.\n\nBut later Friday, he did not mention the filibuster again as he spoke to reporters departing Washington and arriving in Florida for a weekend at his Mar-a-Lago home.\n\nWhile quiet talks are under way, particularly among bipartisan senators, Trump has not been seriously involved.\n\nDemocrats refuse to vote to reopen the government until Republicans negotiate an extension to the healthcare subsidies. The Republicans say they won’t negotiate until the government is reopened.\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said on CNN that Trump needs to start negotiating with Democrats, arguing the president has spent more time with global leaders than dealing with the shutdown back home.\n\nFrom coast to coast, fallout from the dysfunction of the shuttered federal government is hitting home. SNAP food aid is scheduled to shut off. Flights are being delayed. Workers are going without paychecks.\n\nAnd Americans are getting a first glimpse of the skyrocketing healthcare insurance costs that are at the centre of the deadlock.\n\n“People are stressing,” said Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, as food options in her state grow scarce. “We are well past time to have this behind us.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/1/tanzanian-president-samia-suluhu-hassan-declared-winner-of-election","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"05:32:12+00:00","title":"Tanzanian President Hassan declared winner of disputed vote with 98 percent","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu Hassan has been declared the winner of the disputed presidential election with 97.66% of the vote, following the exclusion of major opposition candidates, including Chadema leader Tundu Lissu and Luhaga Mpina.

2025-11-01T05:32:12+00:00\n\nTitle: Tanzanian President Hassan declared winner of disputed vote with 98 percent\n\nTanzanian President Samia Suluhu Hassan has been declared the winner of the country’s disputed  presidential election  with nearly 98 percent of the vote, after leading rivals were excluded from the race.\n\nThe final result announced by the electoral commission on Saturday showed Hassan had won 97.66 percent of Wednesday’s vote, dominating every constituency.\n\nA spokesman for the main opposition party Chadema, which was barred from taking part in the election, slammed Hassan’s victory as a “mockery of the democratic process”,\n\n“We are calling for the intervention by a credible body to oversee another fresh election,” John Kitoka told AFP news agency.\n\nIn a speech from the administrative capital Dodoma after being certified as the winner, Hassan said the actions of the protesters were “neither responsible nor patriotic”.\n\n“When it comes to the security of Tanzania, there is no debate – we must use all available security avenues to ensure the country remains safe,” she said.\n\nThe election for president and parliament set off days of  violent protests  as demonstrators took to the streets of major cities to protest against the barring or prevention of Hassan’s main rivals from running and what they described as widespread repression.\n\nDespite a heavy security presence, election day descended into chaos, with some demonstrators tearing down banners of Hassan and setting fire to government buildings, and police firing tear gas and gunshots, according to reports quoting witnesses. Internet connectivity watchdog NetBlocks said access to social media and mobile internet was restricted across several cities during and after the vote.\n\nChadema told AFP on Friday that “about 700” people had been killed, based on figures gathered from a network checking hospitals and health clinics. On Saturday, Kitoka said the party’s monitors had reported “no less than 800 people” were killed by security forces in protests this week.\n\nMeanwhile, the UN human rights office said credible reports indicated at least 10 people were killed in three cities.\n\nForeign Minister Mahmoud Thabit Kombo  told Al Jazeera  on Friday that the authorities have acted appropriately and the election was conducted fairly.\n\n“No excessive force has been used,” he told Al Jazeera, saying the government has “no official figures” on any protesters killed. “I’ve not seen these 700 anywhere.”\n\nAlex Vines, the Africa director of the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR), says there has been “a campaign of harassment and intimidation” towards the opposition in Tanzania.\n\n“It clearly is not a credible election,” he told Al Jazeera from London, saying the level of violence surrounding the polls, with hundreds of reported deaths, was unexpected in Tanzania.\n\n“This is a very serious crackdown,” the analyst said, stressing that most of the protesters were young people – namely Generation Z.\n\n“There are many young Tanzanians, who think they have been left behind,” Vines added.\n\nHassan, who in 2021 was elevated from vice president on the sudden death of her predecessor, John Magufuli, faced 16 candidates from smaller parties.\n\nChadema leader Tundu Lissu has been jailed for months, charged with treason after he called for electoral reforms that he said were a prerequisite for free and fair elections. He denies the charges. Another opposition figure, Luhaga Mpina of the ACT-Wazalendo group, was barred from running.\n\nRights groups allege Hassan oversaw a “wave of terror” in the country before the vote, including a string of high-profile abductions that escalated in the final days. The government has rejected criticisms of its human rights record.\n\nUnited Nations chief Antonio Guterres is “deeply concerned” about the situation in Tanzania, “including reports of deaths and injuries during the demonstrations”, his spokesman said in a statement."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/1/mass-protests-planned-as-serbia-marks-anniversary-of-train-station-collapse","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"08:26:05+00:00","title":"Serbians mark anniversary of deadly train station collapse","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On the first anniversary of a deadly train station roof collapse in Novi Sad, Serbia, tens of thousands gathered in mourning, observing 16 minutes of silence for the 16 victims.

of thousands of people have marked the first anniversary of a train station roof collapse in the Serbian city of Novi Sad, observing 16 minutes of silence for the 16 victims of the tragedy.\n\nAt 11:52am (10:52 GMT), the time when the incident occurred on November 1, 2024, the large crowd stood in silence outside the railway station on Saturday.\n\n“You could hear a pin drop, it was totally silent for 16 minutes,” Al Jazeera’s Milena Veselinovic reported from the scene.\n\nShe said that the mood was “incredibly sombre” at the event, stressing that the protesters’ aim was both to commemorate the victims but also demand accountability.\n\n“A year on from this disaster, no one has been tried,” said Veselinovic.\n\nThirteen people, including former construction minister Goran Vesic, were  charged  in a criminal case over the collapse, but they have not been tried yet.\n\n“Within the Serbian legal system, those charges still need to be confirmed by a higher court – that hasn’t happened and people here don’t have much faith system in the system that any trial will happen any time soon,” said Veselinovic. “They blame the government and they blame corruption.”\n\nA separate anticorruption probe continues alongside a European Union-backed investigation into the possible misuse of EU funds in the project.\n\nRegular student-led protests have gripped Serbia since the collapse of the canopy at the newly renovated railway station in the country’s second largest city, which became a symbol of entrenched corruption.\n\nProtesters first demanded a transparent investigation, but their calls soon escalated into demands for early elections.\n\nStudents, who called for the “largest commemorative gathering” on Saturday, and others, have been pouring into Novi Sad since Friday, arriving by car, bicycle, or on foot.\n\nThousands  marched  from Belgrade for some 100km (62 miles) and other parts of the country, including Novi Pazar, about 340km (210 miles) south of the capital. It took them 16 days to finish the march.\n\nResidents of Novi Sad took to the streets to greet the marchers, blowing whistles and waving flags, many visibly moved.\n\nDijana Hrka’s 27-year-old son was among the victims.\n\n“What I want to know is who killed my child so I can have a little peace, so that I don’t keep going through hell,” she told Al Jazeera.\n\nHrka added: “I am looking for justice. I want no other mother to go through what I am going through.”\n\nThe protests over the station’s collapse have led to the resignation of the prime minister, the fall of his government and the formation of a new one. But nationalist President Aleksandar Vucic has remained defiantly in office.\n\nVucic has denied accusations and regularly labelled demonstrators as foreign-funded coup plotters, while members of his SNS party pushed conspiracy theories, claiming that the train station roof collapse may have been an orchestrated attack.\n\nBut in a televised public address on Friday, Vucic made a rare gesture and apologised for saying things that, he said, he now regretted.\n\n“This applies both to students and to protesters, as well as to others with whom I disagreed. I apologise for that,” Vucic said and called for dialogue.\n\nThe government has declared Saturday a day of national mourning while the head of the Serbian Orthodox Church (SPC), Patriarch Porfirije, is to serve a mass for the victims at the Belgrade Saint Sava church.\n\n“On this sad anniversary, we appeal to everyone … to act with restraint, to de-escalate tensions and to avoid violence,” the EU delegation in Serbia said in a statement.\n\nAleksandar Popov, a Serbian political analyst, told Al Jazeera that “sky-high” corruption is a major issue in the country that needs to be addressed.\n\n“We’re not talking about tens of millions of euros, but hundreds of millions of euros spun through large infrastructure projects, perhaps billions of euros,” he said.\n\n“This government and the president have captured all key institutions of state, like the judiciary,” he added.\n\nThe protests have remained largely peaceful, but, in mid-August, they  degenerated  into violence that protesters blamed on heavy-handed tactics by government loyalists and police."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/1/melissa-leaves-50-dead-toll-expected-to-rise-in-jamaica-haiti","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"05:03:28+00:00","title":"Melissa leaves 50 dead, toll expected to rise in Jamaica, Haiti","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, a powerful Category 5 storm, devastated Jamaica, Haiti, and Cuba, killing around 50 people with the toll expected to rise.

and Cuba for days, leaving a trail of devastation that killed about 50 people.\n\nThe hurricane smashed into Jamaica with enormous force on Tuesday as a Category 5 storm, and residents were assessing their losses and the long road to recovery on Friday.\n\nMore than 60 percent of Jamaica remains without power, and nearly half of its water systems are offline.\n\nIn the historic seaside town of Black River, in southwest Jamaica, up to 90 percent of all structures were left without roofs, while the storm also snapped power lines and toppled concrete structures.\n\n“People are hungry,” said Monique Powell as she stood watch over a stash of groceries and household items for herself and a group of residents from Greenfield, one of many hurricane-torn communities on the outskirts of Black

which had become water-soaked and damaged.\n\nThe storm, one of the most powerful ever recorded, was made four times more likely because of human-caused climate change, according to a study by Imperial College London.\n\nJamaica’s Information Minister Dana Morris Dixon told a briefing that authorities had “quite credible” reports of a potential five additional deaths, but had not yet been able to confirm.\n\n“We’re still at 19 confirmed, but we do expect that will change today,” she said.\n\nIn nearby Haiti, authorities reported at least 31 people killed and 21 others missing, mostly in the country’s southern region. More than 15,800 people also remained in shelters.\n\nNo deaths were reported in Cuba as of Friday, where the civil defence evacuated more than 735,000 people across the eastern part of the island and where dangerous flooding continued in some areas on Friday.\n\nAlthough the full cost of Jamaica’s recovery is not yet known, the Caribbean country has allocated money for disaster response, including through a unique catastrophe bond arrangement with the World Bank.\n\nDixon said the bond, issued in 2024, provides Jamaica with $150m in financial protection for four hurricane seasons.\n\n“This bond, which provides payouts in the event of natural disasters until 2027, has been triggered by Hurricane Melissa,” she said on Friday.\n\nJamaica is  among many countries calling on wealthy nations to  increase climate financing  to help cover  the costs of climate-induced disasters.\n\nMeanwhile, Jamaica’s Minister of Science, Energy and Technology Andrew Wheatley said that the country “deeply appreciates the global outpouring of support” in the wake of Melissa, but urged potential donors to be wary of scams and use the official government portal for donations.\n\nCuba was working on Friday to rescue residents still stranded by unprecedented floodwaters in the wake of Melissa.\n\nThe Cauto River overflowed its banks shortly after the Hurricane slammed into Cuba as a dangerous Category 3 hurricane, bringing upwards of 380mm (15 inches) of rain to some areas of the eastern end of the island.\n\nEmergency workers on Friday waded waist-deep in wetsuits and used boats and military vehicles to rescue residents from the still-rising waters of the country’s longest river.\n\nRio Cauto resident Eduardo Verdecia, 83, said he and his family had expected the river to subside, but continuing rains, plus run-off from nearby mountains and a fast-rising reservoir, had surprised them.\n\n“When night fell, we thought it would go down.

freedoms after war with Israel\n\nTehran, Iran –  President Masoud Pezeshkian unveiled a “Gen Z adviser” about a month ago, posing for a smiling photo with him that went viral online.\n\nThe adviser, Amirreza Ahmadi, told local media that he sees his mission as listening to the youth of Iran, “from Tehran to the borders of this country”, going so far as to share his mobile number.\n\nBut he later blocked commenting on his social media profiles after criticism from users who claimed that Ahmadi did not “resemble” Gen Z Iranians, was using bots to boost his social media accounts, and had no established connection with youth groups or students demanding change.\n\nThe appointment appears to have been part of an effort by the moderate administration, which promised improved social freedoms and lifted sanctions during election campaigns, to connect with younger generations, who have been  driving political change across Asia  and globally.\n\nPezeshkian and his administration have struggled, though – partly as a result of indifference from many young Iranians to their overtures, and partly because many of the Iranian establishment’s more hardline factions have little interest in appeasing the youth.\n\nSanam Vakil, director of Chatham House’s Middle East and North Africa Programme, said the Iranian state is struggling to speak the language of a generation that grew up online and outside its ideological frame.\n\nAs such, she added, its outreach “feels transactional rather than transformative and ultimately is directed to staving off unrest and protests”, while the hardline elite’s fear of losing control outweighs any concern about losing the young.\n\n“That imbalance keeps Iran locked in a politics of repression rather than renewal. I think the system will be locked between conflicting messages, narratives, and policies,” she told Al Jazeera.\n\nMany of the people defying aspects of state controls are Gen Z youth, who are, like most Iranians, also crushed by the deteriorating economic conditions and rampant inflation amid  corruption and mismanagement .\n\nWith Israel and its Western allies openly touting regime change in Iran since the 12-day war between them in June, authorities say they recognise that public support is needed to get the country through difficult conditions, including reinstated UN sanctions and the lingering threat of war.\n\nThis forced some officials, mostly those in the more moderate or pragmatic camps, to advocate for dialling down some controls on social freedoms.\n\nFormer President Hassan Rouhani, a moderate camp leader, last week criticised hardline lawmakers and politicians for advancing legislation opposed by an overwhelming majority of Iranians, in a likely reference to the  contentious issue of mandatory hijab .\n\nThe government has said it will not enforce the law.\n\nIranshahr, Tehran\n\npic.twitter.com/8nIaJAZVAO\n\n— Arash Azizi آرش عزیزی (@arash_tehran)  October 25, 2025\n\nBut, on the other hand,  hardline factions within the establishment  have mobilised to reintroduce as many restrictions as possible.\n\nA video recorded in downtown Tehran went viral online this week, showing young men and women, who disregarded the dress code imposed by the theological establishment, enjoying a street music performance.\n\nAfter years of musicians defying a state ban on street performances, they have become increasingly common, but still face crackdowns if they get too much attention.\n\nAt least one of the band members had their Instagram account closed by Iranian authorities, with the police posting on the account that it was shut down by judicial order due to “publishing criminal content”.\n\nThe authorities have not publicly confirmed whether the band member could face further punishment.\n\nHardline conservative media outlets this week reported another crackdown in Tehran.\n\nTicket sales for a “disco that included naked women dancing with boys” in the Pakdasht area were stopped, and legal cases were opened against organisers, according to the state-run Fars news website, affiliated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.\n\nThis was in reference to an electronic music event that had been running for weeks and was selling tickets legally after obtaining the required permits from the authorities.\n\nDancing in public spaces, especially when done by men and women together, are prohibited and at times, punished by Iranian authorities.\n\nDrinking alcohol remains outlawed, as well, leading to some Iranians purchasing smuggled goods or dangerous homemade products. Alcohol tainted with ethanol and other chemicals continues to  claim dozens of lives each year .\n\nBut some cafes and restaurants continue to hire DJs – and at times, serve alcohol – despite the restrictions.\n\nIn mid-September, authorities permanently shut down a major restaurant located in Tehran’s Nahjol Balaghe Park because a clip showed people dancing to music inside and because alcohol was allegedly served there.\n\nSeveral clothing shops and other vendors have been shut down over recent weeks after they held events where young people danced in attendance.\n\nIn mid-September, authorities also  cancelled a major public concert  at Tehran’s iconic Azadi Tower that was initially conceived by the government as a demonstration of national unity.\n\nThe apparent contradiction between the positions of different factions within the establishment highlights the nature of Iran – with the government not necessarily having the final say in diffferent matters, and other forces, such as the Revolutionary Guard, able to defy government policy.\n\nThe Supreme National Security Council has ordered authorities to stop heavily enforcing the  controversial hijab law , which penalises women and men with prison time, being lashed or paying fines if the state determines their attire is improper.\n\nIran experienced months of deadly nationwide protests in 2022 and 2023 after the death in police custody of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman who was arrested over her hijab.\n\nHowever, some so-called “morality police” vans have been seen in cities across the country, even though Pezeshkian’s government said no budget had been dedicated towards it.\n\nAnother group defying the system in Iran are women riding motorcycles, as the state still won’t issue them motorcycle licences.\n\nThe government introduced legislation to allow women to ride, but it is stuck in a parliament  dominated by hardline lawmakers  after a record-low turnout in elections since 2020.\n\nMore women are riding motorcycles across the country, however, with hundreds filmed recently taking part in group rides in Tehran.\n\nPezeshkian’s government has also failed to honour another campaign promise: lifting  draconian state bans  on almost all global social media and tens of thousands of websites.\n\nThe government this week blamed Israel for the continued imposition of the tough internet restrictions, claiming that the controls would have been lifted had it not been for the June war.\n\nAzadeh Moaveni, writer and associate professor at New York University, told Al Jazeera she does not believe any faction of the state enjoys broad support from the younger generation, as they haven’t been able to offer them anything substantial.\n\n“Pragmatists within the state are just offering their own frustration, which is of zero value, and at best pointing out, as the president has, that he won’t enforce laws that the majority of the country opposes, like the hijab law,” she said.\n\nMoaveni said the dynamic of loosening and tightening of social freedoms by the state to manage society was no longer working, partly due to the changes taking place in society and also because of the dire economic conditions and multiple  ongoing crises reshaping daily life ."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/1/trump-says-not-planning-us-strikes-on-venezuela","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"01:59:41+00:00","title":"Trump says not planning US strikes on Venezuela","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In November 2025, US President Donald Trump stated he is not planning military strikes within Venezuela, contradicting earlier remarks suggesting targeted actions against drug traffickers.

within Venezuela, appearing to contradict his own comments earlier this month, amid a major US military build-up in the region.\n\nThe US has now deployed fighter jets, warships and thousands of troops to the Caribbean, with the world’s largest warship, aircraft carrier USS Gerald R Ford,  on its way towards the Venezuelan coast .\n\nWhen asked by reporters on board Air Force One on Friday if media reports that he was considering strikes within Venezuela were true, Trump answered: “No.”\n\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio delivered the same message as he responded to an article in the Miami Herald that said Washington’s forces were poised to hit Venezuela.\n\n“Your ‘sources’ claiming to have ‘knowledge of the situation’ tricked you into writing a fake story,” Rubio said in a post on X.\n\nTrump’s brief response on Friday appeared to contrast with remarks he has made about Venezuela on at least  two occasions   earlier this month .\n\nThe US president said last week he would not “necessarily ask for a declaration of war” to proceed, saying, “I think we’re just going to kill people that are bringing drugs into our country. OK? We’re going to kill them.”\n\n“Now they [drugs] are coming in by land … you know, the land is going to be next,” he added.\n\nThe US military has launched a  string of strikes  on vessels in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific since early September, killing at least 62 people and destroying 14 boats and a semi-submersible.\n\nThe Trump administration has said the attacks are targeting alleged drug smuggling, but has yet to present any evidence to the public to substantiate its claims.\n\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk decried the attacks “and their mounting human cost” as “unacceptable” in a statement on Friday.\n\n“The US must halt such attacks and take all measures necessary to prevent the extrajudicial killing of people aboard these boats, whatever the criminal conduct alleged against them,” Turk said.\n\nMeanwhile, a new YouGov poll published on Friday found that fewer Americans approve of the US Navy’s presence around Venezuela than in September.\n\nIn the most recent poll, just 30 percent of people surveyed said that they strongly or somewhat approved of the naval deployment, while 37 percent disapprove.\n\nBy contrast, slightly more people, 36 percent, approved in September, while 38 percent disapproved.\n\nVenezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has responded to the US escalation by accusing the US government of “fabricating a new eternal war” against him.\n\nHe has also denied the US claims about drugs.\n\n“Venezuela is a country that does not produce cocaine leaves,” he said last week, while experts say that most drugs are smuggled into the US via the Mexican land border – by US citizens.\n\nDespite the comments by Trump and Rubio, Trinidad and Tobago, which neighbours Venezuela and has been  hosting a US warship , put its military on alert on Friday and recalled all personnel to their bases.\n\nTrinidadian forces have been placed on “STATE ONE ALERT LEVEL,” a message sent by the army said, according to the AFP news agency. Police said that “all leave is restricted” until further notice.\n\nThe Trinidad and Tobago Guardian newspaper also confirmed that soldiers had been ordered to report to duty.\n\nOn Tuesday, Venezuela  suspended a major gas deal  with neighbouring Trinidad and Tobago, citing the island nation’s reception of the USS Gravely US warship.\n\nTrinidad and Tobago has said the warship was there for regular, planned joint military exercises with the United States.\n\nLeaders of the US Senate Armed Services Committee from both the Republican and Democratic parties have said that their requests for information on the legal basis of the US attacks on vessels in the Caribbean have gone unanswered.\n\nIn a rare bipartisan action, Republican Senator Roger Wicker and Democrat Jack Reed released a statement on Friday, alongside two letters requesting more information on the strikes, addressed to US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, dated September 23 and October 6.\n\nWicker, who is also the chair of the committee, and Reed, who is the top Democrat, said that to date, the requested documents have not been provided."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/28/hurricane-melissa-live-category-5-storm-nears-jamaica-strongest-this-year?update=4067270","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"07:34:24+00:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":[],"content":"Published: 2025-10-28T07:34:24+00:00\n\nTitle: Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica\n\nThis live page has now been closed."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/28/hurricane-melissa-live-category-5-storm-nears-jamaica-strongest-this-year?update=4067258","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"07:34:24+00:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa updates: 'Storm of the century' makes landfall in Jamaica","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article titled 'Hurricane Melissa updates: 'Storm of the century' makes landfall in Jamaica' reports on a major hurricane making landfall in Jamaica, referred to as the 'Storm of the century,' but no specific details, entities, or events are provided due to the article being closed or lacking content.","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":[],"content":"Published: 2025-10-28T07:34:24+00:00\n\nTitle: Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica\n\nThis live page has now been closed."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/28/hurricane-melissa-live-category-5-storm-nears-jamaica-strongest-this-year","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"07:34:24+00:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa updates: 'Storm of the century' makes landfall in Jamaica","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"No key information or entities were extracted from the article due to its incomplete or unavailable content.","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":[],"content":"Published: 2025-10-28T07:34:24+00:00\n\nTitle: Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica\n\nThis live page has now been closed."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/23/tropical-storm-melissa-takes-aim-at-caribbean-islands-on-alert","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"06:29:43+00:00","title":"Tropical Storm Melissa takes aim at Caribbean, islands on alert","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tropical Storm Melissa, the 13th named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season and the first to form in the Caribbean this year, is threatening the Caribbean Sea islands with life-threatening flooding and dangerous landslides due to heavy rainfall.

Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi, has resigned after admitting to leaking footage showing the gang rape of a prisoner at the Sde Temain prison facility in August last year.\n\nThe video of the rape had originally been  leaked  to the press in early August in the midst of a right-wing backlash following the arrest of a number of soldiers for the rape of a Palestinian prisoner.\n\nIn her resignation statement on Friday, Tomer-Yerushalmi blamed pressure from the right-wing on her rape investigation for her decision to leak the footage, claiming that she was countering “false propaganda directed against the military law enforcement authorities”.\n\nIn the leaked footage, soldiers can be seen grabbing and leading away a blindfolded Palestinian prisoner before surrounding him with riot shields to obscure the rape.\n\n“For 15 minutes, the accused kicked the detainee, stomped on him, stood on his body, hit him and pushed him all over his body, including with clubs, dragged his body along the ground, and used a taser gun on him, including on his head,” the original indictment stated.\n\nAccording to medical information obtained by the Israeli daily Haaretz, the victim suffered a ruptured bowel, severe anal and lung injuries, and broken ribs as a result of the assault. He later required surgery.\n\nAt least nine soldiers were detained in connection with the man’s rape. All but five were released relatively quickly.\n\nIn February, the remaining soldiers were indicted for “severely abusing” the detainee, but not raping him. The trial is ongoing.\n\nA United Nations commission, reviewing the change of indictment and other instances of Israel’s use of sexual and gender-based violence, determined that the decision to downgrade the indictments, despite the evidence, “will inevitably result in a more lenient punishment” if there is a conviction.\n\nBecause they determined that doing so was somehow unpatriotic.\n\nA  number  of Israel’s far-right politicians, including Heritage Minister Amichai Eliyahu, were among those who stormed the Sde Teiman prison in protest at the arrest of the soldiers for rape.\n\nIsrael’s hard-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir appeared to address Tomer-Yerushalmi directly in July 2024, writing in Hebrew, “The Military Advocate General, take your hands off the reservists!” he said, referring to the soldiers accused of rape.\n\nBen-Gvir’s fellow traveller on the far-right, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, was equally active on social media at the time, writing that the alleged rapists should be treated like “heroes, not villains”.\n\nReturning to social media during the furore following the rape, Smotrich chose to ignore the credible accusations of rape and instead called for “an immediate criminal investigation to locate the leakers of the trending video that was intended to harm the reservists and that caused tremendous damage to Israel in the world, and to exhaust the full severity of the law against them”.\n\nMany of the loudest voices in defending the alleged rapists were equally vocal in welcoming the resignation of the woman responsible for sharing evidence of that rape.\n\nWriting on social media hours after Tomer-Yerushalmi’s resignation, Smotrich accused her and much of Israel’s judicial system of rank corruption, as well as launching what he called an “anti-Semitic blood libel” against their military.\n\nBen-Gvir was no less critical of Israel’s judicial system in the leaking of the footage, writing: “All those involved in the affair must be held accountable.”\n\nBoth ministers are active supporters of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s ongoing attempts to  weaken the judiciary  and reduce its political oversight.\n\nAt least 135 of the  mutilated bodies  returned to Palestinian officials in Gaza by Israel last week as part of the Gaza ceasefire deal, had been held at Sde Teiman, documents that accompanied each corpse showed.\n\nSeveral of the bodies had been left with blindfolds on, and some had their hands still tied behind their back. One had a rope around its neck.\n\nThe same UN report that examined the reduced indictment against the soldiers also noted that detainees at Sde Teiman – including children – were regularly shackled, forced into stress positions, denied toilets and showers and beaten.\n\nSome were subjected to sexual violence, including the insertion of objects, electric shocks and rape."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/1/thousands-missing-new-horrors-emerge-after-rsf-taking-of-sudan-el-fasher","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"11:18:54+00:00","title":"Thousands missing, new horrors emerge after RSF taking of Sudan’s el-Fasher","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following the fall of el-Fasher to the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in October 2025, thousands of civilians have fled to Tawila, with survivors reporting mass killings, rape, and ethnic targeting.

recounted  harrowing stories  after fleeing the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces in western Sudan’s Darfur, while thousands more remain missing.\n\nThe capital of North Darfur state was the last Sudanese army stronghold in the vast region before falling to the RSF after 18 months of siege on Sunday.\n\nSince then, the United Nations and international aid agencies  have raised the alarm  over the fate of civilians as accounts of  mass killings , rape and other abuses continue to emerge.\n\nAlkheir Ismail, a young Sudanese man who has fled to the town of Tawila, some 50km (31 miles) away, said he was among a group of 300 people who were stopped by RSF fighters as they tried to escape el-Fasher on Sunday. The fighters only spared him because one of the captors recognised him from his school days, he added.\n\n“There was a young man I studied with, in the university in Khartoum, he told them, ‘Don’t kill him’. After that, they killed the rest of the people, the youths with me and my friends.”\n\nOther Sudanese in Tawila also described the fear they experienced after being stopped by fighters.\n\n“All of a sudden they showed up, from where I don’t know. Three young men showed up, different ages. They shot in the air, and said, ‘Stop, stop’. They were wearing RSF clothes,” Tahani Hassan said. “They hit us hard. They threw our clothes on the ground. Even I, as a woman, was searched. The attacker, he could be younger than my daughter.”\n\nFatima Abdulrahim, who fled with her grandchildren, said she walked for five days in brutal conditions to reach Tawila.\n\n“They beat the boys and took everything we owned; they left us with nothing. After we arrived here, we learned that the girls in the group that came after us had been raped, but our girls escaped,” she said.\n\nRawaa Abdalla, a young woman who fled the city, said her father is missing.\n\n‘We don’t know whether he’s alive or dead, whether he’s with the people who left or if he’s injured,” she said.\n\nIn a speech on Wednesday night, RSF head Mohamed Hamdan “Hemedti” Dagalo called on his fighters to protect civilians and said violations will be prosecuted.\n\nOn Thursday, the paramilitary group, which has been fighting the Sudanese army since April 2023, claimed to have arrested several fighters accused of abuses, but UN humanitarian affairs chief Tom Fletcher questioned the RSF’s commitment to investigating violations.\n\nA high-level RSF commander called the accounts “media exaggeration” by the army and its allied fighters “to cover up for their defeat and loss” of el-Fasher, according to Reuters news agency.\n\nBoth the RSF and the army have faced war crimes accusations over the course of the conflict that has killed tens of thousands of people, forced some 14 million from their homes and created the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, according to the UN. Famine is widespread while outbreaks of cholera and other deadly diseases are on the rise.\n\nMore than 62,000 people fled el-Fasher between Sunday and Wednesday, according to the UN. As of late August, el-Fasher was still home to 260,000 people.\n\nIn a statement on Friday, Doctors Without Borders (Medecins Sans Frontieres or MSF) said agencies operating on the ground estimate that only a little over 5,000 people managed to make their way to Tawila over the past five days.\n\n“Based on what patients tell us, the most likely, albeit frightening, answer is that they are being killed, blocked, and hunted down when trying to flee,” said MSF head of emergencies Michel Olivier Lacharite, calling on mediators the United States, Saudi Arabia, the  United Arab Emirates  and Egypt to intervene.\n\nMSF said every single child under five years old, of the 70 new arrivals in Tawila on October 27, was acutely malnourished, with 57 percent of them suffering from severe acute malnutrition.\n\nSurvivors told the aid agency that RSF fighters separated people by gender, age or perceived ethnic identity, with many remaining held for ransom, with sums ranging from 5 million to 30 million Sudanese pounds (more than $8,000 to nearly $50,000).\n\nAnother survivor reported gruesome scenes of RSF fighters crushing several prisoners with their vehicles, it said.\n\nWe denounce the horrendous mass atrocities and killings, both indiscriminate and ethnically-targeted, that have culminated this week in and around El Fasher, Sudan. https://t.co/YGo84UxEn5\n\n— MSF International (@MSF)  October 31, 2025\n\nThe UN Population Fund (UNFPA), the organisation’s sexual and reproductive health agency, which offers humanitarian assistance in Tawila, spoke to more survivors while protecting their identities.\n\nA 24-year-old man said that of a group of 200 men, women and children, only four people who could pay a ransom ended up surviving four different encounters with RSF soldiers at checkpoints on the way to Tawila.\n\n“The rest were killed.

January.\n\nAmong those sentenced on Friday were Halit Ergul – the owner of the Grand Kartal Hotel, which sits in the Kartalkaya ski resort about 295km (183 miles) east of Istanbul – according to state-run broadcaster TRT Haber.\n\nThe court also sentenced Ergul’s wife, Emine Ergul, and their daughters, Elif Aras and Ceyda Hacibekiroglu – all of whom were part of the hotel’s management team.\n\nThe  deadly blaze broke out overnight  in the restaurant of the Grand Kartal on January 21, quickly engulfing the 12-storey hotel, where 238 guests were staying.\n\nThirty-four children were among 78 people killed in the fire, which occurred during the school holidays when many families from Ankara and Istanbul head to the Bolu mountains to ski.\n\nAnother 137 people suffered injuries during the incident, as panicked hotel guests were forced to jump from windows in the middle of the night.\n\nAlso sentenced on Friday were the hotel’s general manager, Emir Aras, as well as the deputy mayor of Bolu, Sedat Gulener, and the director of another hotel, Ahmet Demir, both of whom were reportedly on the board of directors of the company that owned the Grand Kartal.\n\nThere are a total of 32 defendants in the trial, 20 of whom are in pre-trial detention, according to TRT. It’s unclear when the remaining defendants will appear in court.\n\nIn total, the convicted were handed 34 aggravated life sentences for the 34 children killed in the disaster. Those in the courtroom greeted the announcement with applause.\n\nThe fire sparked nationwide anger in Turkiye, with questions raised over safety measures in place at the hotel after survivors said no fire alarms went off during the incident, and they had to navigate smoke-filled corridors in complete darkness.\n\nUnder pressure to act, Turkish authorities quickly  arrested nine people  in connection with the blaze, while the government appointed six prosecutors to lead an investigation.\n\nSpeaking to reporters outside the still-smoking hotel, Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya pledged that those “responsible for causing this pain will not escape justice”.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced a day of national mourning, as he served as a pallbearer at a funeral ceremony for the victims the following day."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/11/1/live-israel-continues-attacks-on-gaza-as-palestinians-fear-return-to-war?update=4075591","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"06:24:47+00:00","title":"Gaza aid blocked at crossings as Israel launches sporadic attacks","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israeli military strikes in Gaza this week have killed over 100 people, following the killing of an Israeli soldier, and the fragile ceasefire remains unstable.

Caribbean countries braced for heavy rainfall and dangerous flooding.\n\nHurricane Melissa was located about 380km (235 miles) southwest of the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince, packing maximum sustained winds of 120 kilometres (75 miles) per hour, the NHC said in its latest advisory on Saturday afternoon.\n\nA hurricane warning was in place for Jamaica as the NHC said life-threatening and catastrophic flash flooding and landslides were expected in portions of southern Hispaniola island – shared by Haiti and the Dominican Republic – and Jamaica into early next week.\n\nThe centre of Melissa was expected to move near or over Jamaica during the weekend and early next week, the NHC said, adding that it could be near or over eastern Cuba by the middle of next week.\n\nA hurricane watch was also in effect for the southwestern peninsula of Haiti, from Port-au-Prince to the border with the Dominican Republic, according to the NHC advisory.\n\nAlready, three people have died in Haiti, including two killed in a landslide in the capital Port-au-Prince and another struck by a falling tree in Marigot, officials said.\n\nA fourth person was killed in the Dominican Republic, where another remains missing.\n\nJamaica’s Meteorological Service principal director Evan Thompson told The Gleaner that residents should brace for a “double effect” as the hurricane’s eye passes over the island, with the strongest winds hitting from opposite directions on either side of the centre.\n\nThe forecast marks a significant shift from earlier in the week, when landfall was considered only a “slim chance”.\n\nAuthorities have readied more than 650 emergency shelters across Jamaica and said airports will close once a hurricane warning is declared. Prime Minister Andrew Holness warned the public to treat the approaching storm as a serious threat. “Take all measures to protect yourself,” he said.\n\nThe storm has already wrought havoc in the Dominican Republic, where nearly 200 homes have been damaged and more than half a million people left without water.\n\nIn the Los Rios neighbourhood of the capital, Santo Domingo, families were forced to flee rising floodwaters on Thursday evening after surrounding streams burst their banks, according to the Listin Diario daily newspaper.\n\nMore than two dozen Dominican communities remain cut off by floodwaters, prompting mandatory evacuations and nationwide school closures.\n\nThe situation is particularly dire for thousands displaced by gang violence in Port-au-Prince, now living in makeshift shelters with scant protection.\n\n“I’m dealing with two storms: the gangs and the weather,” Nephtali Johnson Pierre told The Associated Press news agency.\n\nMelissa is also forecast to strike eastern Cuba as a major hurricane on Wednesday."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/tag/science-and-technology/","dateOfPublication":"2910-10-20","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00Z","title":"Science and Technology | Today's latest from Al Jazeera","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A diverse array of science and technology developments are being reported in 2025, including false claims by Donald Trump linking Tylenol to autism, rising mosquito populations in Iceland due to climate change, Pakistan’s HPV vaccine rollout to combat cervical cancer, major tech outages like Amazon Web Services, growing AI-related misinformation concerns, geopolitical tensions between the US and China, ethical issues in AI-driven retail pricing, the cancellation of the US EV tax incentive, and environmental harm from 'forever chemicals' leading to accountability efforts.

mosquitoes to Iceland?\n\nMosquitoes were detected in Iceland for the first time this month, resulting in the country losing its status as one of the only places in the world without them. The findings were confirmed by the country’s national science institute on Monday.\n\nThis follows record-breaking heat this past summer, which has sped up glacial melting in the country.\n\nOn October 16, insect enthusiast Bjorn Hjaltason posted on a Facebook group  Skordýr og Nytjadýr Á Íslandi  (Insects in Iceland) that he had spotted mosquitoes in Kjos at dusk that day.\n\nHe said he had caught some using a red wine ribbon, a trap using sweetened wine as bait to attract insects. Kjos is a glacial valley 52km (32 miles) northeast of the Icelandic capital, Reykjavik.\n\nHjaltason sent the mosquitoes to the Natural Science Institute of Iceland, where entomologist Matthias Alfredsson confirmed they were indeed mosquitoes.\n\nAlfredsson identified the mosquitoes as belonging to the Culiseta annulata species. This cold-resistant species is native to the Palearctic, which refers to Europe, North Africa and most of Asia north of the Himalayas. The Culiseta annulata are not known to carry disease but are generally considered a nuisance.\n\n“It has adapted to a rather cold climate, surviving the winter as an adult and then staying in shelter, such as outbuildings and basements. The fly stings but is not considered dangerous to humans as it does not carry any known infections in these areas,” a news release published by the Natural Science Institute on Tuesday stated.\n\nMosquito species that are well adapted to cooler conditions and can survive winters as eggs or larvae do not tend to carry disease.\n\n“Their development is slower, their active season shorter and most tropical diseases cannot complete their life cycle before cold weather sets in,” British entomologist Luke Tilley from the Royal Entomological  Society told Al Jazeera. “Cooler regions, therefore, tend to have mosquitoes but with lower disease risk.”\n\nThere are more than 3,500 species of mosquitoes around the globe, and they can be found in most parts of the world, bar a very few, including Antarctica.\n\nMosquitoes breed in shallow, stagnant bodies of water, which Iceland has in abundance. Despite having many marshes and ponds, however, it has never had a native mosquito population.\n\nThis is because mosquitoes are cold-blooded, which means they thrive in warmer environments. Male mosquitoes also feed on flowers, which thrive in warmer temperatures.\n\n“Warmer air and water speed up their growth, feeding and reproduction and also allow disease‑causing organisms inside them to develop more quickly. Longer warm seasons mean more generations of mosquitoes each year, and changes in rainfall can create new pools and puddles for breeding,” Tilley said.\n\nIceland is generally cold throughout the year. Its average temperature varies from minus 1 degree Celsius (30 degrees Fahrenheit) in the winter to 11C (52F) in the warmest months.\n\nMosquitoes lay their eggs during cold weather, and when the water thaws, the larvae hatch from the eggs. In Iceland, however, water typically freezes and thaws several times a year, making the landscape generally inhospitable for mosquitoes.\n\nBefore mosquitoes were spotted this month, the closest they had come to Iceland was in the 1980s when biologist Gisli Mar Gislason spotted one inside his aeroplane that had arrived at Keflavík International Airport from Greenland. The mosquito is preserved at the Icelandic Institute of Natural History.\n\nGislason told Al Jazeera that more mosquito species are in warm climates than cold, and the greatest diversity of mosquitoes is seen in tropical areas.\n\n“There is one species in Greenland, Aedes nigripes. It is a high Arctic species, and their density is controlled by the abundance of hosts, [such as] muskoxen, Arctic foxes, reindeers, polar bears and humans.”\n\nIn a statement, the Natural Science Institute said it is unclear how this particular mosquito species came to be in Iceland. However, it added: “It is likely that it was transported by freight. It is uncertain whether it has settled here permanently, but everything indicates that it can survive in Icelandic conditions.”\n\nA growing number of new insect species are being observed in Iceland due to a warming climate and increased transportation, the institute said.\n\nThe country is warming at an unprecedented rate. In May, Iceland and neighbouring Greenland experienced record-breaking heat due to a persistent weather pattern that brought unusually warm air from the south. In May, temperatures recorded in Iceland were 13 degrees Celsius (23.4 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the 1990-2020 average – 10 times higher than the average warming of 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) across the world as a whole.\n\nThe country’s glaciers have been rapidly melting and are projected to lose about half their volume by 2100, the country’s Vatnajokull National Park website said.\n\nIncreasingly, “cooler climates can support mosquito development and survival. They can adapt to cooler temperatures up to a certain temperature below which they cannot survive. It depends which mosquito species,” Yaw Afrane, a professor of Medical Microbiology at the University of Ghana, told Al Jazeera.\n\nYes. Warming temperatures are changing how mosquitoes behave in many parts of the world.\n\nAs the planet warms, “vector-borne diseases will move to areas that have been free of them as the climate will be more permissive to disease vectors,” Afrane said.\n\nThe World Health Organization has identified an increase in insect-borne disease as one of the biggest health threats to humans associated with climate change.\n\n“Warmer conditions can allow mosquitoes and the pathogens they carry to survive in new regions, extending the potential range of diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and West Nile virus,” Tilley said.\n\n“International travel, trade and changes in land use also play a part. The key is careful monitoring and preparedness to prevent local transmission.”\n\nIn September 2023, the United Kingdom found the eggs of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in the country for the first time near Heathrow Airport. Then in August 2024, four Aedes albopictus eggs were found at a motorway service station in Kent. No further specimens were found on investigation.\n\nThe Aedes aegypti is responsible for the spread of diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika. Aedes albopictus can also transmit diseases such as dengue and chikungunya.\n\nEuropean countries have reported increasing cases of mosquito-borne illnesses recently. Last year, Italy had more than 200 local dengue cases. France and Spain also reported cases of the disease. This year, France has recorded 500 cases of chikungunya.\n\nWarmer countries that already have high rates of mosquito-borne illnesses are seeing a surge in numbers. In September, Bangladesh recorded the largest single-day rise in both deaths and hospital admissions from dengue fever when 12 people died and 740 new people were hospitalised in just 24 hours.\n\nBesides increasing temperatures, heavy rainfall can also allow mosquitoes to thrive. The rain flushes mosquito eggs, larvae and pupae from areas where they breed to new areas. If rainwater does not drain away properly, it leaves pools of shallow, stagnant water, the ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes.\n\nTilley explained that besides the spread of disease, changing mosquito populations can also create shifts in the ecosystem. “More mosquitoes can benefit their predators such as bats, dragonflies and birds, but disease in wildlife may also rise,” he said.\n\n“A mosquito in a new area will be a prey for predators like fish, waterfowl and insect-eating insects. There is, therefore, more diversity of food for these predators,” Gislason told Al Jazeera, adding that it is difficult to predict accurately what will happen if a mosquito enters a new area.

Others jump into damaged stores in the hope of finding bottled water or other supplies.\n\nAs the death toll rises, residents of Black River are still searching for loved ones while they also battle to survive, days after Hurricane Melissa made this Jamaican port city ground zero of the devastation seen across the Caribbean.\n\nResidents here say they have been living in a state of chaos the last three days since Melissa slammed into them as one of the most powerful category five storms ever recorded in the region.\n\nThe fierce winds and storm surge that barrelled through here have decimated nearly everything, leaving roads unusable and a trail of destruction that has them increasingly desperate and isolated with no electricity or running water.\n\nCapsized boats lie kerbside. Brick buildings are split in half. Giant sheets of metal are twisted between tree branches. Vehicles sit in crumbled pieces.\n\nResidents who spoke to the BBC said they have seen no aid trucks in the area so far and described having to eat what food they can find in debris by the roads in the coastal town, nearly 150km (93 miles) west of the capital, Kingston.\n\nOthers made their way inside battered supermarkets, taking what they could for themselves.\n\n\"We have to use whatever we see here, on the street and also in the supermarket,\" Demar Walker explained, sitting in a shaded area down the street from the store to escape the heat and 80% humidity.\n\nHe said he and others had to climb into the market due to its roof caving in and took what they could. They tossed water and items to others also in need.\n\n\"We had to throw food to other people.\"\n\nNearby, others told the BBC of a local pharmacy being looted in Black River, describing anarchy as people ran in and out carrying armfuls of drugs and alcohol.\n\n\"I saw items covered in mud being hauled out,\" Aldwayne Tomlinson told the BBC. \"At first, I thought the place was still open, but then I really got a second glance.\n\n\"I heard a lady say: 'Mi need go get some alcohol.' That's when I knew they were looting the pharmacy as well.\"\n\nJust down the road, a woman standing atop a pile of debris describes the situation there as \"chaos, chaos. Total. No food. No water\".\n\n\"We don't have access to money. We need help. No help has come,\" Chegun Braham continued.\n\nOne couple told the BBC that they owned multiple stores in the area, several of which they said had been looted. They are now standing guard outside one of their stores in the hope of preventing future thefts.\n\nA short walk from the market, Jimmy Esson leaned against a massive metal beam that had been knocked to the ground.\n\n\"I lost everything, all my things,\" he said. \"We need food. We have no food.\"\n\nSurvival is the primary concern on most people's minds here. The other is the rising death toll. Officials in Jamaica said on Thursday that at least 19 people had died in the country, a big jump from the five that had been counted the day before. Another 30 have died in neighbouring Haiti due to the storm.\n\n\"My community, we have dead bodies there,\" Mr Walker said.\n\nHe said he, like many others in the area, still has not heard from family and doesn't know if they made it out of the storm alive. Mr Walker is stuck in Black River, sleeping in whoever's house is still standing that will accept him, he says, while his eight-year-old son is in Westmoreland, the next parish over.\n\nWestmoreland shares Jamaica's western coast, along with Black River in the St Elizabeth parish, and was also severely damaged by Melissa.\n\n\"There's no way of getting to my family to find out if they're OK,\" he said as his eyes began to swell. Along with the unusable roads making travel difficult, there is little to no cell phone service and no electricity or running water in many hard-hit spots.\n\n\"The entire town of Black River is devastated,\" the town's Mayor Richard Solomon has said.\n\nHe noted to local media the desperation of residents who are looting and - while not condoning it - said he understood why it was happening.\n\n\"It is a delicate balance,\" Solomon said of the response to it. \"Persons are seizing the opportunity to pick up what they can off the ground [from damaged stores]. However, you have others being a little bit more forceful, where they are trying to get into people's properties to get all sorts of supplies.\"\n\nLocal officials estimate that 90% of the houses here were destroyed. Much of the town's vital infrastructure has been destroyed too, including the local hospital, police station and fire station.\n\n\"There are entire communities that seem to be marooned and areas that seem to be flattened,\" Information Minister Dana Morris Dixon said.\n\nAid supplies are starting to arrive more rapidly to the main airport in Kingston, but smaller regional airports - some of which are located near where humanitarian assistance is most needed - remain only partly operational.\n\nAid agencies and the military are bringing in the urgently needed supplies from Kingston by land but many roads remain unpassable in places, including in places like Black River.\n\nThe town is about a two-hour drive from Kingston but the main road in is - at various points - flooded, damaged and clogged with cars.\n\nMichael Tharkurdeen, a local medic, was in the town's fire station when the storm hit.\n\n\"We were upstairs, the entire bottom floor was flooded. The water was around maybe four feet going five feet. When the water came in, the seas came in, flooded everywhere,\" he said.\n\n\"Nobody could be on the bottom floor. Trust me, there were waves there about this high,\" he added, pointing to his shoulder.\n\nPeople who did make it to him from the flooded-out buildings nearby arrived in bad condition. They had \"lacerations on their hands, their feet\", he says. \"Kids, elders, everybody.\"\n\nMr Tharkurdee also found a man \"lifeless\" and with \"no pulse\" once the flood waters receded.\n\n\"I'm not a doctor, I'm a medic, so I couldn't pronounce him dead,\" he said. \"All we could have done was document that and cover his body.\"\n\nBy mid-afternoon on Friday, a fleet of military helicopters flew into Black River - with many hoping they came with desperately needed supplies.\n\nArmed officials carrying machine guns descended onto the streets and soon the crowds rummaging the looted pharmacy and grocery store had cleared. A line of cars that had jammed the sole road in the area had been cleared.\n\nA relative quiet replaced the noise and chaos of hundreds of people fighting for their survival.\n\n\"St Elizabeth, we want it to come back again,\" Shawn Morris said of the area's future and his hopes to get aid here.\n\n\"It's not about the money,\" he said. \"We need food and water.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y44ly3vg2o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"05:29:58.808+00:00","title":"Cruise cancelled following death of woman left behind on island","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 60-day cruise around Australia operated by Coral Expeditions was abruptly cancelled after the death of 80-year-old Suzanne Rees, who was left behind on Lizard Island during a day hiking excursion.

after the death of an elderly female passenger who was left behind by the ship on a remote island.\n\nSuzanne Rees had been hiking on Lizard Island with fellow passengers from the Coral Adventurer, but broke off from the group for a rest. The ship left without her and returned several hours later after the crew realised the woman was missing.\n\nA major search operation found her body the following day.\n\nThe Australian Maritime Safety Authority (Amsa) is investigating the incident, alongside Queensland Police and the state coroner.\n\nThe CEO of the cruise operator Coral Expeditions, Mark Fifield, said on Saturday that passengers and crew on the Coral Adventurer were told on Wednesday that the remainder of the voyage had been cancelled due to the \"tragic passing of Suzanne Rees and previous mechanical issues\".\n\nHe added in a statement that passengers would be issued a full refund, and said Coral Expeditions was working \"to co-ordinate the return journeys of the passengers via chartered flights\".\n\nAmsa also released an updated statement on Saturday, saying it had \"issued a notice to the Master of Coral Adventurer\" prohibiting any new passengers from boarding the ship.\n\nThe spokesperson said that officials would attend the vessel in Cairns upon its return.\n\nThe ship initially left the north-western city on 24 October, and was just two days into the voyage at the time of the 80-year-old's death. Lizard Island was the first stop on the journey.\n\nPassengers aboard - who typically pay tens of thousands of dollars to join the cruise - were transported there for a day trip with the option of hiking or snorkelling.\n\nSuzanne Rees' daughter,  Katherine Rees, said on Thursday  that her family was \"shocked and saddened that the Coral Adventurer left Lizard Island after an organised excursion without my mum\".\n\nShe described her mother as an \"active 80-year-old\" who was a member of a bushwalking group.\n\n\"From the little we have been told, it seems that there was a failure of care and common sense.\"\n\nMs Rees added that she hoped the coroner's inquiry would be able to pinpoint what \"the company should have done that might have saved mum's life\".\n\n\"We understand from the police that it was a very hot day, and mum fell ill on the hill climb,\" she said.\n\n\"She was asked to head down, unescorted. Then the ship left, apparently without doing a passenger count.\n\n\"At some stage in that sequence, or shortly after, mum died, alone.\"\n\nEarlier this week, Mr Fifield confirmed that Coral Expeditions was \"working closely with Queensland Police and other authorities to support their investigation\".\n\nHe said that the company was \"deeply sorry that this has occurred\" and had offered its full support to the Rees family.\n\nThe Coral Adventurer caters for up to 120 guests with 46 crew, according to the company's website. It was purpose-built to access remote areas of Australia's coast and is equipped with \"tenders\" - small boats used to take passengers on day excursions.\n\nIncidents like this are rare, and cruise ships have systems to record which passengers are embarking or disembarking, Harriet Mallinson, cruise editor of travel website Sailawaze, told the BBC.\n\n\"Sneaking ashore or [back] on board just isn't an option,\" she said.\n\nCruise lines take these procedures very seriously and have \"clever tech in place to prevent such incidents from happening\", Ms Mallinson added.\n\n\"This is most likely a shocking - and tragic - one-off.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c891d43l8pyo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"00:36:56.941+00:00","title":"Hand of Moscow?

The men jailed for vandalism in French hybrid warfare case\n\nThis week's trial of three undercover operatives, accused of helping the Kremlin to wage a hybrid warfare campaign to \"destabilise\" France, sounds like a surefire recipe for drama, sophistication, and intrigue.\n\nIf only.\n\nOver the course of three days, in a spacious, pine-panelled courtroom on the northern edge of Paris, the case against three seemingly unremarkable Bulgarian men, seated behind glass and shadowed by three police officers who seemed absorbed with their own mobile phones, unfolded with all the panache and excitement of a half-whispered lecture in a library.\n\n\"I had absolutely no idea where we were.\"\n\n\"I did it for the money.\"\n\n\"In the future I plan to get involved in charity work.\"\n\nThese few lines from the men's testimony may help convey the general tone.\n\nAll three were jailed on Friday for two to four years.\n\nBut to bemoan the barely audible banality of it all – the dull motives, the mumbled attempts to shift blame, the sullen complaints about prison life and unsatisfactory psychiatric evaluations - is to miss the truth.\n\nThe banality is the whole point.\n\nLike the cheap drones that both Russia and Ukraine now use to patrol their front lines, the three men on trial in courtroom 2.01 at the Palais de Justice in Paris represent a low-budget evolution of modern hybrid warfare.\n\nImprovised and startlingly effective.\n\nRising in turn inside their glass cage, Georgi Filipov, Nikolay Ivanov and Kiril Milushev admitted carrying out the acts, but denied working for a foreign power as well as antisemitism.\n\nEarly one morning in May 2024, on the banks of the River Seine in the heart of Paris, the three men conspired to spray red paint - and filmed themselves doing so - on the Wall of the Righteous, a monument to those who saved French Jews from the Holocaust during World War Two.\n\nThirty-five red handprints were left on the Shoah memorial. Five hundred more were painted elsewhere.\n\nIt was the first in a series of symbolic attacks in France: pigs' heads placed outside mosques (an act blamed on a group of Serbians); coffins left ominously by the Eiffel Tower; Stars of David painted around the capital.\n\nNews of each event was swiftly broadcast around the world – not just by regular media outlets, but by the automated army of Russian social media trolls which, according to the French agency monitoring such activity, routinely seeks to weaponise each sliver of news that might raise doubts about the stability of French society, and the strength of Europe's democracies, its institutions, and its values.\n\nFrance is seen as a particularly tempting target for the Kremlin, given its current political and social divisions, its often ambiguous attitude to Nato, its large Muslim and Jewish populations, the increasing popularity of the far right, and a history of close ties to Moscow on both extremes of the political spectrum.\n\nIn another era, the Kremlin might have used its own deep undercover agents to carry out acts of sabotage or vandalism.\n\nBut – to make the drone warfare comparison again – why rely solely on valuable assets like highly trained spies, giant ballistic missiles, or submarines used to cut undersea cables, when for a few thousand euros you can, through discreet and easily deniable channels, recruit your own disaffected army of petty criminals, or unemployed wannabe fascists?\n\n\"I had absolutely no idea where we were,\" said Georgi Filipov, as he tried to play down his alleged role in the \"red hands\" operation, arguing that he had travelled from Bulgaria simply to make a little money to help with child support payments for his nine-year-old son.\n\nHe was allegedly paid €1,000 (£875) plus travel expenses.\n\nIn the dock, Filipov, 36, cut a gaunt but muscular figure, twitching slightly like a boxer before a fight as he attempted to defuse awkward questions about his tattoos. In particular, the swastika on his chest and the social media photos showing him giving a Nazi salute and wearing a t-shirt that claimed Hitler \"was right\".\n\n\"I made bad choices in the past,\" Filipov explained, and pointed out that he had already removed several tattoos.\n\nThe Paris criminal court sentenced him to two years in jail.\n\nHaving been successfully extradited from Bulgaria and Croatia to face trial in France, the men all sought to place the blame on a fourth man, Mircho Angelov, who remains at large but is alleged to have links to a Russian intelligence officer. He was given a three-year term in absentia.\n\nThe second defendant, Kiril Milushev, 28, said he had only come to France because he had broken up with his partner, was struggling with a bipolar disorder, and wanted to keep his friend, Mircho, company. He was given two years.\n\nSeated beside Milushev, Nikolay Ivanov creased his forehead as he denied any links with Russia.\n\nHe spoke of his grandparents' role in saving Jews during World War Two and said his ambition now was to obtain a master's degree in law, and to be reunited with his girlfriend - if she'd still have him, when all this was over.\n\nConsidered the mastermind behind the plot, he was given the heaviest jail term of four years.\n\nAs for Russia's alleged role in the red-hands affair, even the defence lawyers openly admitted that \"we suspect\" Moscow's hand.\n\nBut they insisted, as did their clients, that they were unwitting pawns, proxies – one might even say \"drones\" – in a shadow war against the West."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2ww0e0jewo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"14:11:26.339+00:00","title":"Tanzania election: Samia Suluhu Hassan wins vote as hundreds feared dead in unrest","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tanzania's presidential election resulted in a victory for President Samia Suluhu Hassan, who won with 97.66% of the vote, amid widespread protests and allegations of fraud.

declared the winner of Tanzania's presidential election, securing another term amid days of unrest across the country.\n\nSamia won 98% of the votes in Wednesday's poll, the electoral commission said. In her Saturday victory speech she said the election was \"free and democratic\", accusing protesters of being \"unpatriotic\".\n\nOpposition parties rejected the results,  calling the vote a mockery of the democratic process as Samia's main challengers had been either imprisoned or barred from running.\n\nInternational observers have expressed concern over the lack of transparency and widespread turmoil that has reportedly left hundreds of people dead and injured.\n\nThe nationwide internet shutdown is making it difficult to verify the death toll.\n\nThe government has sought to play down the scale of the violence - and authorities have extended a curfew in a bid to quell the unrest.\n\nReceiving her victory certificate on Saturday, Samia, 65, said: \"We thank the security forces for ensuring that the violence did not stop voting.\n\n\"The government strongly condemns the violent incidents. These incidents were not patriotic at all,\" she said.\n\nEarlier on Saturday, electoral commission chief Jacobs Mwambegele declared Samia \"the winner of the presidential election\".\n\nSamia secured about 31.9 million votes, or 97.66% of the total, with turnout nearing 87% of the country's 37.6 million registered voters, the electoral chief said.\n\nIn Tanzania's semi-autonomous archipelago of Zanzibar - which elects its own government and leader - CCM's Hussein Mwinyi, who is the incumbent president, won with nearly 80% of the vote.\n\nThe opposition in Zanzibar said there had been \"massive fraud\", the AP news agency reported.\n\nMwinyi's swearing-in ceremony is under way at Amaan Complex stadium in Zanzibar.\n\nNo protests were reported on Saturday morning, but tension remained high in Dar es Salaam, where security forces manned roadblocks across the port city.\n\nOn Friday demonstrators Dar es Salaam and other cities took to the streets, tearing down Samia's posters and attacking police and polling stations despite warnings from the army chief to end the unrest.\n\nThe demonstrations are mostly led by young protesters, who have denounced the election as unfair.\n\nThey accuse the government of undermining democracy by suppressing the main opposition leaders - one is in jail and another was excluded on technical grounds.\n\nA spokesperson from the opposition Chadema party on Friday told AFP news agency that \"around 700\" people had been killed in clashes with security forces, while a diplomatic source in Tanzania told the BBC there was credible evidence that at least 500 people had died.\n\nForeign Minister Mahmoud Kombo Thabit has described the violence as a \"few isolated pockets of incidents here and there\" and said \"security forces acted very swiftly and decisively to address the situation\".\n\nIn a statement, the UN chief Antonio Guterres said he was  \"deeply concerned\" about the situation in Tanzania, \"including reports of deaths and injuries during the demonstrations\".

2025-11-01T01:10:03.703+00:00\n\nTitle: Henley Passport Index: Why Indian passport is falling in global ranking\n\nEarlier this year, a video by an Indian travel influencer complaining about India's weak passport went viral on social media.\n\nHe  said  that while neighbouring countries like Bhutan and Sri Lanka were more welcoming of Indian tourists, getting visas to travel to most Western and European countries remained a challenge.\n\nHis dissatisfaction with India's poor passport strength was reflected  in the latest Henley Passport Index  - a ranking system of the world's passports based on visa-free travel - which placed India in the 85th spot out of 199 countries, five spots lower than last year.\n\nThe Indian government has not commented on the report yet. The BBC has reached out to the ministry of external affairs.\n\nCountries like Rwanda, Ghana and Azerbaijan with much smaller economies than India - which is the fifth-largest economy globally - are ranked higher on the index at the 78th, 74th and 72nd spots, respectively.\n\nIn fact, India's rank in the past decade has hovered in the 80s, even dipping to the 90th spot in 2021. These rankings are dismal compared to Asian nations like Japan, South Korea and Singapore, which have consistently held top positions.\n\nThis year, like the last, Singapore topped the index with visa-free travel to 193 countries. South Korea came in second with 190 visa-free destinations and Japan ranked third with 189 countries.\n\nMeanwhile, Indian passport holders have visa-free entry to 57 countries, just like the citizens of the African country Mauritania, which shares the 85th rank with India.\n\nPassport strength reflects a nation's soft power and global influence. It also translates into better mobility for its citizens, boosting business and learning opportunities. A weak passport means more paperwork, higher visa costs, fewer travel privileges and longer waiting times for travel.\n\nBut despite the decline in the rank, the number of countries offering visa-free access to Indians has actually increased in the past decade or so.\n\nFor example, in 2014 - the year Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came to power - 52 countries offered visa-free travel to Indians and its passport ranked 76th on the index.\n\nA year later, it tumbled to the 85th position, then rose to 80th in 2023 and 2024, dropping again to the 85th position this year. Meanwhile, visa-free destinations for Indians increased from 52 in 2015 to 60 in 2023 and 62 in 2024.\n\nThe number of visa-free destinations in 2025 (57) is higher than what it was in 2015 (52), yet India's rank for both these years is 85. So, why is that?\n\nExperts say that a major reason is the increasingly competitive landscape in global mobility - meaning countries are entering into more travel partnerships to benefit their citizens and their economies. According to a 2025 report by Henley & Partners, the global average number of destinations travellers are able to access visa-free has nearly  doubled from 58 in 2006 to 109 in 2025 .\n\nFor example, China has increased the number of visa-free destinations its citizens can travel to from 50 to 82 in the past decade. Consequently, its rank on the index has improved from 94th to 60th during the same time period.\n\nMeanwhile, India - which was ranked 77th on the index in July (the Henley Passport Index is updated quarterly to reflect changes in global visa policies) as it enjoyed visa-free access to 59 countries - dropped to the 85th position in October after losing access to two countries.\n\nAchal Malhotra, former Indian ambassador to Armenia, says there are other factors that affect the strength of a country's passport, like its economic and political stability as well as its openness to welcoming citizens from other countries.\n\nFor example, the US passport has dropped out of the top 10 and now occupies the 12th position - a historic low -  because of its increasingly insular stance in world politics , the report says.\n\nMr Malhotra recalls how in the 1970s, Indians enjoyed visa-free travel to many Western and European countries, but that changed after the  Khalistan movement  in the 1980s, which called for an independent homeland for Sikhs in India and caused internal turmoil. Subsequent political upheavals have further chipped away at India's image as a stable, democratic country.\n\n\"Many countries are also becoming increasingly wary of immigrants,\" Mr Malhotra says. \"India has a high number of people migrating to other countries or overstaying their visas and that interferes with the country's reputation.\"\n\nFactors such as how secure a country's passport is and its immigration procedures also play a role in gaining visa-free access to other countries, Mr Malhotra says.\n\nIndia's passport remains vulnerable to security threats. In 2024, the Delhi police  arrested 203 people  for alleged visa and passport fraud. India is also known for having cumbersome immigration procedures and a slow pace of visa processing.\n\nMr Malhotra says that technological advances, like India's recently-launched  electronic passport or e-passport , can improve security and ease the immigration process. The e-passport includes a small chip that stores biometric information, making it harder to forge or tamper with the document.\n\nBut more diplomatic outreach and travel agreements remain key to boosting the global mobility of Indians and, by extension, India's passport ranking.\n\nFollow BBC News India on  Instagram ,  YouTube,   X  and  Facebook ."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3dnnpvjkjvo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"10:49:44.904+00:00","title":"Andrew should answer Jeffrey Epstein questions in US, Democrats say","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"U.S. lawmakers, including members of the House Oversight Committee, are urging Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, a brother of King Charles III, to testify about his connections to Jeffrey Epstein, despite his repeated denials.

Andrew has always denied wrongdoing.\n\nAt least four Democrat members of the House Oversight Committee have since renewed their calls for Andrew to testify - although the panel is controlled by Republicans, who have not indicated they would support the move.\n\nCongressman Suhas Subramanyam told the BBC: \"If he wants to clear his name, if he wants to do right by the victims, he will come forward\".\n\nAndrew could appear remotely, have a lawyer present and could speak to the panel privately, Subramanyam said.\n\n\"Frankly, Andrew's name has come up many times from the victims,\" he told Radio 4's Today programme on Saturday.\n\n\"So he clearly has knowledge of what happened and we just want him to come forward and tell us what he knows.\"\n\nHe added: \"No matter who it is - American or not - everyone should be looked at.\"\n\nFellow committee member   Raja Krishnamoorthi told BBC Newsnight he would be willing to formally summon Andrew   with a subpoena - although he conceded this would be difficult to enforce while he was outside of the US.\n\nHe said on Friday: \"However, if Andrew wishes to come to the United States or he's here, then he's subject to the jurisdiction of the US Congress, and I would expect him to testify.\"\n\nHe added: \"At the end of the day, we want to know exactly what happened, not just to give justice to the survivors, but to prevent this from ever happening again.\"\n\n\"Come clean. Come before the US Congress, voluntarily testify. Don't wait for a subpoena. Come and testify and tell us what you know.\"\n\nCongressman Stephen Lynch also told the BBC hearing from Andrew \"might be helpful in getting justice for these survivors\" but said the committee would be unable to subpoena him \"as the situation stands\".\n\nMeanwhile, Liz Stein - one of Epstein's accusers - said Andrew should \"take some initiative\" and help US investigators.\n\nShe told BBC Breakfast on Saturday: \"A lot of us are curious as to why he's unwilling to cooperate and be questioned about his involvement with Epstein.\"\n\n\"If he has nothing to hide, then why is he hiding?\"\n\n\"We know he had a longstanding friendship with Epstein and that he was in his social circle - so he may have seen things during his involvement with Epstein that he could speak to.\"\n\nAnother of Epstein's accusers, Anouska De Georgiou, likewise told Newsnight Andrew should appear before Congress, saying \"it would be appropriate for him to be treated the same as anybody else would be treated\".\n\nIt comes after UK trade minister Chris Bryant told the BBC Andrew should go to the US to answer questions about Epstein's crimes if invited, \"just as with any ordinary member of the public\".\n\nMeanwhile, the police watchdog said it had approached the Metropolitan Police to ask whether there are matters it should be looking into, in light of media reports about Andrew.\n\nThe Independent Office for Police Conduct said it had contacted Scotland Yard's Directorate of Professional Standards last week - which oversees internal investigations into misconduct - and had not yet received any referrals.\n\nReports  emerged  in mid-October that Andrew sought to obtain personal information about his accuser Virginia Giuffre through his police protection in 2011. He has not commented on the reports, while the Metropolitan Police previously said it was \"actively\" looking into them.\n\nSeparately, new court documents published in the US on Friday showed that Andrew  wrote in an email in 2010  that it would be \"good to catch up in person\" with Epstein, after he was released from prison for soliciting prostitution from a minor.\n\nThe pair were then pictured together in Central Park in New York in December 2010, in a meeting that Andrew later told the BBC was to break off their friendship.\n\nAndrew's ties to Epstein were at the centre of Thursday's decision, with the Palace  announcement  stating: \"These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him.\"\n\n\"Their Majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse.\"\n\nIn recent weeks, pressure had increased on the monarchy to resolve the issue of Charles's brother.\n\nIn early October, emails which re-emerged from 2011 showed Andrew in contact with Epstein months after he claimed their friendship had ended.\n\nA posthumous memoir by Virginia Giuffre was also released - repeating allegations that, as a teenager, she was forced to have sex with Andrew on three separate occasions, claims he has always denied.\n\nAnd earlier this week, the King was heckled about the matter.\n\nAlthough Andrew denies the accusations, the Royal Family considers there have been \"serious lapses of judgement\" in his behaviour.\n\nAs well as losing his titles and honours, he was ordered to move out of his Windsor mansion - Royal Lodge - and into a property on the King's Norfolk estate, paid for by the monarch.\n\nThe BBC understands that he will not have to move out immediately, and could move to Sandringham as late as the new year.\n\nOn Saturday, a black Land Rover with a number plate ending DOY was seen leaving Bishops Gate near Royal Lodge just before 08:00 GMT.\n\nOnly a driver was in the vehicle as it left the grounds of Windsor Great Park. Andrew has previously been pictured driving a vehicle with the same private number plate."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gpwn5v072o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"04:58:44.661+00:00","title":"Halloween 2025 party: Heidi Klum's party, Demi Lovato and Megan Thee Stallion","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article highlights the 2025 Halloween party hosted by Heidi Klum, where she made a major impact with her Medusa costume, collaborating with makeup artist Mike Marino and drawing global attention.

Even politicians are getting in on the action, including President Trump, who is hosting a party at his Florida home.\n\nLike Heidi, her husband Tom Kaulitz, is never one to shy away from playing dress up.\n\nHe was by her side arriving to the party as a man who was unfortunately turned to stone after looking directly at Medusa.\n\nThe Tokio Hotel musician committed to the bit by posing with his weapon and shield raised, suggesting Medusa's appearance caught him by surprise moments before his demise.\n\nIce-T and Coco Austin have never shied away from going all out for Halloween, and are regulars at Heidi's annual bash. This year was no different as the rapper looked menacing in a red hooded jumpsuit, hiding his face with a blood-splattered white mask. He had a selection of weapons on hand to make his costume truly terrifying.\n\nModel Coco also got the horror memo in a bright red wig and denim bodysuit, with Chucky's tagline: \"Wanna play?\" scrawled across the front, layered on top of a striped, long-sleeved turtleneck top.\n\nYouTuber James Charles carried his own head as he made his way into the party, reminiscent of Jared Leto's red carpet arrival at the 2019 Met Gala.\n\nThe beauty vlogger put his own spin on things as a \"headless horseman\" and even filmed a make-up tutorial on Instagram for his unique accessory.\n\nDarren Criss may have taken some inspiration from his host as he donned a Shrek costume, including bright green face paint, a prosthetic nose and huge stomach, which he patted in front of the cameras.\n\nNot quite as epic as when Heidi did the same in 2018, the Glee star switched his efforts up with tartan red trousers alongside wife Mia Swier - who chose not to be his Princess Fiona, but instead Puss in Boots, complete with a black cape and a hair thong.\n\nOlympian Ilona Maher was a real-life vintage Barbie at Klum's Halloween party, modelling a strapless sparkly custom black Undone by Kate gown. She accessorized simply with black opera gloves and a chunky gold necklace.\n\nUnveiling her outfit on Instagram, the rugby player proudly posed with her very own Barbie doll, as well as a handkerchief emblazoned with the phrase: \"Beast. Beauty. Brains. Barbie.\"\n\nNot every costume has gone down well, with some saying that US model Julia Fox's costume as a blood-soaked Jackie Kennedy was in poor taste.\n\nOthers have been more popular.\n\nSinger  Demi Lovato recreated her \"Poot Lovato\" meme  which went viral on Tumblr in 2015 - a reference to her alter-ego who has been locked in a basement.\n\nOther highlights on social media include Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's daughter North West and her friends dressing up  as Japanese kawaii-metal band BABYMETAL.\n\nMaria Carey also went for Japanese theme, with hot pink hair and a frilly pastel blue dress,  and posting \"Happy Halloween from Japan\" in a photo with her two twin children .\n\nRapper Megan Thee Stallion opted for portraying  Choso from the Manga series Jujutsu Kaisen.\n\nSinger Jade, formerly of girl group Little Mix,  dressed up as Greta from the Gremlins , while the  Cat in the Hat's famous aesthetic was recreated  by singer Janelle Monae.\n\nElsewhere, Paris Hilton recreated the  famous look from Britney Spears's music video  for Oops!... I Did It Again.\n\nActress Keke Palmer channelled her inner rapper by  dressing up as Snoop Dogg  (and lip-synching to his music).\n\nActress and BLACKPINK member Lisa  looked dazzling as The Golden Woman  from the animated series Love, Death + Robots.\n\nKourtney Kardashian Barker is famously a big Halloween fan, with this year's costume serving as  a nod to the Bride of Frankenstein.\n\nLizzo, who dressed up as a weight loss drug last year, called Halloween \"so cheesy\"  as she dressed this year as a mozzarella stick , complete with an oozing cheese dress and boots.\n\nContent creator and media personality Amelia Dimoldenberg never takes the easy option when it comes to dressing up for Halloween and this  devilish costume certainly looks like it required some effort.\n\nThe night earlier, on the eve of Halloween, she went to a party in New York as the divorce of singer Lily Allen and Stranger Things actor David Harbour. Dressed as Harbour's sheriff character, she listened to the latest Allen album, which references their breakup.\n\nAnd singer Ed Sheeran  dressed up as Pennywise the clown,  Stephen King's character from It.\n\nMeanwhile, US Vice-President JD Vance wore a wig as he became the bizarre meme-version of himself.

2025-10-31T08:00:12.577+00:00\n\nTitle: Russia's new nuclear weapons - do they work or is it Putin bluster?\n\nOn Wednesday, over tea and cakes with veterans of the Ukraine war, President Vladimir Putin announced Russia had tested a new weapon.\n\n\"There is nothing like this,\" the Russian leader said of the Poseidon - a nuclear-powered, nuclear-capable underwater drone that can be fired like a torpedo and which a senior Russian MP said could \"put entire states out of operation\".\n\nWhen it was first unveiled in 2018, Russian media said the Poseidon would be able to achieve a speed of 200km/h (120mph) and travel in a \"constantly changing route\" that would make it impossible to intercept.\n\nPutin's claim came only days after the announcement that Moscow had conducted a test of its \"unlimited-range\" Burevestnik nuclear-powered cruise missile.\n\nIt's \"a unique product, unmatched in the world\", Putin said of the Burevestnik, noting the missile was so new \"we are yet to identify what it is, what class of weapons [it] belongs to\".\n\nIt is not unusual for Russia to test and flaunt weapons.\n\nAnd, despite the boisterous nature of Russian announcements, their military value is ambiguous.\n\n\"They are basically Armageddon weapons - too powerful to be used unless you're happy to destroy the world,\" Mark Galeotti, a Russia scholar and long-time observer of Russian politics, told the BBC.\n\nBoth the Poseidon and the Burevestnik are second-strike, retaliatory weapons, Mr Galeotti added - and not even the most rabid Kremlin propagandists are suggesting anyone is preparing to launch strikes on Russia.\n\nIt is also unclear whether the weapons are actually viable.\n\nIn 2019,  five Russian nuclear engineers died in a rocket engine explosion  which some Russian and Western experts said was linked to the Burevestnik.\n\nTwo years later, the International Institute of Strategic Studies (IISS) - a London-based think tank specialising in global conflict and security - noted that Russia faced \"considerable technical challenges\" in ensuring \"the reliable performance of the nuclear-propulsion unit\" of the missile.\n\nNeither the Poseidon nor the Burevestnik were entirely novel - both  had first been presented to the world in 2018  as part of a new array of weapons that Putin called \"invincible\".\n\nSo it is the timing of the announcements - rather than their contents - which could be noteworthy.\n\nAfter a whirlwind few months of tentative diplomacy by US President Donald Trump to try and bring Russia and Ukraine to the negotiating table, Trump appears to have cooled off on the endeavour to end the war.\n\nLast week, the White House cancelled a summit between Trump and Putin, apparently after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio realised the gulf between Moscow and Washington's positions was too great for a high-level meeting to achieve meaningful results.\n\nNot only is there no suggestion of any further talks, but soon after the meeting was cancelled, Trump imposed sanctions on two of Russia's biggest oil producers as punishment for Moscow's failure to agree on a peace deal in Ukraine.\n\nAnd while his relationship with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky seems to still be fraught, it appears Trump is growing irritated with Moscow's intractability.\n\nSo Putin may be vying for Trump's attention.\n\n\"In the face of Trump blowing hot and cold with his support for Ukraine or sympathy to Russia, here is an element in which Moscow has bigger cards than Kyiv,\" Mr Galeotti argued.\n\n\"So in that context [successful weapons tests] are more about keeping him thinking Russia is indeed powerful.\"\n\nAnother clue could come from the battlefield in Ukraine.\n\nThree-and-a-half years after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of its neighbour, its troops continue to merely grind on - at great cost in human life and resources - with no obvious breakthrough likely any time soon.\n\n\"We are getting towards the end of summer fighting season in Ukraine and it has not gone very well for the Russians,\" said David Heathcote, head of intelligence at McKenzie Intelligence Services.\n\nThe announcements about the Burevestnik and the Poseidon should be seen as a reflection of the weakness of their conventional forces, Mr Heathcote told the BBC.\n\nRussia is not formally part of any military alliances that would serve as a deterrent if it is on the back foot, and its army is tied up and under pressure in Ukraine.\n\nIn these cases, Mr Heathcote says, \"the Russians always react with unnecessary and overexaggerated sabre rattling\".\n\nWhile Moscow's decision to publicly announce the Burevestnik and Poseidon tests may have been influenced by this, it seems the claim has already had the tangible effect of provoking Trump into instructing its military to resume nuclear weapons testing.\n\nTrump justified the move as a way of keeping pace with other countries such as Russia and China.\n\n\"With others doing testing, I think it's appropriate that we do also,\" Trump said - although it will likely take several months for the US to restart nuclear tests after a 33-year pause.\n\nThe Kremlin's reaction to Trump's statement was quick\n\nPutin spokesman Dmitry Peskov questioned whether the US president had been correctly informed. The Russian tests \"cannot in any way be interpreted as a nuclear test\", Peskov said.\n\nTrump did not elaborate on the kind of tests he wanted the US to resume.\n\nIt was likely, said IISS Head of Strategy, Technology and Arms Control Dr Alexander Bollfrass, that Trump's decision was a direct response to the Russian test of the Burevestnik and that the US could be planning to conduct similar flight tests of US Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg4q403rpzo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"01:19:28.608+00:00","title":"Egypt's Grand Museum opens, displaying Tutankhamun tomb in full for first time","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Egypt has opened the Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM), the world’s largest archaeological museum, which will display the complete contents of Tutankhamun’s tomb for the first time since its 1922 discovery.

2025-11-01T01:19:28.608+00:00\n\nTitle: Egypt's Grand Museum opens, displaying Tutankhamun tomb in full for first time\n\nNear one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World - the Great Pyramid of Khufu at Giza - Egypt is officially opening what it intends as a cultural highlight of the modern age.\n\nThe Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM), described as the world's largest archaeological museum, is packed with some 100,000 artefacts covering some seven millennia of the country's history from pre-dynastic times to the Greek and Roman eras.\n\nProminent Egyptologists argue that its establishment strengthens their demand for key Egyptian antiquities held in other countries to be returned – including the famed Rosetta Stone displayed at the British Museum.\n\nA main draw of the GEM will be the entire contents of the intact tomb of the boy king Tutankhamun, displayed together for the first time since it was found by British Egyptologist Howard Carter. They include Tutankhamun's spectacular gold mask, throne and chariots.\n\n\"I had to think, how can we show him in a different way, because since the discovery of the tomb in 1922, about 1,800 pieces from a total of over 5,500 that were inside the tomb were on display,\" says Dr Tarek Tawfik, president of the International Association of Egyptologists and former head of the GEM.\n\n\"I had the idea of displaying the complete tomb, which means nothing remains in storage, nothing remains in other museums, and you get to have the complete experience, the way Howard Carter had it over a hundred years ago.\"\n\nCosting some $1.2bn (£910m; €1.1bn), the vast museum complex is expected to attract up to 8m visitors a year, giving a huge boost to Egyptian tourism which has been hit by regional crises.\n\n\"We hope the Grand Egyptian Museum will usher in a new golden age of Egyptology and cultural tourism,\" says Ahmed Seddik, a guide and aspiring Egyptologist by the pyramids on the Giza Plateau.\n\nApart from the Tutankhamun exhibit and a new display of the spectacular, 4,500-year-old funerary boat of Khufu - one of the oldest and best-preserved vessels from antiquity - most of the galleries at the site have been opened to the public since last year.\n\n\"I've been organising so many tours to the museum even though it was partially open,\" Ahmed continues. \"Now it will be at the pinnacle of its glory. When the Tutankhamun collection opens, then you can imagine the whole world will come back, because this is an iconic Pharoah, the most famous king of all antiquity.\"\n\n\"It's an absolute must-see,\" says Spanish tourist, Raúl, who is awaiting the full public opening on 4 November.\n\n\"We're just waiting to go and check out all of the Egyptian artefacts,\" says Sam from London, who is on an Egypt tour. \"It's a once in a lifetime opportunity.\"\n\nAnother British tourist says she previously saw the Tutankhamun exhibits on display at the neoclassical Egyptian Museum in bustling Tahrir Square.\n\n\"The old museum was pretty chaotic, and it was a bit confusing,\" she comments. \"Hopefully the Grand Museum will be a lot easier to take in and I think you will just get more out of it.\"\n\nThe new museum is colossal, spanning 500,000 square metres (5.4m sq ft) – about the size of 70 football pitches. The exterior is covered in hieroglyphs and translucent alabaster cut into triangles with a pyramid shaped entrance.\n\nAmong the GEM showstoppers are a 3,200-year-old, 16m-long suspended obelisk of the powerful pharaoh, Ramesses II, and his massive 11m-high statue. The imposing statue was moved from close to the Cairo railway station in 2006, in a complex operation in preparation for the new institution.\n\nA giant staircase is lined with the statues of other ancient kings and queens and on an upper floor a huge window offers a perfectly framed view of the Giza pyramids.\n\nThe museum was first proposed in 1992, during the rule of President Hosni Mubarak, and construction began in 2005.  It has now taken nearly as long to complete as the Great Pyramid, according to estimates.\n\nThe project was hit by financial crises, the 2011 Arab Spring – which deposed Mubarak and led to years of turmoil - the Covid-19 pandemic, and regional wars.\n\n\"It was my dream. I'm really happy to see this museum is finally opened!\" Dr Zahi Hawass, Egypt's former long-time minister of tourism and antiquities, tells the BBC. The veteran archaeologist says it shows that Egyptians are equals of foreign Egyptologists when it comes to excavations, preservation of monuments and curating museums.\n\n\"Now I want two things: number one, museums to stop buying stolen artefacts and number two, I need three objects to come back: the Rosetta Stone from the British Museum, the Zodiac from the Louvre and the Bust of Nefertiti from Berlin.\"\n\nDr Hawass has set up online petitions – attracting hundreds of thousands of signatures – calling for all three items to be repatriated.\n\nThe Rosetta Stone, found in 1799, provided the key to deciphering hieroglyphics. It was discovered by the French army and was seized by the British as war booty.  A French team cut the Dendera Zodiac, an ancient Egyptian celestial map, from the Temple of Hathor in Upper Egypt in 1821. Egypt accuses German archaeologists of smuggling the colourfully painted bust of Nefertiti, wife of Egyptian pharaoh Akhenaten, out of the country more than a century ago.\n\n\"We need the three objects to come as a good feeling from these three countries, as a gift, as Egypt gave the world many gifts,\" Dr Hawass says.\n\nAnother leading Egyptologist, Dr Monica Hanna, names the same objects, \"taken under a colonialist pretext\", as ones which must be repatriated. She adds: \"The GEM gives this message that Egypt has done its homework very well to officially ask for the objects.\"\n\nThe British Museum told the BBC that it had received \"no formal requests for either the return or the loan of the Rosetta Stone from the Egyptian Government\".\n\nEgyptian Egyptologists voice their excitement about the new museum becoming a centre for academic research, driving new discoveries.\n\nAlready, Egyptian conservators based there have painstakingly restored items belonging to Tutankhamun, including his impressive armour made of textiles and leather. According to Egyptian law, such restorations can only be done by Egyptians.\n\n\"Colleagues from around the world have been in awe of the fantastic conservation work that has been done,\" says Dr Tawfik, adding that the entire project is a source of great national pride. \"As well as ancient Egyptian history, we are also showcasing modern Egypt because it's Egypt that built this museum.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crklljyx6mzo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"12:25:48.845+00:00","title":"Defence of Donetsk town a priority, says Zelensky, as special forces deployed","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has declared the defence of Pokrovsk in the Donbas region a national priority, deploying elite special forces from military intelligence and assault units to protect critical supply lines.

The American adoptees who fear deportation to a country they can't remember\n\nShirley Chung was just a year old when she was adopted by a US family in 1966.\n\nBorn in South Korea, her birthfather was a member of the American military, who returned home soon after Shirley was born. Unable to cope, her birth mother placed her in an orphanage in the South Korean capital, Seoul.\n\n\"He abandoned us, is the nicest way I can put it,\" says Shirley, now 61.\n\nAfter around a year, Shirley was adopted by a US couple, who took her back to Texas.\n\nShirley grew up living a life similar to that of many young Americans. She went to school, got her driving licence and worked as a bartender.\n\n\"I moved and breathed and got in trouble like many teenage Americans of the 80s. I'm a child of the 80s,\" Shirley says.\n\nShirley had children, got married and became a piano teacher. Life carried on for decades with no reason to doubt her American identity.\n\nBut then in 2012, her world came crashing down.\n\nShe lost her Social Security card and needed a replacement. But when she went to her local Social Security office, Shirley was told she needed to prove her status in the country. Eventually she found out she did not have US citizenship.\n\n\"I had a little mental breakdown after finding out I wasn't a citizen,\" she says.\n\nShirley is not alone. Estimates of how many American adoptees lack citizenship  range from 18,000 to 75,000 . Some intercountry adoptees may not even know they lack US citizenship.\n\nDozens of adoptees have been deported to their countries of birth in recent years, according to the Adoptee Rights Law Center. A man born in South Korea and adopted as a child by an American family - only to be deported to his country of birth because of a criminal record - took his own life in 2017.\n\nThe reasons why so many US adoptees do not have citizenship are varied. Shirley blames her parents for failing to finalise the correct paperwork when she came to the US. She also blames the school system and the government for not highlighting that she did not have citizenship.\n\n\"I blame all the adults in my life that literally just dropped the ball and said: 'She's here in America now, she's going to be fine.'\"\n\n\"Well, am I? Am I going to be fine?\"\n\nAnother woman, who requested anonymity for fear of attracting the attention of authorities, was adopted by an American couple from Iran in 1973 when she was two years old.\n\nGrowing up in the US Midwest, she encountered some racism but generally had a happy upbringing.\n\n\"I settled into my life, always understanding that I was an American citizen. That's what I was told. I still believe that today,\" she says.\n\nBut that changed when she tried to get a passport at the age of 38 and discovered immigration authorities had lost critical documents that supported her claim to citizenship.\n\nThis has further complicated her feelings surrounding identity.\n\n\"I personally don't categorise myself as an immigrant. I didn't come here as an immigrant with a second language, a different culture, family members, ties to a country that I was born in… my culture was erased,\" she says.\n\n\"You are told that you have these rights as an American - to vote and to participate in democracy, to work, to go to school, to raise your family, to have freedoms - all these things that Americans have.\n\n\"And then all of a sudden they started pushing us into a category of immigrants, simply because they cut us from legislation. We should have all equally had citizenship rights because that was promised through adoption policies.\"\n\nFor decades, intercountry adoptions approved by courts and government agencies did not automatically guarantee US citizenship. Adoptive parents sometimes failed to secure legal status or naturalised citizenship for their children.\n\nThe Child Citizenship Act of 2000 made some headway in rectifying this, granting automatic citizenship to international adoptees. But the law only covered future adoptees or those born after February 1983. Those who arrived before then were not granted citizenship, leaving tens of thousands in limbo.\n\nAdvocates have been pushing for Congress to remove the age cut-off but these bills have failed to make it past the House.\n\nSome, like Debbie, whose two adopted children have special needs and requested that her full name not be used, have spent decades trying to secure citizenship for their dependents.\n\nShe adopted two children from an orphanage in Romania in the 1990s after watching them on Shame of a Nation - a documentary about the neglect of children in orphanages following the 1989 Romanian Revolution, that sent shockwaves around the world when it aired.\n\nThe most recent rejection of citizenship came in May, and was followed by a notice stating that if the decision was not appealed in 30 days, she would have to turn in her daughter to Homeland Security, she said.\n\n\"We'll just be lucky if they don't get picked up and deported to another country that isn't even their country of origin,\" she said.\n\nThose fears for adoptees and their families have risen even further since President Donald Trump returned to the White House, with a vow to remove \"promptly all aliens who enter or remain in violation of federal law\".\n\nLast month, the Trump administration said \"two million illegal aliens have left the United States in less than 250 days, including an estimated 1.6 million who have voluntarily self-deported and more than 400,000 deportations\".\n\nWhile many Americans support deportations of illegal migrants, there has been uproar over some incidents.\n\nIn one case, 238 Venezuelans were deported by the US to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador. They were accused of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang  despite most of them having no criminal records.\n\nLast month, US officials detained 475 people - more than 300 of them South Korean nationals - who they said were working illegally at Hyundai's battery facility, one of the largest foreign investment projects in Georgia.  The workers were taken away in handcuffs and chains to be detained , sparking outrage in their home country.\n\nAdoptee rights groups say they have been flooded with requests for help since Trump's return and some adoptees have gone into hiding.\n\n\"When the election results came in, it started to really cascade with requests for help,\" said Greg Luce, an attorney and founder of the Adoptee Rights Law Center, adding he's had more than 275 requests for help.\n\nThe adoptee who arrived from Iran in the 1970s said she has started avoiding certain areas, like her local Iranian supermarket, and shares an app with her friends so they always have access to her location, in case she is \"swept up\".\n\n\"At the end of the day, they don't care about your back story. They don't care that you're legally here and it's just a paperwork error. I always tell people this one single piece of paper has essentially just ruined my life,\" she said.\n\n\"As far as I'm concerned right now, I feel stateless.\"\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nDespite adoptees being left in limbo for decades, Emily Howe, a civil and human rights attorney who has worked with adoptees across the US, believes it is just a case of political will that should unite people from across the political spectrum.\n\n\"It should be a straightforward fix: adopted children should be equal to their biological siblings of parents who were US citizens at the time of birth,\" Ms Howe said.\n\n\"The applicants have two, three, or four US citizen parents, and are now in their 40s, 50s, and 60s.

over Nexperia - a Chinese-owned chipmaker based in the Netherlands.\n\nIn September, the Netherlands used  a Cold War-era law  to take over the company and prevent the chips from becoming unavailable in an emergency, citing \"serious governance shortcomings\".\n\nChina said in response that it would not re-export completed Nexperia chips to Europe, raising concern among carmakers. One association had described the move as \"alarming\".\n\nAround 70% of chips made in the Netherlands are sent to China to be completed and re-exported to other countries.\n\nChina said in a statement on Saturday that it would \"comprehensively consider the actual situation of enterprises and grant exemptions to exports that meet the criteria\". However, it has not specified what that could entail.\n\nIt also went on to criticise the Hague for what it called \"improper interference in the internal affairs of enterprises\" and blamed it for \"the current disruption of global production and supply chains\".\n\nThe Dutch-controlled firm told customers it would stop sending chips back to China to be processed, according to a letter this week seen by the Reuters news agency.\n\nLast month, the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA) had warned Nexperia chip supplies would only last a few weeks unless the Chinese ban was lifted.\n\n\"Without these chips, European automotive suppliers cannot build the parts and components needed to supply vehicle manufacturers and this therefore threatens production stoppages,\" the group said.\n\nThe latest plans by Beijing to relax its export controls have emerged after US President Donald Trump and Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping met in South Korea earlier this week.\n\nTrump later said the leaders  discussed chips , while Beijing's post-meeting readout did not explicitly mention any area of trade.\n\nThe White House is expected to release a fact sheet later on Saturday detailing its new trade agreement with China. Reuters reports that it will also announce the resumption of Nexperia exports.\n\nIn December 2024, the US government placed Chinese chip manufacturer Wingtech on its so-called \"entity list\", identifying the company as a national security concern.\n\nIn the UK, Nexperia was forced to sell its silicon chip plant in Newport after MPs and ministers expressed national security concerns.

A collapse in its $446 billion real estate economy would bring California to its knees. Gov. Gavin Newsom’s administration went into crisis negotiations with the insurance industry, and emerged in September 2023, with what was billed as an “historic” compromise, one that would reward insurers with higher rates in exchange for protecting homeowners in neighborhoods that climate change was turning into tinder boxes.\n\nThe central promise was that insurers would have to write policies in fire-prone areas at a rate equal to at least 85 percent of their market share across the state. But a New York Times investigation has found that a series of loopholes quietly negotiated by the insurance industry all but eliminated that guarantee.\n\nVast swaths of the designated areas where insurers must write new policies do not in fact overlap with areas that California’s state fire marshal deems to be the most fire-prone, the investigation found, meaning that insurers can load up on coverage in areas the state considers to be safer and still qualify to charge higher rates.\n\nAs a result, insurance companies will be able to raise rates and offload billions of dollars in costs and liabilities to ratepayers while taking on few, if any, new customers in high fire-risk areas.\n\nUnder new rules, insurers get credit\n\nfor writing new policies anywhere\n\nwithin “distressed” counties and ZIP\n\ncodes, even where many homes are\n\ndeemed less fire-prone by the state.\n\nSan Francisco\n\nLos Angeles\n\nUnder new rules, insurers get credit\n\nfor writing new policies anywhere\n\nwithin “distressed” counties and ZIP\n\ncodes, even where many homes are\n\ndeemed less fire-prone by the state.\n\nSan Francisco\n\nLos Angeles\n\nUnder new rules, insurers\n\nget credit for writing new\n\npolicies anywhere within\n\n“distressed” counties and\n\nZIP codes, even where\n\nmany homes are deemed\n\nless fire-prone by the state.\n\nSan Francisco\n\nLos Angeles\n\nSan Francisco\n\nSources: “Distressed” areas from the California Department of Insurance; Footprints of residential buildings from FEMA.\n\nThe New York Times\n\nAnd while the regulations were billed as an attempt to get homeowners off the state’s toverburdened last-resort insurance program, FAIR, the number of residential FAIR policies has nearly doubled since the new insurance deal was announced, rising to 625,033 from 320,581, the Times review found.\n\nSome insurers began minimizing their potential losses even before the new regulations were finalized. In the six months after the deal was announced, California’s three largest insurance groups informed the state of their plans to dump nearly 50,000 existing policies, five times the number filed by those companies in the 20 months preceding the deal. And the new regulations will effectively reward them for doing it.\n\nMore than a fifth of the nonrenewals — about 11,000 policies in total — were in ZIP codes within or adjacent to areas that would burn in the January fires, the Times analysis found. The vast majority of those were in and around Pacific Palisades, where fire later destroyed more than 6,800 structures.\n\nMaggie Neilson, a 53-year-old philanthropy consultant, had a policy from Foremost on her 2,500-square-foot house in Pacific Palisades until the company elected not to renew it in March 2024.\n\nThe only insurer Ms. Neilson could find to replace the policy was the FAIR plan, which charged her about 40 percent more than Foremost had for about 40 percent less coverage. “At the time, the media was saying everyone knows this is a problem and the governor and others are working on it, so I didn’t think too much about it,” she said.\n\nThen in January, her home and all of its contents were destroyed by the Palisades fire. She said her FAIR policy will pay her $1.5 million for a rebuild that she has been told will cost around $3 million.\n\nProponents of the new rules said they would allow rates to reflect the risks of hotter, drier weather and provide a business case for insurers to offer policies in high-risk areas. Representatives for Farmers Insurance, one of the few companies that agreed to discuss the regulations, praised them as a “return to a more effective rating regime” that “will bring positive change to the California insurance marketplace.”\n\nRicardo Lara, California’s elected state insurance commissioner who led the drafting of the new rules, said the state was “in crisis mode” when it negotiated the new regulations, with seven of the 12 top insurers in the state halting or restricting the writing of new policies in California.\n\n“You constantly have to strike the balance between, you know, the consumer protections, giving consumers options, and having a robust and thriving insurance market,” Mr. Lara said.\n\nHe said the new rules would offer tens of thousands of Californians the chance to purchase protection for their homes that might otherwise have been unavailable at any price.\n\nConfronted with The Times’ findings about ways insurers could shortchange their promises to insure in high-risk areas, Mr. Lara conceded that the rules might not deliver the hoped-for outcomes immediately. Insurers, he said, had “bullied” the state as it drafted the new rules. But he predicted that, as rates rose, competition would eventually push insurers back into writing policies in high-risk zones.\n\n“This is uncharted territory,” he said. “Will this be perfect? Absolutely not.”\n\nFrom the insurance industry’s perspective, the roots of the current crisis can be traced back to 1988. Voters passed an initiative that year that made California one of about a dozen states where homeowners’ insurance rate increases must be preapproved by an elected insurance commissioner. The industry has long complained that the system keeps rates in California artificially low.\n\nBy the early spring of 2023, when Governor Newsom began meeting with industry lobbyists, some of California’s largest property insurers had already stopped or curtailed writing new business in the state. State Farm and Farmers, which together comprise one third of the market, started pulling back in May and July of that year.\n\nExisting policies were not affected, but the changes meant that home buyers were left with few options for insuring their new properties other than the FAIR plan, a consortium of all the companies licensed to offer property insurance in the state. FAIR is required by law to sell bare-bones fire policies to people who can’t find coverage in the regular market.Insurers share any profits from FAIR in good times, but must cover all of its losses.\n\n“I think that was the moment when we really started to get nervous,” recalled Ann Patterson, a senior counselor to the governor who was involved in the discussions. “We only have so many more big carriers that can pick up that demand, and if they can’t pick it up, then everybody’s going to end up on the FAIR plan.”\n\nIt was generally agreed that FAIR was not a solution. Its lean policies rarely covered the actual cost to rebuild a home, even though they generally cost more than regular policies. Nearly 7 percent of realtors surveyed in 2023 by the California Association of Realtors said that they had deals fall out of escrow that year because buyers couldn’t find adequate, affordable coverage.\n\nIt was not a problem just for wealthy homeowners in Brentwood and Malibu. Nearly a third of California’s 40 million residents live in or near highly flammable, brushy or densely forested wildlands.\n\nInsurers made it clear that big, regulatory changes were needed to keep them in the market, addressing rising construction costs as well as climate change.\n\nCalifornia requires companies to provide detailed financial information justifying rate-increase requests; if they seek 7 percent or more, the requests can be challenged in public hearings and take up to a year to resolve.\n\nHistorically, wildfire losses figured in those calculations, but insurers had to show data on their actual payouts. They wanted California regulators to instead join other states in allowing rates based on climate-change models that estimate future losses.\n\nSeren Taylor, vice president of the Personal Insurance Federation of California, the lead lobbying group for insurers in California, said rate increases will help avert a serious threat to the state’s economy. “You don’t have to care about insurers per se, but you have to care about having a healthy insurance market,” he said. “We had to give insurers the tools they need to have a functional market.”\n\nThe deal with insurers, as described by Mr. Lara when he announced it, contained an unambiguous promise: If carriers wanted to charge higher rates, they would have to write policies in “fire zones” at a rate “no less” than 85 percent of their statewide market share.\n\nIf a carrier’s statewide market share is 20 percent, for example, its share in designated distressed areas would have to be at least 17 percent.\n\nTo reach the 85 percent standard, insurers can offer policies to homeowners currently on the FAIR plan, though nothing requires them to do that. Or they can write policies anywhere in a list of 662 distressed ZIP codes.\n\nSome of those ZIP codes neatly overlap the state’s high-fire-risk zone maps, like the one covering Topanga, a town known for its hippie scene. Topanga sits in a steep, rugged canyon in the Santa Monica Mountains that can become a wind tunnel, where embers can be blown for miles.\n\nBut the Times analysis found that many “distressed” ZIP codes extend well beyond the riskiest fire zones. The 90063 area, for instance, is in the dense heart of urban East Los Angeles, with only a small sliver overlapping areas deemed at high risk of a blaze — and that sliver has no homes in it at all.\n\nLOS ANGELES\n\n“Distressed”\n\n(TK LA COUNTY\n\nNo residential homes within\n\nthis “distressed” ZIP code\n\noverlap with the state’s\n\nhigh fire hazard zones.\n\nCITY TERRACE\n\nLos Angeles\n\nArea of detail\n\nNo residential homes  within this “distressed”  ZIP code overlap with the state’s high fire hazard zones.\n\nCITY TERRACE\n\nLos Angeles\n\nArea of detail\n\nSources: California Department of Insurance, CalFIRE, FEMA.\n\nNote: Includes “high” or “very high” fire hazard zones. Residential buildings, shown in dark gray, include single-family, multi-family and manufactured homes. Non-residential buildings are shown outlined in light gray.\n\nThe New York Times\n\nAnd half of California’s 58 counties qualify under the regulations as “distressed” in their entirety, even though only a minority of the single-family homes located within them are in high or very high fire risk zones. In Ventura County, which sprawls from urban strip malls and moist strawberry fields to forested peaks, more than 100,000 homes, or roughly 60 percent of the county’s single-family structures, are clustered in areas with lower wildfire risk. Yet insuring any of them would help a company meet the 85 percent target.\n\nPlacer County, just north of Sacramento, stretches east from  suburbs dominated by new subdivisions with few mature trees into the pine-covered slopes of the Sierra Nevada mountains, where rugged terrain and dense vegetation create a higher fire danger.\n\nPolicies written anywhere in the county count toward the requirement.\n\nBut a savvy insurer could meet it by zeroing in on Roseville, a city of about 160,000 residents whose boundaries barely graze the high-risk zones — in fact, one of its three main ZIP codes falls entirely outside the zones.\n\nIn Placer County, a “distressed” county, over\n\n75% of homes are outside of “high” or “very high”\n\nstate fire hazard zones.\n\nConsidered “distressed” by officials, over 75%\n\nof homes in Placer County are outside of\n\n“high” or “very high” wildfire risk zones.\n\nPLACER COUNTY\n\nIn Placer County, deemed “distressed”\n\nby insurance regulators, over 70% of\n\nhomes are outside of the state’s\n\nhigh fire hazard zones.\n\nPLACER COUNTY\n\nIn Placer County, deemed “distressed”\n\nby insurance regulators, over 70% of\n\nhomes are outside of the state’s\n\nhigh fire hazard zones.\n\nPLACER COUNTY\n\nIn Placer County, deemed “distressed”\n\nby insurance regulators, over 70% of\n\nhomes are outside of the state’s\n\nhigh fire hazard zones.\n\nPLACER COUNTY\n\nIn Placer County, deemed “distressed” by insurance\n\nregulators, over 70% of homes are outside of the\n\nstate’s high fire hazard zones.\n\nSources: California Department of Insurance, CalFIRE, FEMA.\n\nNote: Analysis of homes inside of “high” or “highest” fire hazard severity zones based on FEMA single-family or multi-family residential buildings.\n\nThe New York Times\n\nIn more than 100 of the state’s distressed ZIP codes, fewer than a third of single-family homes are in high-fire-risk zones, the Times analysis found. In more than 70 of the ZIP  codes, less than 10 percent of homes are in those zones.\n\nMr. Lara’s deputy commissioner, Mike Peterson, acknowledged in an interview that insurers will probably gravitate toward those lower-risk homes. But he predicted that those opportunities “will be sucked up very quickly, which will force everybody into the more-fire-risk areas.”\n\nInsurers who cannot or choose not to meet the 85-percent requirement can still qualify for the new rate increases. A pair of what industry lobbyists called “offramps” were negotiated as alternatives to the 85 percent rule. Insurers can claim hardship and petition the commissioner for a waiver; or they can take advantage of an option, originally intended just for small companies, that requires only that they increase the number of policies they have in the designated distressed zones by 5 percent over the previous year.\n\n“We decided to include the 5 percent option in order to give all companies a way to incrementally get to the 85 percent target in a way that is sustainable and doesn’t put their solvency at risk,” said Michael Soller, Mr. Lara’s spokesman.\n\nBut the way the provision was written meant that insurers that had spent much of 2024 dumping customers by the tens of thousands would, at least initially, be able to meet an even lower bar.\n\nEight days after the deal was announced in September 2023, Foremost Insurance reported that it had already begun to drop policies in fire-prone areas across the state.\n\nOver the following five months, as Mr. Lara’s office was writing the regulations, three insurers followed suit: Farmers Insurance, CSAA and State Farm.\n\nThese companies told Mr. Lara that they would be dropping more than 50,000 policies in more than 800 ZIP codes, heavily concentrated in the most fire-prone areas of the state.\n\nThis was a different thing entirely than declining to write policies for new customers. It meant that even people whose homes met underwriting standards and who had paid their premiums on time weren’t safe.\n\nBesides Pacific Palisades and other Los Angeles County communities like Calabasas and Brentwood, some of the hardest-hit neighborhoods were in Contra Costa, Santa Cruz and Santa Clara counties, the Times review found. In one ZIP code in Los Gatos, a forested town pressed up against the foothills of the Santa Cruz mountains, State Farm indicated that it would dump two out of three of its customers, and Farmers said it would dump half.\n\nYvette Curran got her nonrenewal notice from Farmers n January 2024. Effective in April, the company would no longer insure her home in the hills north of Santa Cruz. She had been a loyal customer for 12 years.\n\n“What do you do?” she said. “There’s no nobody else to insure you.”\n\nSimilar stories were unfolding across the state. In Lake County in Northern California, where more than 2,000 homes and 65 percent of the land area has burned in a series of devastating fires over the last decade, Foremost dropped the vast majority of its customers; Farmers also issued  nonrenewal notices there, but was more selective.\n\n“I can’t go to the grocery store or walk into a coffee shop or go to a Rotary meeting where there isn’t a couple or three folks who have a horrific story about being nonrenewed,” said Mike McGuire, the California State Senate leader, who represents Lake County.\n\nRex Frazier, president of the Personal Insurance Federation of California, said the nonrenewals occurred at a time when insurers were not yet certain of what the final rules would be, and “needed to respond to their mounting financial problems.”\n\nBut Governor Newsom was frustrated, aides said. Insurers had issued nonrenewals in large numbers before, but this wave came after the industry and the state had struck their deal.\n\nMr. Lara said in an interview that he was angry, too. “I was livid, and yes, I did feel like we were being bullied,” he said. But whatever he felt privately, he said little in public, telling The Times that he felt it would be counterproductive to berate the very companies he was trying to woo back.\n\nYet the state effectively rewarded their behavior by grandfathering in the nonrenewals when it finalized the regulations. Companies like State Farm and Foremost that had dumped more than 5 percent of their customers in fire zones could now add back that 5 percent — perhaps in a lower-risk part of a ZIP code — and still qualify to charge the new higher rates.\n\nBy the time the department put the finishing touches on the regulatory package in December 2024, the state had offered two additional carrots to the industry. One was a cap on the amount of wildfire-related losses that insurance companies comprising the FAIR plan previously had to shoulder. Now, anything above $500 million would have to be borne by residential policyholders across the state. The other was to let insurers factor into their rate calculations the cost of reinsurance, which they buy to hedge the risk of an expensive catastrophe.\n\nConsumer Watchdog, an advocacy group that by law represents California policy holders in rate hearings, estimated that the reinsurance provision alone could raise premiums by an additional 40 percent.\n\nEight days after state officials put the final piece of the new regulations into place, wildfires swept through Los Angeles.\n\nIn their aftermath, Mr. Lara imposed a 1-year moratorium on nonrenewals, but only in the fire-affected areas. It will expire in January 2026.\n\nInsurers already have applied to charge their residential customers $425 million in losses incurred by the FAIR plan in the January fires, based on the new pass-through approved by Mr. Lara.  Consumer Watchdog has filed a lawsuit challenging those assessments.\n\nThe incentive to shed customers in risky areas remains in place for insurers that have yet to file for rate increases under the new system.\n\nSo far, five companies — serving 20 percent of the California market —- have filed for increases. Mr. Lara said that is a promising sign that the new incentives are luring insurers back.\n\nBut the total number of policies they say they will add in distressed areas — 2,500 — is not really a net gain, because it does not take into account the number of policies that some of those same companies dropped since the deal was announced.\n\nThose companies now stand to collect nearly $250 million in additional premiums. Each filed for rate increases just under the 7 percent threshold that would trigger the requirement for public hearings, and could seek additional increases later.\n\nPeople living in hazardous fire zones will probably see rate hikes much larger, since the rate filing is an average, Mr. Lara’s spokesman said.\n\nMeanwhile, the number of homeowners resorting to the FAIR plan has not gone down, as hoped, but doubled. Operators of the plan last month asked for a rate increase of nearly 36 percent. Nor have home buyers found it any easier to obtain insurance. The percentage of realtors reporting that they had deals fall through for lack of insurance has more than doubled since 2023, to 16.6 percent.\n\nThe trends so far suggest that the regulatory package will do little to help homeowners get the coverage they need, said Jamie Court, Consumer Watchdog’s president.\n\n“This isn’t the balanced deal the insurance commissioner sold to Californians,” he said. “It’s a giant giveaway to insurers.”\n\nMr. Lara said state officials will not know if the overhaul worked for another year, at least.\n\nIn the meantime, he said, he was grateful for the Times analysis, and had asked his staff to be on the lookout for the issues it raised. He said the state would make adjustments if needed.\n\n“There’s no guarantees,” he said. “But our current system doesn’t have guarantees, either.”\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this investigation, The New York Times obtained and analyzed a range of data sources.\n\nCalifornia’s Department of Insurance publishes a list of ZIP codes and counties that meet the new insurance regulations’ definition of “distressed.” The Times cross-referenced those designations with the state’s fire hazard maps (focusing, as the regulations do, on “high” and “very high” risk zones), as well as a Federal Emergency Management Agency data set of building outlines. This allowed reporters to compare the number of homes inside those hazard zones versus outside of them. The Times used ZIP code boundaries published by the state’s Department of Technology, ultimately based on boundaries sourced from TomTom, and excluded ZIP codes containing fewer than 100 single-family home structures from those analyses.\n\nTo obtain data on thousands of policies that were canceled by insurers, known as “block nonrenewals” in industry parlance, The Times examined regulatory filings submitted by insurers. (That information is not otherwise readily available because the Department of Insurance does not publish statistics on block nonrenewals.) The Times focused on filings by companies in California’s three largest homeowners insurance groups, measured by total “direct premiums written” in 2023: State Farm Group, Farmers Insurance Group (which also owns Foremost Insurance), and CSAA. These filings indicate the number nonrenewals being undertaken or planned in each California ZIP code. Because insurers do not indicate the specific date any given nonrenewal was planned, The Times analyses focused on the dates insurers submitted the relevant filing exhibits.\n\nNicholas Bogel-Burroughs contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8vrzpgxnro","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"09:13:32.456+00:00","title":"Andrew: Why Sarah Ferguson, Beatrice and Eugenie can't escape the taint of family scandal","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores how the family scandal involving former Duke of York Andrew and his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson, particularly their ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, has deeply impacted the lives and reputations of the family.

Her charity, Sarah's Trust, is now inactive, and her book publishing has been delayed. Her move out of Royal Lodge and the sale of her Belgravia flat mark a personal distancing from royal life. Meanwhile, her daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, retain their titles and have built independent careers, but they remain entangled in the scandal: Beatrice was photographed at a party with Epstein and Maxwell, and a leaked email suggests a 2009 visit to Epstein. Eugenie runs an anti-slavery charity that has raised £1.5 million but has distributed very little, raising ethical questions. The scandal has fractured traditional royal family dynamics, including Andrew’s exclusion from the Sandringham Christmas gathering and the uncertainty of future family time.

has engulfed Andrew is of his own making, but it has had a profound impact on his immediate family: his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson, and their two daughters.\n\nMs Ferguson, 66,  has been haunted by her own links  with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nShe will now move out of Royal Lodge and will make her own living arrangements, although it's believed she won't be moving to Sandringham in Norfolk with Andrew.\n\nPrincesses Beatrice, 37, and Eugenie, 35, will retain their titles, as they are the daughters of the son of a Sovereign.\n\nBut questions have also been raised about whether they can disentangle themselves from their parents' mess.\n\nMs Ferguson, who lost her duchess title when Andrew gave up his Duke of York title a few weeks ago, had, until recently, sidestepped the firing line of the controversy around Epstein.\n\nBut in September,  several charities dropped her as patron or ambassador  after the emergence of an email from 2011 in which she called Epstein her \"supreme friend\" and seemed to apologise for her public criticism of him.\n\nThe only charity she is still linked with is her own foundation, Sarah's Trust.\n\nIt used to have a \"duchess collection\" - a range of products including tea and biscuit sets to raise funds for the charity - but the website for that is no longer active.\n\nIts causes include supporting vulnerable communities, including \"forgotten women\" globally.\n\nBBC News has made multiple attempts to contact the charity to ask if such a cause is appropriate given Ms Ferguson's ties to Epstein. But the phone number listed is not recognised, and emails bounced back.\n\nWe raised this with the Charity Commission, who said one of its team has been in touch with the charity reminding it to keep their contact details up to date.\n\nAway from her philanthropy, Ms Ferguson has various business ventures, and has written several children's books, non-fiction about Queen Victoria, and her own memoirs.\n\nHer latest children's book, which was due to be published on 9 October according to a press release in Bookseller, is now showing as available from 28 November on Amazon.\n\nWaterstones bookstores told BBC News that the publication date for Flora And Fern: Kindness Along The Way, had \"moved\" and that they didn't have a new publication date.\n\nHer publisher, New Frontier Publishing, has not responded to a request for comment.\n\nHowever, one industry source told the BBC that \"it would be an entirely sensible decision\" to delay publication.\n\nMs Ferguson's other publishers have remained tight-lipped when asked whether they plan to sever links with her.\n\nHarper Collins, which has published two of her titles, the most recent being A Most Intriguing Lady which came out in 2023, declined to comment but pointed to the fact that both her books remain in print and available.\n\n\"Publishers don't tend to drop authors, they just quietly don't renew contracts,\" said Neill Denny, editor of the book trade news website Book Brunch.\n\nHe said that while there has been speculation that Ms Ferguson, or indeed Andrew, could write a tell-all memoir, \"I think the publishers would be wary of taking on the ex Duchess of York's story.\"\n\nAs for Beatrice and Eugenie, they have kept their princess title - which will be a small victory for Andrew, who will have wanted to protect his daughters, even at his own expense.\n\nBoth appear to have escaped the UK this week.\n\nBeatrice was pictured at an investment summit in Saudi Arabia. Her family have long-held links to the Middle East and she also recently appeared in a promotional picture  for a UAE bank .\n\nMeanwhile, Eugenie was pictured in Paris with friends.\n\nAnd while there has been some sympathy for the princesses, they also haven't been able to completely avoid the scandals around their parents.\n\nEarlier this week, a picture resurfaced  showing Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell and Harvey Weinstein  at Beatrice's 18th birthday party in Windsor.\n\nThe Telegraph also reported a leaked email from Epstein to his UK-based lawyer that suggested Ms Ferguson and the princesses visited Epstein in New York after he was released from prison in 2009.\n\nA source close to Ms Ferguson insisted that neither she nor her daughters had any recollection of such a visit,  according to the newspaper .\n\nIn 2018, Beatrice  told British Vogue in a joint interview  with her sister: \"We are young women trying to build careers and have personal lives, and we're also princesses and doing all of this in the public eye.\"\n\nThe princesses are not working royals, and both have jobs - Beatrice founded advisory firm BY-Eq, while Eugenie works at the gallery Hauser & Wirth.\n\nBoth are married with children, with Beatrice splitting her time between her Cotswolds property and an apartment in St James' Palace. Eugenie lives between Portugal and a property in the grounds of Kensington Palace.\n\nOn Friday night, royal sources said the late Queen's corgis are still going to be looked after by Andrew, Sarah and their daughters - although it's uncertain whose home they will reside in.\n\nBoth princesses also have their philanthropic endeavours. Eugenie set up the anti-slavery collective, a charity whose focus includes victims of sex trafficking. According to the most recently available accounts, it has raised £1.5m in donations last year but has so far distributed very little, with £1.3m carried forward.\n\nBBC News approached the charity to ask for a comment in light of the latest controversy surrounding Andrew and Epstein, but it has not responded.\n\nAt the end of this tumultuous week, there are still many unanswered questions.\n\nFamily time will clearly be harder now. Andrew is moving to Norfolk, which means he is no longer close by to his daughters and grandchildren.\n\nMs Ferguson - who maintained a close relationship with Andrew and lived at Royal Lodge with him, despite their divorce in 1996 - will also now move home.\n\nOn Saturday,  The Times reported  that Andrew \"finally\" agreed to leave his Windsor mansion, after it became apparent his ex-wife was going to move out.\n\nMs Ferguson's representatives declined to comment when asked by BBC News.\n\nFor now, it is unclear where she will move to. She recently sold her Belgravia flat, which she purchased for £4.2m. It is still listed in her name on Land Registry records, but her spokesperson confirmed to BBC News that the sale has gone through.\n\nAnd then there's a question mark over Christmas.\n\nIt's been previously announced that Andrew would be excluded from the traditional royal family gathering which takes place in Sandringham at Christmas.\n\nWhere Ms Ferguson will be is also not clear.\n\nBut either way, the princesses will face a choice, whether to spend it with their parents, their in-laws, or the wider Royal Family.\n\nWhat they decide may be telling. With the York brand now tainted beyond repair, who they choose to celebrate with may be a sign of who they will align with in future."},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/31/upshot/snap-food-shutdown-trump.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"18:27:07-04:00","title":"Who Will Be Affected by Disruptions to Federal Food Aid","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which serves nearly 42 million Americans, is at the center of a legal and political crisis during a government shutdown.

It pays for groceries for one in eight Americans, and more than one in three households in counties that rely the most on it.\n\nThe administration had said it would not tap contingency funds to keep the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program operating as of Saturday, threatening to halt benefits for the first time in the program’s modern history.

2025-11-01T00:52:35.386+00:00\n\nTitle: Hair transplants, finasteride and hair systems: Welcome to the world of hair restoration\n\n​​I'm bald, and that bothered me for a long time. ​​\n\nIt bothered me that I was bothered. But just one swipe down my Instagram feed reveals I'm not the only man who is self-conscious about his hair.\n\nI'm greeted with videos and posts offering me hair transplants, regrowth tablets, thickening sprays, powders that fill gaps, and hair systems (once known as wigs or toupees).\n\nThese products promise to restore my \"lost confidence\" and stop my lack of hair from \"holding back\" my life.\n\nBut does the wealth of treatment options on offer mean attitudes towards hair loss have shifted? Is what was once viewed as something to be resigned to now seen as reversible, albeit at a cost?\n\nAccording to the International Society of Hair Restoration Surgery (ISHRS), hair transplants are becoming more common around the world - and the people having them are getting younger.\n\nThis global collective of surgeons, doctors and experts found 95% of its members' patients sought hair restoration surgery between the ages of 20 and 35 - and that's something hair-loss surgeon Dr Nilofer Farjo confirms is mirrored in the UK.\n\nWhen my hair first began to recede in my early 20s, I tried my best to cover it up, tactically styling and positioning it in a way that hid the new patches of scalp I hadn't seen before.\n\nThen, while out for my brother's stag do in a Liverpool nightclub, something happened that I haven't been able to forget since.\n\nI had suggested we wear white t-shirts and carry permanent markers so people we met could leave funny messages on our shirts.\n\n\"Best man? Best comb-over,\" one woman wrote.\n\nI laughed it off at the time, but inside, I was crushed. It was clear my hair loss was now noticeable to other people. And from then on, I became more and more self-conscious about my thinning hair.\n\nWhen I was younger, bald men were often the butt of jokes - but taking steps to regain lost hair seemed to be viewed as effeminate and vain. Still, I began to wonder if a hair transplant was my only option. Was that a possibility for someone like me? In my mind, they were only for rich people, and celebrities like Elton John.\n\nFast forward ten years, and social media and dating apps have made us all more aware of how we look, says Dr Farjo, and seeing celebrities and influencers being more open about hair transplants has normalised the procedure.\n\nShe says more and more young men are now choosing to treat their hair loss, and what might have once been deemed \"vanity\" is now considered \"routine self-care\".\n\nWhen I started considering having a hair transplant, I had just finished university, had little money, and no real idea how much the procedure might actually cost.\n\nI began to do some research and discovered a nearby transplant clinic offering free consultations and monthly payment plans.\n\n\"You're still quite young,\" I remember the hair transplant consultant telling me, as he drew on my scalp with a felt-tip pin. \"After this transplant, your hair could recede further. But you can just come and get it filled in.\"\n\nDespite the payment plan, I realised I couldn't afford a hair transplant - especially if I'd have to come and get a top-up later in life.\n\nSince my own consultation in Cardiff in 2014, I've heard about men travelling abroad in increasing numbers to countries like Turkey to have hair transplants. Dr Farjo says this is down to costs being \"a fraction\" of what they are in the UK.\n\nBut while the price may be attractive, she says there are concerns about industry practices, with limited regulations in place. Dr Farjo also warns that cheap, unregulated procedures, not only in Turkey, can sometimes lead to people needing \"costly corrective surgery\" to deal with scarring and \"poor hairline design\".\n\nBut hair transplants in Turkey remain popular and there are many happy customers - including content creator, Ben Placito.\n\nAfter jokey comments from his barber, Ben decided to consider having a hair transplant. And after months of research, he discovered it would be cheaper to have the procedure carried out in Turkey than in the UK.\n\nSome quotes from Turkish clinics were \"crazy cheap\", Ben says, offering surgery for around £1,500. But the 31-year-old chose not to go with the cheapest hair transplant on offer and instead selected a \"premium\" option.\n\nBen felt reassured about his chosen clinic after speaking to other men who had been there and had good experiences. Ben travelled to Turkey in 2022 to have the procedure, sharing his experience on his TikTok account.\n\n\"People have said to me 'it's the best thing you've done,'\" Ben says. \"I'm really happy I did it.\"\n\nAbout a year after I gave up on the idea of surgery, I came across an advert for a clinic offering non-surgical treatments, like finasteride tablets and minoxidil cream, which can be used to stimulate hair growth.\n\nFinasteride is one of the most common pills for hair loss, taken by tens of thousands of men in the UK. It is only available by private prescription.\n\nIt works by preventing testosterone turning into another hormone called dihydrotestosterone (DHT) that can stop hair growing.\n\nMinoxidil, originally a blood pressure medication, has hair growth as a side effect and is commonly sold in the form of a daily cream applied directly to the hair and scalp.\n\nI paid several hundred pounds for a combined course of minoxidil and finasteride but the treatment requires consistent daily use, and I often forgot doses. Eventually, I realised I couldn't justify the cost - or trust myself to stick with it. Health concerns also weighed on me, something the clinic had made clear.\n\nAccording to a 2024 report by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), finasteride is linked to psychiatric issues like depression and suicidal thoughts, and can have side effects affecting sexual function.\n\nThe MHRA advises users to monitor symptoms and stop using the drug if adverse effects occur.\n\nMy experience was a decade ago, but the market for hair-loss medication has since exploded. Superdrug's private online doctor service says it has seen a 68% increase in new patients requesting hair-loss services in the last three months versus the equivalent period last year.\n\nHaving given up on medication, I relied on hats and carefully positioned sunglasses that would \"hide\" my receding hair. If I was taking a photo with family or friends, I'd position the camera so it cropped out the top of my head.\n\nThen in 2019, I began to see adverts for hair systems. These seamless-looking hair pieces are glued to a shaved scalp and blended with existing hair, with regular clinic visits for maintenance. This seemed like a side-effect-free, instant solution.\n\nBut I couldn't shake the thought of suddenly appearing at work or family events with a full head of hair - everyone knew I was balding. I also questioned the legitimacy of the adverts. Were the results real? Or just the result of clever lighting and angles?\n\nI had seen some people with systems telling their social media followers they could start peeling off in the middle of the day - and I dreaded that.\n\nHowever, for 36-year-old Adam Lomax, who has male pattern baldness and trichotillomania (a mental health disorder where you can't resist pulling out your own hair), a hair system was \"life changing\".\n\nAdam had already tried finasteride, which left him feeling anxious, depressed and low in libido.\n\n\"People have been really positive,\" Adam says of the reception to his new hair. \"The conversation around men's hair loss has shifted massively - but you still get the odd troll on TikTok.\"\n\nIt's clear there are plenty of options for men facing hair loss, but not every bald man sees losing their hair as something that needs to be fixed or prevented.\n\n\"The narrative around hair loss needs to change both socially and commercially,\" says Tariq Kazemi, co-founder and CEO of skincare company Bld Bro, a brand which began life as a support group for bald men.\n\nTariq recalls a colleague poking fun at his bald spot during a shopping trip, and describing that as \"like an ice pick to my heart\".\n\nTariq later shaved his head and noticed that jokes about his hair loss stopped. He chose not to pursue any form of hair restoration.\n\n\"Those industries prey on the fear and anxiety of young men,\" he says. \"We've been told it's our identity, our confidence and our attractiveness that will all disappear with the hair on our head.\"\n\nIn 2020, when the world went into coronavirus lockdown many people grew out their hair or attempted to cut it themselves.\n\nBy this time, the only remaining hair I had was around the back of my head and in a thin patch on the top of my forehead. I took the plunge and decided to shave my head. There was a freedom in skipping to the end stage of the balding process, and I've continued to shave my head ever since.\n\nThere's so much social media noise around hair loss, and money to be made from men's worries about it. But after speaking to different men about their hair loss experiences, it's clear there is no single right way to feel happy with your appearance.\n\nThe anxiety I felt while I was losing my hair has gradually ebbed away and I feel more accepting of the way I look. I've come to terms with my baldness now and I prefer to be bald than balding."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy5lzq94gqo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"14:28:31.984+00:00","title":"Royal finances: Where does the King get his money?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the financial structure of the British Royal Family, highlighting that King Charles III is funding Andrew Mountbatten Windsor's relocation to Sandringham following the loss of his 'prince' title.

money after being stripped of his \"prince\" title and asked to leave his mansion.\n\nThe King is understood to be funding Andrew's new accommodation himself and to be making \"appropriate private provision\" as he moves from Royal Lodge.\n\nThe Royal Family receives tens of millions of pounds each year from the Sovereign Grant and uses it to cover the cost of official duties, but this is not the King's only source of income.\n\nIn 2025-26, the  Sovereign Grant, which provides state funding for the monarchy, increased to £132.1m , following a sharp rise in profits for the Crown Estate.\n\nThe figure in 2024-25 was £86.3 million, for the fourth consecutive year.\n\nThat included £51.8 million for the core Sovereign Grant and £34.5 million towards the modernisation of Buckingham Palace, a 10-year £369m project.\n\nThe  Royal Household's annual financial statement  said additional income increased to £21.5m, following a record number of visitors to Buckingham Palace.\n\nPublic funding for the Royal Household has tripled  in real terms since 2012, official figures show. The Sovereign Grant was £31m per year when it was introduced in 2012.\n\nA report by the House of Commons Library said much of the increase had been driven by the Buckingham Palace project.\n\nA Palace spokesperson said: \"It has always been anticipated that the level of the Sovereign Grant will drop once the project is completed.\"\n\nProfits of the Crown Estate - a property business owned by the monarch but run independently - go to the Treasury.\n\nThe level of profit is used to calculate the funding given by the government to the Royal Family.\n\nThe Crown Estate had assets worth £15bn in 2023-24, with billions of pounds worth of properties in London, including Regent Street, as well as nearly half the land along the coast of England, Wales and Northern Ireland.\n\nThe estate is not the King's private property - it merely belongs to the monarch for the duration of their reign. The King cannot sell its assets or keep any profits for himself.\n\nThe Sovereign Grant was initially worth 15% of the Crown Estate profits generated two years previously. That increased to 25% in 2017-18, to help pay for the Buckingham Palace repairs, before reducing to 12% since 2024-25.\n\nHowever,  soaring profits from the Crown Estate  due to six new offshore wind farms still led to the £45m increase in the Sovereign Grant in 2025-26.\n\nUnder the Sovereign Grant Act 2011, if the Crown Estate's profits fall, the monarch still receives the same amount as the previous year, with the government making up the difference.\n\nThe UK government said that over the last 10 years, the revenue received from the Crown Estate was £5bn, which was used for public spending.\n\nThe King and other working members of the Royal Family use the money to pay for expenses related to their official duties.\n\nThe vast majority is spent on the upkeep of properties and staffing, but it also covers costs such as travel to royal engagements.\n\nMembers of the Royal Family carried out 1,900 engagements across the UK and abroad during 2024-25.\n\nMore than 93,000 guests attended 828 events at official Royal palaces, including receptions, award investitures and garden parties.\n\nThe King also receives money from a private estate called the Duchy of Lancaster, which is passed down from monarch to monarch.\n\nIt covers more than 18,000 hectares of land in areas such as Lancashire and Yorkshire, as well as property in central London.\n\nAt the end of March 2025, it was worth £679m and had made £24.4m in annual profits.\n\nWhoever holds the title of Duke of Cornwall (currently the Prince of Wales) benefits from the Duchy of Cornwall.\n\nIt mainly covers land in south-west England. In the year to the end of March 2025 it had assets worth £1.1bn and had made annual profits of £22.9m.\n\nThe King and Prince William receive the profits from the duchies personally, and can spend them as they wish. However, they are not entitled to any proceeds from the sale of any estate assets, which must be reinvested.\n\nThe monarch also owns the royal palaces (which are not part of the Crown Estate) and part of the Royal Collection of art, but these do not generate income.\n\nSome palaces are looked after and funded by the Royal Family itself. Others - such as the Tower of London - are managed by Historic Royal Palaces, an independent charity.\n\nThe King also privately owns properties such as Balmoral and Sandringham.\n\nIt is understood Andrew will be relocated to the  Sandringham estate  in Norfolk, which covers approximately 8,100 hectares.\n\nIn addition, some Royal Family members have private art, jewellery and stamp collections which they can sell or use to generate income as they wish.\n\nIn 1992, Elizabeth II volunteered to pay income tax and capital gains tax on her personal income, and the King does the same.\n\nThe two duchies are exempt from corporation tax, but the King and Prince William voluntarily pay income tax on the revenue they generate. However, the amount of tax they pay is not made public.\n\nThey do not pay capital gains tax because they do not benefit personally from any increase in the duchies' assets.\n\nMembers of the Royal Family pay tax on any income generated from privately-owned assets.\n\nKing Charles does not have to pay inheritance tax on the money he received when the late queen died, under the \"sovereign to sovereign\" exemption agreed in 1993 by then Prime Minister John Major.\n\nThe Sovereign Grant does not cover the Royal Family's security arrangements, which are usually paid for by the Metropolitan Police, although the cost is not disclosed.\n\nSome major events are also not included.  The late queen's funeral in 2022 cost the government an estimated £162m .\n\nThe Coronation of the King cost taxpayers £72m, including £22m for policing.\n\nRepublic, a group campaigning for an elected head of state, has argued that factors such as security need to be included in the cost of the Royal Family.\n\nThe group claims that the total cost of the monarchy is about £510m per year."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c201zvrpvw9o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"16:46:11.747+00:00","title":"Where might Andrew live on the Sandringham estate?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Prince Andrew, now stripped of his 'prince' title, is relocating from Royal Lodge in Windsor to the Sandringham estate in Norfolk, marking a significant departure from the core royal family.

Where might Andrew live on the Sandringham estate?\n\nNewly stripped of his \"prince\" title, Andrew is moving from his Windsor mansion, Royal Lodge, to the Sandringham estate in Norfolk, it is understood.\n\nFormal notice was given to surrender the lease at the Royal Lodge on Thursday, and the move will take place as soon as possible.\n\nThe historic, sprawling estate spans approximately 31 sq miles (80 sq km) of gardens - making it around the same size as Nottingham or Brighton and Hove.\n\nIt was bought as a private country retreat for the future Edward VII when he was Albert, Prince of Wales in 1862, and has since been passed down from monarch to monarch.\n\nThe estate itself covers several residential villages and hamlets, and includes 15 sq miles (40 sq km) of farmland.\n\nThe main building - Sandringham House - is thought to have more than a hundred rooms, including a ballroom.\n\nIt remains a country retreat for the Royal Family and is where they traditionally gather at Christmas.\n\nAndrew will be moving some 140 miles (225km) north-east of his Windsor mansion - and away from senior royals like King Charles III and Queen Camilla, who reside in London, and the Prince and Princess of Wales in Windsor.\n\nSome assumed Andrew would move from Royal Lodge to another property on the Windsor estate, Frogmore Cottage for example, royal biographer Robert Hardman told the BBC.\n\n\"But no,\" he said, \"he's off the estate, he's out of Windsor, he's out of royal Berkshire - he's been sent up the M11 to the royal equivalent of Siberia to sit in Sandringham for the rest of his life.\"\n\n\"This is - some might say brutal, others might say definitive.\"\n\nSandringham is a private estate - not an official royal residence - and it is understood the King will be privately funding Andrew's accommodation there, and that it will not be directly funded by the taxpayer.\n\nThe Palace has not yet said exactly where on the estate Andrew will live, or when he could move.\n\nBut royal sources have said it will not be immediate, and instead be \"as soon as possible and practicable\".\n\nHere is a look at some of the options on the estate.\n\nOriginally known as Bachelor's Cottage, York Cottage is about a quarter of a mile from the main house.\n\nIt has its own set of stables and kennel buildings, according to Historic England, and overlooks one of two man-made lakes on the estate.\n\nThere were reports ahead of Prince Harry's marriage to the Duchess of Sussex that the pair might have been gifted the use of York Cottage by Elizabeth II for use as a country home, but no such plan was ever confirmed and the move never materialised.\n\nIt has reportedly been used as an office and accommodation for staff in recent years.\n\nThe birthplace of Diana, Princess of Wales and her childhood home, Park House was rented by the Spencer family for many years.\n\nIn 1983 it was gifted to Leonard Cheshire, a disability charity, which used it to run a 16-bedroom hotel for the disabled, their carers and family.\n\nThe charity planned a £2.3m refurbishment before the pandemic hit, but announced in 2020 it would not go ahead with the proposal and said instead that it was working with the Sandringham estate to exit the lease.\n\nAnother option is the Gardens House, which was once the residence of the head gardener on the Sandringham estate.\n\nThe Edwardian house has six bedrooms and three bathrooms, is dog-friendly and is one of two properties on the estate available to the general public as a holiday let.\n\nIts grounds hold a working sawmill and organic farm.\n\nIt was  put on the market in July  at a weekly price of £4,110. It is not unusual for royal residences to rent out property to holidaymakers - with eight cottages and lodges available for hire at Balmoral Castle in Scotland.\n\nAnother possibility is The Folly - a three-bedroom, two-bathroom lodge built in the 1800s.\n\nComplete with a turret and a wraparound balcony, it has been used as a hunting lodge and a place to take afternoon tea.\n\nAlso listed as a holiday let to the public, it is said to have room for six guests - a change from the 30-room Windsor mansion Andrew will be vacating.\n\nGiven the lodge's \"grandeur\", Majesty Magazine's managing editor Joe Little told the BBC earlier this year, there is a \"a heightened awareness that the privately owned royal estates are actively striving to bolster\" the Royal Family's revenue streams.\n\nThis is one option that is understood to have been ruled out.\n\nThe farmhouse, described as \"small and intimate\" by former housekeeper Teresa Thompson, has strong associations with Andrew's parents.\n\nHis father, the late Duke of Edinburgh, chose the secluded property as his permanent home when he retired from public life in 2017.\n\nHe and the late Queen already regularly stayed there in preference to opening up Sandringham House when it was just the two of them.\n\nAnmer Hall was gifted to the Prince of Wales and Catherine, Princess of Wales as a wedding present by the late queen in 2013 - so this may be an unlikely choice.\n\nThey spend much of the school holidays in the 10-bedroom, Grade II*-listed house, which is about 2 miles (3km) east of the main Sandringham house.\n\nThe Georgian property dates back to about 1802, but some parts are much older - and it has formed part of the Sandringham estate since 1898."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ylk9r336zo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"17:38:19.439+00:00","title":"What we know about Prince Andrew losing his titles and Royal Lodge","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Buckingham Palace has announced that Prince Andrew has been formally stripped of his royal titles—Prince, Duke of York, Earl of Inverness, and Baron Killyleagh—and will no longer be referred to as His Royal Highness.

mansion, Royal Lodge, Buckingham Palace has announced.\n\nThe King has \"initiated a formal process\" to remove his titles, it said, and Andrew will now be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor.\n\nAndrew, 65 - the King's younger brother - has continued to face more questions about his private life in recent months.\n\nHis links to paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein have caused problems for the Royal Family. The prince, who relinquished his titles this month, has always strongly denied any wrongdoing.\n\nThe dramatic fall from grace affects not just him but his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson and their children, Beatrice and Eugenie.\n\n\"His Majesty has today initiated a formal process to remove the Style, Titles and Honours of Prince Andrew,\" Buckingham Palace  said in a statement  on Thursday evening.\n\n\"Prince Andrew will now be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor.\"\n\nIt also addressed the place where he lives, Royal Lodge.\n\n\"His lease on Royal Lodge has, to date, provided him with legal protection to continue in residence.\n\n\"Formal notice has now been served to surrender the lease and he will move to alternative private accommodation. These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him.\n\n\"Their Majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse.\"\n\nThe language of Buckingham Palace's statement was \"very brutal,\" royal historian Kelly Swaby told the BBC.\n\n\"Ordinary people don't care about the semantics, they want to see punishment, and public opinion is very much against Andrew, the Palace knows that, and the language very much reflects that\".\n\nThe decision was made, and action taken, due to serious lapses in Andrew's judgement, it is understood.\n\nIt is also understood that the wider Royal Family and the government was consulted, and made clear it supports the decision.\n\nThe BBC's former royal correspondent Jennie Bond said she thought the Prince of Wales had pushed for the recent action.\n\n\"I think this line had to be drawn and William was probably pushing for the King to do so,\" she said.\n\n\"William is about to go to Brazil on a very important tour - and the recent tour by the King and Queen to the Vatican was very nearly overshadowed by what was going on with Andrew, and that could not be allowed to continue.\"\n\nIt is understood Andrew will be relocated to the  Sandringham estate  in Norfolk, but details about his specific housing have not been released.\n\nThe wider Sandringham estate covers approximately 20,000 acres (8,100 hectares) with 600 acres (242 hectares) of gardens - and the Palace has not said which property he will stay in.\n\nIt is understood that Andrew is unlikely to move into Sandringham's Wood Farm, his late father's former home.\n\nFormal notice was given to surrender the lease at the Royal Lodge on Thursday and it is understood that Andrew's move to Sandringham will take place \"as soon as practicable\".\n\nAndrew's ex-wife Sarah Ferguson, 66, will also move out of Royal Lodge and make her own living arrangements, it is understood.\n\nShe lost her courtesy royal divorcee title as a duchess in early October, when Andrew lost the use of his Duke of York title - reverting to her maiden name.\n\nThough the public had long referred to her as \"Fergie\", royal commentator Richard Palmer  told the BBC at the time  the title change would \"no doubt\" have an impact.\n\n\"She will have lost a bit of cachet over this,\" he said. \"She certainly does use the title.\"\n\nFor their daughters - Beatrice, 37 and Eugenie, 35 - there is no formal change.\n\nThey will still be princesses because they are the daughters of the son of a sovereign - in line with King George V's Letters Patent of 1917.\n\nTheir places in the line of succession will also stay the same.\n\nAndrew remains eighth in line to the throne despite losing his titles - followed by Beatrice and Eugenie in ninth and twelfth place.\n\nBut their positions in the family are \"low down\" and will likely slip further with time, royal commentator Victoria Murphy said previously - adding that she could not see them, as non-working royals, step into official duties any time soon.\n\nThere was an \"appreciation of the fact that this scandal doesn't involve them,\" she also said, \"and it's not fair for it to impact them directly in the independent lives they are carving out for themselves\".\n\nIt is understood Andrew's accommodation will be privately funded by the King.\n\nAnd the King will make \"appropriate private provision\" for his brother as he moves out of his home.\n\nRoyal sources have previously said the King has tried to apply pressure, and last year cut off Andrew's funding.\n\nAndrew also cultivated his own independent sources of funding since leaving public life, including business connections with China, the Gulf States and a recently curtailed project with a Dutch start-up company.\n\nEarlier this week, Parliament's spending watchdog, the Public Accounts Committee wrote a letter detailing the \"considerable and understandable public interest in the spending of public money\" relating to Andrew.\n\nThe letter asked what the Crown Estate's plan was to ensure value for money in any future agreements with Andrew.\n\nAndrew is understood not to have objected to the King's decision to remove his titles.\n\nHis birth certificate does not need to be changed and the title change will not apply retrospectively.\n\nThe titles being stripped are: Prince, Duke of York, Earl of Inverness, Baron Killyleagh. And he will no longer have the right to be called His Royal Highness. The honours of Order of the Garter and Knight Grand Cross of the Victorian Order will also be removed.\n\nTo remove the titles, the King will send Royal warrants to the Lord Chancellor - who is David Lammy - to officially remove them.\n\nIt comes just weeks after Andrew voluntarily gave up his other royal titles, including the Duke of York.\n\nOn 17 October, Andrew said he would stop using the titles because the \"continued accusations about me distract from the work of His Majesty and the Royal Family\". \"I vigorously deny the accusations against me,\" he said.\n\nUntil this month, Ferguson kept the title Sarah, Duchess of York - but she reverted to her maiden name of Ferguson after Andrew was stripped of his Duke of York title.\n\nThe surname Mountbatten Windsor was created in 1960, and combines the surnames of the late Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip when they married.\n\nIn 1917, fearful of the anti-German sentiment in the UK the reigning monarch, George V, adopted the name Windsor to replace the original Germanic sounding house of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha dynasty.\n\nHe renamed the lineage Windsor, after the castle.\n\nMountbatten is an anglicised version of Battenberg. The Duke of Edinburgh's mother was Princess Alice of Battenberg, but during the First World War the family opted to change it to Mountbatten, again to avoid more anti-German sentiment.\n\nThe double-barrelled name was a concession to the Duke of Edinburgh, who was said to have complained that his children would not bear his name.\n\nAndrew is already not invited to attend royal public events, and his recent appearances have been limited to private, family events, such as funerals or memorials.\n\nThis fiasco will continue to dog the Royal Family, says historian and author Andrew Lownie.\n\n\"They're finally getting ahead of the story, but this isn't the end of it,\" Lownie told the BBC.\n\nThe Palace is \"finally taking some decisive action\" - but it \"won't completely satisfy the public disquiet\".\n\nCampaigners against the monarchy say there should be a wider investigation into what the Royal Family might have known about Prince Andrew's links to Epstein.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police has said it is \"actively\" looking into media reports that then Prince Andrew tried to obtain personal information about his accuser Virginia Giuffre through his police protection.\n\nAndrew has always denied any wrongdoing and has not faced any charges, but large sections of the media will continue digging into the case.\n\nAndrew's links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein are at the centre of this latest announcement.\n\nIn recent weeks, pressure has increased on the monarchy to resolve the issue of Charles's brother, with the King heckled earlier this week by a protester.\n\nAlthough Andrew denies the accusations, the Royal Family considers there have been \"serious lapses of judgement\" in his behaviour.\n\nEarlier this month, emails from 2011 re-emerged, showing Andrew in contact with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein months after he claimed their friendship ended.\n\nIn her posthumous memoir, Nobody's Girl Virginia Giuffre repeated allegations that, as a teenager, she was forced to have sex with Andrew on three separate occasions – claims he has always denied."},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/01/climate/marathon-running-air-pollution.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"05:01:46-04:00","title":"How Bad Air Affects Your Marathon Finish Time","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A study by researchers at Brown University analyzed over 17 years of marathon finish times from nine major U.S. cities, including Boston, New York City, and Los Angeles, and found that higher levels of PM2.5 air pollution are directly correlated with slower finish times — for every one microgram per cubic meter increase, men's times increase by 32 seconds and women's by 25 seconds.

How Bad Air Affects Your Marathon Finish Time\n\nPublished: 2025-11-01T05:01:46-04:00\n\nEvery marathon runner has had a bad day. Your legs start to feel heavy. You feel out of breath. Your goal time slips away.\n\nIt’s easy to blame nerves, or high humidity, or too much (or not enough) spaghetti the day before. But according to a recent study, there could be a less obvious culprit for a sluggish pace: Air pollution.\n\nResearchers at Brown University analyzed a data set of millions of marathon finish times from major U.S. marathons over 17 years. They found that higher air levels of fine particulate matter called PM2.5 — the term for pollutants smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter — were, on average, directly associated with slower finish times.\n\nThis kind of particulate matter is often what drives air-quality warnings. For example, in New York State, an average PM2.5 concentration of 35 micrograms per cubic meter can trigger an air-quality health advisory.\n\nThe marathon researchers used data from nine races, including those in New York City, Boston and Los Angeles, between 2003 and 2019. They found that, for every increase of one microgram per cubic meter of these tiny particles, men’s average finish times were 32 seconds slower and women’s were 25 seconds slower. That means on even a moderately polluted day, times could be slower by minutes.\n\nPollution levels and finish times at nine major U.S. marathons, averaged from 2003 to 2019\n\nSource: Fleury, et. al., Sports Medicine (2024).\n\nThe New York Times\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Their Differences Define Them.\n\nPublished: 2025-11-01T05:17:35-04:00\n\nThe worldviews of two ambitious, left-leaning Muslim politicians were shaped nearly a decade ago during a year of political turmoil.\n\nIn May 2016, Sadiq Khan became mayor of London as Britain voted to withdraw from the European Union, a retreat from global influence fueled in part by anger about migration. That same year, the presidential campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont inspired Zohran Mamdani, this year’s Democratic candidate for mayor of New York, who joined a generation of progressive activists energized by the senator’s embrace of democratic socialism.\n\nSince then, the men have been living in separate political worlds an ocean apart. Mr. Mamdani proudly champions the progressive left’s agenda, while Mr. Khan has governed as an establishment centrist.\n\nBut both have been thrust into prominence — and sometimes attacked in the same breath — as they navigate the nationalist and xenophobic movements that have built across the United States, Europe and beyond. Both have had to increase their personal protection in response to the threats.\n\nIf Mr. Mamdani is elected mayor of New York on Tuesday, the two largest cities in Britain and the United States would be led by liberal, Muslim sons of immigrants, both of whom would have risen to power in part by resisting a rightward lurch in their countries.\n\n“We’re in a moment of populist, far-right uprising in both countries. And the center left has had the stuffing knocked out of them,” said Matthew McGregor, the chief executive of 38 Degrees, a progressive London-based think tank. And yet, he added, “Sadiq and Zohran are unusual and inspiring in a way in which they are seeking to use the power of their respective cities to drive progress forward.”\n\nTheir political arcs are similar. Mr. Mamdani has made affordability the centerpiece of his efforts to win City Hall. Mr. Khan has focused on affordable housing, public transportation and environmental initiatives like curbing traffic congestion and preserving air quality.\n\nAnd they both have become targets of vitriolic attacks by President Trump, who won the White House for the first time in 2016. The president has called Mr. Mamdani a “pure communist” and Mr. Khan a “stone cold loser.” His followers say the successes of the two men foreshadow the end of Western civilization.\n\nBut in many ways, Mr. Mamdani and Mr. Khan are as different as they are similar.\n\nMr. Khan was born in London to Pakistani working-class immigrant parents and lived in public housing with his seven siblings — an upbringing that inspired his approach to politics. Mr. Mamdani, who immigrated to the United States from Uganda as a child, is the son of a university professor and filmmaker and has described his childhood as “privileged.” His father’s writings and teachings helped inform his democratic socialist identity.\n\nThey also are from different generations. Mr. Khan, 55, has spent more than two decades in office as a centrist, establishment figure from the country’s Labour Party. Mr. Mamdani, 34, engineered a long-shot primary victory in June that upended assumptions about New York’s electorate; inspired young, leftist voters; and built a multiracial coalition.\n\nThe two men have spoken only once, and only briefly, according to senior advisers for both leaders. During their conversation, Mr. Khan congratulated Mr. Mamdani for his victory in the Democratic mayoral primary and expressed his pride in seeing a young talent achieve political success.\n\nThe senior adviser for Mr. Mamdani said his team had remained laser focused on the campaign in New York and had not yet plotted out a working relationship with the mayor of London or of any other global city. People close to Mr. Khan said that he had been privately impressed by Mr. Mamdani’s political skills, but that he had not spoken publicly about him. The advisers and people all spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss political matters.\n\nNeither Mr. Mamdani nor Mr. Khan agreed to discuss how they approach similar issues confronting their cities.\n\nConservative and Democratic leaders have described Mr. Mamdani as too far left to appeal to voters outside deep-blue New York City. His campaign promises include free buses, universal child care and a rent freeze for millions of New Yorkers. His rivals have described the ideas as fanciful and fiscally dangerous.\n\nBy contrast, Mr. Khan has sometimes been criticized by left-wing voters as being too centrist. During his first mayoral term, he vocally criticized the Labour Party’s leader at the time, Jeremy Corbyn, who proudly identifies as a socialist and is a veteran of radical left-wing protest movements.\n\nBoth Mr. Mamdani and Mr. Khan have seized on the diversity of their cities to shape their campaigns and approaches to governing. But they have faced different pressures from voters, especially on the issue of what to say about the war in Gaza and the treatment of Palestinians.\n\nMr. Khan called for the British government to recognize a Palestinian state months before it made the decision, following pressure from the political left and large pro-Palestinian demonstrations in London. In September, he described Israel’s actions in Gaza as a “genocide.”\n\nBritain’s control of Palestine in the decades leading up to World War II and its role in the creation of the state of Israel has led to broad popular support in London and other cities for Palestinian self-determination.\n\nThe Palestinian issue has been one of the most difficult for Mr. Mamdani to navigate. Much of his appeal to many New York voters is the result of his unwavering support for Palestinian rights and early call for a cease-fire in the war. But his critics say that he is anti-Israel and not sympathetic to the city’s large Jewish population.\n\nIn an interview on Fox News last month, Mr. Mamdani dodged a question about whether Hamas should be forced to disarm and abandon leadership, saying he remained focused on the issue of affordability in New York. Representative Elise Stefanik, Republican of New York, a frequent critic of Mr. Mamdani, called him a “jihadist,” something his campaign called xenophobic and dangerous.\n\nThe politicians’ experiences, in part, reflect the demographics and the politics of their respective cities.\n\nA recent survey of the religious populations in New York found that roughly a half-million of its residents, or about 6 percent, belong to a mosque. The Jewish population is larger, double by some estimates.\n\nLike New York, London is ethnically and religiously diverse. In the 2021 census, 15 percent of its residents identified as Muslim, making Islam the city’s second-largest religion after Christianity. Less than 2 percent of people in the city are Jewish.\n\nMr. Khan has courted London’s diverse cultures during his three terms. He has celebrated his Muslim heritage and joined public celebrations for the festival of Eid. He also chose to be inaugurated in 2016 at a Christian cathedral in a ceremony attended by civil rights campaigners, has marched in official Pride parades and voted in favor of same-sex marriage in his previous role as a lawmaker.\n\n“Being the son of a bus driver was probably more prominent during the campaign than him being Muslim or being the son of Pakistani immigrants,” said Uma Kumaran, a British Sri Lankan member of Parliament who helped lead Mr. Khan’s first mayoral campaign.\n\nPerhaps the biggest similarity between Mr. Khan and Mr. Mamdani is the vitriol they inspire on the right in both countries.\n\nStephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s onetime chief strategist, has repeatedly raged about the two men, accusing them of being part of a “red-green alliance” between Democrats and “radical Islamists,” and he has said they are “Marxists.”\n\nA Fox News host suggested this past week that New York under Mr. Mamdani would turn into London — a thinly veiled allusion to the city’s large Muslim population and fears about street crime.\n\nA White House spokeswoman, Abigail Jackson, said in a statement that “London and New York City are microcosms of what can happen when left-wing policies are allowed to reign, unchecked by common sense,” and added that “America’s cities should look toward President Trump’s law-and-order policies, not the liberal agenda embraced by socialists like Mamdani.”\n\nThe attacks have dogged their political lives.\n\nFour days before the 2016 London election, Mr. Khan’s main opponent from the Conservative Party wrote an article that accused him of antisemitism and claimed that his election would amount to “aggressive socialism entering Britain though the back door.” It was illustrated with a photograph of a bus that was bombed in 2005 during London’s deadliest terrorist attack. Mr. Khan won the final vote by 13 percentage points.\n\nAsif Hussain, a former senior adviser to Mr. Khan and deputy director on his 2024 re-election campaign, said the mayor’s race that year brought a “fever pitch” of far-right vitriol against him. Even criticisms of his environmental and public transit policies were tinged with xenophobic, anti-immigrant rhetoric.\n\nMr. Khan has been a political target for the right-wing Reform U.K. party, which has blamed him for crime in London and claimed the city is “lawless.” He has countered the criticism by highlighting a drop in violent crime and denouncing opponents for spreading misinformation.\n\nMr. Mamdani has received attacks from members of his own party. When a conservative radio host suggested that Mr. Mamdani “would be cheering” another Sept. 11-style terrorist attack, Andrew Cuomo, the former Democratic governor of New York and Mr. Mamdani’s leading opponent in the mayoral race, quipped, “That’s another problem.”\n\nMr. Khan and Mr. Mamdani have so far refused to back down in the face of the attacks. Mr. Khan recently accused the American president of fanning “the flames of divisive, far-right politics.” Mr. Mamdani has said that Mr. Trump’s election plunged the United States into “a period of political darkness” and that his opponents’ messaging shows that anti-Muslim sentiment is acceptable in public discourse.\n\nIf Mr. Mamdani is elected on Tuesday, he and Mr. Khan may find new reasons — despite their differences — to cooperate as they navigate the increasingly angry political climate.\n\n“London is a major capital in the world. What Sadiq says is of consequence. What the president of the United States of America says is also of consequence,” Mr. Hussain said. “And I think one thing that Zohran will need to be aware of is, once you’re in that position, it’s not just a regional, mayoral role. It’s a global role.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/10/31/magazine/nyc-marathon-finish-photo-history-rod-dixon.html","dateOfPublication":"0000-01-01","timeOfPublication":"00:00:00Z","title":"‘I’m the Guy on the Floor’: Memories From a Thrilling Marathon Finish","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article recounts the dramatic finish of the 1983 New York City Marathon, where Rod Dixon passed Geoff Smith just before the finish line, causing Smith to fall and become the 'guy on the floor' in a famous photograph.

Forty-two years later, we asked them to reflect on what they were thinking.\n\nWhen I crossed the finish line, it was just overwhelming. When I turned to go back to give Geoff a hug, he was gone. I said, “Where did he go?” They said, “Oh, they took him up to medical.”\n\nEverybody thinks I collapsed after I crossed the finish line. I didn’t collapse. I laid myself down. It was my first marathon, and I’d never felt that kind of physical stress before. It didn’t stop me from going to Studio 54 that night.\n\nRod Dixon That morning, they had a limousine to bring the elite athletes to the race. But I took the public bus instead. I had my splits written on my fingers, and I was just really focused on racing the race I had planned for.\n\nGeoff Smith Going into the race, nobody was paying any attention to me. Slowly, I began passing people. And just after the halfway mark, I took the lead.\n\nRod Dixon I was in second, but I was way, way behind Geoff.\n\nGeoff Smith By the time I got into Central Park, I felt a bit of cramp. Tiredness was creeping in. Just before Mile 26, I took the turn to head to the finish line, still thinking I’m going to win. I had no idea that Dixon was closing in.\n\nRod Dixon I couldn’t really see Geoff until we got into Central Park. He was following the blue line in the middle of the road. The ideal, when you’re running curves, is to run the tangents. You save distance. I realized that by cutting three or four yards per corner, I was going to save myself 20 seconds. I wasn’t running any faster, but I started to gain on him.\n\nGeoff Smith All the other races I’d run in Central Park, you had to stay inside the blue line, in the bike lane. So my mind just went to “I’ve got to stay inside the blue line.”\n\nI’m 99 percent certain that’s me. I volunteered on the finish line that year. I do remember that I had had coffee with Rod sometime before. I was a course measurer, and when we measured a course, we cut all the tangents. I told him, “I don’t think anybody can run the courses the way we measure them.” Rod said, “I can.” And then I watched him run through Central Park, the most undulating part of the course. And he was cutting the tangents.\n\nGeoff Smith At the 26-mile mark, 385 yards to the finish, Rod passes me. All that went through my head was: “Shit.”\n\nRod Dixon As I passed Geoff, I increased my pace so that he would think he couldn’t catch me. And there was the finish line.\n\nGeoff Smith I was pretty levelheaded about it. You’re not going to win every race. It was a great spectacle.\n\nRod Dixon I’ve won world cross-country and Olympic  medals, but that New York City Marathon is the defining moment for me. Geoff and I have a connection that will last for our lifetime. And of course, he went on to win the Boston Marathon twice.\n\nGeoff Smith Rod and I are good friends now, and we always laugh about the finish. I went into the New York Road Runners Club years ago, and they had that picture on their wall. I said to the receptionist, “I’m in that picture.” And he said, “Are you Rod Dixon?” “No,” I said. “I’m the guy on the floor.”\n\nPhoto credits: Keith Meyers/The New York Times (Main photo); Rod Dixon (Tatsiana Chypsanava for The New York Times); Geoff Smith (Jillian Freyer for The New York Times).\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn09r01k9yqo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"08:26:53.284+00:00","title":"Why Katy Perry and Justin Trudeau just might work","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the unexpected romance between Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and American pop star Katy Perry, highlighting how their relationship serves as a strategic rebranding effort after both have faced significant reputational challenges.

And their budding romance is not entirely unprecedented in Canadian political history.\n\nThe pairing also allows them to change the conversation after a year in which both have faced hits to their reputations.\n\nThe relationship is a \"rebranding for both of them in a very interesting and unexpected way\", says Jose Rodriguez, a professor of communication studies at California State University Long Beach.\n\nPartnering with a statesman creates a credible bridge for Perry into civic and philanthropic endeavours, he adds. It expands her audience and access to a politically engaged public, and global organisations outside the music industry.\n\nFor Trudeau, 53, the California Girls singer helps his new persona because she is in \"a softer arena\", Mr Rodriguez says, rather than the tough world of politics.\n\nAt the core of it is simple human connection, too, observers note. Both are newly single - Trudeau and his wife separated in 2023 - and this is the first post-split high-profile romance for both.\n\nThe romance rumours between them began swirling in late July, when the two were spotted having dinner together at Le Violon, a swanky restaurant in the heart of Montreal.\n\nTwo days later, Trudeau was spotted attending Perry's show in the city, singing along to her hits Firework and Teenage Dream.\n\nThen, in mid-October, images of them kissing aboard Perry's yacht off the coast of Santa Barbara, California, went viral.\n\nNeither Trudeau nor Perry have publicly spoken about their romance. Their representatives did not respond to the BBC's requests for comments. But before the weekend photos landed, the singer appeared to hint at the relationship during a London tour stop last month.\n\nA fan in the audience proposed to her shortly after photos of her and Trudeau canoodling surfaced.\n\n\"You know, you really should have asked me about 48 hours ago,\" Perry responded.\n\nEven though many may not have seen it coming, observers say their getting together helps serve their individual public images.\n\nAfter becoming a global progressive icon when he was catapulted into Canada's highest office in 2015, Trudeau was forced to resign earlier this year after his popularity plummeted.\n\nDespite winning a sweeping majority a decade ago - promising \"sunny ways\" domestically while being admired for his youthful charm abroad - it did not take long for scandals to tarnish his image.\n\nA series of luxury vacations drew criticism for being tone-deaf - including one trip to the private island of the Aga Khan in the Bahamas, which was found to have violated federal conflict-of-interest laws. Trudeau then faced another controversy in 2019 after old photos of him in blackface surfaced, forcing him to issue a public apology.\n\nBy the end of his tenure, Canadians had grown frustrated with his leadership and were ready to move on.\n\nPerry has similarly faced a crop of undesirable headlines after riding high for years.\n\nThe singer was enjoying the height of pop stardom in the 2010s, churning out consistent hits, and her bold, colourful style helped define pop culture. In 2018, Billboard magazine named her one of the greatest popstars of the 21st Century.\n\nBut scandal found her, too. Her newest album, 143, was panned by critics as her worst artistic effort to date. The Guardian called it \"some way short of a total catastrophe\", while the Telegraph called it \"disastrous\".\n\nAnd earlier this year, she was mocked for taking part in an all-woman Blue Origin space flight with billionaire Jeff Bezos' wife Lauren Sanchez and CBS anchor Gayle King. Perry acknowledged the criticism in April, saying \"I'm not perfect\" but that \"the internet is very much a dumping ground for the unhinged and unhealed\".\n\nThen came the split between her and Bloom, who she was with after her marriage to comedian Russell Brand fell apart in 2011.\n\n\"When you're in the middle of an unfortunate storyline, the best thing you can do is move onto a different storyline,\" notes Los Angeles Times pop music critic Mikael Wood.\n\nThe relationship with Trudeau \"changes the subject from a flop album and from a tour that seemed a little thirsty and misguided, and makes us talk about something else\".\n\nThe measured roll-out of the relationship also seemed to ease observers into the romance.\n\nProf Rodriguez notes that the optics of them appearing together in Paris was \"a high signal, low speech confirmation\" of their affection that allowed the visuals to do the work.\n\n\"Each has weathered scrutiny, so a carefully staged relationship narrative can re-index attention around vitality, optimism and cross-domain relevance.\"\n\nThe pair do have things in common.\n\nPerry and Trudeau are ideologically aligned, LA-based music writer Gerrick Kennedy observes, being \"anti-establishment\" disruptors in their respective fields.\n\nPerry herself is no stranger to activism and politics, having performed at multiple campaign events in 2016 for Democratic US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, and publicly endorsed Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.\n\nShe is a vocal advocate for LGBTQ rights and has supported various feminist charities and causes - issues that Trudeau had also publicly backed (he famously made gender-parity in cabinet central to his policy).\n\nThey also each appear to be dedicated parents to their young children. Perry's four-year-old daughter, Daisy, features frequently on her Instagram. Trudeau's Instagram shows he spent the summer taking each of his three children on separate holidays.\n\nBy dating Perry, Trudeau is charting a different path post-politics than his predecessors, who often assume high-level consulting gigs or join law firms.\n\nIt is, however, on-brand for a prime minister who was always unusual, says Michael Mulvey, a marketing professor at the University of Ottawa.\n\nAs the son of another former prime minister, Pierre Eliott Trudeau, he grew up in the spotlight. One of the earliest photos of him is of an infant Justin being held by former US First Lady Pat Nixon.\n\nAfter the separation from his wife, the youngest Trudeau could not escape the inevitable comparisons to his father, who also separated from his first wife and the mother of his children, Margaret, while in office.\n\nThe senior Trudeau had his own famous flings, namely with American singer Barbra Streisand and Canadian actress Kim Cattrall, of Sex and the City fame.\n\n\"There's no question that we see history repeating itself,\" says Jonathan Malloy, a professor of political science at Carleton University in Ottawa.\n\nBut Prof Mulvey notes that there are others who connect with his human experience of being a newly single dad.\n\nNot long after his exit from politics, Trudeau posted a photo of himself buying kitchenware, which commentators took as him signalling the start of his \"divorced dad era\".\n\n\"There are probably some people that hope he gets it together, has a cooling off period from the post-divorce trauma and gets on with his life,\" Prof Mulvey says."},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/31/world/americas/hurricane-melissa-jamaica-flooding.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"12:44:14-04:00","title":"In a Jamaican Town, Melissa Leaves Floods ‘Infested’ by Dead Livestock","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes ever recorded, caused devastating floods and structural damage across Jamaica and Haiti.

2025-10-31T12:44:14-04:00\n\nIsaiah Beck, a carpenter, was trying to reach his storm-battered house in the New River community in St. Elizabeth parish, on Jamaica’s storm-battered southwestern coast. His home was on the other side of a large pool of chest-high water.\n\nBut he thought better of it when he saw the dead livestock.\n\n“There is a dead cow and hog; the water is starting to get infested,” he said. “The water is coming from all sides.”\n\nThree days after Hurricane Melissa roared across Jamaica, many people in communities stricken by the powerful storm find themselves trapped by floodwaters that keep rising, apparently because of a drainage system that had become blocked.\n\nThe hurricane, one of the strongest ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean, ripped through several island nations, leaving behind death and widespread destruction.\n\nAt least 19 people were killed in Jamaica, and at least 30, including children, in Haiti, officials said. Jamaican officials said they expected the death toll to climb as the authorities reached and searched through the worst hit areas.\n\nThe Jamaican authorities would be “all-hands on deck” to help the country recover from “unimaginable” devastation, the country’s information minister, Dana Morris Dixon, said at a news conference.\n\nIn New River, where there was still no power on Friday, residents said they thought the worst of the storm was behind them — until the water started coming. Water began seeping into people’s homes two days ago and started rising considerably again on Friday, residents said.\n\nAt the height of the storm, one person said, the wind kept peeling the roofs off homes, forcing people to run from house to house in search of safe shelter.\n\nBefore the storm, Mr. Beck said, he had been boarding up windows at a local infirmary, and ended up riding out the storm there.\n\nWhen he was able to get back to his home, he said, the roof had been torn off.\n\n“My house is rubbish,” Mr. Beck said.\n\nReginald Campbell, 64, dragged cushions and mattresses into the sunlight from his flooded house.\n\n“I am trying to get some sun on it because it is starting to stink,” he shouted from his porch, which was surrounded by water.\n\nMr. Campbell said the blocked drainage system was causing the water to keep rising.\n\n“We are anxious,” he said.\n\nElsewhere, a man with a chain saw tackled a palm tree that had fallen across his front yard. He climbed another tree that had power lines draped across it, trying to cut it down.\n\nAbout 2,000 feet down the road, drone footage of the area showed the dead cow and pig that had given Mr. Beck pause. People in houses with roofs torn off peeked through windows in homes surrounded by water. Those with a bit of exposed land had scattered their belongings outside to try to dry them in the sun.\n\nTwo little boys, one barefoot and both shirtless, walked down the street carrying their belongings in plastic bags on their heads. They reached a large pool of water and debated going further.\n\nThey waded through the knee-high water.\n\nWeston Brown, who works as an embalmer for funeral homes, drove to check the conditions at the Bailey Parlor funeral home, which had part of its roof torn off.\n\nMr. Brown was certain that the death toll would rise, as the authorities received more and more reports of bodies deteriorating inside homes.\n\n“We are going to have more people dying,” he said. “People are going to start dying from hunger.”\n\nEmiliano Rodríguez Mega contributed reporting from Mexico City.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/01/us/politics/shutdowns-obamacare-republicans-democrats.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"05:02:09-04:00","title":"Shutdowns, Obamacare and the Risks of Bargaining for Policy Wins in a Crisis","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article examines the current government shutdown and its connection to the Affordable Care Act, drawing a sharp contrast with the 2013 shutdown where Republicans attempted to defund Obamacare through a 16-day closure, ultimately failing.

Crisis\n\nPublished: 2025-11-01T05:02:09-04:00\n\nThe last time Obamacare was at the center of a federal shutdown, with lawmakers seeking to use the leverage of a government funding deadline to get their way on the health insurance program, it did not end well for them.\n\nIt was 2013, and conservative Republicans in the House and Senate pushed their leaders to block legislation to extend government spending unless it also repealed the Affordable Care Act. The result was a 16-day shutdown that produced no changes to the sweeping law.\n\nWhile some of the characters are the same, the dynamic of today’s shutdown is the complete opposite. This time, it is Democrats using their leverage to try to fortify Obamacare by extending tax credits for rising premiums, while Republicans assail them for the hardships mounting from the cutoff of government services.\n\nThe 2013 case ended as a debacle for Republicans as they tried and failed to kill President Barack Obama’s signature legislative achievement while Democrats controlled the Senate. It was never going to happen.\n\nWhether Democrats can be more successful this time around facing off against Republicans who have long targeted Obamacare remains to be seen. But trying to force policy changes through shutdown politics has not been fruitful in the past.\n\n“We shut down the government for 35 days to build the wall, and it didn’t get the wall built,” said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, ruefully recalling an unsuccessful shutdown that began at the end of 2018 and went on to become the longest-ever government closure, a distinction that could be lost next week. “We tried to repeal Obamacare by shutting down the government. Shutting down the government to get a policy never works for anybody.”\n\nDemocrats say the outcome could be different this year, because they are trying to preserve a benefit for Americans rather than strip one away, as Republicans were trying to do in 2013. They have been buoyed by polls showing that more Americans blame Republicans than Democrats for the current closure, and that the health care subsidies are overwhelmingly popular. They have also so far defied G.O.P. expectations that they would fold.\n\n“One of the reasons this is having such resonance and we are showing such unity is because we are asking for what people really want and need, and all of a sudden it is being taken away from them,” Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, said of the health insurance subsidies. “It is different from the issue of 2013.”\n\nUnlike more recent shutdowns that have materialized suddenly when negotiations over spending broke down, the 2013 disruption came at the end of an extended conservative campaign to “defund” Obamacare, even though Mr. Obama was still in the White House and would have had to sign off on any such move.\n\nThat summer, Republicans began clamoring for members of their party to hold firm against any government funding unless it included a repeal of the health law before its implementation date of Jan. 1, 2014.\n\n“We have a chance to stop this, and it may be our last best chance,” Marco Rubio, then a Republican senator from Florida, said in July 2013. “And it comes in September, when we have to pass a short-term budget in this chamber.”\n\nSenators Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah, both Republicans, enthusiastically joined in the effort with the full-throated backing of right-wing conservative advocacy groups. The fight against Obamacare was on.\n\nThere was just one small problem. Many other Republicans believed the anti-Obamacare campaign was badly misguided and doomed to fail. Senator Richard Burr, Republican of North Carolina and a close ally of Speaker John A. Boehner, labeled it “the dumbest idea I have ever heard of.” Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, had already coined the memorable name “wacko birds” to describe colleagues he believed were initiating what he saw as quixotic, publicity-seeking campaigns.\n\nSenator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada and the majority leader, urged Republicans to study who had won previous showdowns before getting too deep into another one.\n\n“I would suggest any of my Republican colleagues who has this idea, give a call to Newt Gingrich,” he said, naming the former House speaker who had engaged in damaging shutdown politics over Medicare during the Clinton administration. “It was disastrous for Newt Gingrich, the Republicans and the country.”\n\nAs the end of the fiscal year approached with no agreement, Mr. Cruz, then a first-term senator, took to the floor for a 21-hour speech against Obamacare in which he famously read the children’s book “Green Eggs and Ham.” Mr. Cruz rallied House Republicans, who held the majority, to hold the line against the Affordable Care Act even though many of his own colleagues in the Senate were opposed to the approach.\n\nWith House Republicans sticking by their demand to strip Obamacare funding from a short-term spending bill against bipartisan Senate opposition, the government closed on Oct. 1 for 16 frantic days. There was much more activity to try and resolve the impasse compared to this year’s shutdown, with the House still absent.\n\nRepublicans finally threw in the towel on Oct. 16 as they licked their wounds, and the recriminations ensued. The fight elevated Mr. Cruz in conservative circles but also earned him the enmity of Republicans who believed he had gotten them into a no-win situation.\n\nMr. Boehner years later lampooned him as “Lucifer in the flesh.” Republicans also bemoaned the fact that the shutdown repercussions had blunted some of the political fallout for Democrats from the disastrous rollout of the Obamacare website.\n\nYears later, Obamacare is again the central issue as the current shutdown extends well beyond the length of the 2013 episode, and barrels toward eclipsing the 2019 closure. Republicans say they are open to negotiating a fix for the expiring health care subsidies, but only after Democrats vote to reopen the government — a step they have so far refused to take.\n\nAs the Senate left town Thursday for the weekend, the shutdown vibe had shifted. More lawmakers in both parties were suggesting that an opening existed to resolve the fight in the days ahead, spurred by federal nutrition programs potentially running out of money and the Trump administration refusing to spend contingency funds to maintain the benefits. A federal judge ordered the administration on Friday to continue paying for food stamps during the shutdown.\n\nSenators said that talks among small “gangs” of lawmakers trying to find a way out of the shutdown would continue through the weekend, as they braced for a breakthrough.\n\nElections around the country on Tuesday were also considered a factor, with Democrats favored to post victories. Such wins could allow them to declare that the voters were behind them, and that they had successfully put the focus on rising health care costs and forced Republicans to confront the issue.\n\nThat would represent at least the chance to claim some measure of victory out of the costly and disruptive shutdown — certainly a better outcome than Republicans faced in 2013.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/31/us/politics/usha-jd-vance-christianity-religion-hindu.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"17:07:00-04:00","title":"Vance Says He Hopes His Wife Embraces Christianity, Setting Off Backlash","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Vice President JD Vance sparked significant backlash by expressing hope that his wife, Usha Vance, would convert from Hinduism to Catholicism during a public event at the University of Mississippi.

Hopes His Wife Embraces Christianity, Setting Off Backlash\n\nPublished: 2025-10-31T17:07:00-04:00\n\nVice President JD Vance provoked a broad backlash this week after he said that he hoped that his wife, Usha Vance, who is of Indian heritage and was raised in a Hindu family, would eventually convert to his own Catholic faith.\n\n“Do I hope eventually that she is somehow moved by the same thing that I was moved by in church?” he said during an event at the University of Mississippi on Wednesday, in response to a question from the audience. “Yeah, I honestly do wish that because I believe in the Christian Gospel, and I hope eventually my wife comes to see it the same way.”\n\nThe comments, which were made in front of thousands of students as part of a Turning Point USA event honoring the slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk, were widely reported by news media outlets and quickly criticized on social media.\n\nBeyond partisan salvos, there was also criticism from some Indians and Indian Americans across the political spectrum who said that Mr. Vance was not respecting his wife’s religious decisions. Some also said his remarks suggested that Hinduism was inferior at a time when aggressive immigration enforcement has left many South Asian Americans and people of non-Christian faiths feeling uncertain and afraid of their place in American society.\n\nThe backlash reflected worries by some in the South Asian community over the Trump administration’s immigration policies and its embrace of conservative Christian groups.\n\nSuhag Shukla, executive director of the Hindu American Foundation, described Mr. Vance’s remarks as “basically saying that my wife, this aspect of her is just not enough.”\n\n“If you were any ordinary pastor, then whatever,” said Ms. Shukla, who has been critical of both Democrats and Republicans in the past. “But he’s not the pastor in chief, he’s the vice president wanting to be president.”\n\n“There’s a lot of uncertainty in the community,” Ms. Shukla said. “This just added kind of fuel to those fears.”\n\nOn Friday, Mr. Vance responded to the upswell of criticism. In a reply to a commenter on X who accused him of throwing his wife’s religion “under the bus,” Mr. Vance called the message “disgusting” and full of “anti-Christian bigotry.”\n\nHe also called Mrs. Vance the “most amazing blessing” in his life, noting that he had also said that at the Turning Point event. He said that she had encouraged him to re-engage with his faith and that while he still wished that she would convert, he would “continue to love and support her” regardless.\n\nIt is not unusual for people in interfaith relationships, and especially for Christians across denominations, to hope for their partners to convert. And the Roman Catholic Church teaches that baptism is required for salvation.\n\nRaised in a loosely evangelical family, Mr. Vance has described himself as going through an “angry, atheist phase” before later converting to Catholicism. Mr. Vance’s embrace of the Catholic faith is evident in his politics, as seen through his frequent emphasis on traditional family principles, social conservatism and economic populism.\n\nMrs. Vance, who was born and raised in Southern California by parents who immigrated from India, has spoken about growing up in a religious Hindu household. The couple, who first met when they were studying at Yale Law School, have spoken publicly before about her role in Mr. Vance’s conversion and their approach to raising their three children in an intercultural and interfaith household.\n\nIn a June interview on Meghan McCain’s podcast, Mrs. Vance said that while the children went to Catholic school, they could choose whether they wanted to be baptized.\n\n“The kids know that I’m not Catholic, and they have plenty of access to the Hindu tradition from books that we give them, to things that we show them, to the visit recently to India and some of the religious elements of that visit,” she said. “So it is a part of their lives and they know many practicing Hindus as a part of their lives in their own family.”\n\nThese family issues, though, can take on a different valence when placed within a broader political and historical context.\n\nThere is a sensitivity in India to proselytizing by non-Hindus because of the long history of Muslim rule and Christian missionary work.\n\nMr. Vance’s comments also appeared to have struck a nerve at a time when rhetoric against immigrants has been growing. An August report from Stop AAPI Hate, a coalition that tracks acts of violence against Asian Americans, documented recent spikes in online hate rhetoric against South Asians related mainly to the mayoral run of Zohran Mamdani and the ongoing debate around H-1B visas.\n\nEarlier this month, a City Council member in Palm Bay, Fla., was censured over a series of social media messages in which he disparaged Indians as coming to the United States to “drain our pockets” and called for them to be deported en masse. The member, Chandler Langevin, is now suing the city of Palm Bay saying that the censure restrictions violated his First Amendment right to free speech.\n\nSangay Mishra, an associate professor at Drew University and the author of “Desis Divided: The Political Lives of South Asian Americans,” said that Mr. Vance’s comments may have come from a deeply personal place, but they were interpreted by some as effectively “nodding to these larger politics of anti-immigration, anti-migrants, anti-replacement theory and white Christian nationalism.”\n\nNot all Indian Americans were bothered by Mr. Vance’s comments.\n\nRami Reddy Mutyala is chairman of Shri Mandir, a Hindu temple in San Diego that Mrs. Vance’s parents occasionally attend. Even though he is a Republican, he said that he disapproved of President Trump, who he said was acting like a “monarch.”\n\nBut he saw nothing wrong with the vice president’s remarks.\n\n“They are adults, they can decide whatever is good for them,” he said. “We cannot force anybody — even I cannot force my children to convert to Hinduism.”\n\nElizabeth Dias contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/10/28/us/wildfire-smoke-firefighter-deaths.html","dateOfPublication":"0000-01-01","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00-07:00","title":"12 Hours in the Smoke","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article investigates the dangerous health risks faced by wildfire fighters in the U.S., focusing on the Green fire in Northern California.

still dying.\n\nIt’s July and the Green fire is tearing through Northern California. An elite federal firefighting crew called the La Grande Hotshots has been sent to help. The 24-person crew has been working for days on the front lines, where invisible toxins hide in the thick haze.\n\nMore than 1,000 firefighters are on the fire. Several crews, including the La Grande Hotshots, are trying to contain the flames by building a trench of bare earth that will stretch from a road to a river bank. They’re doing this at night, in hopes that the cooler air will tamp down the smoke.\n\nThe crew knows that they’re risking their health.\n\nOne longtime member died last year after being diagnosed at 40 with brain cancer. A former crew leader is being treated for both leukemia and lymphoma diagnosed in his 40s. Another colleague was recently told that he has the lungs of a lifelong chain-smoker.\n\nWildfire fighters nationwide are getting sick and dying at young ages, The New York Times has reported. The federal government acknowledges that the job is linked to lung disease, heart damage and more than a dozen kinds of cancer.\n\nCasey Budlong, a La Grande Hotshot, died of cancer in 2024 after fighting fires for two decades. He left behind an 8-year-old son.\n\nBut the U.S. Forest Service, which employs thousands of firefighters, has for decades ignored recommendations from its own scientists to monitor the conditions at the fire line and limit shifts when the air becomes unsafe.\n\nTo find out how harmful the air gets on an average-size wildfire, Times reporters brought sensors to the Green fire this summer. We tracked levels of some of the most lethal particles in the air, called PM2.5, which are so tiny that they can enter the bloodstream and cause lasting damage.\n\nReadings above 225.5 micrograms per cubic meter are considered hazardous. On the fire line, levels regularly exceeded 500.\n\nThe fire began on July 1 after a lightning storm passed over the Shasta-Trinity National Forest.\n\nThe fire began on July 1 after a lightning storm passed over the Shasta-Trinity National Forest.\n\nBy July 16, much of the area was shrouded in smoke.\n\nBy July 16, much of the area was shrouded in smoke.\n\nThat afternoon, a bulldozer carved a containment line that firefighters would expand by carefully burning a wide swath around it, depriving the flames of more fuel.\n\nThat afternoon, a bulldozer carved a containment line that firefighters would expand by carefully burning a wide swath around it, depriving the flames of more fuel.\n\nForest Service crews had to hike up a ridge to get to the line.

Visibility was good, and the air didn’t smell smoky. But our monitors showed readings well into hazardous levels.\n\nAround 6 p.m., the La Grande Hotshots started their shift and set off toward the fire line.\n\nCapt. Nick Schramm, a crew leader, assumed the air was reasonably safe. He has done this work for nearly two decades, and like most firefighters, he often has coughing fits after long shifts. But he believes that exposure to hazardous air is unavoidable.\n\n“That’s just the harsh truth,” he said later.\n\nAs climate change makes fire seasons worse, several states have tried to shield outdoor workers from wildfire smoke, which can contain poisons like arsenic, benzene and lead. California now requires employers to monitor air quality during fires, and to provide breaks and masks when the air turns unhealthy.\n\nBut these rules don’t apply on the wildfires themselves, because state agencies and private companies successfully argued that those constraints would get in the way of fighting fires.\n\nUntil recently, federal firefighters weren’t even allowed to wear masks on the job. Masks are now provided, but they are still banned during the most arduous work, closest to the fire. The Forest Service says face coverings could cause heatstroke, though wildland firefighters in other countries regularly use masks without this problem.\n\nAs crews descended the ridge toward the fire line, the levels of toxic particles nearly doubled.\n\nAs crews descended the ridge toward the fire line, the levels of toxic particles nearly doubled.\n\nFirefighters say that during their shifts they worry more about immediate dangers — falling trees, burns, sharp tools — than about smoke exposure. As the La Grande crew hiked down the steep terrain, Lily Barnes, a squad leader, concentrated on keeping her footing.\n\nBack home in the off-season, she sometimes wonders what the smoke is doing to her body, she said in an interview. “Maybe I’ll realize one day I shouldn’t have been doing this work.”\n\nOn the fire line, the La Grande crew waited for conditions to be right to burn away vegetation.

But our readings showed that it was just as hazardous.\n\nThe handbook issued to Forest Service crews has 10 words of guidance for smoke exposure on the fire line: “If needed, rotate resources in and out of smoky areas.” The agency declined to comment for this story, but in the past has told The Times that while exposure cannot be completely eliminated, rotating crews helps limit risk.\n\nIn practice, according to interviews with hundreds of firefighters, workers feel as though they are sent into smoke and then forgotten. Over months of reporting, Times journalists never saw a boss pull a crew back because of exposure.\n\nEven experienced supervisors can’t tell exactly how unhealthy the air is just by looking.\n\nChuy Elguezabal, the La Grande superintendent, says he pulls his crews out of smoke when it becomes impossible for them to work — when they cannot see or breathe, or they are overcome by headaches and coughing fits.\n\nOn the Green fire, he said, the smoke seemed like more of an inconvenience, like the 105-degree daytime heat or the poison oak that had given many of the firefighters weeping sores.\n\nSince the 1990s, Forest Service researchers have suggested giving crews wearable air sensors, but the agency hasn’t done it. Other dangerous workplaces, like coal mines, have long been required to monitor airborne hazards.\n\nA 1999 Forest Service report that recommended wearable air monitors.\n\nOn the Green fire, The Times used a device that weighs as much as a deck of cards and costs about $200.\n\nLast year, firefighters wore the same devices during a small federal research project to measure their exposure. For hours, those readings stayed at 1,000 — as high as the monitors go — according to Zach Kiehl, a consultant who worked on the project.\n\nMr. Kiehl said that ideally, crews would be issued monitors to know when to put on masks or pull back from a smoky area. “You can pay now and prevent future cases, or pay out later when a person is losing a husband or a father,” he said.\n\nThe La Grande crew has been working in heavy smoke for hours now. They spray water to make sure the fire doesn’t reach the treetops, where it can’t be contained.\n\nThe La Grande crew has been working in heavy smoke for hours now.

They think the exposure was fleeting.\n\nIn fact, the monitors show, the air was never safe.\n\nTo measure particulate concentrations at the Green fire, The Times followed U.S. Forest Service crews and carried two Atmotube PRO sensors. These portable, inexpensive monitors are the same as those the Forest Service has tested in the field.\n\nWe consulted with Dr. Aishah Shittu, an environmental health scientist, and Dr. Jim McQuaid, an atmospheric scientist, both from the University of Leeds. They are co-authors of a study showing that Atmotube Pro sensors demonstrated good performance for measuring fine particulate matter concentrations despite being a fraction of the size of reference-grade models. We also developed our approach in consultation with experts from the Interior Department and the Forest Service.\n\nOn the Green fire, the sensors recorded minute-by-minute averages of airborne particles that are 2.5 micrometers in diameter or smaller. The Times then matched these readings with time stamps and locations from a satellite-enabled GPS watch.\n\nGenerally, the harm associated with PM2.5 levels is calculated based on a 24-hour average. Here, for near-real-time monitoring on the fire line, we followed the guidance of Drs. Shittu and McQuaid by first averaging the readings from the two sensors and then calculating a 15-minute rolling average.\n\nUsing those figures, we categorized the health risks of PM2.5 exposure according to standards set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. We used standards meant for the public because there are no federal occupational standards for wildfire smoke exposure.\n\nAfter averaging, our data had a correlation coefficient of 0.98 and a mean coefficient of variation between the two sensors of 7.5 percent. The E.P.A. recommends that PM2.5 air measurements have a correlation coefficient of at least 0.7 and a mean coefficient of variation less than 30 percent. Our correlation and variance measures gave us confidence that the sensors were largely in agreement.\n\nThe 3-D base map in this article uses Google’s Photorealistic 3D Tiles, which draw from the following sources to create the tiles: Google; Airbus; Landsat / Copernicus; Data SIO, NOAA, U.S. Navy, NGA, GEBCO; IBCAO.\n\nAdditional reporting by Max Whittaker and Lauren McCarthy.

Time\n\nPublished: 2025-11-01T06:19:38-04:00\n\nThe hour between dog and wolf, or “l’heure entre chien et loup,” if you prefer, is, I think you’ll agree, the dreamiest way to refer to twilight. (I will entertain arguments for “the gloaming” and “the violet hour,” but I don’t suspect litigants will get very far.) It’s that time just after sunset when the atmosphere is still partly illuminated by the sun, when the light is ambiguous and the sky can’t choose between blue and black. Night hasn’t yet fully fallen and we are in the borderland between day and dark. One might be forgiven, in this threshold moment, for mistaking a dog for a wolf, for mistaking safety for danger, for feeling slightly off.\n\nDaylight saving time ends tomorrow. That first Sunday in November is a full day suspended between dog and wolf. We’re still grasping at the corn-silk tendrils of summer just as winter gets more insistent. An undertide of confusion persists: Evening car accidents increase, circadian rhythms reset, the moon’s out before dinner. That space in between is strange and destabilizing until we get used to it.\n\nEach year I assume there’s a wolf hiding in the earlier sunsets, that there’s a certain sorrow implicit when daylight decreases. The dog days are literally and metaphorically over. In the northeast U.S., spring and summer are seasons you can pet. Fall and winter have fangs.\n\nNot everyone feels this. I always consult my friend Leigh at this time of year to try to catch some of her glee. “License to hunker!” she nearly bellowed at me when I reminded her we change the clocks tomorrow. “Sorry, it’s 4:30, I can’t do anything more today. Time to have a drink and watch your shows!” I love her delirium, and I want to borrow some of it to wear like a shawl until spring.\n\nThe ancient Greeks experienced time in two ways. Chronos was the clock time that governs our lives, bedtime and estimated departure time, the hour gained or lost. Kairos referred to a more figurative measure of time — the right time, the moment of opportunity, the sacred window for action. In order to recognize kairos, we have to be aware, awake, present. Madeleine L’Engle wrote: “The child at play, the painter at his easel, Serkin playing the Appassionata are in kairos. The saint in prayer, friends around the dinner table, the mother reaching out her arms for her newborn baby are in kairos.”\n\nWhen I think about the mystical possibilities of kairos, it seems mundane, boring, uncreative to be blue about a lost chronological hour. In any season, there is kairos. These moments of possibility, of serendipity, arrive in all seasons, but we have to be awake to seize them. The stillness of the colder, darker months — that license to hunker — is a time to slow down and observe. What windows of luck and chance and coincidence emerge when we’re a little quieter, a little more observant? I’ll be observing the sun setting an hour earlier tomorrow, wondering about kairos, those moments of opportunity in the offing that the clock and the calendar can’t touch.\n\nGovernment Shutdown\n\nA judge ordered the Trump administration to continue paying for food stamps during the shutdown. The program had been set to run out of funds today.\n\nInsufficient staffing at air traffic control facilities set off a second day of widespread delays at airports, including those serving New York City.\n\nTrump has urged Senate Republicans to eliminate the filibuster so they can end the shutdown, though some worry that doing so could backfire.\n\nMore on Politics\n\nOhio became the latest state to redraw its congressional map. The changes could help Republicans pick up two more seats in next year’s midterm elections.\n\nVice President JD Vance said that he hopes his wife, Usha Vance, who was raised in a Hindu family, will eventually convert to Catholicism. He faced quick backlash on social media.\n\nThere’s a growing divide among Republicans over trade: Some in the party oppose Trump’s plan to import beef from Argentina, and senators voted three times this week to end the president’s power to enforce sweeping tariffs.\n\nOther Big Stories\n\nJamaica raised its death toll from Hurricane Melissa to 19 people, and officials expect that number climb as the worst-hit areas are searched.\n\nOpenAI has used complex and circular deals to fuel its multibillion-dollar rise. These charts show how.\n\nA.I. is making death threats more realistic, enabling online harassers to generate images showing their victims in imagined violent situations.\n\nAn 18-karat gold toilet can be yours for $10 million — or whatever the flushable sculpture happens to be worth a few hours before the auction begins next month.\n\nThieves stole more than 1,000 objects from a museum in Oakland, Calif., the city’s police department said.\n\nVacation couldn’t stop Claude Monet, the father of French impressionism, from spending 10-hour workdays at the easel. A lush blockbuster show in Brooklyn helps explain why.\n\nMost museum workers have considered quitting in the past five years, a new survey finds. The industry is vexed by low pay, burnout and “new culture wars.”\n\n“Hedda” stars Tessa Thompson as a stifled newlywed who stirs up mayhem. Our critic calls it “a film for adults that, like its protagonist, doesn’t skimp on brainpower.”\n\n“Little Amélie or the Character of Rain,” an animated film about a young girl in Japan discovering the world, is sweetly humanist with philosophical heft.\n\nNew York City Center usually favors heavy-hitting drama for its annual gala. This time around, though, it’s serving up a feast of cartoonish gore and questionable sex with “Bat Boy: The Musical.”\n\nDaniel Radcliffe is returning to Broadway to star in a solo play called “Every Brilliant Thing.”\n\nSamuel Beckett, who has been dead for 35 years, is having something of a revival right now. That includes “Endgame,” a bleak tragicomedy staged by the Druid theater company.\n\nMore Culture\n\nTwenty-five years after Tim Meadows left “Saturday Night Live,” he’s still regularly popping up on TV screens and delighting new audiences.\n\nSeveral video game revivals this year — in franchises like Double Dragon and Ninja Gaiden — are a throwback to an era when games were much, much harder.\n\nBy Lauren Jackson\n\nThe British singer Lily Allen has released a bombshell divorce album, one that manages to both comprehensively eviscerate an unnamed partner (believed to be her ex-husband, the actor David Harbour) and also actually be good. Our critic called it “irresistible.”\n\nI started listening to the album, “West End Girl,” in a bath the other night, and I didn’t stop until the water got cold. The details were salacious, shocking, unbelievable — it was a royal tour of the wreckage of a marriage, each track a new plot point in a story of sex, lies and discovered texts, some of which she reads aloud.\n\nAllen seems to be suggesting that writing so explicitly, and with such salacious detail, about her own life is “a way of reclaiming her power in her broken relationship,” our critic writes. On the song “Let You W/In,” she sings, “I can walk out with my dignity if I lay my truth on the table.” That she did.\n\nRelated: Allen and Harbour listed their nearly $8 million Brooklyn brownstone recently. That has added to the lore.\n\nBy Melissa Clark\n\nIf you’ve got extra Halloween candy on hand, use it to Nigella Lawson’s sweet and chewy monster cookies. You can fold whatever needs using up into the oat-speckled cookie dough. Chocolate varieties like peppermint patties and peanut butter cups work especially well, getting just a little melty in the oven’s heat. Or use M&Ms or Reese’s Pieces, which add a delightful sugar crunch.\n\nThe Hunt: A senior couple, craving a downtown area with shops and restaurants, set their sights on Portland and Seattle with a $725,000 budget. Which home did they choose? Play our game.\n\nDo it yourself: Painting furniture is trickier than you might think. Here’s a guide.\n\nWhere to eat: Visitors to New York deserve a little treat. Times journalists picked the city’s best snacks.\n\nTravel 101: If you slept in and missed your flight, don’t panic. Here’s how get your trip back on track.\n\nDocGPT: It’s becoming more common to ask A.I. chatbots for medical advice. Experts shared advice for how to do so safely.\n\nLife doesn’t always afford time for slow cooking. For busy parents juggling school drop-offs, college students with a mountain of homework or even experienced home cooks in a rush, a jar of marinara can be a lifeline. And store-bought sauces have come a long way. Nowadays, grocery shelves are replete with a staggering number of promising options, some of which taste convincingly homemade. We taste-tested 41 jars of marinara sauce and found several standouts for your busiest moments — including a thick and tangy sauce for dunking mozzarella sticks and a rustic take that tasted delicious on its own. — Maki Yazawa\n\nLos Angeles Dodgers vs. Toronto Blue Jays, World Series Game 7: Last weekend, this newsletter previewed the World Series as a battle between the Dodgers’ pitching staff, so good at strikeouts, and the Blue Jays’ bats, so good at making contact.\n\nToronto has certainly been hitting the ball. In the games they’ve won, the Jays have scored 11, 6 and 6 runs. And they scored 5 in a loss, the 18-inning classic that was Game 3. Los Angeles’s pitching hasn’t been quite so impressive, but it’s had its moments. The Dodgers’ sometimes-shaky bullpen blanked Toronto for 11 straight innings in Game 3, and Yoshinobu Yamamoto has been a star, throwing a complete game in Game 2 and six sharp innings in last night’s 3-1 win.\n\nGame 7 is tonight at 8 p.m. Eastern on Fox\n\nHere is today’s Spelling Bee. Yesterday’s pangrams were twitching and witching.\n\nTake the news quiz to see how well you followed this week’s headlines.
