\nUpdated: \n        8:05 PM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Every day of the federal government shutdown air traffic controllers calling out sick have caused flight delays, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Friday.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s different every day,” he told reporters at a news conference at Philadelphia International Airport. “The average… is about 5% of our delays come from staffing shortages with air traffic controllers. We’ve gone up as high as 53% of the delays… because of staffing shortages.”\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, 12 air traffic control facilities were short-staffed, including the control towers in Dallas Fort Worth, Newark and Phoenix, TRACONs which handle flights approaching and departing Houston, Newark, Southern California as well as centers, which handle high altitude flights around Albuquerque, Atlanta, Denver and New York.\n \n\n   \n  There have been 222 staffing shortages reported since the start of the shutdown, more than four times the number reported on the same dates last year. Air traffic controllers, like Transportation Security Administration screeners, are required to work during the government shutdown but are not being paid.\n \n\n   \n  “Their paycheck is going to be a big fat zero,” Duffy said. “There’s great frustration. There’s anxiety because as any one of you, you look at the expectation that a paycheck comes in and then you plan for that.”\n \n\n   \n  Controllers, approximately 10,800 federal workers, will receive the first $0 paycheck on October 28. On October 14, they received a partial paycheck, about 90% of the normal total, for hours worked before the shutdown started.\n \n\n   \n  The lapse in government funding makes air travel “less safe,” according to Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, the union which represents controllers.\n \n\n   \n  “As this shutdown continues and air traffic controllers are not paid for the vital work that they do… that leads to an unnecessary distraction, and they cannot be 100% focused on their jobs, which makes this system less safe,” he said. “Every day that this shutdown continues, tomorrow, we’ll be less safe than today.”\n \n\n   \n  Duffy noted the FAA will slow planes down or cancel flights if they cannot be operated safely.\n \n\n   \n  “If we don’t have enough controllers, if we have controllers that are more stressed and less able to do the job… we will reduce the capacity of airplanes taking off and landing, or we will cancel flights,” Duffy said.  “I’m less concerned about you getting there on time. I want you to be safe.”\n \n\n   \n  This week, staffing shortages were also reported in control towers in Austin, Chicago-O’Hare, Nashville, Newark and Reagan National airport, as well as FAA centers in Albuquerque, Cleveland, Denver, Fort Worth, Indianapolis, Los Angeles, Jacksonville, New York and Washington, DC. The facilities in Chicago, Dallas, Detroit, Las Vegas, Philadelphia and Houston that handle flights approaching or departing the area were also short-staffed.\n \n\n   \n  Duffy also warned while future air traffic controllers studying at the FAA academy will be paid for the next couple of weeks, the money will run out soon which would be “cataclysmic” for them.\n \n\n   \n  “Controllers in the academy, and some who have been given spots in the next class of the academy are bailing. They’re walking away,” he said. “They’re asking themselves why do I want to go into a profession where I could work hard and have the potential of not being paid for my services.”\n \n\n   \n  The nation needs about 3,000 more air traffic controllers, and the increased enrollment at the academy is part of the agency’s effort to “supercharge” hiring.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/europe/dahbia-benkired-sentencing-murder-france-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"19:51:00Z","title":"Woman in France Sentenced to Life in Prison for Rape, Torture and Murder of 12-Year-Old Girl in Paris","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 27-year-old Algerian woman, Dahbia Benkired, was sentenced to life in prison without parole for the rape, torture, and murder of 12-year-old girl Lola Daviet in Paris in October 2022.

The US Treasury Department announced on Friday that it is sanctioning Colombian President  Gustavo Petro , accusing him of playing a  “ role in the global illicit drug trade.” Also sanctioned are Petro’s wife and son, and Colombia’s interior minister.\n \n\n   \n  “Since President Gustavo Petro came to power, cocaine production in Colombia has exploded to the highest rate in decades, flooding the United States and poisoning Americans,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Petro, who has previously rejected such accusations, swiftly responded to the announcement, saying on X   that he had retained an American lawyer and intended to fight the sanctions.\n \n\n   \n  “Fighting drug trafficking for decades — and doing so effectively — has brought me this measure from the government of the very society we helped so much to curb its cocaine consumption,” Petro said, referring to the United States. “Quite a paradox, but not one step back, and never on our knees.”\n \n\n   \n  Tensions between Petro’s government and US President Donald Trump have grown for months, especially since the United States began ramping up military activity in the  southern Caribbean .\n \n\n   \n  Petro has sharply criticized US military strikes on alleged drug boats in the region, accusing the United States of being “ murderers .” He has suggested that some of the boats carried innocent Colombians.\n \n\n   \n  At least one US strike in the Caribbean over the past two months  targeted Colombian nationals  on a boat that had sailed from Colombia, two people briefed by the Pentagon told CNN earlier this month. Another strike on a submersible left two survivors, one of whom was  Colombian .   \n \n\n   \n  Elizabeth Dickinson, the International Crisis Group’s senior analyst for Colombia, described the sanctions on Petro as “the personalization of a bilateral crisis.”\n \n\n   \n  On the “day-to-day level and institutional level, there really isn’t a problem between the US and Colombia. Where the problem is this personal crisis, personal conflict,” she told CNN, noting it was not the first time there have been disagreements between Washington and Bogota.\n \n\n   \n  “The Colombian military and security forces have worked hand-in-hand with the United States for close to four decades,” she told CNN. “They are by far the most capable and willing partners that the US has in the region.”\n \n\n   \n  Colombia had long been Washington’s most reliable ally in South America on national security and defense. In 2022, the Biden administration designated the Andean country as a “major non-NATO ally.”\n \n\n   \n  The sanctions were imposed days after Trump said he had halted “all payments” to Colombia, claiming that Petro “does nothing to stop” the production of drugs in his country. The US State Department also revoked Petro’s visa at the conclusion of the UN General Assembly session last month.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the Colombian presidency for further comment.\n \n\n   \n  Colombian Interior Minister Armando Benedetti also criticized the sanctions in a post on X, writing that he had “never entered the house of even a single drug trafficker.”\n \n\n   \n  “For the US, a non-violent statement is the same as being a drug trafficker,” Benedetti added. “Gringos go home.”\n \n\n   \n  Petro’s son Nicholas, in a post, called the move “political and judicial persecution without precedent” and said that he will “turn to international organizations to defend my rights.”\n \n\n   \n  The US Treasury Department said Nicolas Petro was arrested in Colombia in 2023 “for money laundering and illicit enrichment over allegations that he funneled money received from drug traffickers into Gustavo Petro’s ‘total peace’ efforts and election campaign.” Nicolas Petro pushed back on this, saying the prosecutor had stated that the case has nothing to do with drug trafficking or the presidential campaign.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/politics/usda-contingency-fund-november-snap","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"12:16:00-04:00","title":"Trump administration won’t use contingency fund to pay November food stamp benefits","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During an ongoing federal government shutdown that began on October 1, 2025, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has decided not to use its $6 billion contingency fund to pay Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits in November, citing a lack of appropriation for regular benefits.

\n  By Tami Luhby, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:16 AM EDT, Sat October 25, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US Department of Agriculture says it will not tap into its $6 billion contingency fund to cover food stamp benefits next month if the shutdown continues, according to an agency memo obtained by CNN. That means that roughly 42 million Americans  will not receive critical food assistance  from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, in November, unless the agency shifts its position.\n \n\n   \n  However, when asked whether he would direct USDA to fund food stamps next month, President Donald Trump told reporters late Friday, “Yeah, everybody is going to be in good shape, yep.” The president did not provide specific details.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s comments appear to conflict with the agency’s memo, which stated that “contingency funds are not legally available to cover regular benefits.”\n \n\n   \n  “SNAP contingency funds are only available to supplement regular monthly benefits when amounts have been appropriated for, but are insufficient to cover, benefits,” the memo says. “The contingency fund is not available to support FY 2026 regular benefits, because the appropriation for regular benefits no longer exists.”\n \n\n   \n  Also, states will not be reimbursed if they use their own funds to pay for benefits, according to the memo, which was reported earlier  by Axios .\n \n\n   \n  The loss of the critical safety net program ramps up pressure on Congress to end the federal  government shutdown , which began on October 1, by agreeing to a federal spending package. Democrats have said they will not support a short-term spending bill unless it includes an extension of the enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  Republican lawmakers and officials have blamed the Democrats for the impasse, saying they are harming Americans. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins last week told reporters that food stamps will run dry by the end of the month.\n \n\n   \n  The agency told states earlier this month that there is not enough money to pay full food stamp benefits in November if the lapse in federal funding continues and asked them to hold off on next month’s payments until further notice.\n \n\n   \n  However, Democratic lawmakers and SNAP advocates argue that USDA should – or is even obligated to – use the contingency fund to pay November benefits, which are estimated to cost about $8 billion. And they are urging the agency to tap into other pots of money to cover the difference, as the administration has done for its priorities  like paying troops .\n \n\n   \n  “Secretary Rollins’ claim that the Trump Administration is unable to deliver November SNAP benefits during a shutdown is unequivocally false,”   Sharon Parrott , president of the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and a former Office of Management and Budget official, said in a statement Thursday. “In fact, the Administration is legally required to use contingency reserves — billions of dollars that Congress provided for use when SNAP funding is inadequate that remain available during the shutdown.”\n \n\n   \n  In its shutdown contingency plan, which has been since taken offline, the agency noted that “Congressional intent is evident that SNAP’s operations should continue” and referenced that the contingency plan can be used to fund participant benefits if a lapse occurs in the middle of the fiscal year.\n \n\n   \n  About one in eight Americans receive help buying food through SNAP. A key pillar of the nation’s safety net, the program provides enrollees with an average monthly benefit of $188 per person, as of May.\n \n\n   \n  The food stamp program is the second nutrition assistance lifeline at risk of running out of money amid the ongoing standoff on Capitol Hill.\n \n\n   \n  WIC, which provides food aid to nearly 7 million pregnant women, new moms and young children, was on course to deplete its funding earlier this month. But the Trump administration shifted $300 million in  tariff revenue  that’s typically used to fund child nutrition programs to keep WIC operating. The infusion should be enough to cover benefits for the rest of the month, according to the National WIC Association.\n \n\n   \n  This is not the first time that food stamps have been at risk during a shutdown. During the record-long impasse that began in December 2018, the USDA initially said benefits would run dry at the end of January. But the agency then said it would use a provision allowing it to make obligated payments within 30 days of a government funding lapse to  cover February payments . That workaround ultimately wasn’t needed since the shutdown ended in late January.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Kit Maher contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/25/americas/aircraft-carrier-uss-gerald-ford-profile-intl-hnk-ml","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"13:10:00Z","title":"US Navy’s Most Lethal Combat Platform Sent to Caribbean to Pressure Venezuela Over Drug Trafficking","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The US Navy’s most advanced and largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R Ford, is being deployed to the Caribbean as part of the Trump administration’s increased military pressure on Venezuela over allegations of drug trafficking.

\nUpdated: \n        1:10 AM EDT, Sat October 25, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The aircraft carrier USS Gerald R Ford, billed by the US Navy as “the most capable, adaptable, and lethal combat platform in the world,” is being sent to the Caribbean as the Trump administration ramps up  military pressure on Venezuela  over alleged drug trafficking.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s a look at the Ford and the military assets it will bring to US operations in the region.\n \n\n   \n  With a displacement of more than 100,000 tons and a length of 1,100 feet (334 meters), the Ford is the largest warship the US has ever put to sea.\n \n\n   \n  Commissioned in 2017, it’s the first of its class, the successor to the Navy’s 10 Nimitz-class carriers, the oldest of which will be retired next year.\n \n\n   \n  It carries a crew of almost 4,600, including its air wing. That’s about 20% less personnel than the Nimitz class, which the Navy says is possible because of more efficient systems on the Ford.\n \n\n   \n  Those efficiencies are what make the Ford the most advanced carrier in the world and result from its two nuclear reactors, whose exact specs are classified but that put out three times the electrical power of those on the Nimitz-class ships, according to the Navy.\n \n\n   \n  That extra power enables the Ford to operate the electromagnetic aircraft launch system (EMALS). Using magnets instead of steam to power the ship’s catapults gives the Ford the ability to launch aircraft faster and with heavier weapons and more fuel, increasing the range and lethality of its fighter jets.\n \n\n   \n  The same science applies to its 11 Advanced Weapons Elevators, which use electromagnetic motors rather than hydraulics, meaning it can move munitions more quickly from magazines to the flight deck and loaded onto aircraft.\n \n\n   \n  The ship also boasts the Navy’s Advanced Arresting Gear, the system which essentially grabs the tailhook of aircraft with wires when they touch down on its flight deck. The Navy says the digitally controlled system allows for increased sortie rates and lower energy consumption.\n \n\n   \n  The Ford’s flight deck is about four feet wider than the Nimitz class, and its “island” – the portion of the ship rising above the flight deck – is smaller and set farther back, giving more space for easier handling of aircraft movements.\n \n\n   \n  The sharp teeth of the Ford are the F/A-18 fighter jets in carries.\n \n\n   \n  The twin-engine Boeing aircraft can carry a range of air-to-air, air-to-ground and anti-ship missiles as well as laser-guided bombs. They have a maximum combat range of 1,250 miles (2,011 kilometers), according to the Navy.\n \n\n   \n  The Ford also carries electronic-jamming aircraft, airborne early warning and control planes, cargo and passenger planes and helicopters.\n \n\n   \n  But the Ford doesn’t carry the Navy’s newest stealth fighter jet, the F-35C. Modifications needed to support the fifth-generation aircraft are not expected to be made until a yet-to-be-determined future maintenance period.\n \n\n   \n  Getting the Ford into fighting shape was a struggle for the Navy. Though it was commissioned in 2017, it didn’t make its  first deployment  until 2022 as the service struggled to work out kinks in its advanced systems.\n \n\n   \n  The ship made its  first combat deployment  in 2023, an eight-month cruise that saw it spend time in the eastern Mediterranean after the Hamas-led October 7 attack on Israel.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/europe/hungary-orban-russia-oil-sanctions-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"19:01:00Z","title":"A bad week for Hungary’s strongman leader as Trump-Putin summit scrapped and US sanctions Russia","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orbán had hoped to host a Trump-Putin summit in Budapest, promoting his vision of a neutral, sovereign Hungary bridging Western and Russian powers.

leader as Trump-Putin summit scrapped and US sanctions Russia \n       \n  By Christian Edwards, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:01 PM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orbán was delighted to learn last week that Russia and the United States had chosen his country as the venue for another  summit  on ending the war in Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  Having positioned Hungary – a European Union and NATO member – as an ally of both Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump, Orbán was hoping to show the world that “the road to peace runs through Budapest.”\n \n\n   \n  But his hopes were dashed after the Trump administration abruptly shelved plans for the Budapest summit and on Wednesday unveiled  sanctions  on Russia’s two biggest oil producers – the first since Trump returned to the White House.\n \n\n   \n  Although the sanctions aim to  deplete Russia’s war chest , they could also wreak havoc on Hungary’s economy. Whereas almost all EU countries have diversified their energy mix away from Russia since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Hungary’s dependence has deepened. Along with Slovakia, its fellow antiliberal Central European neighbor, Hungary is almost totally reliant on Russia for its oil imports.\n \n\n   \n  Orbán is now reckoning with the grim consequences of his own energy policy. Alongside Washington’s oil sanctions, the EU on Thursday confirmed it would ban Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports from 2027. Last month, Orbán told Trump that, without Russian energy imports, Hungary’s economy would be brought “to its knees.”\n \n\n   \n  Against what he decries as the bland uniformity of Brussels, Orbán says he stands for “sovereignty” – Hungary’s right to chart its own course within the EU and forge ties with hardline leaders abroad. But Orbán’s quest for sovereignty – spurning EU efforts to diversify its energy supplies – has left his country perilously dependent on one country for fossil fuels.\n \n\n   \n  The double blow of US oil sanctions and the LNG ban comes as Orbán, Europe’s longest-serving prime minister, is struggling to contain Hungary’s surging opposition movement led by Peter Magyar, a former Orbán loyalist-turned-arch-rival. While Orbán had hoped a Trump-Putin summit could shore up his support at home, he now faces a deepening economic crisis that could weaken his hand before a crucial election in the spring.\n \n\n   \n  After Moscow’s all-out invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, EU countries moved to slash Russian energy imports to cut off a major source of the Kremlin’s revenue. However, Brussels gave Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic an exemption from a ban on Russian crude oil, giving them time to reduce their reliance on Russia.\n \n\n   \n  Instead, Hungary and Slovakia used the exemption to deepen their dependence. Hungary increased its Russian crude oil reliance from 61% pre-invasion to 86% in 2024. So far this year, 92% of Hungary’s crude oil imports have been from Russia. Slovakia, meanwhile, is “almost 100% dependent” on supply from Moscow, according to a  report  from the Center for the Study of Democracy (CSD) and the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA).\n \n\n   \n  By May, Hungary and Slovakia’s crude oil purchases had sent the Kremlin 5.4 billion euros ($6.3 billion), the report found, saying this was “the equivalent of the cost of purchasing 1,800 Iskander-M missiles that have been used to destroy Ukrainian infrastructure and kill Ukrainian civilians.”\n \n\n   \n  The crude oil imports flow through the  Druzhba pipeline , which has been repeatedly attacked this summer by Ukrainian drones, in an effort by Kyiv to punish its neighbors for helping to fund Moscow’s war.\n \n\n   \n  The CSD-CREA report said that Hungary could diversify its energy supplies, receiving non-Russian oil through Croatia’s Adria pipeline rather than Druzhba.\n \n\n   \n  But Orbán has shown no sign of changing tack. In an interview with Hungarian state radio Friday, he said his government was “working on how to circumvent” the US sanctions, without providing further details.\n \n\n   \n  Hungary’s intent to find workarounds to the US sanctions could provide the first major test of the Trump administration’s seriousness about enforcing them, said Elina Ribakova, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a think tank based in Washington, DC.\n \n\n   \n  Despite harsh rhetoric towards Russia from US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who said the decision to impose new sanctions on Russia was due to “Putin’s refusal to end this senseless war” in Ukraine, Trump has been less abrasive, saying he hoped the sanctions “won’t be on for long.” The US president also left the door open to the Budapest summit, saying “we’ll do it in the future.”\n \n\n   \n  The success of the sanctions on Russia’s oil majors will depend on how they are enforced, including against a Trump ally like Orbán, Ribakova told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “Which will it be: A friendly Putin-Trump meeting in Hungary, or throwing Hungary’s administration under the bus if they try to evade sanctions?” she said. “I have no idea which way the cards will fall here.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/politics/doj-monitor-polling-sites-california-new-jersey","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"10:27:00-04:00","title":"Justice Department to monitor polling sites in six counties in California and New Jersey","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Justice Department has announced it will monitor polling sites in six counties—Kern, Riverside, Fresno, Orange, Los Angeles, and Passaic County—in California and New Jersey ahead of the November 4 elections.

in six counties in California and New Jersey \n       \n  By Kaanita Iyer, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:27 PM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Justice Department  announced  Friday it will monitor polling sites in six counties in California and New Jersey ahead of  November 4 elections , as voters prepare to cast their ballots in less than two weeks.\n \n\n   \n  The department said the move, which focuses on two Democratic-led states, will “ensure transparency, ballot security, and compliance with federal law.”\n \n\n   \n  “Transparency at the polls translates into faith in the electoral process, and this Department of Justice is committed to upholding the highest standards of election integrity,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  The practice of sending federal election monitors to local jurisdictions dates back decades, though President Donald Trump has tried to  assert new authority  over elections.\n \n\n   \n  Friday’s move comes after the Republican parties of California and New Jersey both sent letters to the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division requesting monitors in certain counties and alleging election irregularities.\n \n\n   \n  Nearly five years after the 2020 election, the debunked conspiracy that Trump was robbed of the election due to massive voter fraud is still embraced by many in the Republican Party.\n \n\n   \n  Justice Department officials will now be sent to Passaic County in New Jersey and the following counties in California: Kern, Riverside, Fresno, Orange and Los Angeles.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to these counties’ election departments for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Los Angeles County Clerk Dean Logan said in a statement, “The presence of election observers is not unusual and is a standard practice across the country.”\n \n\n   \n  “Federal election monitors, like all election observers, are welcome to view election activities at designated locations to confirm transparency and integrity in the election process,” Logan added. “California has very clear laws and guidelines that support observation and prohibit election interference.”\n \n\n   \n  Fresno County Clerk James Kus told CNN the Justice Department “has not contacted” him about the monitoring.\n \n\n   \n  “The Fresno County Clerk/Registrar of Voters welcomes all observers for our elections,” Kus added. “It is common for us to have local, state, federal, and sometimes international observers, watching how we administer elections that are accessible, accurate, secure, and transparent.”\n \n\n   \n  Enedina Chhim, community outreach manager for the Orange County Registrar of Voters, told CNN that the department was notified by the US Attorney’s Office for the Central District of California that two attorneys from that office will be observing elections in the county from November 4 to 7.\n \n\n   \n  “Orange County elections are always transparent,” Chhim added.\n \n\n   \n  Since the president’s return to office, the Trump administration has taken several steps to assert a larger federal role in elections ahead of next year’s midterms.\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department is demanding that  states hand over information  about their voters – including sensitive personal data, such as partial Social Security numbers – as they hunt for examples of fraud.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has also sought to require voters to show proof of citizenship to vote, attempting an end-run around states and Congress. He  recently pledged  to act unilaterally to impose voter identification requirements on states and to end most mail-in voting, which would upend a safe and reliable voting method used by millions of Americans.\n \n\n   \n  The president also  signed an executive order  earlier this year, seeking broad changes in how elections are run, although the Constitution primarily vests states with that power. Parts of the order have been blocked in court.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Marshall Cohen and Fredreka Schouten contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/politics/zohran-mamdani-islam-cuomo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"19:14:00-04:00","title":"Mamdani defends his Islamic faith and slams Cuomo in a tearful speech","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for New York City mayor, delivered a powerful and emotional speech outside a mosque in the Bronx, defending his Islamic faith and personal identity amid accusations from independent candidate Andrew Cuomo that he would cheer at a terror attack.

October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   Zohran Mamdani , the Democratic nominee for New York City mayor, stood outside a mosque Friday and slammed independent candidate Andrew Cuomo for  laughing at the suggestion  Mamdani would cheer a terror attack.\n \n\n   \n  “I will not change who I am, how I eat or the faith that I am proud to call my own,” said Mamdani, who is vying to become the city’s first Muslim mayor.\n \n\n   \n  Flanked by a crowd that included women wearing hijabs, Mamdani teared up as he talked about family members facing anti-Muslim prejudice growing up in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\n \n\n   \n  “I want to speak to the memory of my aunt who stopped taking the subway after September 11 because she did not feel safe in a hijab,” Mamdani said, adding: “I want to speak to the Muslim who works for our city, whether they teach in our schools, or walk the beat for the NYPD.”\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo in recent days has trained a spotlight on Mamdani’s faith and immigrant upbringing, trying to undercut Mamdani with people concerned about his criticisms of Israel and whether he would fight antisemitism.\n \n\n   \n  During an interview Thursday with radio host Sid Rosenberg, Cuomo said, “God forbid, another 9/11. Can you imagine Mamdani in the seat?”\n \n\n   \n  “He’d be cheering,” Rosenberg responded.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo paused and laughed, adding, “That’s another problem.”\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after Mamdani’s speech, Cuomo held his own event with South Asian supporters in Jackson Heights, Queens, where he accused Mamdani of being an “actor.”\n \n\n   \n  “Today he is playing the victim, but in reality, he is the offender,” Cuomo said.\n \n\n   \n  He distanced himself from Thursday’s interaction with Rosenberg: “I can see where if you took it seriously, it was offensive.”\n \n\n   \n  “I didn’t take the remark seriously at the time, and of course I think it’s an offensive comment, period, but it did not come out of my mouth,” Cuomo added. “That is my point.”\n \n\n   \n  Instead, Cuomo accused Mamdani of stoking tensions by espousing antisemitic rhetoric and falsely claiming Mamdani’s campaign had been entirely focused on Israel and Gaza. That’s a notable shift for the former governor, who has repeatedly accused Mamdani of disrespecting Jewish voters with his criticisms of Israel and once served as a lawyer for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n \n\n   \n  “What does Gaza and Israel have to do with running for mayor of the city of New York?” Cuomo said. “Is the mayor a member of the United Nations? Is he part of a negotiating team? Why? Because he wanted to use it for political purposes to divide New Yorkers.”\n \n\n   \n  Also this week, Cuomo’s campaign released an unfinished version of an advertisement, created with artificial intelligence, mocking a 2023 interview with Mamdani in which he eats rice with his hands and talks about Palestinian rights, and featuring images of criminals with a keffiyeh and a Palestinian flag.\n \n\n   \n  A Cuomo spokesperson said the video was inadvertently posted and deleted after five minutes.\n \n\n   \n  The back-and-forth comes on the heels of the final general election debate earlier this week, during which Mamdani and Cuomo traded in-person accusations of antisemitism and bigotry.\n \n\n   \n  “You’re the savior of the Jewish people? You won’t denounce ‘globalize the intifada,’ which means ‘Kill Jews,’” Cuomo said, referencing the controversial phrase that  Mamdani has discouraged using  and noting that hundreds of rabbis had signed a letter criticizing him. “There’s unprecedented fear in New York.”\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani on Friday also criticized Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa for  suggesting during Wednesday’s debate  that Mamdani had praised “global jihad” – which Mamdani denies doing – and incumbent Mayor Eric Adams, who has endorsed Cuomo, for appearing to suggest on Thursday that Mamdani’s election would usher in Islamic extremism to New York.\n \n\n   \n  “I do not want to use this moment to speak to them any further,” Mamdani said. “I want to use this moment to speak to the Muslims of New York City.”\n \n\n   \n  The setting of Mamdani’s speech was quintessentially New York, outside on a Bronx street with the sound of sirens and airplanes in the background as well as a dog that barked through parts of Mamdani’s remarks.\n \n\n   \n  The owner of the dog was a local resident who gave his first name as Robert. He said he was a Cuomo supporter.\n \n\n   \n  “At least my dog is saying what people are saying,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani then went inside the mosque to address congregants. In remarks that could be heard on a loudspeaker outside, he asked members of the audience to raise their hands if their names had ever been mispronounced. He described the final days before the November 4 election as “our last opportunity to show ourselves … our dignity.”\n \n\n   \n  As dozens of men left the service, several stopped at a Mamdani campaign table to register to vote.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/weather/tropical-storm-hurricane-melissa-jamaica-caribbean-track-climate-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"12:22:00-04:00","title":"Jamaica Could Face Days of Hurricane Conditions as Melissa Set to Rapidly Intensify in the Caribbean","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tropical Storm Melissa is rapidly intensifying into a major hurricane in the Caribbean, with potential to reach Category 5 strength, posing a life-threatening danger to Jamaica, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic.

Jamaica and other parts of the Caribbean are staring down what could become a catastrophic, days-long assault of extreme rainfall and damaging winds with a strengthening Tropical Storm Melissa expected to become a major hurricane over some of the hottest ocean water on the planet.\n \n\n   \n  Officials are urging anyone in Melissa’s path to prepare for life-threatening flooding, landslides, power outages and dangerous seas.\n \n\n   \n  Melissa could be the strongest hurricane ever to hit Jamaica. Its rain has already been pounding parts of Haiti and the Dominican Republic for several days, flooding roadways and triggering landslides. At least three deaths have been reported in Haiti due to the storm, two of which were the result of a landslide, the Haitian Civil Protection Agency said in a  statement .\n \n\n   \n  In the Dominican Republic, at least one person has died and more than 1,000 people have evacuated or been displaced as a result of Melissa’s flooding rain, emergency operations officials said at a Friday news conference.\n \n\n   \n  As of Friday night, Melissa was about 180 miles southeast of Kingston, Jamaica, with sustained winds of 65 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center (NHC). The storm is  hardly moving  – drifting at just 3 mph – but is starting to strengthen.\n \n\n   \n  The Meteorological Service of Jamaica has issued a hurricane warning for the country, according to the NHC. Hurricane watches and tropical storm warnings are in effect for southern Haiti, with strong winds set to arrive as soon as Friday night and ramp up over the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  Melissa is expected to become a hurricane by Saturday morning and rapidly intensify into a major hurricane of Category 3 or higher over the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  The NHC forecasts Melissa to peak at a high-end Category 4 hurricane with 155 mph winds Sunday night and Monday as it churns south of Jamaica, but notes “there is a distinct possibility that Melissa could become a Category 5 hurricane.” Category 5 hurricanes have winds of 157 mph or higher.\n \n\n   \n  This explosive strengthening is  happening more often  as the world warms due to fossil fuel pollution. Three of the four Atlantic hurricanes this season underwent  extreme rapid intensification :  Erin ,  Gabrielle  and  Humberto .\n \n\n   \n    Melissa’s extreme threats\n \n\n   \n  Jamaica and Haiti are expected to feel the worst of Melissa’s wrath in the coming days, but surrounding countries cannot let their guards down.\n \n\n   \n  A foot or more of rain is possible in parts of Jamaica, southern Haiti and the southern Dominican Republic through early next week.\n \n\n   \n  “Extensive damage to roads and buildings is expected, potentially isolating communities for an extended period of time,” the hurricane center warned of Haiti on Friday. “This is a life-threatening situation and immediate preparations to protect life and property should be taken.”\n \n\n   \n  Jamaica will not only endure Melissa’s torrential rain, but will also have to contend with days of the storm’s ferocious winds. The nation of nearly 3 million people will likely face tropical storm-force winds late Friday into Saturday, while hurricane-force winds build over the weekend and last into early next week. Downed trees, power outages and structural damage are all possible, though the timing for the strongest winds is still coming into focus.\n \n\n   \n  Officials in the country are already preparing for the worst. All public hospitals have been in “emergency mode” since Thursday evening, according to  Christopher Tufton , Jamaica’s minister of health. This designation halts outpatient and elective procedures and ensures more beds are open for emergencies.\n \n\n   \n  Jamaica’s airports remain open for now, but will likely close within 24 hours of a hurricane warning being issued for the country, according to Daryl Vaz, minister of science, energy, telecommunications and transport.\n \n\n   \n  “I urge Jamaicans to take this weather threat seriously,” Prime Minister Andrew Holness said in a news conference Friday. “You have been given enough notice that (Melissa) is coming and that it could be disastrous, so take all measures to protect yourself.”\n \n\n   \n  After Melissa roars by Jamaica, Cuba is likely to be the next country in the storm’s path. Eastern Cuba could face destructive winds and flooding rain from Melissa by midweek. The Bahamas and Turks and Caicos could also see impacts later in the week.\n \n\n   \n  The United States mainland is not completely out of the woods, but a direct hit looks unlikely. Even so, rough surf and rip currents could spread along the US East Coast next week.\n \n\n   \n    Why Melissa’s forecast is so alarming\n \n\n   \n  As this tricky forecast comes into focus, all signs point to Jamaica being ground zero for what could become one of the most destructive hurricanes of the season.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/asia/thailand-queen-sirikit-dies-hnk-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"10:43:00-04:00","title":"Thailand’s Queen Mother Sirikit Has Died at Age 93","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Queen Mother Sirikit, Thailand's influential royal figure and lifelong advocate for rural development and cultural preservation, died at age 93 in Bangkok.

93 \n       \n  Story by Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:43 PM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  Thailand’s Queen Mother Sirikit, who supervised royal projects to help the rural poor, preserve traditional craft-making and protect the environment, died on Friday. She was 93.\n \n\n   \n  The Royal Household Bureau said she died in a hospital in Bangkok. Since Oct. 17, she had been suffering from a blood infection but despite her medical team’s efforts, her conditions did not improve.\n \n\n   \n  She had been largely absent from public life in recent years due to declining health. Her husband, King Bhumibol Adulyadej,  died in October 2016 .\n \n\n   \n  Photos released by the palace for her 88th birthday showed her son,  King Maha Vajiralongkorn , and other royals visiting the queen mother at Chulalongkorn Hospital, where she was receiving long-term care.\n \n\n   \n  Although overshadowed by her late husband and her son, Sirikit was beloved and influential in her own right.\n \n\n   \n  Her portrait was displayed in homes, offices and public spaces across Thailand and her August 12 birthday was celebrated as Mother’s Day. Her activities ranged from helping Cambodian refugees to saving some of the country’s once-lush forests from destruction.\n \n\n   \n  Yet as the monarchy’s role in society was increasingly scrutinized during Thailand’s last decades of political turbulence, so too was the queen’s part in it.\n \n\n   \n  Stories circulated of her behind-the-scenes influence during upheaval marked by two military takeovers and several rounds of bloody street protests.\n \n\n   \n  And when she publicly attended the funeral of a protester killed during one clash with police, it for many marked her taking a side in the political schism.\n \n\n   \n  Sirikit Kitiyakara was born into a rich, aristocratic family in Bangkok on Aug. 12, 1932, the year absolute monarchy was replaced by a constitutional system. Both of her parents were related to earlier kings of the current Chakri dynasty.\n \n\n   \n  She attended schools in wartime Bangkok, the target of Allied air raids, and after World War II moved with her diplomat father to France where he served as ambassador.\n \n\n   \n  At 16, she met Thailand’s newly  crowned king  in Paris, where she was studying music and languages.\n \n\n   \n  Their friendship blossomed after Bhumibol suffered a near-fatal car accident and she moved to Switzerland, where he was studying, to help care for him. The king courted her with poetry and composed a waltz titled, “I Dream of You.”\n \n\n   \n  The pair married in 1950, and at a coronation ceremony later the same year both vowed to “reign with righteousness for the benefit and happiness of the Siamese (Thai) people.”\n \n\n   \n  The couple had four children: current King Maha Vajiralongkorn, and princesses Ubolratana, Sirindhorn and Chulabhorn.\n \n\n   \n  During their early married life, the Thai royals crisscrossed the world as goodwill ambassadors and forged personal ties with world leaders.\n \n\n   \n  But by the early 1970s, the king and queen were devoting most of their energies to Thailand’s domestic problems, including rural poverty, opium addiction in hill tribes and a communist insurgency.\n \n\n   \n  Each year, the couple traveled around the countryside while also officiating at more than 500 royal, religious and state ceremonies.\n \n\n   \n  The queen who was an impeccable dresser and avid shopper also relished climbing hills and entering squalid villages where older women called her “daughter.”\n \n\n   \n  Thousands raised their problems to her, ranging from marital squabbles to serious diseases, and the queen and her assistants took up many personally.\n \n\n   \n  While some in Bangkok gossiped about her involvement in palace intrigues and her lavish lifestyle, her popularity in the countryside endured.\n \n\n   \n  “Misunderstandings arise between people in rural areas and the rich, so-called civilized people in Bangkok.\n \n\n   \n  People in rural Thailand say they are neglected, and we try to fill that gap by staying with them in remote areas,” she said in an interview with The Associated Press in 1979.\n \n\n   \n  Royal development projects were set up across Thailand, some of them initiated and directly supervised by the queen.\n \n\n   \n  To increase income of poor rural families and preserve dying crafts, the queen in 1976 launched SUPPORT, a foundation which has trained thousands of villagers in silk-weaving, jewelry-making, painting, ceramics and other traditional crafts.\n \n\n   \n  Sometimes dubbed the “Green Queen,” she also set up wildlife breeding centers, “open zoos,” and hatcheries to save endangered sea turtles.\n \n\n   \n  Her Forest Loves Water and Little House in the Forest projects sought to demonstrate the economic gains of preserving forest cover and water sources.\n \n\n   \n  While royalty elsewhere had only ceremonial or symbolic roles, Queen Sirikit believed the monarchy was a vital institution in Thailand.\n \n\n   \n  “There are some in the universities who think the monarchy is obsolete. But I think Thailand needs an understanding monarch,” she said in the 1979 interview. “At the call, ‘The king is coming,’ thousands will gather.\n \n\n   \n  “The mere word king has something magic in it. It is wonderful.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/sport/mlb-game-1-world-series-blue-jays-dodgers","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"12:04:00-04:00","title":"Blue Jays power past Dodgers with monster 6th inning to take Game 1 of the World Series","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Toronto Blue Jays defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers 11-4 in Game 1 of the 2025 World Series, marking their first World Series win since 1992.

CNN\n \n   \n  It’s been 32 years since  Toronto  experienced the thrills of the World Series. And on Friday, the city felt those same shockwaves after the Blue Jays came back to take Game 1 over the Los Angeles Dodgers with a final score of 11-4.\n \n\n   \n  The Jays found themselves in a 2-0 hole heading into the bottom of the fourth inning, as the Dodgers looked well on their way to their fourth straight series-opening win this postseason.\n \n\n   \n  But with one Dalton Varsho swing, Toronto found themselves tied with the Dodgers, and the rest was history.\n \n\n   \n  A nine-run onslaught in the bottom of the sixth inning made the difference for Toronto in front of their home fans at a loud and energized Rogers Centre.\n \n\n   \n  Blue Jays utility player Ernie Clement atoned for an early base running mistake with a go-ahead RBI single in the sixth inning to get the scoring started.\n \n\n   \n  The Jays tacked on two more runs before Addison Barger hit a pinch-hit grand slam to break the game wide open. Catcher Alejandro Kirk added a cherry-on-top with a two-run home run for added insurance to make it 11-2.\n \n\n   \n  Barger’s blast was the first ever pinch hit grand slam in World Series history, according to the Fox broadcast.\n \n\n   \n  Coming off of a Game 4 performance in the NLCS which still has  baseball fans marveling , Dodgers two-way star Shohei Ohtani connected on a two-run home run in the next half inning to cut into the Jays’ big lead.\n \n\n   \n  But that was as close as the Dodgers would come the rest of the way.\n \n\n   \n  Following the lopsided victory in the series opener, the Blue Jays find themselves on the right side of Major League Baseball history.\n \n\n   \n  The winner of Game 1 has gone on to win 23 of the last 27 Fall Classics, dating back to 1997, according to the MLB.\n \n\n   \n  The loss was an unfamiliar feeling for the Dodgers, who had only dropped one game this entire postseason entering Friday.\n \n\n   \n  While the four-game sweep of the Milwaukee Brewers gave the Dodgers some extra rest before their trek up to Canada to start the series, a quick league championship series hasn’t always favored the winner.\n \n\n   \n  The team that swept the LCS is 0-5 against the team that won their respective series in seven games, like the Blue Jays did over the Seattle Mariners, according to the broadcast.\n \n\n   \n  Los Angeles starter Blake Snell came out the gates strong but stumbled in the sixth inning, exiting the game after allowing five earned runs while walking three batters and striking out four.\n \n\n   \n  Trey Yesavage, the rookie starter for the Blue Jays, looked like he belonged on the sport’s biggest stage, going four innings, striking out five batters along the way.\n \n\n   \n  Eric Lauer closed out the game for Toronto, getting Dodgers star Mookie Betts to strike out.\n \n\n   \n  The 25-year-old Barger told the Fox crew that he doesn’t remember hitting the grand slam.\n \n\n   \n  “It was so hard to kind of gather my thoughts and everything,” Barger said. “It was just a blackout moment. Crazy.”\n \n\n   \n  The Blue Jays won back-to-back titles in 1992 and 1993 and despite the long drought, the team has a “tight, energetic” clubhouse, according to Barger.\n \n\n   \n  “Every day we’re having fun in there,” Barger said. “We aren’t taking it too serious. We understand we are playing the Dodgers and they are a great team, but we are trying to keep everything the same and go out and compete like we have all year.”\n \n\n   \n  Barger was quick to praise the Blue Jays fans for their support.\n \n\n   \n  “We have the best fans in baseball,” Barger said. “Obviously a whole country behind us. We feel the energy every single night. They’re awesome. We see them on the streets. … I couldn’t be more happy to be here.”\n \n\n   \n  Game 2 is scheduled for Saturday at 8 p.m. ET in Toronto.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/asia/cambodia-scams-chen-zhi-prince-group-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"20:25:00-20:45","title":"Young Tycoon Accused of Masterminding Multibillion-Dollar International Fraud Network","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Chen Zhi, a Chinese-born tycoon who became a naturalized Cambodian citizen and rose to influential political roles, is accused by US and UK authorities of masterminding a massive transnational fraud network through his Prince Group conglomerate.

CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:25 PM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  He is a baby-faced tycoon who rose to the highest echelons of power in his adopted home of Cambodia, where he bestows scholarships and runs philanthropy programs while overseeing one of the country’s largest and best-connected conglomerates.\n \n\n   \n  But behind this façade, Chen Zhi, 37, runs one of the largest transnational criminal organizations in Asia,  US authorities say , an empire fueled by forced labor and cryptocurrency scams that at one point were allegedly earning Chen and his associates $30 million every day.\n \n\n   \n  The money went on buying Picasso artwork, private jets and properties in upscale neighborhoods of London, ﻿as well as supplying bribes to public officials, according to prosecutors in New York, who last week ﻿ announced  they had seized $15 billion in cryptocurrency from Chen following a years-long investigation.\n \n\n   \n  That action has thrown a rare light on an alleged kingpin of Southeast Asia’s murky and criminal world of online scams, which US authorities say operate under the protection of powerful politicians, and conned victims in the US alone out of at least $10 billion dollars last year.\n \n\n   \n  Chen’s Prince Group employs thousands of people and bills itself as one of the biggest conglomerates in Cambodia, with investments in luxury real estate, banking services, hotels, major construction developments, grocery stores and even luxury watches.\n \n\n   \n  But last week, the company was declared a transnational criminal organization by United States authorities, and Chen  was charged  in absentia in New York with money laundering conspiracy and wire fraud conspiracy, along with several associates.\n \n\n   \n  He is still at large, and currently faces no legal threat in Cambodia, which has no extradition treaty with the US.\n \n\n   \n  Prince Group, American and British authorities allege, was the umbrella for more than 100 shell companies and entities allegedly used to funnel laundered cash across 12 countries and territories from Singapore to St Kitts and Nevis.\n \n\n   \n  “Chen Zhi isn’t a mob boss as we traditionally conceive of them – he is (or rather was) the polished face of a state-protected criminal economy,” said Jacob Sims, visiting fellow at Harvard University’s Asia Center and a transnational crime expert.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Prince Group for comment. CNN has also reached out to the Cambodian government and interior ministry for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Prince Group has previously denied allegations of wrongdoing as “false and defamatory” in statements published on its website. Those statements have since been taken down.\n \n\n   \n    Who is Chen Zhi?\n \n\n   \n  Little was known about Chen, also known as Vincent, until he arrived in Cambodia and began splashing enormous amounts of cash.\n \n\n   \n  He was born in China’s southeastern province of Fujian on December 16, 1987, according to the US Treasury Department.\n \n\n   \n  His first business ventures were reportedly an internet café and gaming centers in the provincial capital Fuzhou. In 2011, he plunged into the “uncharted waters of real estate investment in Cambodia,” according to a profile on the website of DW Capital Holdings, a Singapore-based fund manager that lists Chen as its founder and chairman, and which is among the companies sanctioned by the US.\n \n\n   \n  In those “uncharted waters,” a rush of mainly Chinese developers started building casinos in the western Cambodian city of Sihanoukville in the 2010s, turning the quiet seaside town and backpacker haven into a  roaring gambling mecca,  encouraged by lax regulation and the easy availability of casino licenses.\n \n\n   \n  With the casinos and online gambling came organized crime, money laundering, prostitution, drug trafficking and online scamming. The town was described as a “wild west” where a prolific business-crime nexus emerged.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after his arrival in Cambodia, Chen became a naturalized Cambodian citizen – an option available to applicants who donate $250,000 to the state. Analysts say he acquired venerable titles and rapidly gained influence with the Cambodian elite.\n \n\n   \n  He was elevated to be a senior adviser to the government at the rank of minister, was personal adviser to former Prime Minister Hun Sen, and then his son and successor Hun Manet, and bestowed with the honorific “neak oknha,” a title awarded to prominent businesspeople.\n \n\n   \n  Video posted by the former Cambodian leader shows Chen standing alongside Hun Sen in 2022 during a meeting of investors. Chen was also part of a delegation that traveled with Hun Sen to Cuba in 2022, during which he met Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel and was listed as an “adviser” to Hun Sen.\n \n\n   \n  According to the US indictment, Chen also traveled to the US in April 2023 using a diplomatic passport –   a document it alleges Chen obtained after purchasing luxury watches for a senior foreign government official.\n \n\n   \n    Federal investigation reveals wide criminal net\n \n\n   \n  Browse the website of Chen’s Prince Group, and the company’s public image is one of charitable endeavors, business accolades and awards for corporate social responsibility initiatives, large donations to anti-Covid efforts, and education programs.\n \n\n   \n  The group’s charitable trust claims to have donated funds worth $14 million to help Cambodians in a range of initiatives. The company even opened a Prince Horology Vocational Training Center, billed as the country’s first independent watch school.\n \n\n   \n  And it commands a visible presence in the country, with skyscrapers dotting the skylines of Cambodia’s cities. Through its subsidiary Canopy Sands Development, Prince Group has embarked on a $16 billion project near Sihanoukville to develop a 934-hectare “eco city” called the Bay of Lights.\n \n\n   \n  But federal prosectors allege that empire extended to at least 10 forced labor camps in Cambodia, where workers were coerced into carrying out scams “at high volumes” under the threat of violence. The indictment described vast dormitories surrounded by high walls and barbed wire where incidences of   violence and coercion were “frequent.”\n \n\n   \n  From alleged organized crime investments in Palau to shell companies in the British Virgin Islands, Hong Kong and Singapore, investigators implicated 146 entities and individuals linked to Chen, his Prince Group and associates.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s really remarkable in terms of both the state, the scale and size of what they’ve seized, but also the extent to which they’ve been able to identify and target so many of the different nodes of this particular criminal network,” said Jason Tower, a senior expert at the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime (GI-TOC).\n \n\n   \n  As well as Cambodian citizenship, Chen is listed by the US Treasury Department as having passports from Cyprus and the small Pacific island of Vanuatu.\n \n\n   \n  Several of the addresses listed to Chen are in Hong Kong. Construction and engineering services firm Geotech Holdings – which has seven subsidiaries, each sanctioned by the US government – has headquarters in Kwai Chung, home to the city’s container port. The company did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities also allege Chen and his co-conspirators bribed public officials in China and elsewhere to stay ahead of investigations and raids on the forced labor compound. Chen kept ledgers of bribes, according to the indictment, and in 2019 a $3 million yacht was bought for a senior official in an unnamed foreign government.\n \n\n   \n  By approximately 2020, Chen had allegedly amassed a staggering sum of laundered proceeds that included approximately 127,271 bitcoin worth $15 billion across unhosted cryptocurrency wallets whose private keys he personally held.\n \n\n   \n  Chen mastered a combination of elite access, patronage and philanthropy “that opened doors across real estate, finance, and politics, ultimately providing him the resources and protection needed to grow his scam empire,” said Sims.\n \n\n   \n    Cambodia as a ‘scam state’\n \n\n   \n  Cambodia has been described by analysts as a de facto scam state that risks becoming a global pariah if it fails to act against the criminal networks within its borders.\n \n\n   \n  The global scam industry, estimated to be worth between $50 billion and $70 billion, is evolving at an unprecedented scale, the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime  said earlier this year , despite   widely publicized crackdowns on scam compounds in Myanmar.\n \n\n   \n  Cambodia, which has emerged as an epicenter of this scam economy, is estimated to make   $12.5 billion to $19 billion a year from cybercrime – equivalent to about 60% of the country’s GDP, according to a  report  published by the Humanity Research Consultancy in May.\n \n\n   \n  In June, an Amnesty International  report  accused the Cambodian government of “deliberately ignoring a litany of human rights abuses including slavery, human trafficking, child labour and torture” carried out by criminal gangs in scamming compounds across the country.\n \n\n   \n  And the US State Department named Cambodia a state sponsor of human trafficking in its  2025 Trafficking in Persons report,  which noted that senior Cambodian officials owned properties used by online scam operators to exploit victims.\n \n\n   \n  Analysts estimate there are about 300 scamming compounds in the country with a workforce of up to 200,000 people. Cambodia’s garment and textile industry, long a mainstay of its economy, employs about 1 million people, according to the UN.\n \n\n   \n  The Humanity Research Consultancy report, authored by Sims, goes further, detailing how the Cambodian leadership and Cambodian state institutions are “deeply and directly implicated in the growth, durability, and flourishing” of the country’s scam industry.\n \n\n   \n  “The charges focus on Chen and Prince, not the state per se, but the pattern is unmistakable: you don’t build ten forced-labor scam compounds, move billions, and buy impunity without political protection,” Sims said. “It is impossible to imagine that such vast wealth would be moving through the system without the explicit knowledge and participation of its strongman and his immediate circle.”\n \n\n   \n  The criminal operations have gone largely unchallenged in Cambodia due to the complete dismantling in recent years of the country’s civil society and independent media.\n \n\n   \n  In October 2024, the arrest of prominent Cambodian journalist Mech Dara, who helped expose the human trafficking fueling  online scam centers , prompted widespread international concern.\n \n\n   \n  “Civil society in Cambodia has been decimated,” said GI-TOC’s Tower. “And anyone who goes and reports on this issue now they’re silenced. So there’s no space to report on the scam economy, or to raise these issues in the media, civil society can’t touch it.”\n \n\n   \n  The Cambodian government has repeatedly denied any link to the cybercrime industry, and  said this month  that it is “committed to preventing and suppressing all forms of cross-border crimes, particularly online scams.”\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, Prime Minister   Hun Manet established a commission to target the scammers. The government says it has led to the arrest of 3,455 suspects, of 20 nationalities, accused of cybercrime. Authorities also say they have broken up several organized crime and trafficking networks, rescuing human trafficking victims in the process.\n \n\n   \n  “We do not protect individuals who violate the law,” Cambodia’s Interior Ministry spokesman Touch Sokhak told  the Associated Press  news agency regarding Chen. He stressed that Cambodia’s government itself does not accuse Prince Group﻿   or Chen of wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  The ministry has also  rejected  reports that Interior Minister Sar Sokha is a co-investor in the Jin Bei Casino Company – which the US Treasury said runs “among the most notorious” of Prince Group’s scam compounds. Meanwhile, the National Bank of Cambodia  said it was  “taking careful monitoring and investigation measures” to ensure Prince Group’s financial services arm Prince Bank “complies with Cambodian laws.”\n \n\n   \n    Where does Cambodia go from here?\n \n\n   \n  Cambodia is “at a crossroads,” said Tower.\n \n\n   \n  The UK-US action “sends a very strong signal to both the criminal networks, as well as to those elites in Cambodia that are protecting them, and sponsoring them… that this type of impunity is not going to continue, that your assets are no longer safe. And so, I think it is potentially a game changer,” Tower said.\n \n\n   \n  Regional countries have begun to act against the crime flourishing inside Cambodia’s borders that has ensnared their citizens.\n \n\n   \n  South Korea last week issued a travel ban for parts of Cambodia after the death of a South Korean student lured to work in the scam compounds, according to police. More than 60 South Korean nationals were deported from Cambodia and police are seeking to detain most of them over allegations they were involved in online scams.\n \n\n   \n  Chen is at large, with a net worth somewhere in the tens of billions, analysts believe. And the scam compounds in Cambodia continue to operate, stealing money from victims including US citizens.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not like there’s an off button that you can push to stop all of these scam centers,” said Tower.\n \n\n   \n  The question now turns to whether the US, UK and their allies can use the leverage from their joint operation effectively to dismantle the highly lucrative industry.\n \n\n   \n  “This is the first time Washington and London have hit the architecture – the elite ownership, the laundering conduits, and the money itself – at the very top,” Sims said.\n \n\n   \n  “Blunting (Cambodia’s) ability to operate as a de facto scam state will not only materially disrupt the crime today, it will also serve as an effective deterrent model as this crime continues to spread globally,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  “Now is the time to keep the pedal down.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/politics/anonymous-donor-military-pay-shutdown","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"17:11:00Z","title":"Pentagon to use $130 million donation from anonymous Trump 'friend' to pay military members","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration plans to use a $130 million anonymous donation from an undisclosed ally to pay military service members' salaries and benefits during a government shutdown, despite concerns over legality, transparency, and compliance with federal laws like the Antideficiency Act.

 By Adam Cancryn, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:11 PM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Trump administration plans to funnel a $130 million donation from an anonymous ally of  President Donald Trump  toward paying military service members during  the government shutdown , the Defense Department confirmed on Friday.\n \n\n   \n  “The donation was made on the condition that it be used to offset the cost of Service members’ salaries and benefits,” chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement to CNN, adding that the money was accepted under the department’s “general gift acceptance authority.”\n \n\n   \n  The move marks a striking departure from government procedure for funding the military, which traditionally relies on public funds appropriated by Congress. And it raised immediate questions about the donor’s identity and motivations for cutting the nine-figure check to the government.\n \n\n   \n  The $130 million donation is unlikely to make any meaningful impact toward covering salaries of the roughly 1.3 million active duty military troops, netting out to about $100 per service member.\n \n\n   \n  Congressional appropriators on both sides of the aisle said Friday that they were seeking more information from the administration about the specifics of the donation, but had yet to receive any explanation.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats also raised concerns about its legality, contending that the gift acceptance authority cited by the Pentagon  only permits gifts  for a handful of specific purposes — such as funding military schools, hospitals, cemeteries or to benefit wounded troops or the dependents of those injured or killed in the line of duty. Donations can also face additional, tighter restrictions if they come from foreign governments or organizations.\n \n\n   \n  “Using anonymous donations to fund our military raises troubling questions of whether our own troops are at risk of literally being bought and paid for by foreign powers,” Delaware Sen. Chris Coons, the top Democrat on the Senate’s defense appropriations subcommittee, said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Budget experts also questioned whether using the donation to pay military members runs afoul of  the Antideficiency Act , which forbids federal agencies from using federal funds that exceed what have been allocated to them. Democrats have accused the administration of violating that law multiple times during the shutdown, including in its decision to fire thousands of federal workers.\n \n\n   \n  “The Antideficiency Act is explicit that private donations cannot be used to offset a lapse in appropriations,” said Bill Hoagland, a former Senate GOP budget aide who is currently a senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center.\n \n\n   \n  “I think they could accept it but they could not use it for that purpose because the law is very clear,” Hoagland told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Trump on Thursday had touted the $130 million donation, which he said came from “a friend of mine” with the aim of covering military shortfalls. He declined to identify the donor, saying “he doesn’t really want the recognition.”\n \n\n   \n  In response to questions about the donor’s identity and whether they have any ties to foreign entities or interests, a White House spokeswoman referred questions to the Pentagon and Treasury. The Pentagon then referred those questions back to the White House. Treasury did not immediately respond to request for comment.\n \n\n   \n  The Pentagon referred to the donation as an “anonymous” contribution and also did not respond to questions about whether it planned to brief Congress on the details of its use.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional reaction. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/us/mafia-la-cosa-nostra-nba-sports-gambling-probe","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"17:49:00Z","title":"Barcoded decks, contact lenses and X-ray tables: How New York’s mafia allegedly ran illegal poker games tied to US athletes","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A sweeping federal investigation, Operation Royal Flush, has uncovered a nationwide illegal poker scheme allegedly run by members of New York’s mafia, including the Bonanno, Gambino, Lucchese, and Genovese families.

Tucked somewhere between the glitter and grit of Manhattan, a room wafting smoke with the rhythm of a poker game seemingly like any other: Cards whisper against felt, chips click in steady tempo, and players sit around a table, guarding their hands – and secrets.\n \n\n   \n  Some of the players lured to the table – seduced by celebrity faces and the illusion of fair play – are unaware they have just taken a seat at a game rigged by some members of  New York’s mafia  – La Cosa Nostra, authorities say.\n \n\n   \n  That illusion was shattered Thursday when gambling and sports rigging schemes linked to the mob led to the  arrests  of 31 defendants, including Portland Trail Blazers head coach Chauncey Billups and former NBA player with the Cleveland Cavaliers and Miami Heat, Damon Jones. The pair, along with others, are “alleged to have participated in a nationwide scheme to rig illegal poker games,” according to US Attorney Joseph Nocella Jr.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators described the yearslong probe – dubbed Operation Royal Flush – as a meticulous, evidence-driven effort that exposed a sprawling web of corruption stretching from organized crime to professional sports.\n \n\n   \n  At the heart of each underground poker game was a carefully choreographed ballet of stars, signals and souped-up technology, details outlined by prosecutors show.\n \n\n   \n  “What the victims – the fish – didn’t know is that everybody else at the poker game, from the dealer to the players, including the face cards, were in on the scam,” Nocella said.\n \n\n   \n  Among the  defendants in the gambling scheme  are members of major American crime families, as well as current and former NBA players and coaches, New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said. Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier was implicated in a second indictment alleging he used nonpublic information about upcoming NBA games to allow others to profit on betting.\n \n\n   \n  Jim Trusty, Rozier’s attorney, strongly disputed the accusations, saying prosecutors characterized Rozier as a subject of their investigation and not a target.\n \n\n   \n  “They appear to be taking the word of spectacularly incredible sources rather than relying on actual evidence of wrongdoing. Terry was cleared by the NBA and these prosecutors revived that non-case. Terry is not a gambler, but he is not afraid of a fight, and he looks forward to winning this fight,” Trusty added,\n \n\n   \n  An attorney for Billups denied the allegations. CNN has reached out to Jones’ representatives but has not heard back.\n \n\n   \n  More than $7 million was stolen from victims at the underground card games where behind the scenes, an elaborate scheme of advanced technology was tipping the scales, court documents said.\n \n\n   \n  “But my message to the defendants who have been rounded up today is this, your winning streak has ended,” Nocella said. “Your luck has run out. Violating the law is a losing proposition, and you can bet on that.”\n \n\n   \n  This specific quiet theater of greed, luck, and deceit is likely over.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s how officials say they got away with it for so long.\n \n\n   \n    The poker table\n \n\n   \n  From start to finish, prosecutors say the defendants employed a host of technologically sophisticated tactics to make sure they came out on top, stripping millions from their victims.\n \n\n   \n  Unbeknownst to the targets, they were seated at a poker table fitted with X-ray technology designed to read cards placed face down on the table. The games were monitored by “hidden cameras built into tables and light fixtures,” Tisch said.\n \n\n   \n  Sal Piacente, President of UniverSal Game Protection Development, Inc., an expert in various ways to cheat and who consults with casinos around the world told CNN X-ray systems use cameras embedded in the table, which looked upward through the felt. When cards were precisely positioned, the cameras could identify each card and transmit that information to the shuffle machines.\n \n\n   \n  The shuffling machines appeared to be randomizing the cards. In reality, they were altered to read the deck and predict who got the best hand, according to the indictment.\n \n\n   \n  An unaltered shuffle machine contains cameras that alert the casino, dealer, or house if a card is missing and ensures the deck is correctly sorted, according to Piacente.\n \n\n   \n  “The cheaters came up with ways of utilizing that camera as well to know what cards are being dealt and who’s getting them, and that shuffle machine is altered to transmit to an earpiece to tell the people who were going to win,” Piacente said.\n \n\n   \n  During the rigged games, information about the player with the best hand was transmitted to an off-site operator who relayed the information to a person seated at the table who was in on the scheme.\n \n\n   \n  That player, known as the “Quarterback” or “Driver” would then signal to other members of the team by touching a certain colored chip or tapping their chin, wrist or arm a detention letter written to the judge said. A signal was assigned to each one of the players who were in on the scheme.\n \n\n   \n  Some cards had markers, or barcodes, visible only to individuals wearing “special contact lenses or eyeglasses,” the indictment said. Officials said the defendants also used electronic poker chip trays to analyze and read cards on the table.\n \n\n   \n    The players\n \n\n   \n  The case concerning Billups, a Basketball Hall of Famer, who was a five-time All-Star and 2004 NBA champion, involved high-stakes poker games investigators alleged were rigged.\n \n\n   \n  Billups participated in illegal poker games that took place in Manhattan, Miami, Las Vegas and the Hamptons, officials say.\n \n\n   \n  “Anyone who knows Chauncey Billups knows he is a man of integrity; men of integrity do not cheat and defraud others,” Billups’ attorney, Chris Heywood, said in a statement. “To believe that Chauncey Billups did what the federal government is accusing him of is to believe that he would risk his hall-of-fame legacy, his reputation, and his freedom. He would not jeopardize those things for anything, let alone a card game.”\n \n\n   \n  Billups and Jones were dubbed “Face Cards,” professional athletes whose mere presence in the illegal and rigged games offered star power meant to legitimize the games to “attract victims to the games.”\n \n\n   \n  One of the defendants mentioned in the indictment observed one victim seemed eager to give Billups his money because he was “starstruck.” This reaction was intentional. Former professional athletes were used to help lure wealthy victims into the games, according to court documents.\n \n\n   \n  “Once the game was underway, the defendants fleeced the victims out of tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars per game,” Nocella said. “The defendants used a variety of very sophisticated cheating technologies, some of which were provided by other defendants in exchange for a share of the profits from the scheme.”\n \n\n   \n  Members of the conspiracy often texted in real time about the scheme, at times coordinating deliberate losses to keep the victim playing longer or to avoid arousing suspicion, court documents said.\n \n\n   \n  The NBA said Billups and Rozier are on immediate leave from their teams in the league’s first statement since the news of their arrests.\n \n\n   \n  “We are in the process of reviewing the federal indictments announced today,” the league said in a statement on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n    The consequences\n \n\n   \n  Members of the illicit poker scheme at times threatened and resorted to violence when victims failed to pay their debts on time, prosecutors alleged.\n \n\n   \n  “Watch what’s good now,” defendant Zhen Hu, identified as one of the game organizers in the indictment, allegedly texted one victim in 2022 who had not yet paid a gambling debt. “You’ve been running your mouth unchecked.”\n \n\n   \n  Hu allegedly punched the unnamed victim in the face, a move prosecutors say he confirmed in a message to an associate, “I punched somebody in the face the other day, s**ts unraveling quick.”\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors also alleged Hu and three other individuals approached the unnamed victim again sometime later, and the victim was again attacked.\n \n\n   \n  “What you did was cowardly and ridiculous,” the victim texted Hu nearly a year later, according to prosecutors. “And then u send a bunch of goons to solve your problems.”\n \n\n   \n  Some of the defendants and their coconspirators also committed acts of violence, Nocella said, “including the gunpoint robbery of a person in order to obtain a rigged shuffling machine and extortions that were perpetrated against victims in order to ensure they repaid their gambling debts.”\n \n\n   \n  Hu is detained in New York pending trial on charges of a crime of violence, which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. CNN has not been able to determine whether Hu has legal representation.\n \n\n   \n    The Mafia\n \n\n   \n  In New York City, five major Italian American mafia families have  long dominated  organized crime. Four of those five families are involved in the schemes, prosecutors said.\n \n\n   \n  Thirteen members and associates of those families are among the defendants in the two cases, according to Christopher Raia, the assistant director in charge of the FBI’s New York Field Office. Raia said an illegal gambling operation created a “financial pipeline” for La Cosa Nostra.\n \n\n   \n  In New York, the four families supported the rigged poker games and collected a share of their profits, according to the indictment. One of these games, held primarily in a nondescript building in Manhattan’s Kips Bay neighborhood, was affiliated with the Bonanno family, while another, based mainly in Greenwich Village, was connected to the Gambino family, the indictment says.\n \n\n   \n  “These operatives included capos and multiple soldiers from the Bonanno, Gambino, Lucchese and Genovese crime families, bringing four of the five families together in a single indictment is extraordinarily rare,” Tisch said. “It reflects how deep and how far this investigation reached, and the skill and the persistence it took to get here. That work uncovered a deliberate, technologically sophisticated operation designed to carry out their crimes.”\n \n\n   \n  While the Mafia no longer wields the national influence it once did, the FBI warns it  remains a significant threat  in the New York metropolitan area, as well as in New England, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Detroit.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Elise Hammond contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/americas/noboa-ecuador-poison-chocolate-jam-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"17:50:00Z","title":"Ecuador’s President Claims Poisoned Chocolate and Jam Used in New Attempt on His Life","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa claims he survived a third alleged assassination attempt involving poisoned chocolate and jam, which he says contained lethal levels of three incompatible chemicals.

his life \n       \n  Analysis by Max Saltman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:50 PM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Ecuadorean President Daniel Noboa has had quite a month, surviving not one, not two, but three alleged assassination attempts – the latest of which apparently involved gifts of jam and chocolate laced with poisonous chemicals.\n \n\n   \n  The president made the claim to CNN’s Fernando del Rincon on Thursday, saying the gifts had contained “very high concentrations” of three chemicals, “and it was practically impossible for these to be present together at those levels” – unless the gifts had been spiked.\n \n\n   \n  That comes just weeks after another alleged assassination attempt when a crowd throwing rocks surrounded Noboa’s car as he traveled to an engagement in Cañar province. Bullet marks were later found on the vehicle, according to energy minister Ines Manzano, while days earlier, according to Noboa, another crowd threw Molotov cocktails and homemade rockets at his vehicle . \n \n\n   \n  While some critics are skeptical of the claims amid a lack of publicly available evidence – suggesting instead that they are meant to distract from growing public discontent and protests against Noboa’s government – the president insisted to CNN the threat was real.\n \n\n   \n  “It wasn’t just sticks and stones. There were homemade rockets, Molotov cocktails, projectiles that could still kill you … and from high above, they threw rocks at the windshield and hood of the car,” Noboa said.\n \n\n   \n  “If one of these homemade rockets hits you in the chest or head it would kill you.”\n \n\n   \n  What isn’t in dispute is this: the Ecuadorian president is not short of enemies.\n \n\n   \n  Noboa, the 37-year-old heir to a banana empire and one of Ecuador’s largest fortunes, won his first full term in office this year on a promise to crush the “narcoterrorists” who turned his country from a beacon of peace to the home of Latin America’s highest homicide rates.\n \n\n   \n  Since then, he has leaned into the strongman approach and tough-on-crime agenda that made him so popular with voters in his first term, bringing him into the sights of powerful criminal groups.\n \n\n   \n  But it’s not just those criminal networks who have turned against Noboa. With homicide rates rising once again and growing discontent over economic issues such as the price of diesel, Noboa is seeing his once remarkable approval ratings take a battering. In February 2024, 81% of Ecuadorians approved of him, according to  local polling firm Cedatos.  That figure has since declined to around 50%.\n \n\n   \n  In Ecuador, where presidents tend to be “very, very unpopular,” according to Laura Lizarazo, lead Ecuador analyst at consulting firm Control Risks, that’s still a considerable level of support, but Noboa is facing increasing resistance from indigenous groups and civil society advocates over his unilateral decisions and attempts to strengthen his executive authority.\n \n\n   \n  Particularly unpopular, especially among rural, Indigenous Ecuadorans, has been his canceling of a diesel subsidy – a move that has sparked widespread demonstrations – though he has also come under fire for  subsuming  Ecuador’s environmental watchdog into the ministry of mining, which critics fear will undermine regulation, and for his attacks on the judiciary when it ruled against several security measures, including  blanket immunity for law enforcement .\n \n\n   \n  “He has taken some very polarizing policy decisions that have not been well received by the public, and one example of that is precisely this latest wave of protests (over the diesel subsidies),” Lizarazo said.\n \n\n   \n  During the protests, Noboa declared states of emergency in numerous provinces. The movement subsided after Noboa threatened to send in the military to break protesters’ roadblocks. The president later agreed to lower the price of diesel in two installments in December and February. \n \n\n   \n    A violent turn\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, there are even signs of strain regarding the ‘tough on crime’ message that once made Noboa so popular.\n \n\n   \n  Recently, violence in Ecuador has taken a dramatic turn. After a brief respite last year, homicides  rose 40%  in the first seven months of 2025,  while last week explosions from car bombs rocked Guayaquil and killed one person. And in September, there were  two back-to-back prison massacres. \n \n\n   \n  All this comes despite Noboa’s high-profile deployment of army units into Ecuador’s prisons and city streets, as well as the capture of its most-wanted criminal over the summer.\n \n\n   \n  In his interview with CNN, Noboa acknowledged the worsening homicide statistics, but pushed back by claiming that a greater percentage of the killings involved criminal-on-criminal violence.\n \n\n   \n  “The numbers are similar to 2023,” Noboa said, “The difference is that in 2023, six out of 10 (of those killed) had a criminal record. Today, nine out of 10 deaths have a criminal record. They are killing each other.”\n \n\n   \n  Some critics question whether Noboa’s hardline approach is making matters worse.\n \n\n   \n  Noboa “thinks that using the army is the best solution to counter drugs,” said John Paul Pinto, a political analyst based in Quito, Ecuador. “And what we’re seeing here in Ecuador is that that’s a bad strategy. It’s a very bad strategy. It’s not working.”\n \n\n   \n  “Security is not only about the army, police, intelligence,” Pinto said. “Security is about (solving) economic problems, social problems, the participation of the private sector.”\n \n\n   \n    Relations with Trump\n \n\n   \n  Also controversial has been Noboa’s plan to revise Ecuador’s constitution to allow foreign militaries to occupy bases in Ecuador – a plan that will be subject to a referendum next month.\n \n\n   \n  Noboa appears so confident that voters will agree with him that his administration has even  drawn up plans  for a US Navy base on Ecuador’s coast.\n \n\n   \n  In the meantime, he has openly courted US President Donald Trump, spontaneously praising him on social media this week to declare that “Ecuador stands firm in the global fight against drug trafficking” – even as other countries in the region voice concern over US strikes against alleged drug traffickers in the Caribbean and Pacific.\n \n\n   \n  Noboa told CNN he supports the fight against drug trafficking, “which affects the entire society,” and said Ecuador had already submitted a formal request to conduct joint operations with US forces.\n \n\n   \n  Lizarazo said the recent wave of violence in Ecuador was not likely to change Noboa’s hardline approach – rather, he would double down.\n \n\n   \n  “For Noboa’s administration, those events are not a signal of a failed security strategy, but rather an argument for advancing more aggressive measures against organized criminal groups,” Lizarazo said. “That is key to the government’s identity, that security discourse and that strongman image and those hardline policies.”\n \n\n   \n     An image of power \n \n\n   \n  Noboa’s image has long been key to his power, analysts say. He’s young, social media-savvy and eager to participate in the politics of spectacle.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s kind of an atypical leader for Ecuador,” Lizarazo said, “whose popularity and governing strategy is based on his image, his discourse, rather than a clear, evidence-based, comprehensive state strategy to address the key issues of the several crises the country is facing.”\n \n\n   \n  Pinto pointed to Noboa’s  fight with the country’s constitutional court  over security measures earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  After the court suspended several of Noboa’s security policies, including immunity for law enforcement, Noboa personally led a march through the streets of Quito. Along the parade route, billboards showed pictures of the justices, their faces framed by a red-letter message saying: “These are the judges stealing our peace.”\n \n\n   \n  “We are not going to permit change to be halted because of nine people who don’t even show their face,” Noboa told demonstrators in a speech the next day.\n \n\n   \n  Critics warned the move could put the justices in danger, but it is hardly the only time he has shown a willingness to flout institutional norms.\n \n\n   \n  Lizarazo noted how he had caused a diplomatic crisis in April 2024 by ordering security forces to  storm the Mexican embassy  to arrest a former vice president wanted on corruption charges who was seeking political asylum.\n \n\n   \n  “He has clear authoritarian traits and tendencies that will very likely persist over the rest of his administration,” Lizarazo predicted. “He will continue testing institutional boundaries on executive power, and he will continue attempting to expand those executive powers to implement his strongman, hardline security agenda.”\n \n\n   \n  As for the referendum, Lizarazo said it was a “polarizing question, but Noboa has the state apparatus and communication platforms in his favor.”\n \n\n   \n  For his part, Noboa told CNN he intends to respect the results of the referendum whatever the result – but he’s confident Ecuador sees things the way he does.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m convinced that people want real change,” Noboa said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/politics/venezuela-cocaine-trafficking-routes-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"16:47:00-04:00","title":"Trump Considering Plans to Target Cocaine Facilities Inside Venezuela, Officials Say","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump is considering military action to target cocaine trafficking routes and facilities inside Venezuela, despite the country not being a major source of cocaine.

Trump has also  authorized the CIA  to conduct covert operations in Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  The president has not ruled out taking a diplomatic approach with Venezuela to stem the flow of drugs into the US, two officials said, even after the administration cut off active talks with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in recent weeks. Venezuela is not known to be a major source of cocaine, but the Trump administration has been aggressively trying to link Maduro to the drug trade.\n \n\n   \n  “There are plans on the table that the president is considering” regarding operations on targets inside Venezuelan, one administration official told CNN, adding that “he hasn’t ruled out diplomacy.”\n \n\n   \n  A second official, who has been directly involved in some of the discussions, argued that there are many proposals that have been suggested to the president. A third official said the planning is happening across the government, but the focus at the highest levels is currently going after the drugs inside Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has escalated his rhetoric on potential land strikes inside Venezuela in recent days, while the US military  steadily carries out strikes  on alleged drug boats in international waters. The latest was an overnight strike against a boat allegedly smuggling narcotics in the Caribbean, killing six and bringing the total number known of targeted boats to 10 and the number of people killed to 43 since the US began its campaign last month, according to Hegseth.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has previously reported Trump has also been  weighing strikes inside Venezuela itself  as part of a broader strategy aimed at weakening Maduro, and Trump himself has mused publicly about operations on land. The president, however, has not yet made clear what that would entail, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggested drug “routes” might be targeted.\n \n\n   \n  Some administration officials are pushing for regime change and say that the drug campaign could lead to the ouster of Maduro. That could happen by putting pressure on people around the Venezuelan leader who have benefitted from the cartels’ illicit revenue streams, potentially squeezing them so much that they consider ways to oust the Venezuelan leader, sources told CNN.  Newly released video  shows Maduro, in English, pleading for peace.\n \n\n   \n  According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), Venezuela is not a cocaine-producing country.\n \n\n   \n  Almost all coca crops – the main ingredient of cocaine – are concentrated in Colombia, Peru and Bolivia. An annual report from the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) published in March did not mention Venezuela in the four pages dedicated to cocaine trafficking, citing instead Ecuador, Central America and Mexico.\n \n\n   \n  But administration officials still say some drug trafficking does go through Venezuela and point out that Maduro was indicted in 2020 on federal charges of narco-terrorism and conspiracy to import cocaine.\n \n\n   \n  “Nicolás Maduro, is an indicted drug trafficker in the United States, and he’s a fugitive of American justice,” Rubio said on a trip to Ecuador in September.\n \n\n   \n  Trump administration officials cautioned that the president is “not in a rush” — as one official put it — to make a decision, given his focus his currently trained on his trip to Asia and  negotiations with Russia and Ukraine on ending their war .\n \n\n   \n  While officials said Trump was open to finding a diplomatic solution, he also called off efforts earlier this month to engage in negotiations with Maduro and top Venezuelan officials that had been led by Richard Grenell, a special presidential envoy.\n \n\n   \n  US officials also acknowledged that an aggressive operation on a target inside Venezuela would likely require congressional approval, or at least congressional briefings, before the administration could move forward.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, Trump told CNN he could continue to launch strikes against alleged drug traffickers abroad  without Congress first passing an official declaration of war . And while he said he would notify Congress about any operations on land, he contended he would not face any pushback.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not going to necessarily ask for a declaration of war,” he said. “I think we’re just going to kill people that are bringing drugs into our country. Okay? We’re going to kill them, you know, they’re going to be like, dead.”\n \n\n   \n  The buildup of US forces has also raised questions about the Trump administration’s intent in the region. Pentagon press secretary Sean Parnell said in a statement posted on X that the move of the Gerald R. Ford strike group and its associated air wing was meant to “dismantle Transnational Criminal Organizations and counter narco-terrorism.”\n \n\n   \n  The Ford strike group docked near the harbor of Split, Croatia, on October 21. That would leave the carrier and its accompanying ships more than 5,000 miles from the Caribbean, meaning it would take days for the group to be in position to launch any strikes.\n \n\n   \n  Even before the Ford’s arrival, a significant percentage of all deployed US naval assets globally had been relocated to  US Southern Command , the US military’s command responsible for operations in the region, according to a fleet tracker published by the United States Naval Institute’s news portal.\n \n\n   \n  That includes the Iwo Jima Amphibious Ready Group and the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit, amounting to more than 4,500 Marines and sailors, three guided-missile destroyers, an attack submarine, a special operations ship, a guided missile cruiser and P-8 Poseidon reconnaissance aircraft.\n \n\n   \n  At the same time, the US has deployed 10 F-35 fighter jets to Puerto Rico, which has become a hub for the US military as part of the increased focus on the Caribbean. The US has also deployed at least three MQ-9 reaper drones to the island, according to images captured by Reuters in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico.\n \n\n   \n  Naval Station Roosevelt Roads in Puerto Rico, a US military installation that had been shuttered since 2004, is also now back up and running, according to satellite imagery and photos taken at the base.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/europe/kirill-dmitriev-russian-envoy-visits-us-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"16:16:00Z","title":"Top Russian Envoy Visits US for 'Official' Talks, Days After Trump Imposes Sanctions on Moscow","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Russia’s top economic envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, visits the United States for official talks just days after President Donald Trump imposes new sanctions on Russia’s largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil.

continue discussions about the  US-Russia  relationship,” according to the sources.\n \n\n   \n  A White House official told CNN that Trump’s Special Envoy Steve Witkoff is expected to meet with Dmitriev in Miami, Florida, on Saturday. GOP Rep. Anna Paulina Luna will also be meeting with the Russian special envoy, a source with knowledge of the visit told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, Luna posted on social media that she was planning on meeting Dmitriev, saying it is important that the US continues “to foster the relationship and conversations of peace and trade” with Russia. “Our two countries do not need to be enemies. Allies in trade benefit everyone,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  In a  post on X  Friday, Dmitriev said that his visit was “planned a while ago based on an invitation from the US side.” Dialogue between his country and the US is “vital for the world and must continue with the full understanding of Russia’s position and respect for its national interests,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The visit comes amid growing US frustration over the Kremlin’s refusal to end its war in Ukraine and after Trump said he had “canceled” a planned summit with his Kremlin counterpart, Vladimir Putin. The Trump administration on Wednesday imposed sanctions on Russia’s two largest oil companies Rosneft and Lukoil as it called on Moscow to agree to an immediate ceasefire in  the war with Ukraine .\n \n\n   \n  Putin said the sanctions will have little impact on the Russian economy, describing them as an attempt to put pressure on Moscow.\n \n\n   \n  “No self-respecting country ever does anything under pressure,” he said on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  The Russian leader said that, in a conversation with Trump, he had warned that the sanctions would impact global oil prices, including in the US.\n \n\n   \n  Dmitriev – who has been a prominent Kremlin advocate for closer economic cooperation between Russia and the United States – recently proposed the construction of a “Trump-Putin” tunnel between Alaska and the Russian Far East.\n \n\n   \n  Born in Soviet-era Ukraine and educated at Harvard and Stanford in the US, Dmitriev worked as a consultant at American consultancy firm McKinsey and as an investment banker at Goldman Sachs.\n \n\n   \n  After Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Dmitriev was sanctioned by the US Treasury Department, which designated him a “close associate of Putin” and his family.\n \n\n   \n  In April, Dmitriev became the first Russian official to visit Washington, DC, since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. At the time, his visit – during which he met with Trump envoy Steve Witkoff – was viewed as an important step in the then-warming relations between the Kremlin and the White House.\n \n\n   \n  The US government temporarily lifted sanctions against Dmitriev to allow the State Department to grant him a visa to come to the US, a source told CNN in April.\n \n\n   \n   Clarification: This article has been updated to reflect details of Rep.

\n  By Jacqueline Howard, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:58 PM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US Food and Drug Administration has approved another once-a-day pill that works without hormones to treat moderate to severe hot flashes in menopausal women, drugmaker Bayer said Friday.\n \n\n   \n  The drug, elinzanetant, is expected to be available in the United States beginning in November under the brand name Lynkuet,  Bayer said .\n \n\n   \n  It works by blocking the brain chemicals responsible for hot flashes and night sweats – what doctors call vasomotor symptoms – in menopausal women.   It’s estimated that more than 80% of women have hot flashes during menopause.\n \n\n   \n  “This FDA approval represents a bold step forward – our first hormone-free treatment for alleviating vasomotor symptoms of menopause,” Christine Roth, Bayer’s executive vice president of global product strategy and commercialization,  said in a news release  Friday.\n \n\n   \n  “There is a need for more individualized approaches to menopause care, and Lynkuet addresses a significant gap in treatment options,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  For many women,  hormone therapy  can be a safe and effective treatment for menopause symptoms such as hot flashes. But some with underlying health conditions or histories, including certain cancers, are sometimes advised against using hormone replacement therapies. Experts say that for those women, alternative treatment options can be helpful.\n \n\n   \n  A  Phase 3 clinical trial  of elinzanetant that included 628 postmenopausal women found that those taking the drug for 12 weeks reported a  more than 73% reduction  in the frequency of their vasomotor symptoms, or VMS. In contrast, those taking a placebo reported a 47% reduction.\n \n\n   \n  The most common side effects in women taking the drug were drowsiness, fatigue and headaches.\n \n\n   \n  “This yearlong study not only confirmed the initial findings of rapid and significant reduction in the frequency and severity of hot flashes and night sweats but also provided evidence that these effects were sustained over a year, offering hope for longer-term relief,” researcher Dr. JoAnn Pinkerton, UVA Health’s director of midlife health and emeritus executive director of the North American Menopause Society,  said in a statement last month  when the trial findings were published.\n \n\n   \n  “For those dealing with moderate to severe VMS due to menopause, the treatment options have been limited, especially for those who cannot or choose not to undergo hormone therapy,” Pinkerton said. “The disruptive nature of these bothersome hot flashes, particularly when they are more severe, can significantly affect women’s daily lives, both at work and at home, underscoring the urgent need for effective non-hormonal treatments.”\n \n\n   \n  Hot flashes are a sudden feeling of being very hot that’s usually centered around the face, chest and head. They can also cause   intense sweating and flushing that may last several minutes. When this happens at night, it’s called a night sweat. Women in menopause may get them occasionally or many times a day, which can be extremely disruptive.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s important that women know they have choices for treating moderate to severe hot flashes due to menopause, and today’s approval further expands a woman’s options for treating these symptoms,” Claire Gill, president and founder of the National Menopause Foundation, said in Bayer’s announcement Friday.\n \n\n   \n  In 2023, the FDA  approved  the menopause drug fezolinetant, which also works as an alternative to traditional hormone replacement therapies for managing hot flashes. Fezolinetant and elinzanetant are among the first drugs to take advantage of a newly understood pathway in the brain that appears to control hot flashes.\n \n\n   \n  As estrogen decreases during menopause, nerves in the hypothalamus — an almond-size region deep inside the brain whose functions include helping regulate the body’s thermostat — become hyperactive and produce an overabundance of chemical signals called neurokinins. Both of the new drugs block the doorways on cells where certain neurokinins dock, which turns down their ability to stimulate the brain to cause hot flashes.\n \n\n   \n  “Hot flashes, particularly when severe, can have an impact on women’s daily lives,” Pinkerton said in Bayer’s announcement. “This approval provides healthcare providers with a new treatment option that can be used first-line for moderate to severe hot flashes due to menopause.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/business/ronald-reagan-ad-trump-canada-ontario-tariffs","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"16:33:00Z","title":"What the Ronald Reagan ad that got Trump so angry was really all about","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A trade-related ad from Ontario, featuring a 1987 radio speech by former President Ronald Reagan criticizing tariffs and advocating free trade, sparked controversy when Donald Trump claimed it was 'fake' and falsely asserted that Reagan supported tariffs.

about \n       \n  By David Goldman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:33 PM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump has  canceled trade negotiations with Canada  over what he called a “ fake ” ad that featured parts of an anti-tariff speech delivered by conservative hero and former President Ronald Reagan. The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation & Institute also said the ad misrepresented the former president’s words.\n \n\n   \n  It wasn’t fake. It was edited. But Reagan really did spend a  five-minute speech  — an April 25, 1987, national radio address that the Reagan Library has published on  YouTube  — railing against tariffs. It was a full-throated expression of support for free and fair trade.\n \n\n   \n  The  ad , purchased by the government of Ontario and broadcast on major US television networks, aired clips of the address, delivered from Camp David, where Reagan was soon to meet the prime minister of Japan at a time when American attitudes toward Japan were hardening. In the recent past, Japanese companies like Toyota and Sony had flooded America’s market with high quality but inexpensive cars and electronics, harming the business of great American brands, including General Motors and RCA.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly before delivering the radio address, Reagan had placed higher tariffs on various Japanese products in retaliation for the influx of cheap Japanese semiconductors to America. He had some harsh words for Japan – not included in the ad – criticizing it in terms that resembled Trump’s frequent trade missives.\n \n\n   \n  “We had clear evidence that Japanese companies were engaging in unfair trade practices that violated an agreement between Japan and the United States,” Reagan said. “We expect our trading partners to live up to their agreements.”\n \n\n   \n  Reagan said he would remove the tariffs only when there was evidence Japan was treating American businesses and workers fairly – also seemingly channeling one of Trump’s go-to lines.\n \n\n   \n  But Reagan was clear: He was “loath” to place trade barriers on Japan and believed high tariffs were damaging to American workers and the economy. He noted that economists widely believe that high tariffs of the  Smoot-Hawley era  had exacerbated the Great Depression, which he and others of his generation lived through – a painful memory that, he said, remained “deep and searing.”\n \n\n   \n  The bulk of Reagan’s address – and the part the ad drew from most heavily – was his description of why advanced economies had largely abandoned tariffs as an economic tool by the time he became president: They increase domestic companies’ reliance on government intervention, they reduce competition, they kick off trade wars that lead to more tariffs, they raise prices and they ultimately  lead to job losses .\n \n\n   \n  Reagan then criticizes the Democratic-controlled Congress for proposing legislation that could place more trade barriers on other countries. And, despite “certain select cases like the Japanese semiconductors,” Reagan said his administration had embraced free trade.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not clear why Trump called the ad “fake,” but his  Truth Social post  included a critical message about the ad  posted online  by The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation & Institute. It said the ad campaign used “selective audio and video of President Ronald Reagan” and “misrepresents the Presidential Radio Address.” The foundation didn’t say what it believed to be misrepresented.\n \n\n   \n  In a  separate Truth Social post  Monday, Trump incorrectly stated that Reagan supported tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  “They fraudulently took a big buy ad saying that Ronald Reagan did not like Tariffs, when actually he LOVED TARIFFS FOR OUR COUNTRY, AND ITS NATIONAL SECURITY,” Trump posted. “Thank you to the Ronald Reagan Foundation for exposing this FRAUD.”\n \n\n   \n  The Ronald Reagan Foundation & Institute also claimed the government of Ontario didn’t seek permission to use or edit Reagan’s speech, although it’s not clear it was legally required to. The foundation said it was reviewing its legal options and encouraged people to  watch the unedited speech .\n \n\n   \n  The ad has run many times during high-profile events, including during the American League Championship series that featured the Toronto Blue Jays. Starting Friday night, the Ontario-based team will play in the World Series – a great source of national pride for Canadians.\n \n\n   \n  Ontario Premier Doug Ford in a  speech  on October 14 said his government had placed the ad on virtually every major US network because he wanted to “take Ronald Reagan’s words and let’s blast it to the American people.”\n \n\n   \n  “That ad, it’s not a nasty ad,” Ford said. “It’s very factual. And coming from a person like Ronald Reagan, every Republican is going to identify that voice.”\n \n\n   \n  “He was just the best president America has ever seen in my opinion,” Ford, a conservative politician, said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/politics/takeaways-letitia-james-arraignment","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"16:46:00-04:00","title":"Letitia James Pleads Not Guilty to Federal Charges Amid Legal Challenges Over Prosecutorial Authority and Political Motive","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"New York Attorney General Letitia James pleaded not guilty to federal charges of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution, brought by interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan, who was appointed by President Donald Trump after the previous interim attorney served his 120-day term.

Here’s what’s next \n       \n  By Devan Cole, Lauren del Valle, Kara Scannell, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:46 PM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  New York Attorney General Letitia James is set to go to trial in late January on felony charges of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution – if she doesn’t succeed at getting the case dismissed outright.\n \n\n   \n  James was arraigned Friday morning at a federal courthouse in Norfolk, Virginia, where she pleaded not guilty to the pair of charges brought against her by a prosecutor who President Donald Trump put in the job after he complained that investigations into his political foes weren’t moving fast enough.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s no fear today, no fear,” James said outside the courthouse as protesters chanted alongside her. “Because I believe that justice will rain down like water, and righteousness like a mighty stream.”\n \n\n   \n  But it’s possible James doesn’t go to trial on January 26 at all: her attorneys previewed on Thursday and Friday their intent to try to get her case dropped in the coming months on several different grounds.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what to know:\n \n\n   \n    Halligan challenge\n \n\n   \n  James’ lawyers told US District Judge Jamar Walker that they are challenging whether the interim US Attorney for Northern Virginia who brought James’ case, Lindsey Halligan, is lawfully serving in the position.\n \n\n   \n  At Friday’s arraignment, the defense lawyers provided the written version of their arguments against Halligan’s authority, in an indication of how fast the case is moving already.\n \n\n   \n  “Ms. Halligan thus lacked the power to present this case to the grand jury or sign this indictment, and she cannot continue to supervise this prosecution … This Court must reject the Executive Branch’s brazen attempt to sidestep the constitutional and statutory limitations on the appointment of U.S. Attorneys,”  James’ team wrote .\n \n\n   \n  The argument mirrors a similar effort underway in former FBI Director James Comey’s criminal case. Comey, who has pleaded not guilty to allegedly lying in congressional testimony, is another of Trump’s political enemies who Halligan indicted.\n \n\n   \n  Halligan was tapped for the post after Trump pushed out the former interim US attorney, Erik Seibert. Comey’s team is arguing that Seibert had already served the legally allotted maximum of 120 days that someone can serve on a temporary basis before needing to be confirmed by the Senate.\n \n\n   \n  In court papers submitted earlier this week, Comey’s lawyers claimed that Halligan’s appointment after those 120 days had passed means that Trump was not legally able to appoint a new interim attorney and avoid the Senate confirmation process altogether. They called the move a scheme to “circumvent” Congress’ role in the confirmation process.\n \n\n   \n  A judge from South Carolina has been brought in to handle the Halligan issue and the motion in the James case will be added to that docket given the fact that they raise the same legal questions.\n \n\n   \n  It would then be up to the South Carolina judge, Cameron McGowan Currie, to decide whether she should consider them on the same track. Comey’s request is set to be heard by Currie on November 13.\n \n\n   \n  Should James and Comey succeed in persuading the judge that Halligan was unlawfully appointed, it could doom both cases since Halligan was the only prosecutor to sign the indictments.\n \n\n   \n  \n \n\n   \n    Selective and vindictive prosecution bid\n \n\n   \n  James has several other avenues for ridding herself of the charges ahead of trial.\n \n\n   \n  Walker asked Lowell whether he also intends to ask that the case be dismissed based on a claim that the Justice Department is unfairly criminally pursuing her. The judge specifically pointed to a motion to dismiss based on “selective or vindictive prosecution” that is pending in Comey’s case.\n \n\n   \n  Lowell confirmed he’d file such a motion, telling the court it’s “the worst kept secret” that James’ defense attorneys feel she’s being unfairly prosecuted .  But he stressed that his team needed to see more evidence in the case before deciding on the contours of such a claim.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s outspoken dislike for James dates back years. He’s long derided an investigation she led into him and his company as a “witch hunt.” That probe culminated in a $355 million civil judgment last year, though a New York appellate court  recently ruled  the president and his company do not have to pay.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has called James “racist” and “corrupt,” and in 2024, while campaigning for president, said “she ought to be looked at.”\n \n\n   \n  Last month, the president posted publicly on Truth Social a message, which was apparently supposed to be private, to Attorney General Pam Bondi calling on her to move quickly in the investigation into James and others. “Nothing is being done. What about Comey, Adam ‘Shifty’ Schiff, Leticia??? They’re all guilty as hell,” the president wrote.\n \n\n   \n  James’ team has until November 7 to make the selective or vindictive prosecution request. Prosecutors will have until November 21 to respond to it and a hearing on the motion is set for December 5.\n \n\n   \n  Walker also set a separate schedule for any additional requests from James after Lowell hinted at the possibility of them challenging the charges in the case more broadly.  Those potential requests are due by November 17, and the judge said he would hold a hearing on them December 17.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Katelyn Polantz contributed to this report. \n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   \n  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/investing/us-stock-market","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"16:07:00Z","title":"Stocks Rally and Dow Closes Above 47,000 for First Time After Cooler-Than-Expected Inflation Report","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Stocks surged on Friday, October 24, 2025, as cooler-than-expected inflation data from the Consumer Price Index fueled optimism that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in the coming weeks.

is our future’: Europe’s ‘Coalition of the Willing’ vows to increase economic pressure on Russia \n       \n  By Mitchell McCluskey and Catherine Nicholls, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:10 PM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  European leaders vowed to work in coordination to ratchet up the pressure on Russia as the so-called “Coalition of the Willing” met in London to discuss strategies to end the war in Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  The leaders called on more countries to implement sanctions against Russian oil companies after US President Donald Trump unveiled a new wave of sanctions targeting Moscow’s two biggest oil producers, Rosneft and Lukoil.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s measure was followed by the EU rolling out additional sanctions and agreeing to finance Ukraine for the next two years.\n \n\n   \n  Europe faces mounting pressure to settle the protracted conflict as Russian aircraft  incursions  into Europe persist and lethal strikes  damage  Ukraine’s infrastructure.\n \n\n   \n  Despite overtures from Trump and other world leaders to negotiate a resolution, Russian President Vladimir Putin has maintained his maximalist demands on Kyiv to bring the war to an end and refused to agree to an immediate ceasefire.\n \n\n   \n  British Prime Minister Keir Starmer emphasized that Ukrainian security is interlinked with many other countries, including the United Kingdom.\n \n\n   \n  “Ukraine’s future is our future. What happens in the weeks and months ahead is pivotal for the security of the United Kingdom and all our allies across NATO and beyond,” Starmer said.\n \n\n   \n  Last week, the United Kingdom “became the first country to sanction all of Russia’s oil majors,” including the same companies  sanctioned  by the US, Starmer said on Friday.\n \n\n   \n  Starmer said that the “combined impact” of the US, UK and EU sanctions not only impacts the Russian economy but also demonstrates that countries are “all coordinating clearly in our efforts to support Ukraine and effectively doing so.”\n \n\n   \n  The prime minister urged more countries to sanction more Russian oil companies, “to go further, to reduce their dependencies and incentivize third countries to stop buying these tainted resources.”\n \n\n   \n  Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky thanked Trump and Ukraine’s other “partners” who took similar actions, calling the recent oil sanctions a “big step.”\n \n\n   \n  “Diplomacy matters only when it can lead to real decisions. And when it comes to Russia, that dish has many ingredients. The essential ones are real forms of pressure on Russia, sanctions, our long-range capabilities, political pressure, accountability for war crimes, and real actions regarding Russian assets,” the Ukrainian leader said.\n \n\n   \n  Zelensky has made repeated pleas for US-made  Tomahawk missiles  to enable the Ukrainian army to carry out targeted strikes on oil and energy facilities deep inside Russia.\n \n\n   \n  Zelensky first  traveled  to Washington, where Trump denied his request. On Thursday, he  urged  the European Council to provide Ukraine with long-range weaponry.\n \n\n   \n  Strikes continued to hammer Ukraine as the leader traveled to London to engage in the coalition talks. At least three people were killed in Russian strikes that targeted residential areas in Kherson on Friday morning, local authorities said.\n \n\n   \n  “Long-range capability directly strengthens democracy,” Zelensky said at the coalition’s press conference on Friday. “The more losses Putin suffers on his own territory, the fewer assaults he can carry out on the front line, and the faster he will agree to meaningful diplomacy.”\n \n\n   \n  NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte argued that the current moment is the right time to apply more force on Russia, as Putin faces difficulties on the battlefield.\n \n\n   \n  “The truth is that Putin is running out of money, troops, and ideas,” Rutte said.\n \n\n   \n  “Now is the right time to increase the pressure on Russia so we can finally get a fair and just peace for Ukraine,” Rutte said.\n \n\n   \n  Coming on the heels of the “good” meeting with Trump in Washington, Rutte commended the American leader’s new  sanctions , which Rutte said would “starve” Russia’s two largest oil companies.\n \n\n   \n  He added that the measures prove that Trump is “absolutely committed to ending this war and bringing a lasting peace to Ukraine.”\n \n\n   \n    Latest diplomatic talks\n \n\n   \n  Trump called off a diplomatic summit with Putin  scheduled  to be held in Budapest after feeling that the Russian leader was not committed to making progress towards a deal.\n \n\n   \n  The two last met at a  high-profile summit  in Alaska over the summer, from which little progress appeared to emerge.\n \n\n   \n  Since then, Trump had “not seen enough interest” in “moving the ball forward towards peace” from the Russian side, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Instead, Russia’s top economic envoy, Kirill Dmitriev,  arrived  in the United States, where he is expected to meet Trump administration officials “to continue discussions about the  US-Russia  relationship,” sources with knowledge of the visit told CNN exclusively on Friday.\n \n\n   \n  In a  post on X  later Friday, Dmitriev said that his visit was “planned a while ago based on an invitation from the US side.”\n \n\n   \n  In the coalition meeting, Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof remarked that increasing economic pressure on Russia is “the only way to persuade Putin to engage in serious talks.”\n \n\n   \n  The coalition “agreed to be united in our efforts” to counter Russia, Denmark’s Prime Minister, Mette Frederiksen, said.\n \n\n   \n  “I think Putin’s strategy has been to wait for us to stop at some point to give up. But of course, this will never happen,” she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/politics/trump-ends-trade-negotiations-canada","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"15:19:00-04:00","title":"Trump says he’s ending Canada trade negotiations over anti-tariff ad","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump terminated U.S.-Canada trade negotiations in response to a provincial advertisement by Ontario Premier Doug Ford that used a clip from Ronald Reagan's 1987 speech criticizing tariffs.

trade negotiations over  anti-tariff ad \n       \n  By Jessie Yeung, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:19 PM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   President Donald Trump  said on Thursday he was terminating trade talks with Canada, threatening once again to upend the crucial economic relationship between the United States and its second-biggest trading partner.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said he canceled the talks in response to an advertisement released last week by the government of Canada’s Ontario province – which the premier now says he plans to pull – that featured audio from  a speech by former US President Ronald Reagan  criticizing tariffs on foreign goods.\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, Ontario Premier Doug Ford said that after speaking with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, the US ad campaign would pause on Monday “so that trade talks can resume” – but not before it runs during MLB’s World Series games over the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  “Our intention was always to initiate a conversation about the kind of economy that Americans want to build and the impact of tariffs on workers and businesses,” Ford said on X. “We’ve achieved our goal, having reached U.S. audiences at the highest levels. I’ve directed my team to keep putting our message in front of Americans over the weekend so that we can air our commercial during the first two World Series games.”\n \n\n   \n  In the 1987 speech, Reagan lambasted tariffs as hurting “every American worker and consumer” and “triggering fierce trade wars.”\n \n\n   \n  After the ad aired, the Ronald Reagan Foundation claimed it “misrepresents” the speech, and that the Ontario government had not asked permission to use the clip.\n \n\n   \n  While the ad edited the speech and lacked context, the theme of Reagan’s full  five-minute speech , which the Reagan Library has published on  YouTube , is full-throated support for free and fair trade.\n \n\n   \n  Reagan delivered it from Camp David, where he was soon to meet the prime minister of Japan at a time when American sentiment for the country was eroding after its companies flooded America’s market with inexpensive cars and electronics.\n \n\n   \n  Reagan had just placed higher tariffs on various Japanese products to try to stem the damage the imports of cheap Japanese semiconductors had done to US manufacturers. But Reagan was clear: he was “loath” to take that action and believed high tariffs had exacerbated the Great Depression.\n \n\n   \n  Yet by Thursday night, Trump had taken to social media to blast the ad.\n \n\n   \n  “The Ronald Reagan Foundation has just announced that Canada has fraudulently used an advertisement, which is FAKE, featuring Ronald Reagan speaking negatively about Tariffs,” he wrote on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  He claimed the ad aimed to “interfere with the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court, and other courts,” and defended tariffs as critical to the US economy and national security.\n \n\n   \n  “Based on their egregious behavior, ALL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WITH CANADA ARE HEREBY TERMINATED,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  In a  separate Truth Social post  Monday, Trump incorrectly stated that Reagan supported tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  “They fraudulently took a big buy ad saying that Ronald Reagan did not like Tariffs, when actually he LOVED TARIFFS FOR OUR COUNTRY, AND ITS NATIONAL SECURITY,” Trump posted. “Thank you to the Ronald Reagan Foundation for exposing this FRAUD.”\n \n\n   \n  Carney said Friday his country “can’t control the trade policy of the US.”\n \n\n   \n  “We recognize that that policy has fundamentally changed from the policy in the 1980s, 1990s, the 2000s, and it’s a situation where the United States has tariffs against every one of their trading partners in different countries,” he told reporters shortly before boarding a plane to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\n \n\n   \n  Carney said that tariff negotiations with the US had yielded “a lot of progress.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has also reached out to the office of Dominic LeBlanc, the minister overseeing US-Canada trade.\n \n\n   \n  Ford had first posted the ad online on October 16, writing in a caption: “Using every tool we have, we’ll never stop making the case against American tariffs on Canada. The way to prosperity is by working together.”\n \n\n   \n  A disclaimer under the ad states that it was not approved or sponsored by the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library or the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation.\n \n\n   \n  Along with its statement, the Ronald Reagan Foundation offered a link to the full unabridged version of Reagan’s decades-old speech — in which he speaks at greater length about why he opposes tariffs. “More than five million American jobs are directly tied to the foreign export business, and additional millions are tied to imports,” he said in one quote, which was not included in the ad.\n \n\n   \n  The description for the full YouTube video lists the speech as “unrestricted” in both access and use.\n \n\n   \n    Growing tension\n \n\n   \n  Since Trump took office, the centuries-long friendship between the US and Canada has  broken down  amid  bruised feelings  over tariffs and Trump’s  threat to make Canada the 51st US state . Many Canadians are boycotting American goods, and refusing to travel to the US.\n \n\n   \n  Canada has long been one of the US’ top trading partners; last year, the US imported $411.9 billion worth of goods from Canada, according to government figures.\n \n\n   \n  But Canada’s economy has been hit hard by Trump’s steep sectoral tariffs on autos, steel, aluminum, lumber, and energy — some of the country’s key exports to the US. Those fall under the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which Trump brokered during his first term and will be under mandatory review next year. Canada’s unemployment rate is now at its highest point in nine years.\n \n\n   \n  “This is the last thing that either country needs,” Jack Buffington, director of the supply chain program at the University of Denver, told CNN after Trump’s announcement. “We need to stabilize the North American supply chain, particularly given the challenges that the US has with China.”\n \n\n   \n  Carney won an election in April with a strident message for Canadians, warning that their relationship with America would change dramatically in the coming years. He has fostered relationships with other Western countries instead; on Thursday, before Trump’s post, he had announced on X that Canada plans to double its non-US exports in the next decade.\n \n\n   \n  “Our core mission is to build a stronger economy — one that doesn’t rely on a single trade partner,” he wrote on X.\n \n\n   \n  The economic relationship has reached a boiling point several times over the course of Trump’s second term. Earlier this year, in the relationship’s tensest moment, Ford threatened to halt exports of Canadian electricity to the United States, which would have sent US energy bills surging. But he ultimately backed off that threat. Trump has also threatened to call off talks with Canada in the past, only to restore negotiations.\n \n\n   \n  Tensions have eased slightly in recent months, however, with  Carney meeting Trump  at the Oval Office earlier this month. There, Trump joked about a “merger” of the two countries but also praised his counterpart as a “world-class leader.”\n \n\n   \n  LeBlanc, the Canadian trade minister, said negotiators for both countries had left with directions to “quickly land deals” on steel, aluminum and energy. He described the meeting between leaders as “successful, positive, substantial.”\n \n\n   \n  That brief warming, it seems, is over — at least for now.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/politics/beth-yusi-fired-letitia-james-case-information-email","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"12:49:00-04:00","title":"Prosecutor Who Resisted Bringing Charges Against NY AG Was Fired After Allegations She Sent Case Info to Her Personal Email","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Federal prosecutor Beth Yusi, who led resistance against bringing mortgage fraud charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James, was fired after it was alleged she sent personal identifying information of James to her private email.

Several people familiar with the matter told CNN the memo was carefully reviewed by people involved in bringing the indictment before it was presented to a grand jury.\n \n\n   \n   This story was updated to include new information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/us/tennessee-plant-explosion-update","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"15:12:00Z","title":"Tennessee Explosives Plant Blast Kills 16, Investigation Ongoing","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A devastating explosion at Accurate Energetic Systems in Tennessee, a company that produces military and mining explosives, killed 16 employees on October 10, 2025.

\n       \n  By Holly Yan, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:12 PM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The catastrophe at a  Tennessee explosives plant  started in a building that made devices used for mining and detonated more than 24,000 pounds of explosives, authorities said Friday.\n \n\n   \n  The October 10 disaster killed 16 employees at  Accurate Energetic Systems , which makes military and demolition explosives about 60 miles west of Nashville. The blast was so intense, it registered as a 1.6 magnitude earthquake, according to data from the  U.S. Geological Survey .\n \n\n   \n  Fourteen of the victims were quickly identified with the help of  rapid DNA testing . But two weeks later, the remaining two victims’ remains have not been found, Humphreys County Sheriff Chris Davis said.\n \n\n   \n  The searches for the victims and the cause of the blast have been treacherous, with debris hurled miles away and  possible landmines scattered  throughout.\n \n\n   \n  While the cause of the blast remains a mystery, investigators have figured out where the calamity started, said Brice McCracken, special agent in charge at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives’ National Center for Explosives Training and Research.\n \n\n   \n  The “blast seat” was Building 602, a 15,000-square-foot structure that made explosives used for mining, McCracken said. By the end of the disaster, about 24,000 to 28,000 pounds of explosives had been detonated.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators have theories about what might have caused the explosion, said Jamey VanVliet, special agent in charge of the ATF’s Nashville Field Division. But he declined to name those theories or speculate on a potential cause as the investigation continues.\n \n\n   \n    Another half ton of explosives found\n \n\n   \n  During their dangerous search, authorities scoured 500 acres of wooded property looking for victims and explosive hazards, McCracken said.\n \n\n   \n  They found about 1,000 pounds of undetonated explosives, all of which were safely disposed of, he said.\n \n\n   \n  “There is no indication of threat to public safety,” VanVliet said.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators have spent “nearly every daylight hour processing this enormous scene” over the past two weeks, VanVliet said Friday.\n \n\n   \n  “Today, that part of our work – processing the scene – is complete,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The next phase of the investigation will happen at ATF labs and testing facilities, where evidence will be examined in hopes of finding the cause of the tragedy.\n \n\n   \n    ‘2 souls’ have yet to be found\n \n\n   \n  Authorities have identified the 16 victims as Jason Adams, Erick Anderson, Billy Baker, Adam Boatman, Christopher Clark, Mindy Clifton, James Cook, Reyna Gillahan, LeTeisha Mays, Jeremy Moore, Melinda Rainey, Melissa Stanford, Trenton Stewart, Rachel Woodall, Steven Wright and Donald Yowell.\n \n\n   \n  “It really saddens me that we still have two souls that we have not been able to locate,” the sheriff said Friday. “I’ve talked with both of those families last night and this morning. We still have some testing to do,” which Davis said he hopes will be completed in the coming days.\n \n\n   \n  In recent years, safety concerns have been raised at the plant. Federal records show the plant faced fines several years ago related to workplace safety practices.\n \n\n   \n  The Occupational Safety and Health Administration  fined  the company $7,200 after a 2019 inspection found violations related to personal protective equipment, employee exposure to contaminants and inadequate safety training, among other citations. The company contested the findings and eventually reached a formal settlement, OSHA records show.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement posted on its website, Accurate Energetic Systems said it is “shocked and devastated” by the loss of 16 employees.\n \n\n   \n  “These team members are our family, our friends, our neighbors – it is impossible to comprehend,” CEO Wendell Stinson said.\n \n\n   \n  “We maintain high industry standards and have regular reviews by state and federal regulators, and we also lead our industry with significant roles within national safety organizations.

\nUpdated: \n        3:52 PM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Here’s a rundown of what got more expensive in  September’s Consumer Price Index  report — as well as a couple of key areas where consumers are seeing relief.\n \n\n   \n  But first, a caveat: Monthly data can be quite volatile — and that could be even more volatile amid federal cuts and BLS staffing limitations that have impacted how data is collected — so it’s important to look at longer-term trends.\n \n\n   \n    At the grocery store\n \n\n   \n  Grocery prices bolted higher in August, rising 0.6%, which was the highest in nearly three years; however, in September, they rose at a comparably modest 0.3%. For the year, they’re running below overall inflation at a 2.7% rate, BLS data shows.\n \n\n   \n  The dairy case is doing its part to cool down overall food-at-home inflation: Egg prices have dropped after the  avian flu-related issues were resolved , and plentiful production and supply for milk and butter and food oils have kept price hikes at bay.\n \n\n   \n  The same can’t be said for other aisles in the grocery store.\n \n\n   \n   Beef and veal:  In September, prices for uncooked beef roasts rose 4.8%, their largest increase in four years. The broader beef and veal index rose 1.2% in September and is up 14.7% from a year before.\n \n\n   \n   In recent months, the average price of beef has hit record highs, a milestone caused by a  yearslong trend  of drought, shrinking herds and the rise of imported beef.\n \n\n   \n   Lunchmeats:  The beef trend doesn’t bode well here. Prices of the handy sandwich fixings rose 4.2%, the largest on record for the category.\n \n\n   \n   Fresh sweetrolls, coffeecakes, doughnuts:  Cue the “d’oh” from the doughtnut-loving crowd. In September, prices for these delectable baked goods rose 5.7%. That’s the highest monthly increase for that category in more than 26 years.\n \n\n   \n  It’s likely one part lagged effect from prior price spikes in main ingredients (like eggs wheat, spices and sugar) and one part post-pandemic changes in consumer demand and labor patterns, BLS researchers noted earlier this year when analyzed baked goods prices.\n \n\n   \n   Coffee:  America’s favorite caffeinated beverage actually got cheaper in September — this index fell by 0.1%. But this is where that monthly caveat comes in hand: September’s little dip comes after seven consecutive months of price hikes ranging from 0.9% to 3.6%.\n \n\n   \n  For the year, coffee prices are up 18.9%. It’s even worse if you like the quick fix of instant — that’s up 21.7%, which is the highest annual inflation since the summer of 1995.  And it’s very possible it won’t stop there  if President Donald Trump follows through on his threat to enact steeper tariffs on Colombian shipments. Key coffee-exporter Brazil also faces a 50% levy.\n \n\n   \n    The services economy\n \n\n   \n   At-home care for elderly and people with disabilities : Prices here soared 7% in September, marking the highest-ever monthly increase for this category (which the BLS started tracking in December 2005). On an annual basis, they’re up 11.6%.\n \n\n   \n  Health care costs are on the rise, and that’s especially been the case for the care economy, where providers are  facing funding shortfalls  (that have been exacerbated by new budget cuts). That has contributed to low wages, which have led to worker shortages (now exacerbated by  immigration reductions ), which in turn have resulted in care deserts, further putting upward pressure on prices — and, in turn,  negative labor market outcomes .\n \n\n   \n   Admission to sporting events:  The kick-off to football season came with a heftier hit to the pocketbook. The price for fandom went up 3.7% from August, according to BLS data, which accounts for seasonality.\n \n\n   \n  On an annual basis, sporting event tickets are down by about 6.9%; however, this category might be highlighting a “K-shaped economy” trend that’s influencing pricing.\n \n\n   \n  “Consumers at the higher end of the income spectrum are still spending relatively freely on discretionary services, and that is putting upward pressure on airfares and on hotel prices” and other related categories, said Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon.\n \n\n   \n   Airline fares:  Ticket prices were up 2.7% on a monthly basis, further driving the annual rate to 3.2%.\n \n\n   \n    Tariff effect on goods\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s substantial and widespread tariffs are having an effect on overall inflation, but instead of a surge, the pass-through to consumers has been  ongoing, gradual and uneven  (for a multitude of reasons).\n \n\n   \n  It’s a slow bleed that’s expected to continue into early next year, but some of the impacts are already being felt.\n \n\n   \n  “The grocery segment, of course, is one of the prime ones,” Daco said. “Yes, we do produce some fruits and vegetables and some meat, but we also import a lot of produce and other items that are in our grocery stores.”\n \n\n   \n  So, it makes sense why products like bananas (+6.9% annually), canned fruits and vegetables (+5%)   and sugar and sweets (+6.7%) are rising at their fastest annual rates in years.\n \n\n   \n  The tariffs are also showing up in other non-grocery goods that saw notable price increases in September:\n \n\n   \n   Watches:  Monthly price shifts in this category can be quite volatile; however, the trend in recent years — as with many other goods — is generally one of falling prices. That wasn’t the case in August, when watch prices went up 1.9%, or in September, when they rose 3.2%, bringing the annual rate to 6.6%.\n \n\n   \n  In August, the United States imposed a 39% tariff on Switzerland,  which is one of the top exporters of watches to America .\n \n\n   \n   Boys’ apparel:  The back-to-school shopping season was met with plenty of sticker shock in August, and that continued in September. This category rose 2.6%, which was the largest monthly increase in more than a year.\n \n\n   \n  Many articles of clothing and accessories are made outside the United States in countries such as Bangladesh, China, India and Vietnam,  leaving them greatly exposed to tariffs .\n \n\n   \n   Furniture and appliances:  Shelter-related services inflation, which carries the biggest weight in the CPI, slowed further in September. But the prices of goods that fill homes definitely did not.\n \n\n   \n  “Other furniture,” which can include desks, bookcases and the like, saw price increases of 1.9%, the highest in nearly two years and is at its highest annual inflation rate in nearly three years. There’s a similar story for appliances, which are up 1.3% from the year before (after a 0.8% rise in September).\n \n\n   \n  Trump in recent months extended tariffs to  appliances  and has vowed to enact  even more “substantial” tariffs on furniture .\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/politics/hakeem-jeffries-zohran-mamdani","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"15:00:00Z","title":"Hakeem Jeffries Endorses Zohran Mamdani for NYC Mayor","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has endorsed Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for Mayor of New York City, ending months of hesitation and internal party division.

\n  By Aaron Blake, Alex  Leeds Matthews, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:10 PM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump canceled trade talks with Canada on Thursday, citing a recent ad released by the government of Canada’s Ontario province that quoted former President Ronald Reagan’s  1987 radio address to the nation on fair trade .\n \n\n   \n  Trump said the  ad , which aired in the US, was “fake,”  though it was in fact edited  using real clips from Reagan’s five-minute talk ahead of a meeting on trade with Japan’s prime minister.\n \n\n   \n  CNN analyzed key excerpts from the speech below. Quotes from the ad are highlighted.\n \n\n   \n  As you might notice, the Reagan comments the government of Ontario used actually came in the context of him levying new tariffs against Japan — rather than a general broadside against the concept of tariffs. This reinforces that Reagan did sometimes use tariffs. He emphasized not just free trade, but fair trade.\n \n\n   \n  In this case, he accused Japan of failing to abide by a 1986 agreement and allowing for the  dumping of semiconductor chips into the markets , which harmed American producers’ ability to compete. He levied 100% tariffs on Japanese laptop computers, power tools and television sets, among other items. It was the first major trade retaliation against Japan since World War II.\n \n\n   \n  Reagan’s remark that he is “loathe” to impose tariffs is where we start to get into the contrast with Trump’s approach, which has been to levy huge tariffs on many countries in the service of negotiating. Reagan White House officials repeatedly emphasized this was a step they didn’t want to take, but they had their hand forced. “Nobody wants a trade war, but nobody wants to be a patsy either,” Reagan White House chief of staff Howard Baker  said  shortly before the tariffs were announced.\n \n\n   \n  This section is another notable difference from Trump. While Trump initially billed his tariffs as being about unfair trade policies, that justification quickly came into question. He’s justified his tariff threats using a multitude of reasons, including sometimes  dubious claims of alleged drug-trafficking , Denmark  refusing to sell Greenland  to the United States, and most recently on Thursday, him being upset about an ad from the government of Ontario. The formula for Trump’s initial “Liberation Day” worldwide tariffs also, quite notably, was focused not on specific unfair trade policies,  but rather trade imbalances .\n \n\n   \n  The line about “free trade” and also “fair trade” was indeed a theme of Reagan’s presidency. But Reagan also frequently emphasized that his tendency was toward the free side of trade. He routinely derided the protectionism that Trump now hails.\n \n\n   \n  “Today, protectionism is being used by some American politicians as a cheap form of nationalism,” he said in 1988, crediting Americans for rejecting “the siren song of protectionism.”\n \n\n   \n  “So-called protectionism is almost always self-destructive, doing more harm than good even to those it’s supposed to be helping,” he said in 1985. And contrary to Trump’s posture about unequal trade, Reagan said in 1987 that “protectionism is not the way to resolve our trade imbalance.”\n \n\n   \n  Reagan often railed against Smoot-Hawley, a package of large tariffs signed into law in 1930 that many historians indeed say worsened the Great Depression. Trump has taken the polar opposite view. He  claimed in April  that the depression “would have never happened if they had stayed with the tariff policy. It would have been a much different story.”\n \n\n   \n  This epitomizes the differences between Trump and Reagan on tariffs. Trump has  hailed the power of tariffs  and the impact they could have on American manufacturing. He has called tariffs the “most beautiful word in the dictionary.” Reagan, by contrast, generally cast tariffs as a necessary evil that sometimes needed to be invoked — and cast arguments that tariffs are pro-American as political pandering.\n \n\n   \n  Reagan was clear that he viewed trade wars as bad and best to be avoided. Trump has said that “ trade wars are good, and easy to win .”\n \n\n   \n  Trump is currently going much further than even many congressional Republicans seem comfortable with on his tariffs. But the situation with Reagan was often the opposite. Congress back then tried to go further than Reagan on tariffs, and he repeatedly  vetoed bills he viewed as too protectionist .\n \n\n   \n  If there’s some commonality between Reagan and Trump, it’s in how neither wanted to be constrained by Congress on this issue. Reagan here was referring to an effort in Congress that called for even tougher retaliation against countries like Japan. He later  vetoed the legislation .\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/politics/social-security-cola-increase-2026","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"14:08:00Z","title":"Social Security Monthly Benefits Will Increase 2.8% in 2026","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Social Security recipients will receive a 2.8% increase in monthly benefits in 2026, based on a 3% inflation rate in September 2025, following a period of high inflation in 2022.

However, many seniors say the annual adjustments haven’t been enough to cover their ever-rising expenses.\n \n\n   \n  The increase for 2026 is larger than the  2.5% cost-of-living-adjustment  that beneficiaries received for this year, but far smaller than the ones for the few years before that, when inflation was running rampant.\n \n\n   \n  Monthly payments for retired workers will rise by about $56 to an estimated average of $2,071 starting in January, the agency said. Nearly 71 million senior citizens, people with disabilities and others receive Social Security benefits.\n \n\n   \n  (A total of 75 million Americans receive either Social Security or Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits from the agency. Some receive both.)\n \n\n   \n  The annual adjustment, known as a COLA, is based on an inflation metric from the third quarter of the year. Inflation has moderated after being at around a four-decade high in 2022, which resulted in an  8.7% adjustment  for 2023.\n \n\n   \n  A related metric, the Consumer Price Index,  rose 3%  in September compared with a year ago, the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced Friday.\n \n\n   \n  The COLA increase was scheduled to be announced last week but was  delayed  by the federal government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  A good chunk of beneficiaries’ COLA for 2026 will likely be erased by an increase in Medicare Part B premiums, which is expected to be released next month. The monthly premium for 2026 is forecast to jump to more than $206, up from $185 this year, according to Medicare’s most recent trustees report. That would be about twice the increase for 2025.\n \n\n   \n  For the average beneficiary, the higher projected Medicare premium would eat away at nearly half the bump in Social Security benefits, Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, an advocacy group, said in a statement. For some, the premium increase would consume their entire COLA.\n \n\n   \n    Not keeping up with expenses\n \n\n   \n  Social Security recipients have long complained that the annual COLA has not kept up with their actual expenses. In fact, the benefits lost 20% of their  buying power  between 2010 and 2024, according to an analysis last year from The Senior Citizens League. Those who retired in 2010 would need a boost of $370 a month, or $4,443 a year, on average, to regain the lost value.\n \n\n   \n  Over the last decade, the annual increase has been about 3.1%, on average, according to Social Security. Since it is based on the prior year’s inflation rate, it may not reflect the change in prices that beneficiaries are currently experiencing.\n \n\n   \n  Also, AARP has advocated for the COLA formula to better represent senior citizens’ costs, particularly since they typically have higher health care expenses.\n \n\n   \n  “The CPI for working Americans doesn’t quite capture what the spending patterns are for older Americans,” Joel Eskovitz, senior director of Social Security at AARP’s Public Policy Institute, told CNN. “It’s close, but there are just different things that working Americans spend on than retired Americans.”\n \n\n   \n    Looking for help and cutting back\n \n\n   \n  Many retirees depend heavily on Social Security — it’s the primary source of income for 40% of older Americans, according to AARP.\n \n\n   \n  While Sam Ciraulo is appreciative of any bump in benefits, he said it won’t be enough to buy a tank of gas.\n \n\n   \n  A retired adjunct professor who resides in Sacramento, California, Ciraulo lives off roughly $1,400 in monthly Social Security benefits and food stamps. The COLA is expected to increase his payment by about $40, but he thinks about half of it will go to the Medicare Part B premium hike.\n \n\n   \n  Ciraulo, 68, has already had to turn to nonprofits and religious groups for assistance, mainly to pay for his utilities. He has a rare neurological disease that requires him to keep his house cool. However, he’s had a harder time securing aid lately since the organizations are either tapped out, overwhelmed with requests or have shuttered.\n \n\n   \n  “When I see the electricity bill, when I go to pay it every month, I have to think about what I’m going to cut in order to be able to pay that bill or where I’m going to go to get help to pay that bill from nonprofits,” said Ciraulo.\n \n\n   \n  For Joyce Clarke, the annual adjustments don’t “even come close” to the rising costs of her gas, rent, groceries and electricity. Last year’s COLA was eaten up by the rent increase at her senior housing complex.\n \n\n   \n  She called the 2.8% boost “an insult.”\n \n\n   \n  This year, the retired executive assistant had to stop buying fresh beets after the price rose from 89 cents to $1.19 at her local supermarket. Instead, she stocks up on canned beets during her bimonthly trips to Walmart.\n \n\n   \n  And she hasn’t gone to her favorite Italian restaurant, where she would get pasta, salad and garlic bread for $15, since Christmas.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a luxury I can’t afford,” said Clarke, 79, who lives in Riverside, California.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/us/gregory-bovino-chicago-immigration-tear-gas-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"12:30:00-04:00","title":"Top Border Patrol official accused of violating judge’s use-of-force order by throwing tear gas at Chicago protesters","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Senior Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino is accused of violating a court-ordered restriction on aggressive crowd control tactics by allegedly throwing tear gas canisters at protesters in Chicago’s Little Village neighborhood during an anti-ICE demonstration.

By Amanda Musa, Hanna Park, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:30 PM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Senior Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino is accused of throwing at least one  tear gas canister into a crowd of protesters  in a Chicago neighborhood Thursday in a potential violation of a judge’s order restricting federal agents from using aggressive crowd control tactics during anti-ICE protests.\n \n\n   \n  A new court filing against the Department of Homeland Security alleges Bovino “apparently threw tear gas into a crowd without justification” during a protest against federal immigration authorities in Chicago’s Little Village neighborhood.\n \n\n   \n  The notice of alleged violation was filed by a combination of media groups, individual protesters and Chicago-area clergy members who earlier this month  obtained a temporary restraining order  from US District Judge Sara Ellis after suing DHS and Trump officials over federal agents’ tactics against protesters. Ellis was appointed by former President Barack Obama.\n \n\n   \n  Bovino, 55, has  emerged as the on-the-ground face  of President Donald Trump’s effort to surge federal law enforcement into Democratic-led states and cities regardless of whether local officials want them there.\n \n\n   \n  The new court filing cites a Facebook video post that shows Bovino throw an object toward protesters Thursday morning. The video, which CNN has viewed, does not show clearly what happened in the minutes leading up to the alleged incident or if any warnings were given.\n \n\n   \n  “Defendant Bovino appears to throw either one or two tear gas canisters over the heads of armed federal agents in front of him and in the direction of a crowd of individuals protesting, including an individual filming the encounter,” the filing from Thursday states.\n \n\n   \n  Ellis’  sweeping order  restricts agents’ crowd control tactics, use of force and actions against journalists and others at protests in Chicago, but it includes exceptions for individuals who pose a threat to law enforcement or others. During a hearing  last week , she said she had concerns about whether her order was being followed.\n \n\n   \n  Bovino is one of more than a dozen administration officials named as defendants in the lawsuit filed earlier this month, which accuses federal agents of “a pattern of extreme brutality” intended to “silence the press and civilians.”\n \n\n   \n  “Riot control measures were deployed, including by Bovino, and arrests were made. Agents properly used their training,” DHS said in a Friday post on  X . “The use of chemical munitions was conducted in full accordance with CBP policy and was necessary to ensure the safety of both law enforcement and the public.”\n \n\n   \n  Hours before the court filing alleging a possible violation of the judge’s order, Bovino defended federal agents’ conduct in the Chicago area during an  interview with CBS News .\n \n\n   \n  “The use of force I’ve seen has been exemplary. By exemplary, I would say the least amount of force necessary to accomplish the mission,” Bovino said, in response to attacks he’s seen carried out on federal agents by “extremists and others.”\n \n\n   \n  Protests in Chicago have ramped up since federal agents were deployed on the city’s streets early September during what the Trump administration has titled “ Operation Midway Blitz, ” a targeted crackdown on illegal immigration that has led to over 1,000 arrests.\n \n\n   \n  Federal agents’ response to the demonstrations has drawn widespread outcry, notably when  an area pastor  was  seen on video  being shot in the head with pepper balls by officers perched on the roof of the Broadview ICE facility near Chicago.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, Bovino insisted such tactics do not necessarily violate DHS policy, telling CBS: “If someone strays into a pepper ball, then that’s on them. Don’t protest, and don’t trespass.”\n \n\n   \n  Ellis has ordered Bovino be deposed in the case and a preliminary injunction hearing is set for November 5. On Thursday, the court expanded Bovino’s deposition time to five hours.\n \n\n   \n  Bovino, who formally heads Border Patrol’s El Centro sector in California, has been leading the federal crackdown in Chicago after helming similar operations in Los Angeles earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  His heavy-handed tactics, including immigration sweeps in parking lots and smashing car windows, have fueled consternation among some in the Trump administration while also garnering praise from senior Homeland Security officials.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker announced the creation of the  Illinois Accountability Commission  “to pursue accountability for the people of Illinois,” amid the surge in federal immigration enforcement in his state.\n \n\n   \n  The commission is charged with creating a public record of federal enforcement abuses, capturing the impact of the enforcements on families and communities in Illinois, and recommending actions to “prevent further harm and to pursue justice,” Pritzker said.\n \n\n   \n  Criticism over federal authorities’ tactics in Chicago comes amid the broader legal battle over Trump’s push to deploy National Guard troops in the city.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, US District Court Judge April Perry  ordered an extension  of the order blocking the deployment of Guard troops to Chicago through final judgment. The Trump administration is urging  the Supreme Court  to allow the deployment.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/politics/california-redistricting-kevin-mccarthy","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"12:05:00-04:00","title":"Republican tensions rise over Kevin McCarthy’s faltering push to fight California redistricting","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Republican efforts to stop California’s Proposition 50 redistricting measure have collapsed due to a massive shortfall in fundraising and campaign spending.

tensions rise over Kevin McCarthy’s faltering push to fight California redistricting \n       \n  By Arit John, Sarah Ferris, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:05 PM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  This summer, a fired-up Kevin McCarthy vowed to personally lead the fight against  California Democrats’ redistricting push , aiming to raise $100 million to help protect Republican lawmakers in his home state.\n \n\n   \n  But in the final weeks of the high-stakes election, the former GOP speaker has fallen massively short of that mark, according to people familiar with the fundraising goal he set. That has required more direct involvement from both the White House and GOP leadership, those people said.\n \n\n   \n  Republicans acknowledge that they always faced an uphill battle to defeat Democratic  Gov. Gavin Newsom  on the referendum, known as Proposition 50, in a state where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by 4.5 million voters. But multiple Republicans told CNN that McCarthy and the groups involved in the campaign squandered a critical early window to craft a compelling message and raise the financial resources necessary to compete.\n \n\n   \n  Now, even some senior House GOP leaders privately concede the measure is on track to pass, another Republican source said.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it is an opportunity that is being wasted,” one House GOP lawmaker from California told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “A lot of people are frustrated … a lot of money could have gone into this,” the member said, noting that the fundraising is “nowhere near what normally happens in an election cycle.”\n \n\n   \n  This lawmaker was among several Republicans who told CNN that they had been expecting a major influx of GOP cash that simply did not materialize.\n \n\n   \n  Groups opposing Proposition 50 have spent a total of about $31 million so far on TV advertising while groups supporting the measure have spent more than $80 million, according to the media tracking firm AdImpact. That gap has grown over the last four weeks, over which the “No” side has spent just $3 million on ad time, while the “Yes” side has spent more than $40 million.\n \n\n   \n  McCarthy’s committee was meant to ramp up its spending in the final weeks of the campaign, a source familiar with the “No” side’s thinking told CNN. But that spending didn’t materialize to the level Republicans hoped. The group, “No on 50 – Stop Sacramento’s Power Grab,” has raised just $11.4 million, according to recent campaign finance data.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not raising money at a time when it really desperately needs those resources,” the source said. “So, the prognosis for this specific campaign doesn’t look terribly good.”\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for McCarthy didn’t respond to requests for comment. But Jessica Millan Patterson, a former state GOP party chair who is running the McCarthy-backed committee, said her group would continue working to oppose the measure despite the spending disadvantage.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to continue to raise the money that’s necessary to get out the vote, to make sure that we are persuading individuals that can be persuaded, and at the end of the day, make sure that we defeat this partisan power grab,” she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  She also pushed back on reports that McCarthy planned to raise $100 million.\n \n\n   \n  “I think Politico is confused,” she told CNN, referencing the outlet that first reported the total. “That’s a number that the Democrats said that they were going to spend, and we are often outspent.”\n \n\n   \n  But multiple sources told CNN that McCarthy had, indeed, told fellow Republicans he was aiming for $100 million and said they expected McCarthy to invest far more than he has for the race.\n \n\n   \n  Some in Trump’s orbit are openly   blaming McCarthy, who resigned from Congress in 2023 soon  after losing his speakership .\n \n\n   \n  Steve Bannon, a longtime McCarthy antagonist who is close to Trump, confirmed that White House officials were frustrated with McCarthy over the redistricting initiative. “Very very pissed,” he wrote in a text message to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “A defeat on Prop 50 makes Newsom the automatic Democrat front runner for ’28 — that’s why it was essential to get the President engaged early in this fight —a fight that could be won,” Bannon said. “The great minds of the Republicans never engaged, leaving us without our best weapon — MAGA.”\n \n\n   \n    Momentum grows for the ‘Yes’ vote\n \n\n   \n  Newsom and fellow Democrats seized national attention by launching their referendum effort following  Texas Republicans’ move  to launch a rare mid-decade redistricting at the behest of President Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats in the California legislature voted to place Proposition 50 on the November ballot in August. If voters approve the measure, it would temporarily replace congressional maps drawn by the state’s independent redistricting commission with new ones crafted by California Democrats. The new lines would be in place through the 2030 election.\n \n\n   \n  The Newsom-backed Yes coalition – made up of unions, advocacy groups and prominent national Democrats including  former President Barack Obama  – has argued that their party must “fight fire with fire” to combat Republican gerrymandering in other states done at the behest of the president.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats are now entering the November 4 election with high confidence.\n \n\n   \n  A CBS/YouGov poll found that 62% of likely California voters plan to or have already voted yes on Proposition 50, including 85% of Democrats, 60% of independents and 22% of Republicans. Thirty-eight percent of likely voters said they would or have already voted no. Half of voters said they were motivated by a desire to oppose the president.\n \n\n   \n  If the measure indeed passes, five Republican-held districts will be redrawn to be more favorable for Democrats, erasing part of the seven-seat advantage Republicans hope to gain from redrawing maps in Texas, Missouri and North Carolina.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has pressured other GOP-led states to redraw their maps as he hopes to prevent Democrats from winning control of the US House in next year’s midterms, giving them power to disrupt the final two years of his second term.\n \n\n   \n    The Republican side still has raised tens of millions\n \n\n   \n  Republicans have still raised some serious money:  Charles Munger Jr. , son of the late Berkshire Hathaway vice chairman Charles Munger, kicked off the opposition’s spending with more than $30 million. The second-biggest funder has been the Congressional Leadership Fund, the super PAC backed by House GOP leadership, which chipped in $13 million.\n \n\n   \n  Corrin Rankin, the chair of the California Republican Party, said the state GOP’s goal has always been to spend wisely and focus on turning out Republican voters.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re always going to be outraised,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Shawn Steel, who is leading the state Republican Party’s efforts, said he had “zero expectations” about the financial resources the California GOP would receive. Still, he aggressively pitched national Republicans in Washington, DC, on fighting Proposition 50 and was able to raise $10.8 million for the party, he said. Steel said he also urged people to back the McCarthy effort.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s gotten some. It hasn’t been insignificant,” said. “I wish he had more funding, because he really knows California very well. He’s the only recent-day Republican that’s gotten a lot of people elected to Congress.”\n \n\n   \n    A more fractured opposition\n \n\n   \n  The “No on 50” coalition has been more fractured than the “Yes” side. Different organizations are working to reach different segments of the voting population.\n \n\n   \n  The California Farm Bureau has been urging their members to oppose the measure as well, arguing that the district lines cut up rural districts in the northern and central parts of the state and combine them with more urban areas.\n \n\n   \n  “This, for us, is not a partisan issue,” said Shannon Douglass, the group’s president.\n \n\n   \n  Munger, who helped fund the ballot initiatives that created the independent commission, has targeted “good government” Democrats and independents who want to preserve the power of the independent commission.\n \n\n   \n  Amy Thoma Tan, a spokesperson for the Munger group, said they’re feeling “cautiously optimistic” about November 4.\n \n\n   \n  “Voters are voting, and they are starting to understand what getting rid of the redistricting commission would do,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The question is what resources will be available to push that message. Thoma Tan declined to say whether Munger would invest more money, pointing to Munger’s recent statement that he will only discuss political strategy after the election.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats, meanwhile, were quick to launch a massive organizing effort both in DC and in Sacramento that led to near-record fundraising levels. One of those organizers, California Rep. Pete Aguilar, the No. 3 House Democrat, said the party has found a way to translate their base’s deep frustration and anger at Trump into tangible action.\n \n\n   \n  “We heard for so many months, ‘Democrats need to do something.’ I think with Prop 50 we are giving people something that can be done,” Aguilar told CNN. “The ‘no’ side kind of underestimated that people wanted to do something. And this is a moment of action.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/entertainment/jelly-roll-cheating-bunnie-weight-loss","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"10:05:00-04:00","title":"Jelly Roll Talks About How His Marriage Survived His Infidelity","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Country music singer Jelly Roll has opened up on a podcast, revealing that he had an affair with his wife Bunnie XO, which was one of the worst moments of his adult life.

mansion in Windsor \n       \n  By Lianne Kolirin and Lauren Said-Moorhouse, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:20 PM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As the scandal surrounding Britain’s  Prince Andrew  continues to make headlines across the world, many are asking whether the disgraced royal will be able to continue living in Royal Lodge, the 30-room mansion that has been his home since 2003.\n \n\n   \n  But how much do we know about the sprawling property in Windsor Great Park that is home to Andrew and his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, and where their daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, spent much of their teenage years?\n \n\n   \n    Why does Andrew live in Royal Lodge?\n \n\n   \n  The late Queen Elizabeth II granted Andrew, the third of her four children, the right to live in the lodge, which is officially owned by the Crown Estate. The prince paid £1 million for the property back in 2003, and under the terms of the 75-year lease, due to expire on June 15, 2078, he is expected to pay for any refurbishment work and the maintenance of the surrounding grounds.\n \n\n   \n  He was also required upfront to pay £7.5 million ($10 million) to cover necessary refurbishments that were completed in 2005, according to a  National Audit Office report.  According to the lease, signed on August 8, 2003, rent “if demanded” was only required to be “one peppercorn” per annum.\n \n\n   \n  The property sits in an estate of 40 hectares (99 acres) and features a swimming pool, an aviary, six lodge cottages, a gardener’s cottage and accommodation for police protecting the royals to stay in.\n \n\n   \n  It is situated within Windsor Great Park, close to Windsor Castle, Frogmore Cottage (where the Duke and Duchess of Sussex previously lived) and Forest Lodge, the Windsor residence of the Prince and Princess of Wales.\n \n\n   \n  There has been intense media speculation in recent days over Prince Andrew’s continued occupancy of Royal Lodge. Buckingham Palace and the Crown Estate both declined to comment over reports that he is in talks to leave the residence.\n \n\n   \n    Two centuries of royal residents\n \n\n   \n  A house has stood on the site since at least the 1660s, although it has undergone considerable updates and renovations since then. Its first links with the royal family came in the early 19th century when George IV, then the prince regent, converted the rustic-styled cottage into a hunting lodge and then private retreat. By the mid-1820s it had become known as Royal Lodge.\n \n\n   \n  After George died in 1830, much of the structure was pulled down by William IV and it was used as a “grace and favor” residence for most of the rest of the century.\n \n\n   \n  The Royal Chapel was added to the site in 1865, but, though situated within the grounds of the lodge, it does not come under the current lease.\n \n\n   \n  The property was rebuilt during the 1930s around a room remaining from George IV’s original cottage.\n \n\n   \n  Prince Andrew’s late mother, Queen Elizabeth II, lived in the lodge as a child, moving there with her parents — then the Duke and Duchess of York — in 1932. The family remained at Royal Lodge until the duke and duchess were crowned four years later, following the abdication of Edward VIII.\n \n\n   \n  Following her husband’s death in 1952 and the coronation of her daughter, Elizabeth II, the Queen Mother used the Royal Lodge as her Windsor residence until her death in 2002.\n \n\n   \n  After his grandmother died, Prince Andrew approached the Crown Estate about acquiring the leasehold on the property. The property was not offered to the wider market because of its sensitive location in the heart of Windsor Great Park and the need for security, given its proximity to the Royal Chapel.\n \n\n   \n    What changes has Andrew made?\n \n\n   \n  The renovation work that Andrew carried out on the family property included internal alterations to the tiled ceiling, external repainting, new tarmac for the gate entrance and light fittings and cameras for outside the lodge, according to a planning application lodged with the Royal Borough of Windsor & Maidenhead.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier planning applications show that the local authorities granted permission to build a single-story property to accommodate police officers protecting the site in 1990, and permission was given for the construction of a conservatory in 2001.\n \n\n   \n    Queen Elizabeth’s fairy-tale playhouse\n \n\n   \n  Also in the grounds is Y Bwthyn Bach, which translates from Welsh as “little cottage.” The miniature thatched cottage was given by the people of Wales to the late Queen Elizabeth II on her sixth birthday and was where she and her sister, Princess Margaret, played as children — as did their children and grandchildren.\n \n\n   \n  In a 2012 BBC documentary called “The Diamond Queen,” Princess Beatrice said she and her sister had been “lucky enough” to play there together with their cousins as children.\n \n\n   \n  She described it as the “most glamorous Wendy house ever” and said that she spent about a year overseeing its renovation. This, she said, involved new wiring, new curtains and completely rethatching the cottage to give it a “bit of a spruce-up.”   \n \n\n   \n  Viewers got to see the princess take host Andrew Marr inside the miniature property, which was fully furnished and complete with furniture, crockery and glassware and a fridge from the 1930s.\n \n\n   \n  In 2018, Prince Andrew and his former wife hosted the wedding celebrations for their younger daughter, Eugenie, and her husband, Jack Brooksbank, at the lodge following the official ceremony at St. George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle.   \n \n\n   \n  In 2020, Eugenie’s sister, Beatrice, tied the knot on the estate itself, marrying Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi in a small ceremony in the chapel while Covid-19 restrictions were in place.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/europe/uk-arson-attack-russia-sentencing-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"12:26:00-04:00","title":"Drug dealer who organized Russia-linked arson attack in UK jailed for 17 years","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Dylan Earl, a 21-year-old drug dealer, was jailed for 17 years for orchestrating a February 2024 arson attack on a Ukrainian-owned warehouse in London that delivered Starlink internet terminals to Ukraine.

He was sentenced to 12 years in prison.\n \n\n   \n  Four others were convicted in July for their roles in the plot to burn down the warehouse on an industrial estate in east London on behalf of Wagner, a Russian mercenary group that has fought in Ukraine and is a proscribed terrorist organization in the UK.\n \n\n   \n   CNN reported from the trial  at London’s Old Bailey court this summer. Courtroom testimony and police evidence unveiled what experts said was a paradigmatic case of Russia’s “shadow” attacks on countries across Europe, in which Moscow has relied not on well-trained agents, but a network of low-level criminals: some sympathetic to Russia’s cause, others simply wanting payment.\n \n\n   \n  Whereas during the Cold War espionage and sabotage required painstaking recruitment and planning, these operations now just require a few hours on Telegram and some cash. Analysts told CNN this tactic is a dark spin on the modern “gig” economy, with hostile actors offering on-demand, no-strings-attached work to a flexible workforce.\n \n\n   \n  The sentencing of Earl and Reeves came after British police on Thursday arrested three men in their forties on suspicion of  spying for Russia . Dominic Murphy, head of the Counter-Terrorism Policing London, said his force was seeing an increasing number of “proxies” being recruited by foreign intelligence services. In September, three others were arrested on the  same charges .\n \n\n   \n  Ken McCallum, the head of MI5, Britain’s domestic intelligence service, warned last year that Russia was on a campaign “to generate mayhem on British and European streets.” Analysts have said the campaign has aimed to show Europe that there are costs to supporting Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  The alleged attacks have included blazes at a shopping mall in Poland and an Ikea store in Lithuania, cyberattacks on Czech railways, and the vandalism of Jewish buildings in France. Russia has denied involvement.\n \n\n   \n  Gabrielius Landsbergis, Lithuania’s former foreign minister, said trying to thwart the campaign felt like playing whack-a-mole: “You catch one and Russia easily replaces them with several others hired through Telegram.”\n \n\n   \n  Hundreds of exchanges on social media, reviewed by CNN during the trial, showed how this new “gig economy” for sabotage functions. Earl, a drug dealer, contacted a now-defunct Telegram account called “Privet Bot,” which prosecutors said was associated with Wagner and between 2023 and 2024 encouraged people to join operations across Europe.\n \n\n   \n  Within days of contacting the account, Earl – whose correspondence revealed sympathy for Russia’s war – had been given his first target for an arson attack, the warehouse owned by a Ukrainian man. Reeves, having spoken with Earl, then recruited others to help carry out the attack.\n \n\n   \n  Nii Mensah was sentenced to nine years’ imprisonment for his role in the attack; Jakeem Rose received eight; and Ugnius Asmena received seven. Ashton Evans, who was involved with Earl in another plot to set fire to a London restaurant and kidnap its owner, was sentenced to nine years in prison. That plot was foiled in April 2024.\n \n\n   \n  Frank Ferguson, head of the Special Crime and Counter Terrorism Division of the Crown Prosecution Service, said the prosecution “marks a pivotal moment in our national security efforts.”\n \n\n   \n  “This case demonstrates how vital the (National Security) Act is in protecting the UK from hostile state activity and ensuring those who seek to undermine our safety and security are held fully accountable,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/business/binance-zhao-trump-pardon","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"11:17:00-04:00","title":"What is Binance, and what CZ’s pardon could mean for US crypto investors","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Changpeng Zhao, known as CZ, the founder of Binance, has received a pardon from President Donald Trump, reigniting debates about wealth-based legal leniency and political influence in the crypto industry.

October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Changpeng Zhao, one of the wealthiest and most influential figures in the cryptocurrency industry, is back in the spotlight this week after  securing a pardon  from President Donald Trump — a reprieve that renews concerns that those with deep pockets have been able to buy their way out of trouble under Trump 2.0.\n \n\n   \n  It is hard to overstate how much Zhao, who goes by “CZ,” has shaped the crypto industry since he launched Binance in 2017 and grew it into the world’s largest trading platform for digital assets.\n \n\n   \n  Put simply: If you want to take, say, $100 from your bank account and use it to buy or sell cryptocurrencies virtually anywhere in the world, Binance facilitates that process, and takes a small fee off of every trade. It also offers more complex financial services like margin trading and “staking,” a way for investors to earn passive returns on their crypto holdings.\n \n\n   \n  Not only is Binance by far the world’s biggest crypto exchange, as measured by both user count (280 million globally) and trading volume (more than $217 billion daily), it boasts  40% of the market share  among centralized crypto exchanges.\n \n\n   \n  But   Binance hasn’t always complied with rules governing the sale of financial services in various jurisdictions, including in the US, which effectively banned the global version of the platform in 2019. (In response, Binance launched a more limited service, Binance.US, though in practice many users within US borders found ways around the ban, according to media reports and the Department of Justice.)\n \n\n   \n  US federal prosecutors said in a 2023 that Binance  had become a hub for bad actors , enabling transactions linked to child sex abuse, narcotics, terrorist financing and money laundering. Binance also lacked protocols — standard for financial services companies — to report transactions for money laundering risks, according to the Justice Department, and employees were well aware that such an oversight would invite criminals to the platform. One compliance staffer wrote, according to court documents:    “we need a banner ‘is washing drug money too hard these days - come to binance we got cake for you.’”\n \n\n   \n  The company and Zhao pleaded guilty in the United States to money-laundering violations. As part of a settlement with the government, Zhao stepped down as CEO, paid a $50 million fine, and served a four-month sentence in federal prison. Zhao still owns an estimated 90% of the company, giving him an estimated net worth of  more than $80 billion , according to Forbes.\n \n\n   \n  Zhao remains synonymous with Binance, and he retained his industry clout even after he went to prison. On Friday, Zhao, a Chinese-born Canadian national who now lives in the United Arab Emirates, reflected on his recent ups and downs,  stating : “My official record was tarnished for a bit, but my reputation held strong. No one, not a single person, stopped doing business with me.”\n \n\n   \n    Why does it matter?\n \n\n   \n  For years, crypto in the United States was a largely theoretical project — a parallel financial system led by a community of extremely online pioneers, who believed the future of money lay in computer networks outside the control of governments or central banks.\n \n\n   \n  But 16 years in, crypto has ballooned to a $3.5 trillion industry with growing exposure to mainstream finance, due in part to Trump’s evolution from skeptic to full-fledged crypto mogul. Just this week, Federal Reserve Board Governor Christopher Waller said  crypto assets “are no longer on the fringes”  and “increasingly are woven into the fabric of the payment and financial systems” — a stunning acknowledgement for an industry that nearly imploded just three years ago with the collapse of FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried’s once high-flying competitor to Binance.\n \n\n   \n  Institutional interest in crypto has shot up with the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs, and Congress recently passed an industry-approved regulatory bill that proponents hope will increase adoption. There’s a long way to go, however, as most Americans (63%) have little or no confidence in crypto as a safe investment,  according to Pew Research.  \n \n\n   \n  Crypto proponents also embraced Trump’s re-election — the industry became the  biggest corporate donor  in the 2024 general election — and Trump embraced crypto right back.\n \n\n   \n  Trump took to crypto with the zeal of the converted, promising to make the United States the “crypto capital” of the world, and even embracing fringe elements that  made many advocates uneasy  — like launching his own memecoin, a kind of souvenir token closely associated with scams, pardoning the notorious founder of the criminal Silk Road marketplace, and calling for the establishment of a national strategic bitcoin reserve, which would enrich early adopters while undermining the anti-establishment ethos of crypto’s founding.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump family’s vast crypto empire is  perhaps the most problematic  of the president’s conflicts of interest, making  earlier ethics debates  over his hotel and casino business interests look downright quaint. There is virtually no cap on how much money can flow to the Trump family via crypto.\n \n\n   \n    The Trumps and Binance\n \n\n   \n  The president’s pardon of Zhao exemplifies those ethical concerns because Binance has direct financial ties to the Trump family’s crypto business.\n \n\n   \n  In March, the Trump family’s World Liberty Financial launched a dollar-pegged token known as a  stablecoin  — popular assets in crypto because their value remains constant, while most other token prices are prone to volatility.\n \n\n   \n  According to  Bloomberg , Binance wrote the basic code to power World Liberty’s stablecoin, USD1, and has promoted the coin to its 280 million users around the globe.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after the coin launched this spring, a UAE-based firm announced it would use USD1 to take a $2 billion stake in Binance — using USD1, a deal that is expected to generate millions in returns for World Liberty, which is controlled jointly by the Trumps and the family of Steve Witkoff, Trump’s Mideast negotiator.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/business/analysis-trump-sanctions-russian-war-machine-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"20:29:00Z","title":"Trump’s sanctions target Russian ‘war ATM,’ but the real test is enforcement","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration announced sweeping new sanctions targeting Russia’s two largest oil producers, Rosneft and Lukoil, marking a significant shift from previous diplomatic engagement and Biden-era restraint.

    9:29 AM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  After nine months of attempting to coax Russia into concessions using only incentives – whether by holding talks on repairing diplomatic relations or hosting a major bilateral summit on US soil – the Trump administration in an unexpected reversal announced “ massive sanctions ” Wednesday on Moscow’s two biggest oil producers.\n \n\n   \n  Just one week earlier, President Donald Trump had backed away from supplying long-range  Tomahawk missiles  to Ukraine after a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who secured an invitation to a second bilateral summit, this time in Budapest.\n \n\n   \n  Secretary of State Marco Rubio, among the more hawkish members of Trump’s Cabinet regarding  Ukraine , was tasked with preparing that summit. But Russia’s uncompromising insistence on addressing what it sees as the “root causes” of the conflict finally hit home at the White House. Trump didn’t want to “waste time” at another summit, he said Wednesday, though he left the door open, suggesting that “we’ll do it in the future.”\n \n\n   \n    Will this dent Russia’s war machine?\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s frustration with Russia had clearly been growing in recent months, as it became clear that his much-touted Alaska summit had failed to stop escalating violence in Ukraine. He even shifted his position on Ukrainian strikes deep inside Russia, increasing intelligence sharing to help Kyiv target military and energy facilities,  sources told CNN  last week.\n \n\n   \n  And yet after multiple threats from Trump to ramp up sanctions against Moscow failed to materialize, and with the call between the two presidents last week suggesting the US leader was still susceptible to Russian persuasion, Wednesday’s move to sanction the Russian oil giants and their subsidiaries blindsided experts.\n \n\n   \n  “It was actually surprising simply because there was always a discrepancy between Trump’s rhetoric and actions,” said Maria Shagina, a senior fellow at the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), in written comments to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “It seems that today Russia has overplayed its hand, and Trump’s patience is wearing thin,” she wrote.\n \n\n   \n  How painful this will be for Russia is something that experts and energy markets are still trying to decipher.\n \n\n   \n    What exactly are the sanctions?\n \n\n   \n  This is the first time Trump has imposed direct sanctions on Russia since he returned to office in January, though in August, his administration declared punishing secondary tariffs on India for its purchases of Russian oil.\n \n\n   \n  The sanctions are typical in the sense that the companies listed – Rosneft and Lukoil, along with dozens of subsidiaries – will have their assets frozen in the United States, and US entities will be banned from doing business with them. Yet most experts agree that targeting Rosneft and Lukoil represents a significant change. Together, the two companies account for about half of Russian oil exports, according to RBC Capital Markets.\n \n\n   \n  In January, the Biden administration went after Russia’s third- and fourth-largest oil companies, Gazpromneft and Surgutneftegaz, in its final package of sanctions. But it left the biggest ones alone, experts say, over fears of triggering global supply disruptions that would lead to higher oil prices.\n \n\n   \n  In a note Wednesday night, Helima Croft, head of Commodities Strategy at RBC, called Trump’s sanctions “the most material move to date by the United States to shutter the Russian war ATM.”\n \n\n   \n    What else is the West doing?\n \n\n   \n  Another first for Trump’s second term here is the appearance (whether by accident or design) of coordinating sanctions with NATO allies, which had been normal practice under the Biden administration.\n \n\n   \n  A week earlier, on October 15, the United Kingdom expanded its sanctions to include Rosneft and Lukoil, and on Wednesday, the European Union also unanimously approved its 19th package of sanctions. That package includes a full transaction ban on Rosneft. And while it stops short of targeting Lukoil, it goes after Litasco, a trading unit of Lukoil in the United Arab Emirates that the European Union describes as “Lukoil’s prominent shadow fleet enabler.”\n \n\n   \n  “This is a clear signal from both sides of the Atlantic that we will keep up collective pressure on the aggressor,” wrote European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who also held a call Wednesday with the US treasury secretary.\n \n\n   \n    How big a blow is this to Russia?\n \n\n   \n  The impact that the new US sanctions could have on the Russian economy is up for debate. Shagina, the IISS senior fellow, points out that the move comes at a “vulnerable point” for Moscow, which faces the double whammy of Western sanctions and what she calls Ukrainian “physical sanctions” with its ongoing drone attacks on Russian energy infrastructure. Those attacks have already contributed to a 20% drop in Russia’s energy revenues so far this year, though Moscow is planning to make up some of the shortfall through tax increases.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a strong signal, but it’s still more of a signal than a huge blow to the Russian economy,” said Janis Kluge of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, a think tank in Berlin. He points out there has been little to no effect so far on the ruble and that the stocks of Lukoil and Rosneft have fallen but “not cratered.”\n \n\n   \n  Experts largely expect that while there may be temporary supply disruptions, Russia will find ways to keep its oil – including that produced by Lukoil and Rosneft – flowing onto global markets.\n \n\n   \n  “Russia has set up a total off-grid infrastructure to be able to keep on supplying its oil to its trading partners, especially in India, especially in China,” said Ajay Parmar, director of oil markets and energy transition at Independent Commodity Intelligence Services (ICIS), a London-based commodities data and analytics firm. He said he believes that the Russians will simply make “adjustments” and create new workarounds.\n \n\n   \n  The lasting impact will depend on the US appetite to tackle those workarounds as they arise, said Richard Bronze, head of geopolitical analysis at Energy Aspects, a data and intelligence firm in London\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not clear yet that the Trump administration, even if it doesn’t get what it wants from Putin, is going to have the resolve and the desire to go down that road,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    Will this dent the global economy?\n \n\n   \n  The big question for both Russia and the global economy, experts say, is how India will respond to these new US sanctions. Citing industry sources, Reuters reported Thursday that Reliance Industries, India’s biggest importer of Russian crude oil, is planning to cut back or stop imports completely, going even further than the letter of the sanctions as US pressure mounts on New Delhi to stop importing Russian oil as a condition for tariff reduction.\n \n\n   \n  For Russia, this would be critical.  India imports 1.5 million to 2 million barrels of Russian crude per day, Parmar estimates, accounting for about 30-40% of all Russian exports.  If those imports were to suddenly stop, “that would leave only China as the big buyer of Russian oil,” he told CNN. “I think it’s unlikely that China would buy all of that lost oil, so some of it may be taken off the market, and that is really the bigger driver for higher oil prices right now,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile multiple trade sources told Reuters Thursday that Chinese state oil majors have suspended purchases of seaborne Russian oil in the wake of the US sanctions – a move that would further strain Moscow’s oil revenues.\n \n\n   \n  Chinese national oil companies PetroChina, Sinopec, CNOOC and Zhenhua Oil will stop dealing in seaborne Russian oil, at least in the short-term, the sources told the agency.\n \n\n   \n  US crude oil prices are down almost 25% from their peak in January, a drop that gave Trump “more room now to impose sanctions,” Kluge pointed out. But the challenge will be avoiding sustained price rises that could hand an unexpected windfall to Moscow and partially offset the impact of sanctions, he said. That would likely mean Trump putting further pressure on OPEC+ to boost oil production, said Parmar. If Trump is successful, price rises could be contained.\n \n\n   \n    Will it bring Putin back to the table?\n \n\n   \n  On their own, these sanctions are nowhere near enough to spark a course correction in Moscow, experts agree. And yet they could signal more difficult times ahead for the Kremlin.\n \n\n   \n  The response from Putin, coming almost 24 hours after the US sanctions announcement, was somewhat contradictory.\n \n\n   \n  The sanctions “will not significantly affect our economic well-being,” he told a group of Russian reporters. “No self-respecting country and no self-respecting people ever make decisions under pressure,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The ultimate economic impact of these new sanctions on Russia is yet to be determined but the political shift is alarming for Moscow, said Kluge, of the German think tank.\n \n\n   \n  “Yes, it could be different tomorrow again,” he said referring to Trump’s approach to Russia.\n \n\n   \n  But “it’s a signal that the previous mode of dealing with Russia in which there was always another chance … another extension to the ultimatum … has actually ended.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/europe/louvre-heist-lift-maker-scli-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"07:29:00Z","title":"Louvre Heist Lift-Maker Capitalizes on Product’s Notoriety with Cheeky Instagram Ad","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A German company, Böcker, which manufactures heavy-duty lifts such as the Agilo model, found itself in the spotlight after being linked to the brazen theft of priceless jewelry from the Louvre Museum in Paris.

publicity.\n \n\n   \n  In a tongue-in-cheek  Instagram  post, the company, based in Werne, northwestern Germany, posted   an image of the scene following the incident and captioned it: “”The next

The Böcker Agilo transports your treasures weighing up to 400kg at 42 meters per minute – whisper-quiet thanks to 230 V E-motor.”\n \n\n   \n  The unidentified thieves, who remain at large, made off with historic jewels worth more than $100 million after breaking into the world-famous Paris museum in broad daylight on Sunday morning, when the museum was already open to visitors. Video footage appears to show that they entered through a second-floor balcony after gaining access with a truck fitted with the lift.\n \n\n   \n  Alexander Böcker, the German company’s managing director and third-generation owner, told CNN in a statement that he and his wife were “shocked” when they first saw the news on Sunday and realized “that our lift had been misused for this robbery.”\n \n\n   \n  Then, once it became clear that nobody had been injured, the business owner’s entrepreneurial spirit kicked in.\n \n\n   \n  “Once the initial shock had subsided, black humour took over,” he said in the statement. “We joked around a bit, had some fun and came up with some initial slogans.”\n \n\n   \n  The feedback to the company’s post, published on Monday, has been “overwhelming” and mostly positive, according to Böcker.\n \n\n   \n  In an interview with Reuters, he said: “Luckily for us, most of the people got the humor and know that we are not involved in the robbery and we were very pleased with the reaction so far.”\n \n\n   \n  The Louvre’s director, Laurence des Cars, told a French Senate committee hearing on Wednesday that the museum’s aging camera system did not cover the eastern balcony of the Apollo Gallery, where the robbers used an angle grinder to break in.\n \n\n   \n  Des Cars told the hearing that the “absolutely obsolete, even absent, technical infrastructure” to monitor the country’s most valuable treasures was a “terrible observation” for the world’s largest museum. She said she had offered her resignation to Culture Minister Rachida Dati after the robbery, but it was rejected.\n \n\n   \n  According to Böcker, the Agilo is mainly used in construction and to transport heavy goods during removals and is not meant to transport people.\n \n\n   \n  The specific model used in the heist was sold to a customer in the Greater Paris area who rents it out, according to Böcker’s statement.

26-year-old slugger, who signed with the Blue Jays organization in 2015 and has played his entire big league career with the team since 2019, has set the world alight in this year’s MLB playoffs – leading Toronto to its first World Series appearance since 1993.\n \n\n   \n  The landmark run has come behind Guerrero Jr.’s  astounding batting ; he’s gone .442 from the plate with 12 RBIs and six home runs this postseason, drawing him level with José   Bautista and Joe Carter for the most homers in Blue Jays  franchise postseason history .\n \n\n   \n  And he has done it all in a single, magical October that has so far seen him be awarded the American League Championship Series (ALCS) MVP after the Blue Jays defeated the  Seattle Mariners  in seven games to advance to the Fall Classic.\n \n\n   \n  Despite this month being legacy defining for the Montreal-born, five-time MLB All-Star, the Guerrero name is already firmly stamped in baseball’s history books.\n \n\n   \n  His father, Baseball Hall of Famer Vladimir Guerrero Sr., was the 2004 AL MVP and a nine-time Major League All-Star who played 16 years in MLB with the Montreal Expos (1996-2003), Anaheim/Los Angeles Angels (2004-2009), Texas Rangers (2010) and the Baltimore Orioles (2011).\n \n\n   \n  Although Guerrero Jr. is now on everyone’s mind in Toronto, it wasn’t his first foray into the baseball limelight in Canada. As a child, he was a  regular  at the ballpark, often accompanying his dad on the field before games.\n \n\n   \n  “And from the time I was very young, I remember always imitating what my dad did on the field,” Guerrero Jr. wrote for  The Players Tribune. \n \n\n   \n  The younger Guerrero detailed that he watched his father and tried to emulate him, even picking up on gameday routines.\n \n\n   \n  “He taped his feet before games … so I taped my feet before games.\n \n\n   \n  “He didn’t wear batting gloves … so I didn’t wear batting gloves.\n \n\n   \n  “He stood a certain way in the batter’s box … so I took the same stance,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  But now the roles are reversed, with his father watching on as the younger Guerrero adds to the family legacy and continues to light up the diamond.\n \n\n   \n  After his son was crowned ALCS MVP in a series where he went yard three times, the older Guerrero showed his support in an  Instagram post  that read: “I’ve seen every sacrifice, every workout, every tear. Watching him become the ALCS MVP is the reward for all of it. You’re great son!”\n \n\n   \n  Despite all of his accolades, Guerrero Sr. never won a World Series, with his closest attempt coming as a designated hitter when he and the Rangers lost the 2010 Fall Classic in five games to the San Francisco Giants. He left MLB the following season to join the Dominican Major League.\n \n\n   \n  “My personal goal is to win a World Series and give the ring to my dad,” Guerrero Jr. said in an interview with  Fox Sports  before the Blue Jays had clinched a World Series berth.\n \n\n   \n  That goal is now within reach after Toronto booked its place in the best-of-seven World Series   against the Los Angeles Dodgers, with Game 1 set for Friday in Toronto.\n \n\n   \n  “It means a lot,” Guerrero Jr. told  CNN Sports ’ Andy Scholes on media day.\n \n\n   \n  “I was not even born when when (the Blue Jays) were in the World Series, you know, but to me, it’s like bring bringing back and trying to win it all is something I always dream with.\n \n\n   \n  “I know everybody here is gonna be 100% to trying to win it all.”\n \n\n   \n  Blue Jays fans across Canada will hold their faith in Guerrero Jr. when he takes to the field, and that’s something the Dominican-Canadian feels when he’s out there.\n \n\n   \n  “They are the best fans ever,” he said speaking to reporters on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “They always bring the energy. They are always there for us.

That’s higher than normal but not out of control \n       \n  By Alicia Wallace, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:56 AM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The cost of living got even more expensive for Americans last month, with prices rising at the fastest pace since the start of the year.\n \n\n   \n  Consumer prices rose 0.3% in September, which drove the annual rate of inflation from 2.9% to 3%, the highest it’s been since January, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data released Friday.\n \n\n   \n  Gas prices, which shot up 4.1% overall and 4.2% for regular unleaded fuel (both the largest monthly increases since August 2023), were the biggest culprit behind the monthly increase, BLS data shows.\n \n\n   \n  Food prices rose at a more moderate pace than they did in August (a month when grocery prices leapt by the highest rate in nearly three years). And housing-related inflation also continued its lengthy slowdown.\n \n\n   \n  Economists were expecting that inflation would continue to pick up speed, rising 0.4% for the month and 3.1% from the year before, according to FactSet estimates.\n \n\n   \n  Excluding food and energy, which can be quite volatile, the core measure of CPI rose 0.2% in September, with an annual inflation rate settling out at 3%.\n \n\n   \n  Although better than economists had expected, Friday’s inflation data is a disconcerting reminder that prices are still rising faster than they typically should.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s a psychological milestone of being back at that 3% level again,” Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, said in an interview with CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Due to inflation, the typical American household is spending $208 more a month in September to purchase the same goods and services as they were a year ago, and $1,043 more a month than they did at the start of 2021, coming out of the pandemic, new data from Moody’s Analytics showed.\n \n\n   \n  The softer inflation reading for September gives a green light to a rate cut from the Federal Reserve, which has a policy meeting next week, wrote Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FwdBonds.\n \n\n   \n  However, Rupkey cautioned that the better-than-expected report might also be painting a rosier picture than actually exists.\n \n\n   \n  “The immediate dangers from Trump 2.0 tariff policies have not yet fed through to inflation overall,” he wrote in a note to investors Friday. “The market will likely hold their applause, however, as one reason inflation is held in check may be due to the economic slowdown seen in many labor market indicators.”\n \n\n   \n  Friday’s report provided further evidence that President Donald Trump’s steep import tariffs are causing certain goods prices to move higher. Categories such as apparel, home furnishings, footwear and appliances all continued to see price increases last month, and a closely watched inflation index (core goods excluding autos) is up 1.3% annually, which is the highest since August 2023.\n \n\n   \n  However, the September report is  somewhat unique in its own right : It’s the first major federal economic report released since the US government shut down on October 1.\n \n\n   \n  September CPI, which was originally scheduled for release on October 15, is being belatedly published so that the government can meet deadlines to make cost of living adjustments for 2026 Social Security payments.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/sport/baseball-world-series-shohei-ohtani-conversation","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"10:57:00+00:00","title":"Was Shohei Ohtani’s NLCS Game 4 the greatest baseball performance ever?

Who wins the World Series? A conversation \n       \n  By Harry Enten, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:57 AM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Baseball fans continue to marvel at  Shohei Ohtani ’s performance in Game 4 of the National League Championship Series.\n \n\n   \n  He hit three home runs and pitched six innings of shutout ball. This left a lot of people wondering and flat out saying it was the greatest postseason effort of all time.\n \n\n   \n  But was it? I discussed that, Ohtani’s overall impact on baseball and the upcoming World Series with my old friend and sports expert Mr. Neil Paine. He runs his  own substack .\n \n\n   \n    Was that the best baseball performance ever?\n \n\n   \n   Harry Enten (HE) : I looked this up and Ohtani is the first pitcher ever to hit two, let alone three home runs in a postseason game. He is also only the 10th pitcher to go for at least six innings, giving up two hits, no runs and striking out at least 10. Is there anything I’m missing here?\n \n\n   \n  Neil Paine (NP): It’s interesting. Technically, there were probably games in history where someone added more total value with either the bat  or  the pitching arm than Ohtani did combined last week. For instance,  there’s a stat called Run Expectancy Added  that tracks how much a batter improved his team’s chances of scoring (or a pitcher reduced the opponent’s chances) – and in that stat, Ohtani graded as a +5.16 between his batting (+3.13) and pitching (2.03). There were  10 playoff games by batters  where someone added more value than Ohtani did overall, and  10 playoff games by pitchers  where they could say the same.\n \n\n   \n  And yet, there’s something about the “unicorn” nature of what Ohtani did that feels like it should get extra credit, beyond what the raw numbers say. None of those 10 batters were also pitching, or vice-versa, and to have one guy do both is almost completely unprecedented.  Babe Ruth ’s best combined Run Expectancy Added in a playoff game that he also pitched was just +4.01.\n \n\n   \n  It’s almost one of those definitional things where, if this is Ohtani’s greatest combined batting/pitching game ever –  and it was , by Run Expectancy – it must also be the best combined game by anybody because he’s the only guy who’s ever really even tried this kind of thing (at least among modern players).\n \n\n   \n   HE : I love the advanced stats there because it does put it all together. You make a fairly convincing case that it wasn’t the “greatest”… but it makes me think we’re looking at the wrong words here.\n \n\n   \n  The right word is historic. Ohtani literally made history. It is one of a kind –i.e. truly unique – even if it wasn’t the greatest.\n \n\n   \n   NP : Or what I really like is what my fellow Substacker (and your fellow Ivy grad)  Doug Glanville  has called what Shohei tends to do: “ Ohtanic .” It’s a special sort of thing that not only hasn’t been done before, but also up until about a decade ago, we didn’t even think was  possible  in the game anymore.\n \n\n   \n    Is Ohtani the best ever?\n \n\n   \n   HE : This I think is part of the Ohtani playbook overall. I saw people online making the statement that Ohtani is the greatest ever or best ever.\n \n\n   \n  But anyone can look it up and see there have been people who have done better. There are people who have hit more home runs, for example. There have been people who have higher  wins above replacement  (or WAR, an advanced statistic that seeks to measure a player’s overall contribution).\n \n\n   \n  But then you look at players who pitched at least 5% of the time. Only Ohtani and Ruth have hit 100 or more home runs. Ohtani has hit nearly 300 homers and has plenty of career left.\n \n\n   \n  He is truly one of a kind for players in the last 90 years.\n \n\n   \n   NP : Well, I wanna push back on one thing you said: “Anyone can look it up.” It’s actually surprisingly difficult to find the combined Run Expectancy stats I mentioned above, for instance. And only in the past few years did FanGraphs even add  a combined WAR leaderboard , pretty much in response to Ohtani’s existence.\n \n\n   \n  I think that really gets to the one-of-a-kind angle as much as anything else – when these statistical sites or historical resources were set up during the 21st century, it had been so long since there was a truly viable batter/pitcher hybrid like this that they didn’t even think they would need to mash together players’ stats across both activities. Ohtani broke how we do seemingly simple stat lookups with these feats that are so outside the bounds of what is usually considered “normal” for the purposes of reporting on the game.\n \n\n   \n    Ohtani is dragging eyes from overseas to the US game\n \n\n   \n   HE : That might be the gentlest pushback in history, ha ha. You know I read what you write here, and it really gets to how Ohtani breaks the traditional metrics. He’s forcing us to think about baseball differently.\n \n\n   \n  You know I’ve written a number of pieces in the past about how baseball viewership is  way down from its heights  – even if they are up a little bit this year.\n \n\n   \n  Ohtani makes those comparisons somewhat useless. Why? He’s bringing in so many international viewers. Specifically, those from Japan. More people in Japan tuned into this season’s  Tokyo Series  starring the (Los Angeles) Dodgers than Americans did to last year’s World Series.\n \n\n   \n  Baseball nearly doubled its viewership of last year’s World Series thanks to Japan, even as those games were playing in the morning in Tokyo.\n \n\n   \n   NP : The Dodgers have truly become Japan’s team in recent years, and Ohtani is unsurprisingly right in the middle of that. He gave them the  most valuable Japanese hitter  in the league by WAR, and the team also had the  most valuable Japanese pitcher  in Yoshinobu Yamamoto – plus two more positive-value pitchers in the form of Roki Sasaki and Ohtani himself.\n \n\n   \n  Every time a great player gets posted from NPB (Japan’s version of MLB), the Dodgers are either the frontrunners to sign him or at least on the very short list of candidates, in part because of the talent pipeline they’ve already built in LA.\n \n\n   \n  And then that builds a virtuous cycle where the Dodgers get a ton of attention from fans in Japan, and when they do well, it makes them a more appealing destination for the next generation of players coming over, and so forth.\n \n\n   \n  We used to associate the (Seattle) Mariners and (New York) Yankees with acquiring Japanese stars as well – think of  Ichiro (Suzuki)  and Hideki Matsui, for instance – but the Dodgers were always the original destination  going back to Hideo Nomo , and they’ve re-asserted themselves in that regard again, to the benefit of their brand and MLB’s as a whole.\n \n\n   \n   HE : Again, this is a situation where Ohtani is just unique. Yes, those guys were big in Japan, but Ohtani is just different. Moreover, the way baseball has capitalized on him is different too.\n \n\n   \n    Who wins the World Series?\n \n\n   \n   HE : And thanks to that, we’re now onto a World Series that truly feels more “World” than ever before. We got the popularity of the game in Japan and the Toronto Blue Jays are involved.\n \n\n   \n  Of course, there can only be one winner. The prediction markets have the Dodgers as more than a 2:1 favorite over the team whose flag flies north of the border. What do you say?\n \n\n   \n   NP : I’m just old enough to remember  when they made a big deal about  the Blue Jays facing the Atlanta Braves in 1992 as the first true, international “World” Series. Look at how far we’ve come!\n \n\n   \n  But yeah, the Dodgers are fairly heavy favorites, and it’s hard to argue against that after what they did to the Milwaukee Brewers – who had  the best record in baseball  during the regular season – in what was a very lopsided, brutal  NLCS sweep .\n \n\n   \n  The things that I think point to  Toronto having a chance  are that the Dodgers’ starters pitched out of their  minds  during that series: they had literally the best rotation ERA (0.63) ever in a League Championship Series. That may not be able to be repeated for a second straight series, though they are coming off a  near-record amount of rest  heading into the Fall Classic.\n \n\n   \n  The Blue Jays are also much better offensively than Milwaukee – they’re averaging 6.5 RPG in the postseason with  Vladimir Guerrero Jr.  carrying a 1.440 OPS. And then, if you get to the Dodger bullpen, you’re facing a group that was outside the top 20 in WAR during the regular season.\n \n\n   \n  But the thing that makes the Dodgers so dangerous is just how many players they have who can hurt you. If it’s not Ohtani – and it’s worth pointing out that, despite the mammoth Game 4 we talked about earlier, he was hitting below .200 in the NLCS beforehand, yet they were still dominating – it might be Freddie Freeman, or Mookie Betts, or a bunch of guys – like Tommy Edman, Teoscar Hernández, Max Muncy and Kiké Hernández – who always seem to be coming up with the clutch hit.\n \n\n   \n  That, as much as anything else, will be what determines the series – whether Toronto’s pitching can match what LA’s aces do and give themselves a chance to win. But to me, the Dodgers are just too overwhelming. I think they win it in 5.\n \n\n   \n   HE : There you have it… It’s Dodgers in 5… I think Neil’s probably right. Unless, the Blue Jays win. In that case, I disagree with my old pal. Thanks, Neil!\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/travel/spite-houses-hostile-architecture","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"08:05:00-04:00","title":"Saying ‘screw you’ through architecture: America’s spite houses","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the concept of 'spite architecture' — buildings or land features intentionally designed to provoke or annoy specific individuals or groups — through a modern case study of Aaron Jackson’s Equality House in Topeka, Kansas.

Stuck in his small Queens apartment, the self-described “news junkie” spent long stretches online, falling into internet wormholes.\n \n\n   \n  At some point, he says, he came across the  Westboro Baptist Church  (WBC).\n \n\n   \n  The Church, which is considered a hate group by the  Southern Poverty Law Center , is best known for organizing pickets at soldiers’ funerals and emblazoning anti-LGBT slogans on protest signs and billboards.\n \n\n   \n  “The first thing I saw was that (the church) was in a neighborhood. I was walking around and I decided to do a 360 view and I saw a ‘for sale’ sign in front of the house on Google Earth. I thought it would be really funny to buy that house.”\n \n\n   \n  Although that specific house in Topeka, Kansas, was no longer for sale when Jackson inquired, another one on the street was. Jackson bought it sight unseen. Despite never having been there, he was ready for a change, so he moved to his new digs in Topeka, the state capital.\n \n\n   \n  But becoming the WBC’s neighbor was only the first step in his plan.\n \n\n   \n  Next, he painted the house’s exterior in rainbow stripes to make it look like a Pride flag. The act was intentional, agitprop for the social media age. It was a response to the the church’s anti-gay rhetoric, and it was right in front of their living room windows, impossible to ignore.\n \n\n   \n  He named it the Equality House.\n \n\n   \n  Photos of the home went viral, but Jackson thought people would see a picture, have a laugh, and then move on.\n \n\n   \n  Instead, they showed up to visit.\n \n\n   \n  Although Topeka has a population of about 125,000 people, its location along I-70, a major highway that cuts east-west across the US, makes it a convenient stop along road trips. The Westboro Baptist Church, and the Equality House, are just off the highway.\n \n\n   \n  A few years later, Jackson bought a second home on the street and painted it in pink, white and blue stripes to resemble the  trans pride flag .\n \n\n   \n  Jackson doesn’t call the Equality House a “spite” house, but he knows that a lot of people disagree. The house is part of a wider nonprofit he’s established called  Planting Peace,  which has launched other initiatives including orphanages and elephant rescue efforts.\n \n\n   \n  “The Equality House is a symbol of compassion, peace, and positive change,” the organization’s website says. But its location, facing the infamous church, makes a case for its “spite” house label.\n \n\n   \n    Hostile designs\n \n\n   \n  Spite architecture has a short but vivid history, most of it American.\n \n\n   \n  It’s sometimes mistakenly linked to “nail” houses, where owners refuse to sell to developers, leaving a single structure marooned amid new constructions. Sometimes owners are holding out for a bigger payday. Others stay put out of stubbornness — think of the little house at the  beginning of the movie “Up.” \n \n\n   \n  But spite houses are different. They’re built not to resist developers but, as their name suggests, they’re intentionally designed, with a degree of malice, to annoy someone specific.\n \n\n   \n  Boston’s “ Skinny House ” may be the most famous example.\n \n\n   \n  Ten feet wide and four stories tall, it rises from the city’s historic North End. According to a real estate agent who once sold it, two brothers owned the plot. One built a grand home for himself while the other was away fighting in the Civil War. When the soldier returned, furious that his brother had left him a smaller portion of the plot, he built a narrow tower to block the mansion’s view and sunlight.\n \n\n   \n  Today, a plaque outside the diminutive 44 Hull Street property reads “Skinny House,” with “Spite House” in parentheses. Although it’s still a private residence, it has become a tourist attraction in the tony Boston neighborhood, which also contains the Old North Church, the city’s oldest, and a statue of Paul Revere.\n \n\n   \n  On Google Maps, it’s labeled “Boston spite house.” Instagram is full of photos of tourists visiting the house, with “stretching my arms out between this house and the one next door” by far the most popular pose.\n \n\n   \n  Spite is one thing. Prime location is another. Despite its dimensions and the regular parade of visitors outside, the home  sold for $1.25 million  in 2021.\n \n\n   \n  While spite houses aren’t an exclusively American phenomenon, they do flourish in the United States. The mix of private-property culture, individualism, and the country’s fragmented zoning laws creates ideal conditions for personal grudges to solidify into real estate.\n \n\n   \n  “Hostile architecture is very American,” says Paavo Monkkonen, assistant professor in the University of California, Los Angeles’ Department of Urban Planning. “Your house represents more here than it does in other countries. It’s a more personal symbol because it’s a home ownership society. There’s more neighbor-to-neighbor conflict.”\n \n\n   \n  Spite houses are a kind of hostile architecture, but usually on a local scale —built for the irritation of a particular person or family. Broader “hostile architecture” includes things like uncomfortable park benches meant to keep homeless people from sleeping on them.\n \n\n   \n  “The US approach to urban design is often not people-centric,” says Monkkonen. “In the sense that in certain parts of the city you want to build things that no one will go to, plazas that will be empty, because you want to protect your own peace and quiet.”\n \n\n   \n  There are spite houses outside of the US, too.\n \n\n   \n  Sarajevo’s Inat Kuća, or House of Resentment, offers a Balkan version of the genre.\n \n\n   \n  In the 1800s, Austro-Hungarian authorities wanted to demolish homes alongside the Miljacka River to make room for a new city hall. One homeowner refused to sell. The eventual compromise saw the government move his house, brick-by-brick, and rebuild it in the opposite river bank.\n \n\n   \n  Today, the structure is home to a traditional Bosnian restaurant, but to locals it will always be the House of Spite or House of Contempt – a moment of David defeating Goliath, and a symbol of Bosnian pride.\n \n\n   \n  And it doesn’t have to be a full-on house of spite to get visitors interested in stopping by.\n \n\n   \n  In New York City’s West Village, one of the most desirable neighborhoods in the United States, a small, easily missed corner of pavement has become an unlikely tourist attraction.\n \n\n   \n  This isn’t just any old piece of Manhattan asphalt.\n \n\n   \n  The 500-square-inch triangle carries an all-caps message: “PROPERTY OF THE HESS ESTATE WHICH HAS NEVER BEEN DEDICATED FOR PUBLIC PURPOSES.”\n \n\n   \n  Officially, it’s called the Hess Triangle. Unofficially, it’s the “spite triangle.”\n \n\n   \n  Its existence began as a beef between the Hess family — German immigrants who owned large plots of land in this part of Manhattan — and the city, which seized most of their land in the early 1900s to build the subway.\n \n\n   \n  When a survey showed the city’s measurements of the land were slightly off, the family refused to surrender the remaining two-foot sliver. Instead they tiled their protest into the ground.\n \n\n   \n  The appearance of the spite triangle made headlines in July 1922, with the New York Times giving it an aptly  small amount of newspaper real estate  .\n \n\n   \n  For Aaron Jackson’s Equality House project, going viral had pros and cons. He was happy that the wave of attention got people to learn about Westboro Baptist Church and educate themselves on LGBT issues.\n \n\n   \n  However, it got to the point that he no longer wanted to live in the house day-to-day. Instead, Jackson is   converting the home into a museum and library so that people who visit can do more than just take a picture.\n \n\n   \n  Some guests, Jackson says, want to show support when they visit the Equality House. Others want to argue. Some consider it a spite house, while others think it’s an activist experiment.\n \n\n   \n  “At the end of the day,” says Jackson, “it’s an art project. I don’t tell people how to feel.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/sport/athletics-ruth-chepngetich-marathon-doping-ban-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"07:07:00-04:00","title":"Marathon record holder Ruth Chepngetich given three-year ban for doping violation","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Women’s marathon world record holder Ruth Chepngetich has been banned for three years after testing positive for the prohibited diuretic Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) in a sample collected on March 14, 2025.

   \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander poured in a career-high 55 points as the Thunder outlasted the Indiana Pacers 141-135 on Thursday in what was Oklahoma City’s second straight double-overtime victory to begin the season.\n \n\n   \n  In a rematch of last season’s NBA Finals – which went the full seven games – the two squads proved again that there was little to separate them as neither led by more than  seven points  in the 58-minute affair.\n \n\n   \n  Although the reigning MVP blew up on the night, he was supported by Aaron Wiggins’ 23 points and nine rebounds and Ajay Mitchell’s  career-best  26 points off the bench for the Thunder – who were missing key players such as Jalen Williams, Cason Wallace, Isaiah Joe and Alex Caruso.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the Tyrese Haliburton-less Pacers were led by Bennedict Mathurin and Pascal Siakam, who each had a double-double and combined for 68 points in what was Indiana’s opening game of the NBA season.\n \n\n   \n  And it was Siakam who came up clutch at the end of regulation. With seven seconds remaining in the fourth quarter and the Thunder leading 113-111, the Cameroonian forward stepped back over Oklahoma City center Chet Holmgren to sink a high-arching, 22-foot jumper that sparked a roar from the Indiana crowd. Gilgeous-Alexander then missed a pull-up triple, sending the game to OT.\n \n\n   \n  The opening overtime period gave SGA the chance to prove why he is the reigning MVP, sinking a clutch step back jumper to give the Thunder a two-point lead with 26.4 remaining and briefly silence the crowd at Gainbridge Fieldhouse.\n \n\n   \n  But the Pacers rallied again, this time behind the silky touch of Mathurin. The fourth-year guard faked his way past his fellow Canadian Gilgeous-Alexander and stepped through to lay in his 36th point of the game, tying the affair at 124-124 with 0:13 remaining.\n \n\n   \n  And after Gilgeous-Alexander was once again wide of the mark on another attempted game winner, OKC was once again set for double OT.\n \n\n   \n  Controversy then struck with under 30 seconds left.\n \n\n   \n  With the Thunder leading 139-135 with 22.1 seconds remaining in the game, it appeared Pacers forward Obi Toppin had stolen an errant inbound pass, but the officials conceded a timeout called by the OKC bench, much to the anger of Indiana head coach Rick Carlisle.\n \n\n   \n  The Thunder – who became the first team in NBA history to begin a season with double overtimes in their first two games – then sealed the victory when Gilgeous-Alexander was fouled and sunk the ensuing free throws to make it 141-135.\n \n\n   \n  After the game, Carlisle was apoplectic,  telling reporters : “I’m not talking about the refs. If I talk about the refs, I will be fined an exorbitant amount of money.”\n \n\n   \n  “They just kept marching to the free throw line,” he said regarding the Thunder’s ability to get to the line. “When that happens it takes the pace out of the game.

joins historic club with big win over Minnesota Vikings on Thursday Night Football \n       \n  By Ben Morse, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:20 AM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Los Angeles Chargers head coach  Jim Harbaugh  joined a historic club after his team comfortably beat the Minnesota Vikings 37-10 on Thursday Night Football.\n \n\n   \n  Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert threw three touchdowns and running back Kimani Vidal rushed for over 100 yards and another score as LA dispatched the Vikings.\n \n\n   \n  With the victory, Harbaugh became just the second person in NFL history to earn 60 wins as both a starting quarterback and head coach. He joins Norm Van Brocklin as the only people to reach that mark.\n \n\n   \n  Harbaugh had a 66-74 record over a 13-year playing career in the  NFL  which included stints with the Chicago Bears, Indianapolis Colts, Baltimore Ravens and the then named San Diego Chargers.\n \n\n   \n  As a head coach, he compiled a 44-19-1 record with the San Francisco 49ers between 2011 and 2014 and Thursday’s victory improves his record with the Chargers to 16-9 in his two seasons back in California.\n \n\n   \n  The win over Minnesota at SoFi Stadium helps get the Chargers’ season back on track after the team lost three of their last four.\n \n\n   \n  The game began strongly for the home team, with LA leading 21-3 at halftime with three touchdown drives in the first two quarters.\n \n\n   \n  The Vikings got their only touchdown of the game with 4:36 left in the third quarter when back-up  quarterback  Carson Wentz connected with Jordan Addison to reduce LA’s lead to 14 points.\n \n\n   \n  But Minnesota failed to score again after that and the Chargers added 13-straight points to close out the victory and improve to 5-3.\n \n\n   \n  Herbert finished the game 18-of-25 passing for 227 yards, three TDs and one interception, while also running for 62 yards.\n \n\n   \n   According to the NFL , it was Herbert’s third game of his NFL career with three-plus touchdown passes and more than 50 yards rushing, something no other quarterback in Chargers history has ever done.\n \n\n   \n  After the game, Harbaugh was effusive in his praise of his star QB.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s just another thing about Justin Herbert that I don’t know how he does it,” Harbaugh told reporters. “It’s nothing but respect.\n \n\n   \n  “To be able to actually throw an interception and then come back the next drive – that’s the great ones who can do that. The great, great ones. Just measure what they do after something goes bad, after there’s an interception. That’s the worst thing that can really happen to you as a quarterback. And then chart what they do with the next drive. That shakes a lot of guys. Not Justin Herbert, not the great ones, back right down the field. … It’s incredible.”\n \n\n   \n  For the Vikings, they slip to 3-4 and continue to struggle on offense with starting QB JJ McCarthy still sidelined with an ankle injury.\n \n\n   \n  McCarthy’s replacement, Wentz, came into the game nursing a shoulder knock and looked out of sorts all evening as he made his fifth straight start for the team.\n \n\n   \n  Minnesota had just 164 total yards on offense while the Chargers had 419. LA also dominated the time of possession, having over 39 minutes of the ball while the Vikings had just under 21 minutes.\n \n\n   \n  Wentz’s interception midway through the fourth quarter halted any slim hopes Minnesota might have had about a  dramatic comeback . And with the team’s playoffs hopes on the line, the return of McCarthy – who was the emergency third QB on Thursday – is expected before their Week 9 game against the Detroit Lions.\n \n\n   \n  The only bright spot for the Vikings on Thursday was their star wide receiver Justin Jefferson having his own moment of history. Jefferson joined Hall of Famer Randy Moss (8,375 yards) and Torry Holt (8,156) as the only players with at least 8,000 receiving yards in their first six seasons in NFL history,  per NFL Research .\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/sport/football-ncaa-indiana-resurgence","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-04:00","title":"How Indiana upended decades of futility to become college football’s most unlikely rising power","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Indiana University football, long regarded as a perennial failure with a history of poor performance and fan apathy, has undergone a dramatic transformation under the leadership of athletic director Scott Dolson and head coach Curt Cignetti.

CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Galen Clavio walked into the student mailroom – back when student mailrooms were still a thing – and found an envelope stuffed in his mailbox. Inside were six tickets for each of that season’s Indiana University  football  games, free to him as a dorm resident because, to put it bluntly, no one was terribly interested in going to Hoosier football games, let alone paying for them.\n \n\n   \n  It was 1997 and the Hoosiers were terrible. Not that being terrible was unusual. For the better part of its 138-year existence, Indiana football has excelled at being awful.\n \n\n   \n  It owned the record for most losses in  Division I  history (713) and the worst winning percentage in Big Ten history (.421). Prior to last year, only 14 teams in school history had earned a trip to a bowl game and of the then-30 coaches to lead the program, only five left with winning records – just three since the turn of the 20th century and only one, Bo McMillan, since the end of World War II.\n \n\n   \n  In 1976, Lee Corso, who coached the Hoosiers from 1973 to 1982, memorably stopped a game against Ohio State to snap a picture of his entire team under the scoreboard. The Hoosiers had just scored and led the Buckeyes 7-6 – the first lead Indiana held over Ohio State in a quarter century.\n \n\n   \n  “I looked it up. Can you believe it? Twenty-five years! The goal of a lifetime,’’ Corso said after the game, explaining his rationale. Ohio State went on to win the game, 47-7.\n \n\n   \n  Suffice to say, Indiana football was not an afterthought in the state. That would require it to be a thought in the first place.\n \n\n   \n  “Being an Indiana football fan felt like being in a very small club that no one wanted to join,’’ Clavio, who is now the associate dean for undergraduate education at the IU Media School and director of the university’s sports media program, told  CNN Sports .\n \n\n   \n  This is basketball country, a reality proudly declared at the Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame – “in 49 other states, it’s just basketball, but this is Indiana,’’ – which is located in New Castle, home also to the largest high school gym in the world (capacity 9,325) and the Steve Alford All-American Inn, where a gigantic sneaker sits out front of the hotel named after the beloved IU hoopster.\n \n\n   \n  This is where 41,000 people came to watch high school star Damon Bailey play in his state championship game and where, if you ask people about the Wat Shot – Christian Watford’s 2011 buzzer-beating three-pointer against rival Kentucky – they not only know what it is; they know where they were when the ball went in.\n \n\n   \n  “Hoosiers,” remember, might be a nickname for all IU athletes, but in the movie, they measured the height of a basket, not the length of the football field.\n \n\n   \n  As a fourth-generation Hoosier, Clavio was reared on all of this, but his father also was a freshman during IU’s football glory year (singular), back in 1967 when Indiana went to the Rose Bowl (and, for what it’s worth, lost to USC). He regularly took his son to football games, largely because the tickets were cheaper and easier to get than they were for hoops games.\n \n\n   \n  So, as misery-inducing as it was, Clavio regularly attended the football games as an undergrad and long after. When he started working at IU in 2009, he started a podcast, the “ CrimsonCast ,” in which he dissects both football and basketball. Maybe 1,000 listeners tuned in for the fall Sunday postmortems.\n \n\n   \n  Last weekend, after the Hoosiers rocked Michigan State and rose to No. 2 in the Associated Press polls, more than 12,000 people tuned in to Clavio’s podcast. The Hoosiers are a hot topic and more a ridiculously happy one, having won more games (18) in the last season and a half than they amassed in the previous three years combined. After turning its own history on its ear by earning a spot in  the College Football Playoff last year , Indiana is now one of just six undefeated teams left and that No. 2 ranking in the AP poll is a new program best.\n \n\n   \n  The once forlorn small club of football faithful have welcomed a convoy of bandwagon hoppers. This Saturday’s noon ET game against UCLA will mark the eighth consecutive sellout for IU. After the allotted 11,000 student tickets sold out for the first time, athletic director Scott Dolson made more available.\n \n\n   \n  They weren’t free.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Google me’\n \n\n   \n  What is happening at Indiana is not normal, not ever, but certainly not in the revenue-rich era of college football.\n \n\n   \n  To the spenders go the spoils, and while IU as an athletic department wasn’t low rent, it was not keeping up with its peers. According to the Knight-Newhouse College Athletics Database, IU regularly trailed its Big Ten brethren in annual football spending, $12 million shy of the median in 2019.\n \n\n   \n  With the help of deep-pocketed donors, the university has slowly opened its wallet. Two years ago, it finally crafted a football-only weight room and added new suites and this year put down new turf in the stadium. The result: $61.6 million spending in 2024 (a number partially offset by the $15 million owed to former head coach Tom Allen), on par with the rest of the Big Ten.\n \n\n   \n  But if football success was predicated on spending money alone, the Texas Longhorns would never lose a game. For the better part of its existence, Indiana football largely followed the playbook when it came to head coaching hires, either recycling former head coaches who’d been fired (Gerry DiNardo, Sam Wyche) or targeting assistants from other big-name programs (Tom Allen, Kevin Wilson).\n \n\n   \n  In December 2023, after dismissing Tom Allen, Dolson opted to go in another direction, bringing in a wildly successful head coach who made up for what he lacked in name recognition with a history of winning.\n \n\n   \n  Adding in his time at Indiana, Curt Cignetti is 137-37 as a head coach, a pattern of sustained success that ought to merit attention. Except his resume included stops at Indiana University of Pennsylvania, a Division II school; Elon, an FCS school; and James Madison (JMU), which only jumped to the FBS level in 2022. While moving from low- to mid- to high-major is a normal process in college basketball, it’s not regularly done in football.\n \n\n   \n  Fair or not, Indiana was, frankly, the only sort of job the 62-year-old Cignetti was going to get.\n \n\n   \n  In truth when, at a news conference, he provided his now legendary answer to a question about selling his vision to recruits – “It’s pretty simple. I win. Google me.’’ – he was being equal parts badass and honest. People did, in fact, have to Google him.\n \n\n   \n  Dolson did not.\n \n\n   \n    Indiana gets rolling under Cignetti\n \n\n   \n  Dolson grew up in Michigan City, Indiana, closer in proximity to Michigan, Michigan State and Northwestern, but his heart always bled Hoosier red.\n \n\n   \n  At the age of 9, Dolson attended a Bob Knight basketball camp, dreaming of finding a way to join the team. Smart enough to know he couldn’t play for the Hoosiers, he turned his attention to serving as a student manager as an undergrad. In 1987, when Knight and the aforementioned Alford combined to take Indiana to a national title, Dolson was a junior.\n \n\n   \n  The year after he graduated, he joined the athletic department as a part of the Varsity Club and essentially never left.\n \n\n   \n  That long history with the school means he knew well the historic pigskin ineptitude he was battling when, in 2020, he succeeded Fred Glass as AD.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve had our ups and downs, and unfortunately a lot more downs,’’ Dolson told CNN Sports. “We always were trying to find consistency and never could.’’\n \n\n   \n  Dolson decided to not merely search for consistency; he opted to research it. He commissioned an in-house study to examine what did and didn’t work at Indiana, as well as consider how other schools with similarly strong basketball histories – Kentucky, Kansas and Duke – had at least made some inroads in football. He looked at everything from budgeting to scheduling to facilities.\n \n\n   \n  He also formed a profile for the sort of coach he needed to succeed. At the top of the list: Someone with successful head-coaching experience. A strong recruiter and smart offensive mind who could develop quarterbacks also mattered, as did a person who appreciated continuity in his staffing.\n \n\n   \n  When Dolson interviewed Cignetti, he found himself mentally ticking off the boxes on his wish list.\n \n\n   \n  Cignetti was not blind to what he was walking into. Upon stepping off the plane for his introductory press conference, he sensed the sort of Eeyore gloom pervading Indiana football. It was worse than disappointment; it was disinterest.\n \n\n   \n  So when he was introduced at halftime during a basketball game that day, he hit the Hoosier faithful square in the eyes, finishing his remarks with a literal mic drop by shouting, “Purdue sucks. But so does Michigan and Ohio State. Go IU!”\n \n\n   \n    From unknown to untouchable\n \n\n   \n  The energy and bluster helped but rare is the coach who doesn’t come in promising to win big.\n \n\n   \n  What separated Cignetti was he had a plan to do it.\n \n\n   \n  Often lost in the pursuit of the next head coach is just how hard it is to  be  a head coach. Cignetti has held the job title since 2011. Despite the laundry list of things to do at Indiana, he was not intimidated. He was not confused about what he wanted, or what his team’s identity would be.\n \n\n   \n  Within days of signing his contract, Cignetti reached out to the staff under Allen and asked them to evaluate each of the returning players so that, when he arrived on campus, he could start making decisions. By the end of week one, a stunned Dolson told his wife Heidi, “This thing is already rolling.”\n \n\n   \n  “When you take over a program, but especially football because it’s so big, it can be overwhelming,’’ Dolson said. “Like where do you start? He knew what he wanted, and how he was going to do it from day one. It was, ‘This is what we’re going to do, how we’re going to do it, and we’re not tolerating anything else.’’’\n \n\n   \n  In a way, Cignetti built the Indiana roster in his own image – on the backs of players hungry to prove their worth.\n \n\n   \n  His starting quarterback in 2024, Kurtis Rourke, came from the Group of 5 Mid-American Conference (MAC) member Ohio University, and threw for 3,000 yards and 29 touchdowns. Lead running back Justice Ellison came from underwhelming Wake Forest, and rushed for more than 800 yards. Top receiver Elijah Sarratt followed his coach from James Madison and hauled in 53 catches for 957 yards. Linebacker Aiden Fisher also came from JMU. He led the defense with 118 tackles.\n \n\n   \n  He’s followed the same formula this year. Running back Kaelon Black, another James Madison transfer, leads the team with 439 yards on the ground and Sarratt is back atop the receivers, with nine TDs and 603 yards receiving.\n \n\n   \n  And then there is this year’s quarterback. A coveted player at the time of his transfer from Cal, Fernando Mendoza does not come to his Heisman-contending season via a gilded path. A former three-star recruit out of Miami and the grandson of Cuban immigrants, he initially signed with non-scholarship Yale before getting a late bite from Cal. He grew into his greatness.\n \n\n   \n  It’s all put Indiana into a rather unique pickle. Instead of searching for his next coach, Dolson had to make sure he could hang on to the one he had.\n \n\n   \n  Cignetti’s success coupled with IU’s lack of tradition ordinarily would make the coach ripe for the picking from other bigger, more established programs. Dolson stopped the rumor mill before it started to churn, offering his coach a new  eight-year, $93 million deal  last week.\n \n\n   \n  That’s a nice salary jump for a man who was making $670,000 two years ago at James Madison.\n \n\n   \n  Cignetti rewarded himself by buying some new furniture, though he kept a 36-year-old, well-worn Bradington Young recliner, despite protests from his wife, Manette. “It’s untouchable,’’ Cignetti told the Big Ten Network.\n \n\n   \n  Now, so is the coach.\n \n\n   \n    Energy, belief and hope\n \n\n   \n  The schedule breaks favorably going forward. Of Indiana’s remaining five opponents, UCLA is the only team with a winning record in the Big Ten. The rest are a combined 1-15 in the league, and a would-be reckoning at Penn State appears far less daunting now that the Nittany Lions  fired their coach  and lost their quarterback to injury.\n \n\n   \n  That would set up a potential Big Ten Championship Game showdown with the one contender the Hoosiers won’t face in the regular season:  Ohio State . The Hoosiers have won the conference title twice before, but it’s been almost 60 years since that glorious 1967 campaign.\n \n\n   \n  It is all quite heady and IU fans are basking in the joy. Clavio, for one, made the 10-hour roundtrip drive to Iowa and flew out for the game at Oregon. He’s already contemplating how to get to Maryland and Happy Valley.\n \n\n   \n  Patrons at Nick’s English Hut, the go-to spot for post-hoops victory revelry, broke out into song as the game clock hit zeroes against Oregon – a rousing rendition of the famous chorus from “Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye” –  and people are already imagining the giddy conundrum of important football games bleeding into basketball season.\n \n\n   \n  It’s also created yet another delightful first for the fall season in Bloomington: How to block out the noise.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve been on this campus since my freshman year in 1984 and the feeling on campus with football, I’ve never seen anything like it,’’ Dolson said. “There’s energy. There’s belief. There’s hope. But, and I know it sounds cliché, but internally, we’re focused on the work.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re not thinking about how far we’ve come and what we’ve done. Because when you focus on the work, you’re thinking about what you haven’t done yet.’’\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/health/florida-maha-medical-freedom-movement","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-04:00","title":"At the Hollow in Florida, the ‘medical freedom’ movement finds its base camp","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In Sarasota County, Florida, a growing 'medical freedom' movement centered at The Hollow and led by figures like Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo, his wife Brianna, and anti-vaccine activist William Makis, rejects mainstream public health policy.

camp \n       \n  By Arthur Allen, KFF Health News\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: KFF Health News\n \n   \n  MAGA and MAHA are happily married in Florida, and nowhere more at home than in Sarasota County, where on a humid October night a crowd of several hundred gathered to honor state Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo, his wife, and an unlicensed Canadian radiologist who treats cancer with horse paste.\n \n\n   \n  The event,  titled “The 3 Big C’s: Courage, Censorship & Cancer ,” was sponsored by the  We the People Health and Wellness Center , a clinic, funded by a Jan. 6 marcher, where patients can bask in red light, sit in ozone-infused steam baths, or get their children treated for autism with an experimental blood concentrate.\n \n\n   \n  In Venice, in Sarasota County, a “medical freedom” movement forged in opposition to covid lockdowns blends wellness advocates, vaccine-haters, right-wing Republicans, and angry parents in a stew of anti-government absolutism and mystical belief.\n \n\n   \n  Ladapo’s wife, Brianna, a self-proclaimed “spiritual healer” who says she speaks with angels and has prophetic visions, chaired a panel at the event at the Venice Community Center. The keynote speech was by William Makis,  a litigious covid conspiracist  who, after losing his medical license in 2019, has made a living treating cancer patients with antiparasitic drugs including ivermectin, which was also championed in some circles as a covid treatment during the pandemic.\n \n\n   \n  Clinical trials showed that ivermectin didn’t work, but covid skeptics viewed medicine’s rejection of it as part of a conspiracy by Big Pharma against a cheap, off-patent drug. Some of the patients in his care have what he calls “turbo cancers,” Makis says, blaming alleged impurities in mRNA vaccines that he says have killed millions of people.\n \n\n   \n  For Makis, it’s all one big conspiracy — the virus, the vaccine, and the suppression of his therapies.\n \n\n   \n  Brianna Ladapo has her own take on medicine, based on the idea of good and bad spiritual energy. She wrote in a memoir that as the pandemic began she intuited that it had been planned by “sinister forces” to “frighten the masses to surrender their sovereignty to a small group of tyrannical elites.” She has written that the government  hides vaccination’s risks .\n \n\n   \n  She sees “dark forces” all over the place, including, she said  in a podcast interview  earlier this year, in “chemtrails” shaped like a pentagram. “They’ve been plastering it in the sky right outside our house for the last few weeks,” Ladapo said. The chemtrails “they are dumping on us,” she said, had sickened her and her three sons. “The dark side are no fans of ours.”\n \n\n   \n  (“Chemtrails” are a favorite topic of conspiracy theorists who say they think that contrails, the condensation formed around commercial airplane exhaust, contain toxic substances poisoning people and the terrain. Although there is zero evidence of that, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.  plans to look into  whether they are part of a clandestine effort to use toxic chemicals to change the weather.)\n \n\n   \n  Ladapo’s husband hasn’t publicly endorsed all her beliefs, but as surgeon general he’s reversing decades of accepted public health practice in Florida and embracing untested therapies. “We’re done with fear,” Joseph Ladapo said after being named surgeon general in 2021. He wants to ban mRNA vaccines in Florida, and on Sept. 3 he announced plans to end childhood vaccination mandates in the state.\n \n\n   \n  A few days after the Venice event, Ladapo  said he hoped  to support Makis’ work — though his treatments are unproven and potentially dangerous — through a new $60 million cancer research fund created by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and his wife, Casey.\n \n\n   \n  Vic Mellor, CEO of  a local concrete business , founded and owns We the People. He’s an associate of retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, who was briefly President Donald Trump’s national security adviser in 2017 before being dismissed for lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians. Trump later pardoned him, and Flynn since has become a leader of the Christian nationalist movement.\n \n\n   \n  We the People provides vitamin shots but no vaccines. In fact, many of its offerings are treatments for supposed vaccine injuries. Part of the We the People building is a broadcasting studio, where conservatives hold forth on what they see as the villainy of liberals and the American Academy of Pediatrics.\n \n\n   \n  Mellor was at the U.S. Capitol during the riot on Jan. 6, 2021 — he said he “just knocked on front doors,” according to a Facebook post described  by The Washington Post . He returned home and started building a 10-acre complex that hosts weddings and right-wing assemblies, with playgrounds, a butterfly garden, a zip line over a pond visited by alligators, and an attached, separately owned gun range.\n \n\n   \n  Visitors who travel down a dirt road to The Hollow — named for the hollow-core concrete that made Mellor wealthy — can enter the compound through a dark, cavernous passage lined with neon signs illuminating maxims from the likes of Thomas Jefferson, Thomas Paine, and Flynn.\n \n\n   \n  The Hollow has hosted clinics for unvaccinated kids and events  for Ladapo , anti-vaccine activist Sherri Tenpenny (who in 2021 told legislators at  an Ohio House hearing  that covid vaccine made people magnetic), and other “medical freedom” advocates. Mellor created a medical home for such ideas by  opening We the People  in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  The year before, three “medical freedom” candidates had won seats on the board overseeing Sarasota’s public hospital and health care system, after protests over the hospital’s refusal to treat covid patients with ivermectin and other drugs of choice for covid contrarians.\n \n\n   \n  On a recent afternoon at The Hollow, manager Dan Welch was clearing brush when approached by KFF Health News. As a foe of vaccinations, he welcomed Ladapo’s move to end vaccine mandates. “Maybe in their inception, vaccines were created to prevent what they were supposed to prevent,” Welch said. “But now there’s so much more in there, the metals, aluminum, mercury. Since they started vaccination, the autism rate went through the roof, and I believe these vaccines are part of it.”\n \n\n   \n  The theory that vaccines cause autism has been debunked, and manufacturers removed mercury from childhood vaccines 24 years ago, although Welch said he doesn’t believe it.\n \n\n   \n  Vaccination faces additional challenges in a century-old Sarasota County neighborhood of low-slung bungalows called Pinecraft, home to about 3,000 Mennonites — and double that number when Amish snowbirds arrive in the winter. Pastor Timothy Miller said that while Sarasota’s Mennonites are less culturally isolated than the Mennonite community in West Texas, site of a measles outbreak in January, many in his community also shun vaccination.\n \n\n   \n  His cousin Kristi Miller, 26, won’t vaccinate her 9-month-old daughter or any of the other children she hopes to have, she said, because she thinks vaccines probably cause autism and other harms.\n \n\n   \n  As for vaccine-preventable diseases like measles, she doesn’t worry about them.  Like the Ladapos , “I don’t live in fear,” she said. “I have a God who’s bigger than everything.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/science/london-underground-mosquito-debunked-study","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"06:42:00-04:00","title":"‘London Underground mosquito’ is actually much older than previously thought","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A new genetic study refutes the long-standing belief that the 'London Underground mosquito' evolved in the tunnels of London.

\nUpdated: \n        6:42 AM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A type of mosquito that was believed to have evolved in the London Underground has a much older origin in the Mediterranean, according to a new genetic study.\n \n\n   \n  The myth originated during World War II when Londoners sheltering from German warplanes in subway stations had to endure bites from mosquitoes. The pests were so well adapted to the city’s subterranean tunnels that, in the following decades, biologists started to suggest they might have evolved down there.\n \n\n   \n  The mosquito in question is commonly known as the northern house mosquito, and it exists in two forms, identical in appearance but different in behavior. One is called Culex pipiens form pipiens, which only bites birds and lives in open air environments, and the other is called Culex pipiens form   molestus — from the Latin word for annoying — which bites humans and thrives belowground.\n \n\n   \n  It was the latter variant, some biologists thought, that could have adapted to thrive in London’s Tube stations. “That theory was made really famous by a genetic study published in 1999, which claimed, based on what I would say was limited evidence, that the ‘London Underground mosquito’ seemed to have evolved (on site) from aboveground population,” said Yuki Haba, a postdoctoral researcher at Columbia University and first author of the new study that  published  Thursday in the journal Science.\n \n\n   \n  In the study, Haba and his colleagues analyzed the DNA sequences of hundreds of mosquitoes from all over the world, including some historical samples that were alive during World War II, and concluded that molestus did not rapidly evolve below the surface of the English capital but has a much longer history.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a lot older than the London Tube, and it seems to have evolved around the Mediterranean region, particularly in the Middle Eastern region,” said Haba, adding that the split between the aboveground pipiens and the belowground molestus could have occurred as early as 10,000 years ago, and as late as 1,000 years ago, but most likely between 3,000 and 2,000 years ago.\n \n\n   \n  “The evolutionary analysis suggests that those ancestral molestus populations were aboveground,” he added, “and they kind of gradually dispersed to other places of the world, including the London Underground.”\n \n\n   \n    Migrating north\n \n\n   \n  The team’s quest to test the “London Underground mosquito” hypothesis rigorously started in 2018. “We literally googled Culex pipiens and emailed every author of every paper that we found about the mosquito, telling them we needed samples to understand the origin and genetic diversity of the species,” Haba said.\n \n\n   \n  Thousands of emails and a few years later, the researchers had collected dead mosquitoes — preserved in ethanol — from more than 200 sources across 50 countries. They couldn’t get any live ones from the London Underground itself, as the scientists were denied permission to collect insects directly from the Tube. They instead used historical samples collected throughout the 1900s, conserved at London’s Natural History Museum and analyzed by the Wellcome Sanger Institute, a genomics research center.\n \n\n   \n  In total, the researchers analyzed 357 contemporary mosquitoes and 22 historical specimens, and used additional mosquito samples from a separate study, which beefed up the overall count to about 800.\n \n\n   \n  “Our data shows that molestus is descended directly from pipiens populations that still thrive in the Mediterranean region,” said Lindy McBride, senior author of the study and an associate professor of evolutionary genomics and neuroscience at Princeton University. This finding suggests that it “evolved at Mediterranean latitudes, but probably in the Middle East, where it’s actually too arid for the bird-biting variant to exist.”\n \n\n   \n  At roughly that time, people in the area were starting to create agricultural communities that used irrigation systems, providing ideal places for the mosquito to breed and enabling it to colonize these arid areas and then adapt to humans, McBride said.\n \n\n   \n  The findings are corroborated by the fact that molestus was first  described  as a species in 1775 in Egypt by naturalist Peter Forsskål. “It had probably been there for 1,000 years, at least, before that,” McBride said. “It was then documented in southern Europe in two places, Croatia and Italy, in the 1800s and then the first records from belowground sites in Northern Europe are from about 1920.”\n \n\n   \n  This sequences of detection suggest that molestus traveled north, and once it hit climates too cold to survive in the open, it found refuge underground. “They can’t survive the cold winter, so they would have been confined to southern France, Italy, Greece, Spain,” McBride said. “They couldn’t have gotten much further north than that until there were underground structures to occupy during the winter.”\n \n\n   \n  There are over 3,000 species of mosquitoes, and they have by now colonized every continent except Antarctica. A mosquito was just found for the first time in Iceland, a country previously believed to be free of the insects due to its cold climate.\n \n\n   \n    Mosquito opportunities\n \n\n   \n  Richard Nichols, a professor of genetics at Queen Mary University of London, was not involved with the research but was one of the authors of the 1999 paper that popularized the “London Underground mosquito” hypothesis. Nichols said in an email that he thinks the new study is wonderful and convincing, and although it comes to different conclusions than his own research, “that’s how science works.”\n \n\n   \n  The 1999 study, he continued, showed that the underground mosquitoes in London were genetically distinct from the aboveground populations, and had distinguishing characteristics that helped them live underground, such as the ability to go through the life cycle without a blood meal, indiscriminate biting when the opportunity arose, and an ability to mate in confined spaces and breed throughout the year.\n \n\n   \n  “We interpreted these results to imply that some of the above underground population had adapted to the London (Tube) system and become reproductively isolated from them,” he said, acknowledging that the data from the new study, which is sourced from more places and has greater genetic diversity, reveals new information that was not available at the time. “In those days we could only readily survey 20 genes — not whole genomes,” he explained.\n \n\n   \n  “Our results still stand, but the interpretation has changed.”\n \n\n   \n  Cameron Webb, an associate professor of medical entomology at the University of Sydney and NSW Health Pathology in Australia, called it a fascinating and comprehensive study of the evolution of this globally important mosquito. “While often portrayed as having adapted specifically to the London Underground, this mosquito is actually well known to be associated with subterranean habitats around the world,” Webb, who was not involved with the work but has conducted research on molestus mosquitoes, wrote in an email. The study demonstrates the ancestral basis for the ability of this mosquito to exploit the London Underground, he added.\n \n\n   \n  The “London Underground mosquito” highlights the need to better understand the biology of less-studied mosquitoes to see how they may exploit the changing urban landscape and bring with them increased pest and public health concerns, Webb concluded. “As the design of our cities adapts in response to a changing climate, we must ensure we don’t create more opportunities for mosquitoes.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/americas/zhang-chinese-fentanyl-kingpin-us-extradition-hnk-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"04:34:00-04:34","title":"Mexico hands suspected Chinese fentanyl kingpin over to US authorities, minister says","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Mexico has extradited Zhi Dong Zhang, a Chinese national operating under the alias 'Brother Wang,' to U.S. authorities after a lengthy legal and enforcement process.

     5:00 AM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  They were faces of the Democratic resistance, a winning piece of the blue wave, when the party  swept control  of the House of Representatives in 2018 as a fierce reaction to President Donald Trump’s first two years in office.\n \n\n   \n  Now, Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill are seeking to spur another Democratic revival. Their respective races for governor in Virginia and New Jersey  offer potential lessons  for the party as it tries to rise from political exile and find a pathway back to power.\n \n\n   \n  “What we will do this November is not just vote against something, but we will vote for the policies that we believe in,” Spanberger told a crowded rally here this week. “Are you ready to win?”\n \n\n   \n  A year after losing the White House and failing to win control of Congress, Democrats are working to move beyond the  soul-searching  and finger-pointing phase of their 2024 defeat. The November 4 elections are the latest test of the party’s efforts to rebuild, rebrand and rebound in the new Trump era.\n \n\n   \n  “This one’s too important,” Sherrill told supporters on a recent night, hoping to impress upon them the urgency of the moment. “Make sure no one sits this out.”\n \n\n   \n  New Jersey and Virginia are the only states in the country that elect governors the year after a presidential campaign. The races could hold lessons for Democrats as they seek to unify their fraying coalitions, try to win over any disillusioned Trump voters and recruit candidates for next year’s midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  Yet those races are only one chapter of the Democratic Party’s fight.\n \n\n   \n  An epic generational and ideological clash is unfolding in New York City, where Zohran Mamdani is working to take command in a mayoral race with Andrew Cuomo. The spirited campaign has shined a light on the risks and rewards for a party still reconciling its identity and finding the best approach to address the affordability crisis and other challenges facing Americans.\n \n\n   \n    Inside the blue wave\n \n\n   \n  It was 2018 when Spanberger, a former federal agent and CIA officer, was elected to a Congressional seat in central Virginia long held by Republicans. Her national security credentials and more centrist views appealed to suburban voters turned off by Trump.\n \n\n   \n  She once  confronted  progressive members of her own party in a private call, admonishing them “to not ever use the words ‘socialist’ or ‘socialism’ ever again.” She won hard-fought re-election battles before stepping down at the end of her third term to focus on her run for governor.\n \n\n   \n  Her biography and a lifelong commitment to service is at the center of her bid for governor, where polls show she is leading Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears. Top Democrats have flocked to Virginia, eager to highlight Spanberger as a broader example for where the party stands.\n \n\n   \n  “Everything about her turns the GOP narrative about who Democrats are upside down,” Pete Buttigieg, a former Democratic presidential candidate and transportation secretary, said as he rallied Spanberger’s supporters here. “This is what the mainstream actually looks like.”\n \n\n   \n  In New Jersey, Sherrill was also part of the class of Democratic candidates in 2018 whose  national security credentials  were at the heart of their quest to win seats once held by Republicans. Her advertising campaign is built around her training as a pilot, with images of her flying a helicopter saying: “The Navy taught me in a crisis you either find a way or make one.”\n \n\n   \n  Locked in a particularly fierce fight in the closing days of the race, Republican challenger Jack Ciattarelli has called out Sherrill’s frequent references to her military service. He minced few words to one crowd last week, saying: “She’ll tell you she knows how to fly a helicopter, but she doesn’t know a damn thing about running the state of New Jersey.”\n \n\n   \n    Capitol Hill roommates\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger, 46, and Sherrill, 53, forged a friendship after arriving on Capitol Hill. They became roommates and still have a running conversation about their respective races and how both could become the first Democratic female governor of their state. (The winner between Spanberger and Earle-Sears will make history as Virginia’s first female governor.)\n \n\n   \n  They’ve often talked about their common bonds, including how Spanberger was born in New Jersey and moved to Virginia at age 13, while Sherrill was born in Virginia and moved to New Jersey as an adult.\n \n\n   \n  “Here’s somebody who comes from that national service background like I do. Someone who’s a mom, like I am. She has three kids, I have four,” Sherrill said in an interview. “I don’t think either of us thought we were going to run for office until in 2018 we felt called to serve again and have been in it ever since.”\n \n\n   \n  They’ve also adopted similar approaches in their campaign by intentionally avoiding trying to add their voice to every Democratic criticism about Trump, but instead focusing on the  tangible effects  of Trump’s policies and whether he has lived up to promises made a year ago.\n \n\n   \n  “He told people he would drive down their costs. I think a lot of people feel very let down,” Sherrill said. “As he’s raising their costs, he’s making billions of dollars. That is really speaking to people who say this is not some guy who has my interest at heart.”\n \n\n   \n  For all the similar strains of their candidacies, their challenges are quite distinct.\n \n\n   \n  Sherrill is seeking to replace Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy, who has been in office for eight years. Not since 1961 have Democrats won three consecutive elections as governor.\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger is running to replace Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, which offers a far simpler case to make an argument for change.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Too many people to please’\n \n\n   \n  As the fall campaign heads into the home stretch, more than a dozen Democratic voters in Virginia and New Jersey told CNN they feel hopeful the party is starting to gain confidence and find its footing one year after a punishing loss that sent Trump back to the White House.\n \n\n   \n  “It will rebuild itself. It just takes time,” said Barbara Lee, a retiree from Staunton, Virginia, who waited in line to see Spanberger at the Jefferson Theater in Charlottesville. “We need new leadership. Abigail can start us off.”\n \n\n   \n  But in the next breath, Lee echoed the sentiment of other Democrats when she said the party must work to extinguish ideological infighting that she believes runs as hot as ever.\n \n\n   \n  “We just have too many people to please. That’s why it’s so hard for us,” Lee said. “We are being attacked from all areas – not just Republicans – but from our own party. So let’s get that out of the way and we can go on to what’s next.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/politics/who-gets-paid-during-shutdown","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Here’s who’s getting paid — and who isn’t — during the federal government shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During a continuing federal government shutdown that began on October 1, 2025, over 1 million federal workers are either unpaid or furloughed, while lawmakers, judges, and certain essential personnel continue to receive pay.

CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Federal workers are bearing the brunt of the government shutdown, with more than 1 million of them  going unpaid  while Democrats and Republicans in Congress argue over funding federal agencies for the current fiscal year.\n \n\n   \n  Many will miss their first full paychecks on Friday, while others will feel the loss early next week, depending on their agency.\n \n\n   \n  But lawmakers on Capitol Hill will still collect their paychecks during the impasse, which began October 1, with no end in sight. They continue to receive their salaries, as directed by the  Constitution  – although some have said they wouldn’t accept their pay or will donate the money.\n \n\n   \n  Shutdowns typically fall unevenly on those who work for the federal government. And this time, President Donald Trump is taking additional steps to shield — at least temporarily — certain employees and the  military  from the financial pain, even as he threatens that hundreds of thousands of other staffers may never receive the  back pay  guaranteed to them under a 2019 law that he signed.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Democrats on Thursday blocked a GOP-led bill to  pay workers who are deemed essential  during the shutdown. Many Democrats have said they want to pass a bill that also pays furloughed federal employees, though Republicans on Thursday rejected their alternatives. But some Republicans and Democrats have expressed optimism that there could be a bipartisan deal on a compromise measure.\n \n\n   \n  With many federal workers living paycheck to paycheck, missing even one can be financially devastating. Scores of federal employees have written to CNN about the economic toll the shutdown is taking on them and their families, leaving them at risk of losing their homes or cars or making it difficult for them to feed and provide for their families.\n \n\n   \n    Here’s who gets paid\n \n\n   \n  In addition to lawmakers, Supreme Court justices and federal judges will still receive their paychecks, thanks to the Constitution. So will political appointees who are confirmed by the Senate, along with certain other appointees.\n \n\n   \n  Also, roughly 830,000 federal workers are continuing to be paid during the impasse, according to a Bipartisan Policy Center review of shutdown contingency plans filed by agencies. That’s because their compensation doesn’t rely on annual appropriations from Congress. Instead, they are paid through other spending packages, such as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act or the Inflation Reduction Act, through fees or through other resources.\n \n\n   \n  Only days before the roughly 2 million active-duty and reserve members of the military were set to  miss their first paychecks , the Trump administration announced it would use about $8 billion in Pentagon research and development funds to cover the October 15 payroll. But there isn’t enough money for the next distribution at the end of the month.\n \n\n   \n  In addition, the Trump administration has  moved to pay  Federal Bureau of Investigation special agents, according to Kash Patel, the agency’s director. Plus, 70,000 law enforcement personnel in the  Department of Homeland Security , including in Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the US Secret Service and other divisions will receive their paychecks, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem  posted on X. \n \n\n   \n  And the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is  temporarily recalling  roughly 3,000 furloughed employees amid open enrollment for Medicare and the Affordable Care Act, starting Monday. They will be paid for the time they are working.\n \n\n   \n    Here’s who doesn’t get paid\n \n\n   \n  Roughly 730,000 federal employees are working without pay, while another roughly 670,000 have been furloughed, according to the latest estimate from the Bipartisan Policy Center. However, agencies have made changes as the shutdown drags on. For instance, the Internal Revenue Service originally said it would use the Inflation Reduction Act to keep paying all of its roughly 74,300 employees but a week later decided to  furlough nearly half its workforce .\n \n\n   \n   Senate staffers  learned last week that they will not receive their October 20 paychecks and won’t be paid for the remainder of the shutdown, while the judicial branch announced that it has run out of funding to sustain full operations. Essential staff will stay on the job, working without pay, while other court employees will be furloughed.\n \n\n   \n  In the past, federal workers typically received back pay when impasses ended, but Congress made it official in 2019. However, the White House budget office is considering a new interpretation of that law, arguing it doesn’t cover furloughed employees.\n \n\n   \n  Many  federal contractors , including those who handle security, clean offices and staff the cafes in federal buildings, are also laid off during shutdowns. But unlike federal workers, they have no guarantee of being made whole at the end of the impasse.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/sport/basketball-nba-terry-rozier-arrested-betting-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"04:55:00-04:55","title":"Feds Reveal Mafia-Linked Gambling Probe That Led to Arrests of Hall of Famer Chauncey Billups and NBA Star Terry Rozier","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. federal government has revealed a sweeping gambling investigation linked to organized crime families such as the Bonanno, Genovese, Gambino, and Luchese, which resulted in the indictment of 34 individuals, including Hall of Famer Chauncey Billups and NBA star Terry Rozier.

24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Portland Trail Blazers head coach and basketball Hall of Famer Chauncey Billups, Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier and former NBA journeyman Damon Jones  are among 34 people indicted in connection  with two separate federal gambling investigations announced by the Eastern District of New York on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  At a lengthy and at times spirited news conference that included FBI Director Kash Patel, US Attorney Joseph Nocella Jr., and others detailed the sweeping multi-year investigations that spanned 11 states, resulted in the arrests of 34 people, involved tens of millions of dollars and included members of the notorious Bonanno, Genovese, Gambino and Luchese crime families.\n \n\n   \n  Billups, who coached in the Trail Blazers’ opening game on Wednesday night, was arrested in Portland on Thursday morning and is expected to appear in federal court there later on Thursday. Rozier, arrested in Orlando, will appear there.\n \n\n   \n  Both will be arraigned at a later date in Brooklyn.\n \n\n   \n  Jones, who retired in 2012, is one of three people to be charged in both cases.\n \n\n   \n  “My message to the defendants who have been rounded up today is this: Your winning streak has ended,’’ Nocella said. “Your luck has run out. Violating the law is a losing proposition, and you can bet on that.’’\n \n\n   \n  Billups, the Portland head coach since 2021, is charged in an elaborate scheme in which marks were lured to participate in rigged poker games in part with the opportunity to play alongside the NBA five-time All-Star as well as Jones.\n \n\n   \n  Billups, Nocella said, knowingly served as the so-called “face card,” to attract the “fish,” to underground games in Miami, New York, Las Vegas and the Hamptons that they had no chance of winning. Those involved in the scheme used rigged card-shuffling machines, poker chip trays and even special contact lenses or eyeglasses that could read pre-marked cards. In some instances, the alleged conspirators used X-ray tables that reveal cards when they are placed face down.\n \n\n   \n  Nocella said the scheme, deemed “Zen Diagram” by the feds, “fleeced” victims out of tens of millions of dollars. One alleged victim lost $1.8 million. The money was then laundered by the crime families.\n \n\n   \n  “And when people refused to pay, these defendants did what organized crime has always done,’’ New York police commissioner Jessica Tisch said. “They used threats. They used intimidation. And they used violence. It’s the same pattern that we have seen for decades, traditional mob enforcement methods combined with new technology to expand the reach of their operations.’’\n \n\n   \n  Rozier, who was arrested in an Orlando hotel, was alleged to participate in a game-fixing scheme that included prop bets on his availability.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators allege between December 2022 and March 2024, Rozier tipped people about his availability for games, citing seven specific games in their investigation including one, against the New Orleans Pelicans, already flagged by sportsbooks for irregular activity.\n \n\n   \n  In that March 2023 game, Rozier, then with the Charlotte Hornets, left the game after just nine minutes with an injury. According to investigators, Rozier shared that inside information, and his co-conspirator bettors made $200,000 in wagers on the under.\n \n\n   \n  “Those bets paid out, generating tens of thousands of dollars in profit,’’ Tisch said. “The proceeds were later delivered to his home, where the group counted their cash.’’\n \n\n   \n  That investigation, deemed “Nothing But Net,” also included the previous arrest of former Toronto Raptors center Jontay Porter, who was banned from the NBA in 2024 and later admitted to manipulating his performance in two games. He is awaiting sentencing.\n \n\n   \n  Nocella said other defendants involved in the case threatened Porter, who had pre-existing gambling debts, in order to get the inside information.\n \n\n   \n  “This is the insider trading saga of the NBA,’’ FBI Director Patel said.\n \n\n   \n  The NBA has said previously it looked into the game involving Rozier against the Pelicans and that no rules had been broken. He was with the Heat, who opened their season on Wednesday, but did not play due to a coach’s decision.\n \n\n   \n  Jim Trusty, Rozier’s attorney, strongly disputed the accusations, saying that prosecutors characterized Rozier as a subject of their investigation and not a target.\n \n\n   \n  “But at 6 a.m. this morning they called to tell me FBI agents were trying to arrest him in a hotel,’’ Trusty said.\n \n\n   \n  “They wanted the misplaced glory of embarrassing a professional athlete with a perp walk. That tells you a lot about the motivations in this case. They appear to be taking the word of spectacularly incredible sources rather than relying on actual evidence of wrongdoing. Terry was cleared by the NBA and these prosecutors revived that non-case. Terry is not a gambler, but he is not afraid of a fight, and he looks forward to winning this fight.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the Trail Blazers and other teams mentioned in the news conference. Attorney information for Billups was not immediately available.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, the NBA said, “We are in the process of reviewing the federal indictments announced today. Terry Rozier and Chauncey Billups are being placed on immediate leave from their teams, and we will continue to cooperate with the relevant authorities. We take these allegations with the utmost seriousness, and the integrity of our game remains our top priority.”\n \n\n   \n  The Heat directed press inquiries to the NBA statement. The Trail Blazers noted that Tiago Splitter will be taking on interim head coaching duties as Billups is on leave.\n \n\n   \n  “We are aware of the allegations involving head coach Chauncey Billups, and the Trail Blazers are fully cooperating with the investigation. Billups has been placed on immediate leave, and Tiago Splitter will assume head coaching duties in the interim. Any further questions should be directed to the NBA,” the Blazers said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional reporting. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Kara Scannell and Mark Morales contributed reporting to this story. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/world/new-zealand-fugitive-father-secret-camps-revealed-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"13:17:00Z","title":"Photos reveal the secret bush camps fugitive father used to hide his children","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Police in New Zealand have released photos of two secret bush camps used by Tom Phillips, a father who disappeared with his three children in December 2021, to hide from authorities for nearly four years.

hid his children from the world for almost four years in dense New Zealand wilderness have released new images of two makeshift camps where they believe the family spent most of their time.\n \n\n   \n  The photos of remote bush hideouts used by Tom Phillips, who was shot dead by police last month, show two large “established” camps which were “heavily concealed” by thick vegetation, north and east of Marokopa, on the country’s western coast.\n \n\n   \n  Detectives believe they served as the family’s main strongholds, enabling Phillips to navigate between the coast, farmland and wilderness with his three children ages 9 to 12.\n \n\n   \n  The secret bases helped the family live undetected until police finally tracked Phillips  down in the early hours of September 8 , and retrieved the children from deep within the forest.\n \n\n   \n  The images released Friday show a northern site with a wooden hut crafted from logs and topped with what appears to be a thatched straw roof, with its walls partially exposed to the elements.\n \n\n   \n  An image of the interior shows a damp, muddy floor, a plastic bucket, two partially filled jerry cans and a thick rope tethered to a stump atop a supporting wooden pole.\n \n\n   \n  An aerial shot of the eastern hideout captures it as a mere speck beneath an expansive tree canopy.\n \n\n   \n  Closer images reveal a more substantial structure with a pointed roof, made from logs and foliage, housing a log table and several bags, rope and a helmet hanging from the rafters which are covered by a plastic tarpaulin.\n \n\n   \n  An additional photo shows a low shelter, barely tall enough to sit upright, covered in foliage camouflaging the family’s location.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities said stumbling upon these sites by chance would have been almost impossible and that approaching Phillips in such circumstances “would have been extremely dangerous.”\n \n\n   \n  “As we’ve said previously, we knew he had firearms and was motivated to use them,” Detective Superintendent Ross McKay said.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators have removed a haul of items from the camps for forensic examination as part of ongoing enquiries to identify anyone who might have assisted Phillips during his time on the run.\n \n\n   \n  “We continue to make good progress and believe he was assisted by a small number of people at different stages over the last four years,” McKay added.\n \n\n   \n  Phillips, who came from a farming family in Marokopa, disappeared with his children into the rugged wilderness during a bitter family split in December 2021.\n \n\n   \n  At first, Phillips was wanted for failing to appear in court on charges of wasting police resources but, over the course of almost four years, his charge sheet grew longer and more serious, with allegations that he robbed a bank in May 2023.\n \n\n   \n  Police scrambled search teams, helicopters and planes to investigate sporadic sightings until police finally confronted him on a rural road and returned gunfire when he shot and injured an officer.\n \n\n   \n  The eldest child was with him when he was shot dead by police. The other two siblings were found hours later, alone at the camp.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/us/chicago-ice-raids-resistance-efforts","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"04:00:00-05:00","title":"Residents in Chicago Suburb Resist ICE Raids Amid Widespread Immigration Crackdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In October 2025, residents of Mount Prospect, Illinois, resisted a federal immigration enforcement raid led by ICE agents under the Trump administration’s 'Operation Midway Blitz,' which had resulted in over 1,000 arrests in Illinois since September.

\n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:00 AM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In the quiet village of Mount Prospect, nestled just northwest of Chicago’s city limits, residents were sheltering from the cold and rain on a sleepy Sunday afternoon watching TV, scrolling through social media and enjoying midday coffee at home.\n \n\n   \n  As rain pattered against windows, and trees lining the streets swayed, flurries of urgent texts began ricocheting from one end of the neighborhood to the other, and panic set in as some residents put on their shoes and hurried out the door.\n \n\n   \n  “ICE IS HERE,” one text between Mount Prospect neighbors said.\n \n\n   \n  “F**king helicopters. Ice at Owen Park,” read another. “On our way,” one neighbor replied.\n \n\n   \n  The historic suburb quickly devolved into a scene that has  become familiar  to places like nearby  Chicago  and elsewhere across the country as President Donald Trump works to execute his Day 1 promise to crack down on  immigration and crime : A Homeland Security helicopter whirred overhead, several SUVs and trucks with tinted windows drove slowly past houses, and around two dozen masked federal agents meandered through yards and walked down sidewalks, according to images and interviews with residents.\n \n\n   \n  Neighbors stepped out of their homes to document the agents who had descended on their community, joining a coalition of opposition to the president’s unwavering determination to  detain and deport undocumented migrants  en masse  – a  resistance effort  spreading throughout US cities that have seen their workers, schoolchildren and community members swept up in ICE raids.\n \n\n   \n  “The Rapid Response network confirmed high levels of immigration enforcement activity in Rolling Meadows, Wheeling, Prospect Heights & Mt. Prospect,” read a text from an ICE activity alert system run by a local immigrant rights group, the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights. “At least 4 people have been detained.”\n \n\n   \n  Without knowing exactly where she was headed, Mount Prospect resident and small business owner Dawn Ardito grabbed her phone and driver’s license and rushed out the door after receiving some of the texts. She had reached only the end of her block before spotting the first set of SUVs with dark windows driven by men in masks and fatigues.\n \n\n   \n  She followed the cars to a nearby street with even more SUVs and agents. Ardito joined the handful of neighbors who had gathered, recording the federal officers with her phone, asking them what they were doing and demanding they leave.\n \n\n   \n  “You don’t belong here,” Ardito said she told immigration enforcement agents. “Our neighbors, they do belong here. Our community members, they do belong here.”\n \n\n   \n  Agents told residents they were looking for an “escaped criminal,” describing the person to Ardito and others as a “gang member” at one point, then a “murder suspect” and “sex offender” as the operation went on.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security about the operation.\n \n\n   \n  Mount Prospect police said they encountered the Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers while responding to a 911 call about a person running through a nearby backyard. Officers left after they “confirmed these were federal agents,” and didn’t participate in the operation, “as this would be in violation of Illinois State Law and the Trust Act,” Officer Greg Sill said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Another person living in Mount Prospect who was mobilized by the texts, speaking on condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal, said she hoped to chase out the agents with her screams like she’d seen in videos on social media of similar encounters around Chicago.\n \n\n   \n  “People should be coming out of their houses and confronting (agents),” the resident said. “I have neighbors who are terrified to leave their houses. … Nobody should have to live like that, not in any neighborhood.”\n \n\n   \n  For more than an hour, residents screamed, videotaped and tailed federal vehicles, raucously honking horns to send the message: Their operation is not welcome here.\n \n\n   \n  Agents left the area after about two hours, neighbors said. It’s not clear whether agents arrested the person they told residents they were searching for.\n \n\n   \n  “If it can happen here, it can happen anywhere,” Ardito said. “Just because you haven’t seen it outside your front door like I saw it this weekend -– only time will tell until we all see that.”\n \n\n   \n    Packing whistle kits and buying out street vendors: How Chicagoans are opposing ICE in their neighborhoods\n \n\n   \n  At “ No Kings ” protests, Latino independence  celebrations  or ordinary afternoons in the streets of Chicago, bright orange whistles swing from community members’ necks, ready to cut through the city’s bustle should federal immigration agents appear.\n \n\n   \n  The whistles have become a peaceful display of opposition as  federal agents have been deployed  across the city in recent weeks for what the Trump administration calls “Operation Midway Blitz,” an ICE effort that has resulted in more than  1,000 arrests of migrants across Illinois  between September 8 and October 3, according to the Department of Homeland Security.\n \n\n   \n  In Belmont Cragin, a northwest Chicago community, local organizers have rallied hundreds of volunteers to create kits packed with the whistles, handouts showing when to use them and bilingual flyers detailing what bystanders’ and detainees’ rights are when agents are conducting arrests.\n \n\n   \n  One pamphlet in the kit reads, “Form a crowd, stay loud,” instructing users to blow the whistles as they spot ICE activity to guide nearby Chicagoans to where the agents are patrolling or conducting arrests so they can make noise, document or follow agents’ caravans.\n \n\n   \n  Alonso Zaragoza, an organizer helping to run Belmont Cragin United, said the group has 30,000 whistle kits to distribute throughout the city. The group is hosting its next “Whistlemania” event October 29, when nearly 80 Chicago communities are expected to come together to fold pamphlets and pack plastic whistles to reach their goal of 100,000 kits.\n \n\n   \n  “Immigrants keep us moving forward. They’re the oil in the machine that is our community,” Zaragoza said. “Hopefully Whistlemania takes off in other communities, like in  Portland , to protect their immigrant populations.”\n \n\n   \n  But many immigrants in Chicago now fear venturing out into the very community they help sustain.\n \n\n   \n  West 26th Street, in the predominantly Latino community of Little Village, once boasted an array of friendly street vendors selling shaved ice and fresh corn, with their carts dotting the busy road. Since “Operation Midway Blitz” launched, locals say street corners are emptier, and vendors who set up shop do so at their own risk.\n \n\n   \n  “Everybody who is getting arrested right now are people who are going to work,” said Erendira Rendon, vice president of immigrant justice at The Resurrection Project, a Chicago-based nonprofit. “Folks have to stay inside to stay safe.”\n \n\n   \n  Chicago resident Rick Rosales, a community organizer and co-founder of Cycling x Solidarity, a local cycling group dedicated to mutual aid, started raising money when raids began to ramp up to buy up all the vendors’ food to get them off the street for the day.\n \n\n   \n  Sunday morning, Rosales and a few other volunteers biked up to a woman selling empanadas in the pouring rain. On the street next to her tent, the woman’s young child was sitting in her parked car as she worked. The bikers bought every empanada she had.\n \n\n   \n  “She was incredibly grateful, very taken by surprise,” Rosales said. “And no sooner did we pack up the bikes with all her goods, she’s already packed up her cooler and tent. It’s cold, it’s raining, it’s early in the morning – she has a child, and now they get to go home.”\n \n\n   \n  After buying out a vendor, the bikers pass out the food to encampments and shelters.\n \n\n   \n  Rosales’ group works with the Street Vendors Association of Chicago, which typically helps vendors design menus and obtain permits, to fundraise and identify sellers. Together, the groups organize bike tours where riders buy from a series of vendors as they explore the city.\n \n\n   \n  “A few of our vendors have been detained (by ICE),” said Maria Orozco, outreach coordinator of the association. “So, we try to protect our vendors and make sure they’re good and make sure that the community supports them.”\n \n\n   \n    Chicago is the epicenter of immigration crackdowns amid ongoing legal battles\n \n\n   \n  As attorneys face off in courtrooms and federal agents on the ground clash with residents, Chicago is being cemented as the  epicenter  of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown after a flurry of legal developments.\n \n\n   \n  The Windy City was thrust into the national spotlight after a federal appeals court temporarily  allowed the federalization  of Illinois National Guard troops but blocked their deployment within the state.\n \n\n   \n  Trump on Friday  urged the Supreme Court  to allow him to deploy the National Guard in Chicago, putting the explosive legal fight over his ability to use those troops on American soil before the justices for the first time.\n \n\n   \n  The appeal uses striking language to describe the situation in Chicago, asserting federal officials there “have been threatened and assaulted, attacked in a harrowing pre-planned ambush involving many assailants.”\n \n\n   \n  That framing stands in stark contrast with how US District Court Judge April Perry described the situation on the ground in an order  earlier this month .\n \n\n   \n  Perry, a Biden nominee, pointed to what she described as “a troubling trend of defendants’ declarants equating protests with riots and a lack of appreciation for the wide spectrum that exists between citizens who are observing, questioning, and criticizing their government, and those who are obstructing, assaulting, or doing violence.”\n \n\n   \n  Illinois and the city of Chicago have  asked the justices  to block the administration’s emergency request to keep National Guard troops in that state and have fiercely denied the administration’s descriptions of crime in the Prairie State’s biggest city.\n \n\n   \n  For residents in Chicago communities like Little Village and Belmont Cragin, and outside city limits in Mount Prospect and across Illinois, the work goes on.\n \n\n   \n  “I now have this whole new network of people that we have connected with, and having this firsthand experience, it has really bonded us,” Ardito said. “We are now making sure we’re connected and looking for what we can do to continue to protect our community and to continue to push back.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Omar Jimenez contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/politics/abbe-lowell-letitia-james-attorney","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"04:00:00-04:00","title":"Washington Mega Lawyer Abbe Lowell, 73, Is the Fresh Face of the Trump Resistance","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Abbe Lowell, a 73-year-old Washington-based attorney, has emerged as a central figure in the 'Trump resistance' movement, defending high-profile political figures such as John Bolton, Letitia James, Hunter Biden, and former officials like Bob Menendez and Miles Taylor.

lawyer Abbe Lowell, 73, is the fresh face of the Trump resistance \n       \n  By Kara Scannell, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:00 AM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Attorney Abbe Lowell stood beside  John Bolton  in a federal courthouse in Maryland last week as Donald Trump’s former national security adviser pleaded not guilty to charges of mishandling classified information.\n \n\n   \n  Three days later, Lowell was at a federal appeals court in Philadelphia arguing that President Trump’s  choice of US attorney for New Jersey  is unlawful. And on Friday, Lowell will be beside New York Attorney General  Letitia James  in Norfolk, Virginia, as she is arraigned on federal charges of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution. James has called the charges “baseless.”\n \n\n   \n  Lowell has for decades been a moth to the flame of Washington politics and scandal. He built his reputation by getting politicians out of legal trouble or advocating pointedly before television cameras to try to sway public opinion and influence prosecutors’ decision making.\n \n\n   \n  Now, at 73, Lowell is one of the most prominent faces defending many of Trump’s perceived enemies in criminal investigations, security clearance revocations, and other matters.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s a lawyers’ lawyer in that the politics aren’t what motivates the case,” said Mark Zaid, a high-profile Washington, DC, lawyer who represents whistleblowers. Zaid hired Lowell and other attorneys when the Trump administration revoked his security clearance.  They filed a lawsuit, which is pending, to try to get it restored.\n \n\n   \n  “He argues for the rule of law and this administration is subverting the rule of law so much that I wish there was an army of Abbe Lowells who, even if they didn’t have his skill, that they have his desire to uphold the integrity of the system and the principles that this country was founded on,” Zaid said.\n \n\n   \n  While Lowell is taking on Trump now, his past clients include Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner when they were questioned as part of the special counsel investigation into Russia’s meddling in the 2016 presidential election. He also defended President Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden, who went to trial and was convicted of gun-related charges. Biden also pleaded guilty to tax crimes. (He was later pardoned.)\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, Lowell left Winston & Strawn, the large DC law firm where he spent the past seven years, to set up his own firm to represent clients in the Trump administration’s crosshairs. He’s bolstered his team with a cadre of young lawyers.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to James, Bolton and Zaid, Lowell is also representing others targeted by Trump, including Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, former Department of Homeland Security chief of staff Miles Taylor and several former FBI agents and Justice Department prosecutors who were fired from their positions.\n \n\n   \n  Lowell declined to be interviewed. In a statement he said he started his own firm to fill a need.\n \n\n   \n  “The catalyst was the Trump administration’s attempts to use the legal system to silence perceived opponents and critics. I have challenged government overreach in every administration since President Reagan, but the scale and scope of Trump’s intrusion required action,” Lowell said in a statement to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Lowell was born in the Bronx, New York, and raised on Long Island where his father was an insurance agent and his mother was a doctor’s assistant. He graduated from Columbia Law School and swiftly made his way to Washington and into politics.\n \n\n   \n  He served as counsel to House Democrats during President Bill Clinton’s impeachment proceedings. Soon thereafter Lowell represented California Democratic Rep. Gary Condit during the disappearance of intern Chandra Levy in 2001. Condit was  interviewed  by the police amid reports of a romantic relationship with her. He declined to speak to the media, while Lowell frequently sparred with journalists on TV. Condit was never charged with any wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  Former Democratic presidential candidate and Sen. John Edwards hired Lowell when he went on trial on campaign finance charges. The trial dominated the headlines. Edwards was acquitted of one charge and the jury deadlocked on others.\n \n\n   \n  “In these politically charged cases you have to wear two hats. You have to be traditionally good in court … but then you also have to have some sophistication about the way Washington works. Abbe wears both,” said Reid Weingarten, a Washington criminal defense lawyer and long-time friend of Lowell’s. “I think the Edwards trial sent him on the path to become a defense attorney trial guy.”\n \n\n   \n  Weingarten encountered Lowell decades earlier when he was a prosecutor investigating a Tennessee lawmaker who Lowell represented.\n \n\n   \n  “Each thing he handled he took incredibly seriously like there was nothing more important than this particular matter, this client, this cross examination. It accounts for much of his success,” said Weingarten. “He devotes his all to it and Abbe’s all is way more than most.” (The lawmaker was not charged with any wrongdoing.)\n \n\n   \n  New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez turned to Lowell when he faced bribery charges in 2017. Then, a Newark jury failed to reach a verdict and a federal judge later  acquitted  Menendez on some charges. (Menendez was convicted in 2024 on different bribery charges in New York. Lowell did not represent him at trial).\n \n\n   \n  Lowell also represented Matthew Grimes, a former assistant to Trump donor and loyalist Tom Barrack. Barrack, who is now US ambassador to Turkey, and Grimes were both acquitted of federal charges of acting as foreign agents.\n \n\n   \n  During the trial, Lowell fumbled with his microphone as he spoke with the jury and read aloud text messages, translating emojis as “smiley face,” that Grimes sent to an overseas counterpart who was part of the alleged scheme.\n \n\n   \n  One person involved in the case, who did not want to be identified, said Lowell’s actions appeared to disarm his client to the jury and turned the allegedly criminal exchanges into seemingly benign chats between young men looking to impress each other.\n \n\n   \n  “He understands all the intangibles that go into presenting to a jury that’s different from the facts and the law. Those are the things that make him a very good lawyer,” said one lawyer who has opposed him.\n \n\n   \n  “Outside of the courtroom, generally, he’s a tough guy. He’s no holds-barred – a lot of posturing, a lot of self-righteousness. It worked for him,” the person said.\n \n\n   \n    Accused of posturing\n \n\n   \n  Lowell’s posturing and what some lawyers describe as brash manner aren’t without controversy.\n \n\n   \n  He took over Hunter Biden’s representation after a plea deal to end the criminal investigation blew up spectacularly during a court hearing, ending any potential for the case to be resolved before his father’s re-election campaign.\n \n\n   \n  Lowell shifted the strategy to a more aggressive public posture, sparring with Republicans on the hill and teeing the case for trial.\n \n\n   \n  During the trial, lurid details of Hunter Biden’s drug use and sex life spilled into the public in the middle of Biden’s re-election campaign.\n \n\n   \n  During  opening arguments , Lowell leaned into Biden’s drug use as something millions of Americans deal with.

advantage: the long game \n       \n  Analysis by Simone McCarthy, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:01 AM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Chinese leaders have just concluded a  closed-door conclave  focused on drawing up the country’s next five-year economic blueprint – a sweeping plan covering everything from accelerating tech innovation to streamlining how China’s farms grow food.\n \n\n   \n  Stakes are high for formulating that strategy, with Chinese officials under pressure to reduce reliance on imported technology and address economic weaknesses as the country faces a deepening rivalry with the US.\n \n\n   \n  But drawing up the plan – especially at a moment when Washington remains  immobilized by a government shutdown  over spending for the current fiscal year – also gives leader Xi Jinping an opportunity to showcase a source of his confidence in China’s rise: the authoritarian country’s ability to produce – and deliver on – far-reaching visions.\n \n\n   \n  Chinese state media and officials have not been delicate about playing up what they see as that competitive advantage in recent days.\n \n\n   \n  “Scientifically formulating and continuously implementing the five-year plan is … a key political advantage of socialism with Chinese characteristics. Many foreign political parties envy us for this,” Jiang Jinquan, an official with the Communist Party Central Committee’s Policy Research Office, said at a press briefing Friday, adding that such plans were essential for “gaining strategic initiative in the midst of intense international competition.”\n \n\n   \n  A  commentary  in the Communist Party mouthpiece People’s Daily published Thursday praised how China “views the whole country as one chessboard… and continues to advance steadily along the correct direction,” while “some countries remain trapped in the shortsightedness and constant policy reversals under multiparty systems.”\n \n\n   \n  “Long-termism,” a blend of continuity and flexibility, is something “Western countries find difficult to match,” another  article , in state media agency Xinhua, quoted Tsinghua University professor Yan Yilong as saying.\n \n\n   \n  A separate  commentary  published by Beijing Daily, meanwhile, spotlighted the “out of control” situation in the US, pointing to the “No Kings” protests, the government shutdown, and a controversial  AI-generated video meme  shared by US President Donald Trump last weekend.\n \n\n   \n  It concluded: “The (American) halo is illusory, and the myth is fragile. To use Trump’s own words: The United States has become a failed state in many ways and is ‘dying from within.’”\n \n\n   \n  Such rhetoric is, of course, not unusual within China’s tightly controlled propaganda environment. And officials have long looked to play up the ills of other countries, especially the US, to boost their own image for domestic and, increasingly, international audiences.\n \n\n   \n  But the sentiment also reflects the thinking of the country’s ruling Communist Party – and its leader Xi – at a moment when the two countries are sparring over tech and trade as they grapple with how to structure their economic relationship and rivalry.\n \n\n   \n  And the chance to amplify that sentiment, through the pomp of crafting the upcoming five-year plan, couldn’t come at a better moment for Xi, days ahead of a meeting with Trump on the sidelines of an international summit in South Korea, and weeks after China reignited US ire by expanding its  rare earths export control regime. \n \n\n   \n    The five-year plan\n \n\n   \n  Full details of the upcoming five-year plan will not be released until after its approval by China’s rubber-stamp legislature in March. But an overview of the priorities approved by a powerful Communist Party committee that met over four days this week exuded confidence in China’s continued rise.\n \n\n   \n  “We will strive for another five years to achieve a significant leap forward in our country’s economic strength, scientific and technological capabilities, national defense strength, comprehensive national power, and international influence by 2035,” a communique released by state media Thursday said.\n \n\n   \n  Officials would “accelerate the development of building China’s strength in manufacturing, product quality, aerospace, transportation, and cyberspace.”\n \n\n   \n  Leaders signaled they would stay the course on “accelerating high-level scientific and technological self-reliance” and infusing high tech into industry – building on China’s current efforts to upgrade its manufacturing and capacity to innovate.\n \n\n   \n  “The proposals advocate for a forward-looking layout for future industries, promoting quantum technology, biotechnology, hydrogen energy, nuclear fusion, brain-computer interfaces, embodied intelligence, and sixth-generation mobile communications as new drivers of economic growth,” Zheng Shanjie, head of China’s National Development and Reform Commission, told reporters Friday.\n \n\n   \n  The signaling following the meeting in Beijing suggested China would double down on its position as a manufacturing and industrial powerhouse, despite longstanding views from some analysts that it should transition to a services-driven economy as many developed economies have. The communique also stressed the importance of national security and the need to “accelerate the building of advanced combat capabilities” for the military.\n \n\n   \n  Officials pointed to efforts to address challenges like flagging domestic consumption, socioeconomic inequality and “involution” – or cutthroat domestic competition linked to overcapacity. China would “vigorously boost consumption” and “improve the social security system,” as well as further opening China’s market to international players, according to the communique.\n \n\n   \n  How officials precisely plan to achieve these goals will only become clearer over the coming months and years.\n \n\n   \n    ‘A vital political advantage’\n \n\n   \n  Observers have long noted the ability of China’s tightly controlled system to achieve far-reaching goals.\n \n\n   \n  The country has raised hundreds of millions out of poverty, transformed into the world’s second-largest economy and a global growth engine, and more recently emerged as a technological powerhouse and a proponent of the green transition across the world.\n \n\n   \n  And as the US shakes up its own foreign and domestic policy under Trump, Beijing is also touting China’s planning as proof that it, not the US, is a responsible global leader.\n \n\n   \n  “In today’s global environment, some major powers frequently change their policies, and such ‘unpredictability’ has cast a shadow over world peace and development,” an editorial in state-backed tabloid Global Times published Friday said.\n \n\n   \n  “The development roadmap unveiled in the communique for China’s next five years offers the world something truly rare in these turbulent times – certainty,” it added.\n \n\n   \n  Unlike in Western democracies, where visions for a country are articulated by leaders elected by popular vote – and can often be voted down by opposition lawmakers – China’s five-year plans are crafted in the upper echelons of the Communist Party, ostensibly with what Beijing calls “mass consultation” with various sectors of society. Xi sits “at the helm” of this process, according to state media.\n \n\n   \n  Once set, five-year plans act as marching orders for officials across the sprawling apparatus of the government and a guide for businesses, universities and other organizations on how to align their own strategies with the party’s.\n \n\n   \n  Such plans have at times had disastrous consequences. The “Great Leap Forward” associated with the second five-year plan of 1958, that was supposed to drive China’s industrialization, instead drove the country into famine, killing an estimated tens of millions of people.\n \n\n   \n  More recently, plans have spurred China’s energetic efforts to build out new industries like green technology and electric vehicles and upgrade factory production, but also shown some of the drawbacks of state-backed planning.\n \n\n   \n  Take EVs, for example. China now dominates the sector globally, yet state support has also created artificial market saturation, driving price wars and an ongoing wave of company failures.\n \n\n   \n  But for Xi, who is determined not to see China’s rise hindered by Western export controls and trade barriers, it’s clear that the power to chart out a vision, to deliver with a deadline in 2030, underlines his faith that his system will ultimately win out.\n \n\n   \n  Or in his own words, as recently quoted in state media, when it comes to China’s “revitalization,” this planning creates “a vital political advantage.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/us/minneapolis-school-shooting-sophia-forchas-released","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"10:59:00-05:00","title":"57 days after a gunshot to the head, 12-year-old school massacre survivor has returned home","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 12-year-old girl, Sophia Forchas, survived a devastating gunshot wound to the head sustained during a prayer session at Annunciation Catholic School on August 27, 2025.

CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:00 AM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Department of Homeland Security is funneling $10 billion through the Navy to help facilitate the construction of a sprawling network of migrant   detention centers across the US in an arrangement aimed at getting the centers built faster, according to sources and federal contracting documents.\n \n\n   \n  Construction on some of the facilities is set to begin as soon as next month, one of the sources familiar with the project told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  It’s the latest example of the Trump administration  leveraging the US military  to support its immigration enforcement efforts, stemming from the White House’s desire to dramatically  ramp up nationwide immigration operations  and arrest a record number of migrants.\n \n\n   \n  The contracting program, which has not been previously reported, is a joint effort between DHS and the Defense Department and leans on the Navy’s Supply Systems Command as a contracting arm to hire companies for construction and maintenance of the detention facilities.\n \n\n   \n  The new detention centers are likely to be primarily soft-sided tents and may or may not be built on existing Navy installations, according to the sources familiar with the initiative. DHS has often leaned on soft-sided facilities to manage influxes of migrants.\n \n\n   \n  One of the sources said the goal is for the facilities to house as many as 10,000 people each, and are expected to be built in Louisiana, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Utah and Kansas. Additional details about the facilities remain unclear, as the contracting process is still ongoing.\n \n\n   \n  An uptick in immigration arrests has required more detention space to hold people for processing and potentially deportation. ICE, which also uses local jails to hold people, was previously funded for around 41,000 beds to temporarily house detainees. White House border czar Tom Homan has said he wants to double that number of detention beds—and fast.\n \n\n   \n  For that reason, Homeland Security officials have been trying to find ways to quickly secure contracts, which can often be delayed by federal competition rules. DHS has been “bouncing around from one contract vehicle to another,” one source said, as challenges and delays in contracts have previously created headaches for the department.\n \n\n   \n  In July, ICE secured $45 billion worth of additional funding from Congress to build new detention facilities. One such facility was built at Fort Bliss Army base in Texas and  reportedly violated  dozens of federal detention standards.\n \n\n   \n  The latest contract approach, through the Defense Department, is expected to narrow the pool of eligible contractors and accelerate the contracting process, sources told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The Navy solicitation listed on a federal contracting site provides a preview of what will be expected of contractors. For example, they will be expected to build a range of structures within the detention facilities themselves, including courtrooms and administrative and support space for ICE staff, according to the documents reviewed by CNN. And they will be required to ensure ready access to emergency services and airport transfers, the documents say, highlighting ICE’s varied needs as it works to carry out Trump’s mass deportation agenda.\n \n\n   \n  The Navy and DHS did not return requests for comment.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not surprising they would do this, especially for this type of quick turnaround construction,” said Todd Harrison, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who focuses on defense spending. “The military is good at logistics, and they’ve had to do quick turn construction projects like this overseas. You’re already dealing with an organization that knows how to do this type of contracting activity, and do it quickly.”\n \n\n   \n  To facilitate the construction, the Navy quietly broadened an existing contracting mechanism in July to “add a new geographic region”— the United States and outlying territories.\n \n\n   \n  Previously, the contract solicitation, known as the Worldwide Expeditionary Multiple Award Contract, had been used primarily to support military operations abroad. But in July, it was amended as “WEXMAC 2.1, Territorial Integrity of the United States,” and now notes that contractors “may be required to provide infrastructure, staffing, services, and/or supplies necessary to provide safe and secure confinement for aliens in the administrative custody” of DHS and ICE.\n \n\n   \n  It also stipulates that new contracts will involve Defense Support of Civil Authorities — a process by which US military assets and personnel can be used to support domestic law enforcement missions — and says that contractors “will provide for the secure custody, care, and safekeeping of aliens in accordance with state and local laws, standards, policies, procedures for firearms requirements, or court orders applicable.”\n \n\n   \n  The new solicitation also says that contractors building and staffing the facilities do not have “right of refusal, and shall take all referrals from ICE as applicable.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/politics/new-york-attorney-general-letitia-james-lindsey-halligan","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"10:01:00-23:00","title":"NY AG Letitia James to ask for her case to be dismissed due to appointment of Lindsey Halligan","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"New York Attorney General Letitia James has filed a motion to dismiss her indictment on charges of bank fraud and false statements, arguing that the appointment of Lindsey Halligan—presumably a handpicked prosecutor by President Donald Trump—violates ethical and procedural standards.

\n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  New York Attorney General Letitia James  filed a notice on Thursday  that her legal team plans to ask for her indictment to be dismissed, citing the appointment of President Donald Trump’s handpicked prosecutor Lindsey Halligan, according to a filing submitted by James’ legal team.\n \n\n   \n  “Please take notice that on October 24, 2025, Letitia James, by counsel, will file her motion to dismiss the indictment that challenges the unlawful appointment of the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, Lindsey Halligan,” the court filing said.\n \n\n   \n  The brief two-page filing also included a footnote referring to another recent indictment against former FBI Director  James Comey , who is also seeking to have his indictment dismissed due to Halligan’s appointment. The footnote says the two motions, “should likely be consolidated.”\n \n\n   \n  James was  indicted  on two felony charges of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution on October 9. James is scheduled to appear in court in Norfolk, Virginia, on Friday at 11 a.m. ET.\n \n\n   \n  Halligan is expected to be in the Friday hearing, according to a source familiar.\n \n\n   \n  A hearing on Comey’s motion is scheduled for November 13.\n \n\n   \n    Asks to bar DOJ from talking to press\n \n\n   \n  Also Thursday,  James asked the federal judge  overseeing her criminal case to bar federal prosecutors from talking with the media about it to ensure she has a fair trial.\n \n\n   \n  Halligan had communicated with a reporter about the case two days after she persuaded a federal grand jury to indict James.\n \n\n   \n  Those comments – which were reported earlier this week by the journalist, Anna Bower – represented “a stunning disclosure of internal government information,” attorneys for James told US District Judge Jamar Walker. They noted that the conversation, which was initiated by Halligan and occurred over the messaging platform Signal, included the prosecutor’s thoughts on the “credibility and general strength of the evidence presented to the grand jury.”\n \n\n   \n  “These extrajudicial statements and prejudicial disclosures by any prosecutor, let alone one purporting to be the U.S. Attorney, run afoul of and violate the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Code of Federal Regulations, this Court’s Local Rules, various rules of ethical and professional responsibility, and DOJ’s Justice Manual,” James’ attorneys wrote in court papers.\n \n\n   \n  “In order to ensure a fair trial and impartial proceedings for Attorney General James, we respectfully seek the Court’s intervention to prevent any further disclosures by government attorneys and agents of investigative and case materials, and statements to the media and public, concerning this case and any parties or witnesses,” the lawyers told the judge.\n \n\n   \n  They’re asking for a court order that would, among other things, bar Halligan and other prosecutors in the case from making “extrajudicial disclosures of investigative and case materials, and statements to the media and journalists.”\n \n\n   \n  Under their proposed order, prosecutors would also need to keep a list of all contacts they have with members of the media.\n \n\n   \n  “As the prosecutor who is ‘handling the case’ against Attorney General James and purporting to be the U.S. Attorney, Ms. Halligan is supposed to be the standard-bearer of the professional responsibility rules rather than the District’s violator-in-chief,” the attorney general’s lawyers wrote in their filing.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Kristen Holmes contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/politics/trump-retribution-public-opinion-analysis","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"12:01:00-04:00","title":"Americans seem to see through Trump’s legal retribution","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Americans are increasingly viewing the Trump administration’s legal actions against political opponents as politically motivated and less serious than the indictments brought against Trump himself.

On Friday, New York Attorney General Letitia James is due to be arraigned in Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  And  CNN reported  Thursday that Ed Martin, one of the most polarizing Trump Justice Department officials, has been pushing for the investigation into Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff’s alleged mortgage fraud to lead to an indictment, despite prosecutors from the Maryland US Attorney’s Office being hesitant to proceed with charges.\n \n\n   \n  Trump declined to weigh in on a possible Schiff indictment on Thursday, saying, “I hope it’s true, but I don’t know anything.”\n \n\n   \n  As the administration has targeted the president’s enemies, the big question has been whether Americans would see it as just some political tit-for-tat equivalent to the indictments of Trump, or whether they’d recognize it as an extraordinary weaponization of the justice system.\n \n\n   \n  The early verdict is in.\n \n\n   \n  Americans seem to see charges the Trump administration has brought against its enemies as significantly less serious and significantly more politicized than the indictments of Trump.\n \n\n   \n  A  Quinnipiac University poll  this week showed voters agreed 52%-38% that Trump was “using the U.S. Justice Department to file unjustified criminal charges against his political opponents.”\n \n\n   \n  Independents agreed with that sentiment by a nearly 2-to-1 margin, 58%-31%.\n \n\n   \n  A  Reuters-Ipsos poll , meanwhile, showed Americans said 55%-26% that Trump was using federal law enforcement to go after his enemies. Even 29% of Republicans agreed with this.\n \n\n   \n  (The question, unlike the Quinnipiac poll, didn’t ask people to judge the legitimacy of the charges.)\n \n\n   \n  The polls would seem to be in line with a late September  survey from the Pew Research Center .\n \n\n   \n  That poll was conducted shortly after Trump removed a US attorney who resisted bringing charges against James and issued a public call for Attorney General Pam Bondi to bring them against Comey and James. Comey’s indictment landed soon after, which fell in the middle of the poll’s survey period.\n \n\n   \n  Pew showed 62% of Americans agreed Trump was at least “probably” improperly encouraging federal investigations of his political opponents. Even 40% of Republican-leaning Americans said Trump was probably doing this.\n \n\n   \n  These are pretty striking numbers that suggest a potential political problem for Trump, even as he moves forward.\n \n\n   \n  And perhaps most notably, the numbers suggest Americans see the situation as quite different from Trump’s indictments.\n \n\n   \n  The president baselessly accused then-President Joe Biden and a “weaponized” Justice Department of being behind the charges against him. (In fact, there is  much more to tie Trump to orchestrating the Comey and James indictments .)\n \n\n   \n  Analysts have generally regarded the recent classified documents charges against a third Trump foe, former national security adviser John Bolton,  as being more substantial . The case originated in the Biden administration, and Trump didn’t publicly push it like he did the James and Comey cases – or fire a prosecutor.\n \n\n   \n  But Americans seem to see the charges against Trump as simply more serious than the overall charges his administration has brought against his enemies.\n \n\n   \n  While just 38% of voters in the Quinnipiac poll said the charges against Trump’s opponents were justified, Americans generally said by clear, double-digit margins that the cases against Trump were legitimate – and even that he was guilty. (Trump pleaded not guilty in all cases against him.)\n \n\n   \n  Americans said 56%-41% that the investigations against Trump were “fair” rather than a “witch hunt,” according to a  March 2023 Marist College poll  conducted shortly before his  first indictment.\n \n\n   \n  And they said  47%-31% that the charges owed to Trump’s own actions , rather than an “abuse of the justice system,” according to an August 2023 CNN poll.\n \n\n   \n  Americans said  57%-41%  that the Justice Department was holding Trump accountable like anyone else, rather than that DOJ was “unfairly targeting Trump for political reasons,” according to a December 2023 Washington Post-University of Maryland poll.\n \n\n   \n  And they said 58%-37% that there was “credible evidence” that Trump committed serious federal crimes, according to an August 2023  Public Religion Research Institute poll .\n \n\n   \n  Near-majorities of Americans  saw political motivations  in many of the cases. And even more saw that in the Manhattan hush money case in which Trump was eventually convicted.\n \n\n   \n  But that didn’t mean Americans saw those cases as illegitimate “witch hunts” or “hoaxes,” as Trump claims they were.\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, Americans seem much more inclined to believe that about the cases Trump is orchestrating against his foes.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/politics/trump-drug-traffickers-congress-venezuela","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"10:07:00-23:00","title":"Trump insists he can strike alleged drug traffickers without Congress declaring war","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has stated that he can launch military strikes against alleged drug traffickers in countries like Venezuela without requiring a formal declaration of war from Congress, asserting that such actions are justified and will be communicated to lawmakers.

\n  By Adam Cancryn, Avery Schmitz, Natasha Bertrand, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:07 PM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump on Thursday insisted that he could continue to launch  strikes against alleged drug traffickers  abroad without Congress first passing an official declaration of war.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not going to necessarily ask for a declaration of war,” he said. “I think we’re just doing to kill people that are bringing drugs into our country. Okay? We’re going to kill them, you know, they’re going to be like, dead.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s dismissal came as he suggested his administration would  soon begin targeting  those deemed as cartel members within countries like Venezuela, in addition to continuing to strike alleged drug boats in international waters.\n \n\n   \n  The president said he would notify Congress first before beginning any operations on “land,” but contended that the plan would not face any pushback from lawmakers.\n \n\n   \n  “We going to go. I don’t see any loss in going” to Congress, Trump said. “We’re going to tell them what we’re going to do and I think they’ll probably like it, except for the radical left lunatics.”\n \n\n   \n  The lethal strikes on vessels in the Caribbean and east Pacific have unnerved some lawmakers, given the little evidence the administration has presented proving that the targets were so-called narco-terrorists.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth insisted that the military has confirmed that each targeted boat is trafficking drugs. Still, he defended the decision to  return two survivors  of a recent strike as “standard” practice in war.\n \n\n   \n  “Compared to Iraq and Afghanistan, the vast majority of people that we captured on the battlefield we handed over to the home country,” he said, referencing the US’ wars in the Middle East. “So in this case, those two, they were treated by American medics and handed immediately over to their countries where they came from.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s remarks come as an American B-1 Lancer bomber flew near the coast of Venezuela on Thursday, although the president denied that the US sent the B-1 bomber.\n \n\n   \n  “No, it’s not accurate. No. It’s false. But we’re not happy with Venezuela for a lot of reasons. Drugs being one of them, but also they’ve been sending their prisoners into our country for years under the Biden administration, not anymore, we have a closed border,” Trump said.\n \n\n   \n  The aircraft first appeared on flight-tracking dashboards southwest of the Dallas Fort Worth area around 4:30 a.m. ET on Thursday and at its closest point was a little more than 50 miles from the Venezuelan mainland.\n \n\n   \n  About nine hours later, open-source flight data showed the bomber reappearing for around 15 minutes within Venezuela’s flight information region (FIR) – an area where air traffic control is provided by Venezuelan authorities.\n \n\n   \n  However, it was not immediately clear whether the plane — which was accompanied by a second aircraft during its appearance in the FIR — entered Venezuelan airspace.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the Defense Department for comment.\n \n\n   \n  The flight comes as tensions continue to rise between the two countries following the deployment of US warships to the Caribbean on what Washington has said is part of a counter-drug trafficking campaign but Caracus fears is a cover for regime change.\n \n\n   \n  Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Wednesday claimed his country had  5,000 Russian-made Igla-S anti-aircraft missiles  in “key air defense positions.”\n \n\n   \n  The missiles are short-range, low-altitude systems that can shoot down small aerial targets such as cruise missiles, drones and low-flying planes. While B-1s can fly at altitudes as high as 60,000 feet they can also operate as low as 200 feet above the ground.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/politics/cuomo-mamdani-islam-nyc-mayoral-race","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"11:03:00-11:03","title":"Cuomo invokes fears of Mamdani’s Muslim faith in final days of NYC mayoral race","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the final days of the New York City mayoral race, Andrew Cuomo, the former governor running an independent campaign, intensified efforts to stoke fears about Zohran Mamdani’s Muslim faith.

days of NYC mayoral race \n       \n  By Gloria Pazmino, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:03 PM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Andrew Cuomo kept up a late-campaign effort to raise fears about the Muslim faith of Zohran Mamdani, the front-runner in the New York City mayoral race, even laughing Thursday at the suggestion that Mamdani would cheer a terror attack like 9/11 were it to happen again.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo, the former New York governor running an independent bid after losing to Mamdani in the Democratic primary, chuckled as radio host Sid Rosenberg, who has previously called Mamdani an “animal” and a “jihadist,” closed out a segment by calling Mamdani a “terrorist.”\n \n\n   \n  “God forbid, another 9/11. Can you imagine Mamdani in the seat?” Cuomo posited.\n \n\n   \n  “He’d be cheering,” Rosenberg responded.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo paused and laughed along, adding, “That’s another problem.”\n \n\n   \n  The comments, made just days before New Yorkers cast their ballots, was the latest invocation by Cuomo of Mamdani’s Muslim faith and background.\n \n\n   \n  In the last days before the November 4 general election, Cuomo has repeatedly focused on Mamdani’s religion, arguing he was betraying Islam by supporting the decriminalization of sex work while also suggesting that Mamdani would betray New York City on matters of public safety and terrorism as he appeals to moderates and conservatives as well as Jewish voters concerned about  Mamdani’s criticism of Israel .\n \n\n   \n  Asked if he believed Cuomo was making Islamophobic statements against him, Mamdani replied with “yes.”\n \n\n   \n  “We’re speaking about a former governor who, in his final moments in public life, is engaging in rhetoric that is not only Islamophobic, not only racist, it’s also disgusting,” Mamdani told reporters Thursday. “Andrew Cuomo’s message is to smear and slander the first Muslim candidate on the verge of leading this city where 1 in 8 New Yorkers are Muslim and say that by virtue of your faith you are worthy of suspicion.”\n \n\n   \n  Among the Democrats who ripped Cuomo’s comments was US Rep. Ritchie Torres, who has  been a sharp critic  of Mamdani.\n \n\n   \n  “It should be possible to critique a candidate’s ideas without demonizing the candidate himself,” Torres  wrote  on X. “To insinuate that a mayoral candidate would celebrate a second 9/11 is beyond disgusting and disgraceful. We all have a responsibility to lower the temperature and to restore a measure of civility to our public discourse.”\n \n\n   \n  In one mayoral debate, Cuomo tore into Mamdani, who is a Shia Muslim, by referencing Sunni Muslims and saying Mamdani had ideas that were “haram,” or forbidden. The Shia-Sunni split dates nearly to the founding of Islam and has often animated religious and political tensions among Muslims.\n \n\n   \n  “To Zohran, I believe you have been a divisive force in New York, and I believe that’s toxic energy for New York,” Cuomo said. “It’s with the Sunni Muslims when you say decriminalize prostitution, which is haram.”\n \n\n   \n  Standing next to Mayor Eric Adams on Thursday hours after his radio interview, Cuomo nodded as Adams appeared to suggest Mamdani’s election would usher in Islamic extremism to New York.\n \n\n   \n  “New York can’t be Europe, folks,” Adams said “You see what’s playing out in other countries because of Islamic extremism, not Muslims. Let’s not mix this up.”\n \n\n   \n  During Wednesday night’s debate, the Cuomo campaign posted and then quickly deleted an AI-generated video to social media, showing a fake version of Mamdani using his hands to shove rice into his mouth as a voiceover warned about Mamdani’s “radical” ideas.\n \n\n   \n  “The video was a proposal that wasn’t approved, wasn’t finished and didn’t go through the normal legal process,” Cuomo spokesperson Rich Azzopardi said. “It was posted for five minutes before it was taken down.”\n \n\n   \n  And during the Democratic primary campaign, an anti-Mamdani super PAC that raised millions for Cuomo ran television ads that described Mamdani as “dangerous” by exclusively using footage of him wearing traditional South Asian clothing. Mamdani usually wears a suit when campaigning. Mamdani also accused Cuomo of sending mailers to voters which showed him with a darkened beard.\n \n\n   \n  Zara Rahim, a senior adviser on Mamdani’s campaign, said Cuomo was “trying to define what being Muslim should look like.”\n \n\n   \n  “He has only tried to court Muslim people by saying look at this bad Muslim – that is a desperate tactic from a man who has nothing to say to Muslim people,” Rahim said.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo was questioned earlier this year for never having visited a mosque during his nearly 12 years as governor of New York, a state home to one of the largest Muslim populations in the country. Now, his campaign says he’s been to several, sometimes making multiple stops in a single week.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo’s newfound effort to court the South Asian community was also the topic of intense sparring between Cuomo and Mamdani in the first debate, with Cuomo at one point suggesting Mamdani’s politics are not “representative” of the Muslim community or “follow the Muslim faith.”\n \n\n   \n  A visibly miffed Mamdani responded by pointing out Cuomo hadn’t visited a mosque until after he lost in the Democratic primary.\n \n\n   \n  “It took me to get you to even see those Muslims as part of this city, and that frankly is something that is shameful,” Mamdani said.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo’s campaign also launched an effort called “Hindus for Cuomo,” with visits to Hindu mandirs, or temples, where he decries democratic socialism. And following others’ cues, he’s learned to bow and touch the floor when entering a gurdwara, a Sikh place of worship.\n \n\n   \n  Aides to Cuomo believe he may be able to peel away some support among older, more conservative voters who tend to focus on public safety and education. They are hoping Cuomo’s promises to hire more officers and expand the city’s gifted and talented schools could pull some immigrant voters away from Mamdani, who has called for police reforms while disavowing his past calls to defund law enforcement and proposed narrowing gifted programs.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani, an immigrant from Uganda, was raised by Indian parents in Manhattan and was 9 years old on September 11, 2001.\n \n\n   \n  He has spoken about how growing up in the post 9/11 world shaped his childhood, echoing a similar story told by thousands of children who were in school the morning of the attacks.\n \n\n   \n  “Zohran grew up in the shadow of 9/11,” Rahim, his senior adviser, said Thursday. “At the end of the day, this is New York City and New Yorkers are very familiar with garden-variety Islamophobia; they see it and reject it.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/politics/virginia-democrats-house-redistricting-battle","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"10:37:00-23:00","title":"Virginia Democrats Prepare to Reshape US House Districts in Counter to Trump’s Redistricting Push","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Virginia Democrats are preparing to redraw their congressional districts in response to President Donald Trump’s push for partisan redistricting in Republican-led states, aiming to gain more seats and ensure fair representation.

\n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  Virginia Democrats are taking steps to redraw their state’s US House districts, hoping to boost the party’s chances in next year’s midterm elections and counter President Donald Trump’s push for more partisan districts in Republican-run states.\n \n\n   \n  Virginia House Speaker Don Scott sent a letter Thursday to members telling them to convene Monday for a special session but did not state a reason. The purpose includes congressional redistricting aimed at gaining more Democratic-held seats, according to four sources with direct knowledge of the plans who spoke on condition of anonymity to The Associated Press because they are not authorized to publicly discuss them.\n \n\n   \n  Virginia would be the second state with a Democratic-led legislature after  California  to enter a national redistricting battle with enormous stakes. If Democrats gain just three more seats, they would take control of the House and effectively impede Trump’s agenda.\n \n\n   \n  Republican lawmakers in  Texas ,  Missouri  and  North Carolina  already have approved new congressional maps aimed at helping their party win more seats and retain the slim GOP House majority. And even more states are considering redistricting as the battle front widens.\n \n\n   \n  A spokeswoman for Democrats’ House campaign arm characterized the Virginia effort as the party pursuing “every available tool to counter Republicans’ desperate attempts to steal the midterms.”\n \n\n   \n  “Virginia’s decision to convene and preserve the right to consider a new map in 2026 is critical in the fight to ensure voters have fair representation,” said Courtney Rice, communications director for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\n \n\n   \n  Republicans vowed to fight. Virginia House Minority Leader Terry Kilgore said Democrats missed their opportunity to carry out this procedure by 2026 and that it’s “too late constitutionally” to do so.\n \n\n   \n  “We are going to do everything legally we can do to stop this power grab,” Kilgore said.\n \n\n   \n  Voting districts typically are redrawn at the start of each decade to account for population changes noted by the census. But Trump took the unusual step over the summer of urging Republican-led states to reshape key districts to try to buck a historical trend of a president’s party losing seats in midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  Virginia currently is represented in the US House by six Democrats and five Republicans who ran in districts with boundaries imposed by a court after a bipartisan redistricting commission failed to agree on a map after the 2020 census.\n \n\n   \n  The effort to redraw Virginia’s congressional districts comes in the final weeks before the November 4 state legislative and statewide elections. But Monday’s session is just the start of what could be a long legislative process, running past the election.\n \n\n   \n  Because Virginia’s redistricting commission was established by a voter-approved constitutional amendment, the electorate must sign off on any changes. And any proposed change to the constitution must first pass the legislature in two separate sessions. Democrats are scrambling to hold that first vote this year, so that they can approve the change a second time after a new legislative session begins January 14.\n \n\n   \n  Voters still would have to approve a change in the constitution to allow using the new House map. And that vote would need to occur before congressional primaries, which are currently set for June 16 — though dates for such elections have been pushed back in the past.\n \n\n   \n  In many states, congressional districts are drawn by state lawmakers, subject to the approval of the governor. But North Carolina’s new map, which received final approval Wednesday from the Republican-led Legislature, did not have to go to Democratic Gov. Josh Stein. Those changes target a swing district held by Democratic US Rep. Don Davis by adding areas that contain more Republican-leaning voters.\n \n\n   \n  Like Virginia,  California  has a constitutionally established redistricting commission, which approved maps after the 2020 census. California voters are to decide in a November 4 election whether to temporarily suspend those districts and instead use a map approved by the Democratic-led Legislature that could help Democrats pick up as many as five additional seats.\n \n\n   \n  No voter approval is necessary for the revised districts in Missouri, North Carolina or Texas, though opponents in Missouri are gathering petition signatures to try to force a statewide vote on their new map.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/weather/tropical-storm-hurricane-melissa-caribbean-track","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"20:19:00-04:00","title":"Melissa Forecast to Become Major Hurricane, Threatening Jamaica and Caribbean Nations","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tropical Storm Melissa is forecast to intensify into a major hurricane (Category 3 or greater) by the weekend of October 24–27, 2025, due to slow movement and warm ocean waters.

The longer it lingers, the more rain it dumps and the more likely it is to rapidly intensify into a monster storm.\n \n\n   \n  Intensity forecasts have ramped up considerably in the past few days. A worst-case scenario for some Caribbean islands is increasingly likely with Melissa set to reach at least Category 4 hurricane strength next week, fueled by extremely warm water.\n \n\n   \n  A tropical storm warning is in effect for Jamaica with Melissa’s outermost winds expected to reach there in the next day or so. Hurricane watches are in effect for Jamaica and parts of Haiti, meaning hurricane-force winds are possible by the weekend. Haiti, Jamaica and parts of the Dominican Republic face days of heavy rain that threaten significant flash flooding and dangerous mudslides.\n \n\n   \n  Jamaica could end up being the epicenter of the worst Melissa has to offer, based on current forecasts. Preparations were well underway in the country Thursday as officials urged residents to take Melissa seriously and stay vigilant.\n \n\n   \n  All public hospitals are set to go into “emergency mode” Thursday evening, Christopher Tufton, Jamaica’s Minister of Health and Wellness confirmed at  a news conference . This designation halts outpatient and elective procedures and ensures more beds are open for emergencies.\n \n\n   \n  Jamaica’s airports remain open for now, but will likely close within 24 hours of a hurricane warning being issued for the country, according to Daryl Vaz, Minister of Science, Energy, Telecommunications and Transport.\n \n\n   \n  As of Thursday evening, Melissa was about 165 miles south-southeast of Kingston, Jamaica, with sustained winds of 45 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center. It’s drifting north-northwest at just 2 mph, slower than the average person on an afternoon stroll.\n \n\n   \n  Melissa is forecast to reach hurricane strength by the weekend and will likely rapidly intensify into a  major hurricane  — Category 3 or greater — Monday. This explosive strengthening is  happening more often  as the world warms due to fossil fuel pollution. Three of the four Atlantic hurricanes this season underwent  extreme rapid intensification :  Erin ,  Gabrielle  and  Humberto .\n \n\n   \n  Melissa is already bringing heavy rain to parts of the Caribbean. Up to 10 inches of rain could fall, with isolated totals topping a foot across southern Haiti, southern Dominican Republic and eastern Jamaica through the weekend. Those totals will likely climb even higher early next week, but by exactly how much depends on Melissa’s track and intensity.\n \n\n   \n  The United States mainland is not completely out of the woods, but a direct  hit looks unlikely. If Melissa takes longer to turn north, it could bend toward eastern Cuba or the Bahamas before curving into the Atlantic. Even so, rough surf and rip currents could spread along the US East Coast next week.\n \n\n   \n  There’s also still a slim chance that Melissa takes a sharp turn to the north earlier than expected and bears down directly on Haiti. That scenario would deliver highly-concentrated impacts there and torrential rain to the Dominican Republic.\n \n\n   \n    Why Melissa’s forecast is so alarming\n \n\n   \n  Melissa’s path and strength will keep evolving in the days ahead, but the warning signs are already there for millions of vulnerable people in the Caribbean.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/asia/myanmar-starlink-scam-centers-spacex-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"10:20:00-04:00","title":"SpaceX disables thousands of Starlink devices being used by Myanmar scam centers","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"SpaceX has disabled over 2,500 Starlink internet devices used by cyber scam syndicates operating in Myanmar, particularly in border compounds like KK Park.

2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  SpaceX has disabled over 2,500 Starlink devices being used by cyber scam syndicates operating in a lawless corner of Myanmar, the   Elon Musk-led company said Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Despite regional authorities’ highly publicized  crackdowns on the cyberfraud centers  along Myanmar’s border with Thailand this year, the scamming networks have continued to proliferate in the civil war-afflicted nation.\n \n\n   \n  SpaceX said it works to identify violations in all markets where Starlink operates.\n \n\n   \n  “On the rare occasion we identify a violation, we take appropriate action, including working with law enforcement agencies around the world,” said Lauren Dreyer, SpaceX’s vice president of business operations for Starlink, in a post on X.\n \n\n   \n  “In Myanmar, for example, SpaceX proactively identified and disabled over 2,500 Starlink Kits in the vicinity of suspected ‘scam centers’.”\n \n\n   \n  Dreyer did not provide a date for when the consoles were disabled, but the announcement comes after the Myanmar military junta said it discovered 30 sets of Starlink “receivers and accessories” during a raid on one such scam compound this week.\n \n\n   \n  There are about 30 sprawling, purpose-built compounds dotted along the Myanmar-Thai border that are dedicated to scamming victims, including Americans, out of billions of dollars every year, according to  a recent report  by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.\n \n\n   \n  Workers in the scam centers are often lured by the promise of well-paid jobs,  or trafficked, and are routinely held against their will and forced to carry out online fraud schemes in the heavily guarded compounds, where former detainees have  previously told CNN  beatings and torture are common.\n \n\n   \n  For more than a year, concerns have been raised by the United States that criminal networks in Myanmar were using Starlink to access the internet and carry out their scams.\n \n\n   \n  Starlink has more than 6 million global users, according to its website. It provides high-speed internet service using a network of thousands of satellites at low-Earth orbit, enabling it to reach remote communities.\n \n\n   \n  An investigation by the news agency Agence France-Presse this month found that Starlink receivers had been installed on the roofs of the scam compounds at a “huge scale.”\n \n\n   \n  The US Congress Joint Economic Committee has begun an investigation into Starlink’s alleged involvement in the centers, according to the AFP investigation.\n \n\n   \n  The move by SpaceX comes as the global scam industry is growing at an unprecedented rate, according to the UN Office of Drugs and Crime, with criminal groups adopting  artificial intelligence  and using online cryptocurrency markets to move vast amounts of stolen money undetected.\n \n\n   \n  Southeast Asia is a hotspot for these romance or investment scams known as “pig butchering,” named for the practice of fattening up prey before the slaughter. And Myanmar has become an attractive destination for the cybercrime networks, who are shielded by corruption and the military junta.\n \n\n   \n  Kristalyn, from the Phillipines, said she was working in KK Park, a notorious scam compound near Myawaddy, a border town in southeast Myanmar, when the internet was cut at around noon on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  “In the morning the Chinese boss came into our office and told us to return to our rooms,” she told CNN, requesting to use only her first name for safety reasons.\n \n\n   \n  “But not long after, he came back in again and told us to just leave the place,” added Kristalyn, who said she had been working there since July.\n \n\n   \n  She and around 200 other Filipinos, along with others from India, Pakistan and several African countries, were waiting near the border with Thailand and trying to cross over, she told CNN Friday.\n \n\n   \n  “Some of us are staying in abandoned houses, buildings and even some are just staying on the streets trying to cross the border. We have no food here. We have no money at all.”\n \n\n   \n    Civil war\n \n\n   \n  Since taking power in a 2021 coup, the military administration – which does not control all of the country – has fought a civil war against a patchwork of anti-junta and regional ethnic groups.\n \n\n   \n  In February, Thailand  cut electricity supplies  to several areas in Myanmar that are home to the scam sites, to try and disrupt their operations.\n \n\n   \n  Soon after, about 7,000 workers and victims  were released  from scam centers along the border and repatriated in a major operation by Thai authorities.\n \n\n   \n  Between January 30 and October 19, Myanmar’s military junta said it had arrested 9,551 foreign nationals from the scam compounds, repatriating most of them.\n \n\n   \n  But experts have warned that represents a tiny fraction of people trapped and working in the centers.\n \n\n   \n  The military said Monday its raid on KK Park uncovered more than 2,000 workers.\n \n\n   \n  Footage filmed for CNN from inside KK Park in April shows paved roads lined with trees and manicured lawns, giving the image of a legitimate business district, complete with a hotel and billboards advertising gambling sites.\n \n\n   \n  But a source who works in the anti-human-trafficking field told CNN the raid on KK Park has not stopped operations.\n \n\n   \n  While the impact of ceasing Starlink operations “is not nothing,” there were still “many victims trapped inside” other buildings of the compound   who “confirmed last night they’re still being forced to scam,” said the source.\n \n\n   \n  Transnational crime expert Jason Tower said the military raid on KK Park was “more of a publicity stunt than a crackdown” and that it was “business as usual” for dozens of scam compounds still operating along the Moei River that separates Myanmar and Thailand.\n \n\n   \n  “With international attention and outrage over Southeast Asia’s scamdemic rising, the Myanmar military is trying to skirt accountability for transforming the Myanmar-Thailand border lands into a hub for criminality,” said Tower, a senior expert at the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime (GI-TOC).\n \n\n   \n  The Association of Southeast Asian Nations meets for a summit later this week in Malaysia, and the scourge of scam centers is likely to be a top issue on the agenda. “The military is also trying to position itself as continuing to take action on this issue,” Tower said.\n \n\n   \n  A massive  law enforcement operation  by the US and UK that recently targeted a Cambodian criminal scam network “likely pushed China to increase pressure once again on the Myanmar military regime to take further action,” Tower added.\n \n\n   \n  “It is also likely that the Myanmar military seeks to establish more direct control over some of the scam centers, as it realizes just how much illicit revenue is being brought in by this extremely lucrative form of criminal activity,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the military junta for comment.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/style/india-mf-husain-art-intl-hnk-dst","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"12:28:00-04:00","title":"Why ‘India’s Picasso’ is breaking auction records — and enraging the Hindu right","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article examines the polarizing legacy of M.F.

In March 2025, a 14-foot-long painting titled 'Untitled (Gram Yatra)' sold for $13.75 million at Christie’s, setting a new record for modern Indian art. This success contrasts with the controversy that erupted during a June 2025 auction of 25 long-lost Husain paintings in Mumbai, where Hindu nationalist groups threatened protests over his depictions of Hindu deities in suggestive or nude poses. The article traces the roots of this controversy back to 1996, when a magazine published a nude image of Goddess Saraswati, leading to legal action, attacks on Husain’s home, and ultimately his self-imposed exile in 2006. Despite legal rulings clearing him of obscenity charges, Husain remained a symbol of the tension between artistic freedom and religious sensibilities. Scholars and supporters argue that Husain drew from Indian art history and treated all religious figures equally, while critics frame his work as a desecration of Hindu modesty.

Husain, one of 20th-century India’s most important artists, this year has been a tale of two auctions.\n \n\n   \n  In March, one of the late painter’s monumental depictions of rural life, the 14-foot-long “Untitled (Gram Yatra),” became the  most expensive  modern Indian artwork ever to go under the hammer. The $13.75 million price tag almost doubled the previous record, with onlookers at Christie’s in New York bursting into spontaneous applause.\n \n\n   \n  Three months later, an auction of 25 long-lost Husain paintings in Mumbai was far less celebratory. Police  patrolled the premises  and erected barricades at the auctioneer’s office after a right-wing Hindu nationalist group  warned  of “strong public agitation” if calls to cancel the sale — due to Husain’s “vulgar and obscene” portrayals of sacred figures — were ignored.\n \n\n   \n  The auction went ahead without incident. But the contrasting moods exemplified the painter’s status as one of Indian art’s most celebrated but controversial names. As if to further underscore his polarized reputation, this year also saw a Delhi court order the seizure of two “offensive” Husain paintings, while, earlier this month, the Qatar Foundation announced plans for an entire  museum  dedicated to his work (Qatar had given   Husain citizenship after he fled India, in 2006, fearing for his safety).\n \n\n   \n  Known for bold, colorful explorations of folk and pop culture, Husain was lauded as a pioneer of Indian modernism and often dubbed “India’s Picasso.” His paintings played with icons in all their forms, from Mother Teresa and Indira Gandhi to Bollywood stars and mythological figures from literary epics.\n \n\n   \n  The artist’s portrayals of nude Hindu deities, however, stand accused of offending religious sentiments — a reaction his supporters believe is exacerbated by his Muslim heritage. As a result, his later life was dogged by protests, legal action, death threats and an arrest warrant. Despite later being exonerated by India’s supreme court, he died in self-imposed exile, in London, in 2011. In its statement opposing June’s Mumbai auction, right-wing group Hindu Janajagruti Samiti said that Husain “deliberately painted vulgar and obscene images of goddesses … thereby gravely hurting the sentiments of millions of Hindus in the world.”\n \n\n   \n  The rekindling of old grievances, almost 15 years after his death, may be down to burgeoning interest from the global art market. But reactions to Husain’s work are also a bellwether of Hindu nationalism, according to Dr. Diva Gujral, an art history fellow at the University of Oxford’s Ruskin School of Art. While many of his most contentious works were produced in the 1970s, it is no coincidence that protests only erupted in 1990s, a decade when the Hindutva ideology flourished, communal tensions deepened and, Gujral said, Muslims became “a lightning rod” in India.\n \n\n   \n  “The reception of Husain is such a good litmus test for Indian cultural politics, because there are times when it wasn’t controversial,” she added, calling the reactions a “way to take the temperature of the country.”\n \n\n   \n    Icons past and present\n \n\n   \n  Hailing from an Indian branch of the Sulaymani Bohras, a Muslim sect residing primarily in the Arabian Peninsula, Husain was exposed to both Hindu and Islamic art from a young age.\n \n\n   \n  He was born in 1915 in Pandharpur, a pilgrimage town dotted with Hindu temples in western India. After his mother’s death, he was sent to study Urdu and Islamic calligraphy at his grandfather’s madrassa in  Sidhpur , Gujarat. Husain later lived in the city of Indore and immersed himself in folk traditions, like performances of the Hindu epic “Ramayana,” before enrolling in art lessons at the local art institute. In 1934, he sold his first painting on a roadside for 10 rupees.\n \n\n   \n  His interest in iconography always stretched far beyond religion. In his early 20s, Husain moved to Mumbai to paint billboards for the nascent Hindi film industry. It would prove a formative experience — one that shaped his fascination with contemporary idols and Bollywood, as well as his penchant for vivid colors and flattened, figurative forms.\n \n\n   \n  Then, in 1947, came another decisive moment in the artist’s life: India’s independence from colonial rule and Britain’s partition of the subcontinent into a Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan. Partly inspired by the religious strife that ensued, the painter co-founded the Bombay Progressive Artists’ Group (PAG), alongside major figures like F.N. Souza and S.H. Raza, later that year.\n \n\n   \n  The avant-garde group sought to forge a new visual language of — and for — India. Rejecting revivalist nationalism, its members fused local art traditions with outside influences, especially those of European modernists like Pablo Picasso, Amedeo Modigliani and Henri Matisse (though Husain also traveled to China in the early 1950s), as they interrogated their country’s emerging identity.\n \n\n   \n  “It was about creating something new, breaking with the past,” said Gujra adding that the group did more than “simply take” from Western art. “They’re reinvigorating a language that’s made available to them through access to places like London and Paris. But it’s very much their own thing.”\n \n\n   \n  For Husain, this meant a Cubist-inspired style rooted firmly in the Indian experience. It is an approach epitomized by the record-breaking “Untitled (Gram Yatra),” which he produced in 1954, though it went largely unseen for seven decades before going on sale at Christie’s this year. The narrative painting comprises 13 vibrant vignettes, each containing a snippet of rural life. Abstracted villagers are depicted working the land, milling grain and tending to livestock. Elsewhere, a farmer symbolically reaches out of his portrait’s frame to hold up a landscape in a neighboring vignette.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s literally the farmer supporting the land, and supporting the state and the nation,” said Nishad Avari, head of South Asian modern and contemporary art at Christie’s. “This is Husain’s way of saying that, while we may be modernizing, post-independence, and entering this new era, it’s very important not to forget that the basis of the country is its rural folk.”\n \n\n   \n  Despite the public attention Husain’s later work attracted, his most valuable paintings emerged during this early period, Avari said. “He’s playing this critical role of defining what it is to be an Indian artist in the new country of India, and what Indian modern art really means,” he added. “He’s a linchpin figure in defining this moment.”\n \n\n   \n  As many of Husain’s contemporaries moved overseas (including Souza and Raza, who relocated to the UK and France, respectively), the painter remained in India, his eternal muse. He nonetheless enjoyed some global recognition, exhibiting in New York City in 1964 and participating in the 1971 São Paulo Biennial in Brazil alongside Picasso. This period also saw Husain exploring female forms, including images of Hindu goddesses like Durga and Lakshmi, sometimes in suggestive or erotic poses.\n \n\n   \n  Husain maintained that he never intended to degrade these deities. His subjects were not the goddesses themselves, but their iconography — how they appeared in temple art, sculptures and friezes. Their nudity was drawn from Indian art history, not his imagination, though the paintings were nonetheless viewed by some critics as a “kind of desacralizing act,” said the University of Oxford’s Gujra.\n \n\n   \n  “In Hindu nationalist politics, the bogeyman is the Muslim invader who outrages the modesty of the Hindu woman,” she said. “For a lot of your average Indian viewers who didn’t have an enduring understanding of the nude and its art historical heritage… he becomes the Muslim disrobing the Hindu woman.”\n \n\n   \n  “It reignited old ideas of the Muslim taking what isn’t his,” she added. “But the idea for Husain is that this heritage belongs to all of us.”\n \n\n   \n    Fundamentalist reprisals\n \n\n   \n  The entire 1980s passed before the paintings faced significant religious backlash. In that time, Husain was even welcomed into the political establishment as a member of the Indian parliament’s upper house, the Rajya Sabha, where he served until 1992.\n \n\n   \n  But everything changed in the fall of 1996, when a Hindu monthly magazine, Vichar Mimansa, published the artist’s nude depiction of the goddess Saraswati alongside an article headlined “M.F. Husain: A Painter or Butcher.” The incident led to multiple  criminal complaints  against Husain, who was then aged in his early 80s, beginning a chain of events that led to his self-imposed exile.\n \n\n   \n  In 1998, Hindu fundamentalists attacked Husain’s Mumbai home and galleries displaying his work. Eight years later, another hardline group offered a 510-million-rupee (then $11.5 million) cash reward for his murder. The protests stretched beyond India’s borders, too, with London’s Asia House controversially canceling an exhibition of Husain’s work in 2006, citing security concerns, after Hindu groups demanded its closure and vandals defaced two of his paintings.\n \n\n   \n  That year, a court in Indore issued an arrest warrant for Husain. The offending image, this time, was a more recent painting that reimagined the map of India as a naked woman on her knees, city names marking her body. The artist publicly apologized for causing offense and denied giving it the name “Bharat Mata” — or Mother India, a personification of the nation — claiming the work was untitled. This did little to appease his critics.\n \n\n   \n  Concerned for his safety and facing hundreds — or as he  later suggested,  thousands — of legal cases, Husain left India in 2006. The Delhi High Court and, later, India’s Supreme Court eventually rejected calls for Husain’s summons and cleared him of obscenity charges, effectively quashing cases in other cities. In its ruling, in 2008, the Supreme Court criticized the emergence of a “new puritanism” in India, stating that erotic sculptures were a common sight in Hindu temples. Yet, Husain never felt it was safe to return to the country again.\n \n\n   \n  His plight meanwhile became a rallying cry for supporters of Indian secularism. Novelist Salman Rushdie was among those to  criticize  the Indian government for its “inadequate” protection of Husain and the freedom of expression he represented. “Violence and its ugly sisters, both Hindu and Islamic, have to be resisted,” Rushdie said at an address in Delhi in 2010. “They must be rebuffed. To appease it is the best way to ensure their growth. I am afraid India is going that way.”\n \n\n   \n  Husain spent most of his final years in Dubai, Doha and London. Upon surrendering his Indian passport to apply for Qatari citizenship, he is reported to have said: “India is my motherland, and I simply cannot leave that country. What I have surrendered is just a piece of paper.”\n \n\n   \n  He also often spoke of his desire to return home — including to his friend Abhishek Poddar, a prominent collector and founder of Bangalore’s Museum of Art & Photography, who regularly mailed Husain his favorite Indore newspaper. “His love was India, and he always missed India,” said Poddar. “I once said, ‘What is it that you miss? And he said, ‘What I really miss is the earth there. The mud.’”\n \n\n   \n    Master showman\n \n\n   \n  Husain’s goddess paintings were just a fraction of his life’s work. Even the most conservative estimates put his total output at 30,000 to 40,000 artworks, spanning printmaking, writing and filmmaking of both the arthouse and Bollywood variety. He was similarly prolific after leaving India: In 2007, he completed 51 paintings inspired by the Bollywood classic “Mughal-e-Azam,” and was, at the time of his death, working on a series of 99 artworks, reflecting the 99 names of Allah, telling the history of Arab civilization.\n \n\n   \n  “He needed to paint all the time,” said Poddar, who first met Husain as the artist waited for a lift, without shoes, at a Kolkata bus stop in the early 1980s. (The 57-year-old collector, then a teenage art enthusiast, approached Husain after recognizing his flowing white beard from a weekly magazine, and the pair struck up an unlikely friendship.) “I once saw him at his London property where he had between 25 and 30 works. I met him again two or three days later, and lo and behold, there were another 12 or 13.”\n \n\n   \n  “There would have been at least a dozen occasions when he’s sitting with me and he’s drawing somebody’s portrait,” added Poddar, who holds several Husain works in his museum’s collection.\n \n\n   \n  Husain painted anywhere and everywhere. Renowned as a showman, he even painted during live performances and immediately auctioned off the resulting works. Taking commissions from Gulf royals and industrialist billionaires, he was something of an art-world celebrity, his distinctive appearance, designer suits and reputation for walking around shoeless all part of his own icon-building.\n \n\n   \n  “He was known as the barefoot artist,” said Avari, the Christie’s specialist. “He made that a thing. He would walk around with this very long paint brush, using it as a cane. There was no mistaking the figure of Husain wherever he went.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t know anybody who doesn’t have a Husain story,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  But if Husain was, to use Poddar’s words, a “brilliant marketing man,” is it plausible that he had attempted to exploit religious outrage to serve his own ends? Gujra described the painter as a “contrarian” who “definitely liked controversy,” though she suggests he would neither have intended nor anticipated the reaction his work provoked. “He was interested in mass images,” she explained.\n \n\n   \n  Poddar meanwhile argued that his fiercely secular friend treated Hindu icons the same as all his other subjects. In fact, Husain was also accused of blasphemy by Islamic groups over a song in his 2004 movie “Meenaxi: A Tale of Three Cities,” as its lyrics used words directly from the Quran.\n \n\n   \n  “If there were a pantheon of figures associated with Islam, I don’t think he would have looked at that any differently from the way he looked at Christianity, Sikhism, Hinduism or whatever else,” said Poddar.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think he ever had an anti-Hindu agenda,” he added. “Ever.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/politics/supreme-court-liberals-nitrogen-hypoxia-executions","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"20:04:00Z","title":"Supreme Court Liberals Decry 'Excruciating Suffocation' in Nitrogen Hypoxia Executions","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Supreme Court's liberal justices—Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson—issued a strong dissent criticizing nitrogen hypoxia executions, arguing they involve prolonged, conscious suffocation and psychological terror, potentially violating the Eighth Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishment.

decry ‘excruciating suffocation’ in nitrogen hypoxia executions \n       \n  By John Fritze, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:04 PM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Supreme Court’s three liberal justices on Thursday laid out a remarkable critique of  nitrogen hypoxia executions , asserting that the new form of capital punishment causes “psychological terror” and “excruciating suffocation”   in the condemned and likely violates the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.\n \n\n   \n  Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the court’s senior liberal, encouraged Americans to start a stopwatch on their phones and reflect as the seconds turn into minutes.\n \n\n   \n  “Now imagine for that entire time, you are suffocating,” Sotomayor wrote in  her dissent , which was joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson. “You want to breathe; you have to breathe. But you are strapped to a gurney with a mask on your face pumping your lungs with nitrogen gas.”\n \n\n   \n  “Your mind knows that the gas will kill you,” she continued. “But your body keeps telling you to breathe.”\n \n\n   \n  Sotomayor’s striking dissent came in the case of Anthony Boyd, who was convicted and sentenced to death in 1995 for the brutal killing of Gregory Huguley in Alabama. Huguley was duct-taped to a bench, doused with gasoline, and burned alive over a $200 drug debt, according to court records.\n \n\n   \n  The Supreme Court declined to pause Boyd’s execution, and, as is almost always the case in emergency death penalty cases, the majority did not explain its decision. Capital cases almost always come up to the Supreme Court days – and sometimes hours – before the scheduled execution.\n \n\n   \n  Boyd was executed later Thursday, according to Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall.\n \n\n   \n  Five states have authorized the use of nitrogen hypoxia as a form of execution, but only Alabama and Louisiana have used the method so far. Early last year, the  Supreme Court allowed Alabama  to execute an inmate with the procedure for the first time.

PM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  When President Donald Trump hung up the phone after his talk with Russia’s Vladimir Putin last week, he was so convinced there was enough progress made that he announced he was heading soon to Budapest for an in-person summit.\n \n\n   \n  Five days later, the  summit was off  and  new sanctions on Moscow  — the first of Trump’s second administration — were on.\n \n\n   \n  What happened in between was a steady realization by the president and top officials that Putin’s stance on ending the war had not significantly shifted from the last time  the two met on a US air base in Alaska , according to US officials.\n \n\n   \n  Putin’s  continued strikes  on civilians in Ukraine, his maximalist demands on Kyiv to bring the war to an end and his refusal to agree to an immediate ceasefire all added up, in Trump’s mind, to a clear signal that nothing really had changed.\n \n\n   \n  “It just it didn’t feel right to me,” Trump said Wednesday. “It didn’t feel like we were going to get to the place we have to get. So I canceled it.”\n \n\n   \n  The wholesale reversal was cheered by Trump’s European allies and many of the president’s supporters, and condemned as unhelpful by Putin. After months of threatening new measures on Russia, only to stop short, Trump has now gone further than ever before in punishing the country for its war in Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  “I just felt it was time,” Trump said at the White House moments after the new sanctions were announced. “We waited a long time.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Good conversations’ that ‘don’t go anywhere’\n \n\n   \n  Whether Trump’s new stance is permanent, or simply a temporary phase, is an open question. He has  repeatedly zigzagged  in his approach to Putin since returning to office, often influenced by his phone conversations with the Russian leader. And new pressure on global oil prices could test his willingness to withstand the potential fallout for American consumers.\n \n\n   \n  There was no single moment that shifted the president’s thinking, according to a senior White House official. Instead, his view evolved as he found himself repeatedly disappointed that Putin appeared no closer to agreeing to end the war.\n \n\n   \n  “Every time I speak with Vladimir, I have good conversations, and then they don’t go anywhere,” Trump complained Wednesday. “They just don’t go anywhere.”\n \n\n   \n  A day after his call with Putin, Trump met over lunch in the Cabinet Room with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.  The meeting was tense , and the Ukrainians left having failed to secure the long-range Tomahawk missiles they’d been seeking.\n \n\n   \n  But while Trump pressed Zelensky to agree to land concessions that would bring the war to a close, by the end of the meeting he’d arrived at a plan that would call for a ceasefire at the current battle lines — well short of what Putin has demanded for peace.\n \n\n   \n  After a phone call Monday between Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, it was clear to American officials that Moscow’s stance hadn’t significantly shifted, despite what Trump believed to be a positive conversation with Putin four days earlier.\n \n\n   \n  The Budapest summit he’d hoped to arrange in a couple of weeks might be a “waste of time,” Trump speculated. Planning was halted.\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of the announcement of the new sanctions on Wednesday, Trump sat down for a meeting where the topic arose with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who has been a proponent of imposing sanctions on Russia for months.\n \n\n   \n  This time, the president surprised even some of his closest advisers by agreeing to impose sanctions on Russia’s largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil. Bessent returned to his office at Treasury to brief his team and compile the new sanctions into a release.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly afterward, Trump spoke to Rubio — who was preparing to depart for a trip to Israel — and advised him that they would be imposing the sanctions immediately.\n \n\n   \n  Back at the White House, Bessent teased the impending announcement in a roundabout way. After speaking with reporters in the driveway, he was walking back into the West Wing before he spun around and returned to the microphones.\n \n\n   \n  “We are going to either announce after the close this afternoon — or first thing tomorrow morning — a substantial pickup in Russia sanctions,” he said as reporters scrambled to get their cameras back into place.\n \n\n   \n  Inside the building, Trump was meeting in the Oval Office with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, who made the last-minute journey from Brussels as an emissary for European leaders hoping Trump would remain on Ukraine’s side.\n \n\n   \n  Rutte could hardly have hoped for a better outcome, as Trump spelled out his sudden decision to make good on a threat he’d been alluding to  for months.\n \n\n   \n  “These are very big, those are against their two big oil companies, and we hope that they won’t be on for long. We hope that the war will be settled,” Trump said.\n \n\n   \n    Surprise within the White House\n \n\n   \n  Even many inside the White House were surprised how quickly the new package of sanctions came together. Trump had told advisers for months that one day he would decide it was time to take stronger action on Russia. The president suggested to advisers that his “instincts” were telling him it was time to move in a different direction with Putin.\n \n\n   \n  “It was the culmination of having good calls [with Putin] and then reading the papers and seeing Russia is still” bombing Ukraine extensively, the senior White House official said.\n \n\n   \n  Hours before the announcement, Russia struck a Ukrainian kindergarten building in Kharkiv. Video from the scene showed terrified people running from the burning building, clutching screaming children.\n \n\n   \n  Trump was also motivated by the truce  he helped broker in Gaza , believing it only came together after he had grown increasingly tough on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n \n\n   \n  “Getting tough led to action,” the official said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has received repeated calls from Sen. Lindsey Graham, along with other Republican allies, encouraging him to impose sanctions. After joining Trump for lunch in the Rose Garden on Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters he wanted to bring a long-delayed sanctions bill to the floor “when the White House believes it’s useful to them to get Putin to the table and to get a deal that ends the war, so we’re prepared to act.”\n \n\n   \n  “We want to do everything we can to support the president, his team’s efforts and the efforts of our allies to bring the bloodshed to an end and a peaceful conclusion,” Thune said.\n \n\n   \n  Starting in the days after he retook office in January, Trump has held out the option of using sanctions to force Putin to the negotiating table. He said on January 22, two days after he was inaugurated and one day after his onetime deadline to end the war, that he may have no choice than to “put high levels of Taxes, Tariffs, and Sanctions” on Moscow.\n \n\n   \n  The threats continued through the spring and summer, but never materialized into new measures. Trump privately said he was concerned that tough new sanctions might push Putin further away from peace talks, officials have said – a viewpoint his top diplomat echoed in August.\n \n\n   \n  “The minute you issue new sanctions … our ability to get them to table will be severely diminished,” Rubio said in an interview around the time Trump met Putin in Alaska.\n \n\n   \n  Trump did apply new tariffs on India as punishment for its purchases of Russian oil. But he didn’t slap similar measures on Moscow’s largest customer, China, as he works to broker a new trade deal with  President Xi Jinping .\n \n\n   \n  Trump has not ruled out meeting Putin at some point in the future when he feels the time is right.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the president and the entire administration hopes that one day that can happen again,” White House   press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday. “But we want to make sure that there’s a tangible, positive outcome out of that meeting, and that it’s a good use of the president’s time.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/politics/construction-workers-east-wing-ndas","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"19:30:00-04:30","title":"Mum’s the word from workers on East Wing demolition, including some who say they’ve signed NDAs","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The White House is undergoing a major demolition of its East Wing, a historic section of the complex, in preparation for the construction of a new multi-million-dollar ballroom.

EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Construction workers in lime green vests, hoodies and hard hats who have spent the last several days clearing the White House’s East Wing departed through the Treasury grounds on their way out for lunch break Thursday, passing camera crews and journalists who have been capturing their work since  demolition began earlier this week . But they remained tight-lipped about their role in a project that has enthralled the American public.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re not allowed to answer questions,” one worker said.\n \n\n   \n  “Everything has to go through the White House press office,” said another.\n \n\n   \n  Some even said they signed non-disclosure agreements.\n \n\n   \n  A White House official told CNN that is routine practice. After all, the workers who operate excavators and otherwise clear the wreckage have a close-up view of facilities that house the officials who run the US government. “There is nothing unusual about requiring workers to sign NDAs, and it is standard,” the White House official told CNN, adding that certain contractors are required to have security clearances because “there are aspects of the project that deal with operational security on campus.”\n \n\n   \n  The White House has been under a microscope since excavators were caught on camera tearing down the East Wing Monday, with historic preservation groups  calling for a stop to the demolition  and President Donald Trump’s critics asserting he had not been fully open about just how much would be destroyed in the process of building a new multi-million dollar ballroom on the grounds. David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama, called it “a metaphor for broader, reckless destruction” within the Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n  “For anyone who has worked at the WH, or cares about its rich history, it’s a gut punch,” Axelrod posted on X.\n \n\n   \n  The White House has asserted it was transparent all along. When  the project was first announced , images showed the ballroom in place of the East Wing. And during a dinner with donors to the ballroom effort last week, Trump turned away from the podium in the East Room, had the gold curtains opened and showed dinner attendees a glimpse of the East Wing outside.\n \n\n   \n  “Everything out there is coming down, and we’re replacing it with one of the most beautiful ballrooms that you’ve ever seen,” Trump said.\n \n\n   \n  The administration has also noted it isn’t the first to make changes, pointing to past construction projects by prior presidents. On Thursday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt flipped through photos of some of those endeavors, including the construction of the West Wing and West Terrace in 1902.\n \n\n   \n  “These images look quite similar to what you and the American people are seeing today,” Leavitt said, adding that many presidents have “made their mark” on the White House complex.\n \n\n   \n  But even Trump himself noted from the Oval Office Wednesday, “This obviously would be the biggest change.”\n \n\n   \n  The administration has previously raised security concerns over information about  the demolition . Earlier this week, a Treasury spokesperson confirmed the agency had urged employees against sharing images of the construction for that reason, after images surfaced on Monday that could have been taken from Treasury grounds. That facility sits directly next to the East Wing.\n \n\n   \n  “Carelessly shared photographs of the White House complex during this process could potentially reveal sensitive items, including security features or confidential structural details. Out of an abundance of caution, we have urged our employees to avoid sharing these images,” a Treasury spokesperson told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  But the construction is impossible to keep completely out of public view. It can be seen — and heard — from the North Lawn of the White House, 15th street and atop higher buildings in DC. Videos and still images of the swift demolition have filled social media and news networks, some met with incredulity and outrage. Some have pointed to Trump’s past comments that seemed to downplay the impact.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s being built over on the east side, and it will be beautiful views of the Washington Monument. It won’t interfere with the current building. It’ll be near it, but not touching it and pays total respect to the existing building, which I’m the biggest fan of; it’s my favorite place,”  Trump said,  speaking to reporters in the Roosevelt Room.\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear how long the building of the ballroom will actually take, but  the White House  said it’s “expected to be completed long before the end of President Trump’s term.” The president himself said, “We’ll get it built quickly.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN reached out to McCrery Architects and Clark Construction, which the White House has said are leading the project, for comment but not yet received a response.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/politics/antisemitism-republicans-analysis","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"19:32:00-04:00","title":"A growing cancer: The right’s growing acknowledgment of its own antisemitism","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article details a growing internal reckoning within the Republican Party over antisemitism and extremist rhetoric.

cancer’: The right’s growing acknowledgment of its own antisemitism \n       \n  Analysis by Aaron Blake, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:52 PM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Vice President JD Vance last week presented the Republican Party and the conservative movement with a fork in the road. They could either denounce the increasing examples of racist, antisemitic and extremist rhetoric in their ranks, or they could  whatabout  them away.\n \n\n   \n  Vance  suggested the latter course . Responding to newly published  vile text messages  from Republican officials and staff, he pointed to violent texts from Democratic Virginia attorney general candidate Jay Jones.\n \n\n   \n  “I refuse to join the pearl clutching when powerful people call for political violence,” Vance said.\n \n\n   \n  The approach made political sense. The Trump administration is in the process of  misleadingly painting  the political left as more violent and extreme than the right – this despite  years of data  to the contrary and  court rulings rejecting its characterizations .\n \n\n   \n  But increasingly, prominent conservatives are rejecting Vance’s tack.\n \n\n   \n  They’re arguing that those texts and other revelations betray a very real and growing problem in their ranks, and that looking the other way just isn’t an option. They’ve cast it as a moral, political and even a quite literal hazard.\n \n\n   \n    The growing calls for an internal reckoning\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas offered some of the most significant comments to date this week. He cited a  “growing cancer” and “poison” of antisemitism on the right .\n \n\n   \n  “I’m here to tell you in the last six months, I have seen antisemitism rising on the right in a way I have never seen it in my entire life,” Cruz said Tuesday at the 45th Annual Night to Honor Israel in San Antonio, adding that “the church is asleep right now.”\n \n\n   \n  While he argued the problem has been worse on the left, he said it was foolish to ignore it on the right. He cited the oodles of antisemitic responses he gets on social media and said it wasn’t just bots funded by foreign governments.\n \n\n   \n  “I am telling you this is real, it is organic, these are real human beings, and it is spreading,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Plenty of other conservative influencers have made similar arguments over the past week, in some cases explicitly rejecting calls like Vance’s to stay focused on the left, even if they didn’t specifically call out the vice president.\n \n\n   \n  Daily Wire editor-in-chief Ben Shapiro appeared with an advocate of Vance’s approach and warned that the right was “ sort of whistling past the graveyard .”\n \n\n   \n  Shapiro, who is Jewish, said threats he’s received from the right have become “more common.”\n \n\n   \n  “If somebody tries to kill me, it’s a fricking Agatha Christie novel,” Shapiro said. “I just don’t know which direction the bullet is coming from at this point, given the sort of various and sundry radical extremes that exist.”\n \n\n   \n  Those fears about extremism leading to violence became more real this week. The state of Florida arrested a man for  allegedly threatening to kill Dillon and other Jewish conservatives . Dillon and others who were allegedly targeted by the man linked the threats to a baseless conspiracy theory promoted by far-right influencers that Israel was behind Charlie Kirk’s assassination.\n \n\n   \n  “Some on the right are spreading these ideas,” Dillon  said . “Others, to their shame, are either afraid or unwilling to confront them.”\n \n\n   \n    The GOP’s dilemma\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, that particular conspiracy theory – about Israel supposedly being involved in Kirk’s assassination – crystallizes the GOP’s political dilemma.\n \n\n   \n  Former Daily Wire host Candace Owens has played  a massive role in spreading  it via her hugely popular podcast. Some on the right have  accused Tucker Carlson of flirting with it . That includes in his eulogy for Kirk when he compared his assassination to those who plotted to kill Jesus – whom Carlson called “guys sitting around eating hummus” in Jerusalem. ( Carlson said  on his show this month that claims that he was being antisemitic in the eulogy are “insane,” adding, “All I did was recount the gospel.”)\n \n\n   \n  But despite Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu publicly denouncing the theory early on, the American right has been slow to address it. Some on the right have  criticized former Fox News host Megyn Kelly  for declining to call out Owens and Carlson, whose broader commentary about Jews and Israel has also  raised alarm bells among Republicans like Cruz .\n \n\n   \n  Kelly has offered  a Vance-ian defense  for her posture, saying she’s not interested in rocking the boat.\n \n\n   \n    A problem that’s getting harder to ignore\n \n\n   \n  Republicans have largely ignored the Owens situation, but there seems to be a growing recognition on the right that not calling out this kind of rhetoric  is also politically fraught.\n \n\n   \n  Yes, Democrats have their problems here, including Jones’ texts and the recent controversy over popular Maine Democratic Senate candidate Graham Platner having  a tattoo that resembled Nazi imagery . (Platner has said he didn’t understand the image was tied to Nazism.)\n \n\n   \n  But the evidence of this problem on the right – and perhaps most notably, its penetration of official circles – is also building.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not just the vile text messages shared by a group of young Republicans on a group chat.  Trump nominee Paul Ingrassia, who, in his own private messages, allegedly said he had “ a Nazi streak ” and made racist comments, was recently withdrawn after some GOP senators pushed back.\n \n\n   \n  There have been other Trump appointees and nominees with  extreme  and  inflammatory social media histories , as often documented by CNN’s KFile. And Trump appointees and GOP members of Congress who  appeared at gatherings   of white nationalists . A Ron DeSantis presidential campaign aide in 2023 shared a  video with a neo-Nazi symbol .\n \n\n   \n  And that’s to say nothing of Trump’s history here. That includes his downplaying of a racist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017, his frequent  use of antisemitic tropes , and his comment, according to his former chief of staff John Kelly, that  Adolf Hitler did some “good things.”  (A Trump spokesman has denied this comment.)\n \n\n   \n  Conservative New York Times opinion columnist David French in  a 2023 column  highlighted a number of other examples of this phenomenon and warned the right of this sleeping giant of an issue.\n \n\n   \n  “We should expect more bigotry and more revelations,” French wrote. “Dark words spoken in secret will spill out into the public square. The lost boys of the American right corrupt our culture.”\n \n\n   \n  That’s proven rather prescient. And the right is now being forced to reckon with it more out in the open, even as the administration would prefer to avert its gaze and focus on more politically advantageous matters.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/politics/adam-schiff-investigation-donald-trump-ed-martin","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"18:27:00-04:00","title":"Prosecutors Hesitant to Charge Trump Opponent Adam Schiff Over Mortgage Fraud Allegations","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Prosecutors in the Maryland U.S. Attorney’s Office are withholding charges against Democratic Senator Adam Schiff over mortgage fraud allegations, despite an ongoing investigation.

I have no idea what’s going on. You tell me that he’s going to be indicted.

Nothing is being done. What about Comey, Adam ‘Shifty’ Schiff, Leticia??? They’re all guilty as hell, but nothing is going to be done.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN later reported the directive was meant to be a private message to Bondi.\n \n\n   \n  Asked about the reports surrounding a Schiff probe Thursday, Bondi, who joined Trump for the roundtable, told reporters, “We’re not going to comment on any grand jury that’s open. We can’t legally.”\n \n\n   \n  Since that message was sent, Trump’s handpicked interim US Attorney in Eastern Virginia, Lindsey Halligan, has secured grand jury indictments of former FBI Director James Comey and  New York Attorney General Letitia James .

special counsel Jack Smith is requesting that Congress and the Justice Department allow him to testify publicly,  according to a new letter  he sent Thursday to the leaders of the House and Senate Judiciary committees.\n \n\n   \n  Smith says he wants to testify “in open hearings” because of “the many mischaracterizations” around his investigations that led to criminal charges against Donald Trump in 2023 for alleged mishandling classified records and actions related to the 2020 election results.\n \n\n   \n  The letter, obtained by CNN, reflects a bubbling inquiry from Republicans in Congress who have accused Smith of wrongdoing in overseeing the prosecutors’ office. Smith has maintained he followed all court and Justice Department protocols.\n \n\n   \n  Smith’s lawyers on Thursday told the Republican committee leaders, however, that he would need reassurance from the Justice Department that “he will not be punished” for testimony, since some of the facts of his special office investigations are still under seal in court or protected by grand jury secrecy rules.\n \n\n   \n  Jack Smith’s lawyers are expected to formally seek guidance from the Justice Department regarding possible congressional testimony, but have not done so yet, a source familiar to the plans told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The letter sent Thursday by Smith’s attorneys to House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan and Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley also said their client needed “access” to the files created during his time as special counsel “to provide full and accurate answers” to their questions.\n \n\n   \n  “Jack Smith certainly has a lot of answering to do, but first, Congress needs to have all the facts at its disposal,” Grassley told CNN in a statement. “Hearings should follow once the investigative foundation has been firmly set, which is why I’m actively working with the DOJ and FBI to collect all relevant records that Mr. Smith had years to become familiar with.”\n \n\n   \n  Rep. Jamie Raskin, top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, urged his committee leaders to accept Smith’s offer.\n \n\n   \n  “I can think of no reason to deny the American people the opportunity to hear his testimony, under oath and with questioning from Members of both parties, and to let all Americans judge for themselves the integrity of Mr. Smith’s investigations. There is no reason his appearance should be in the shadows of a backroom and subject to the usual tiresome partisan tactics of leak-and-distort,” Raskin said in his own letter Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Potential public hearings would give Smith his biggest opportunity yet to defend the integrity of the two criminal cases he brought against Trump.\n \n\n   \n  After Trump’s reelection last year brought a swift end to Smith’s prosecutions, the former special counsel has made few public comments about the matter, though he’s been steadfast in his defense of how the historic criminal cases were handled.\n \n\n   \n  During a recent talk in London, he  said the cases were untainted by politics  and called claims that they were politically motivated “absolutely ludicrous.”\n \n\n   \n  “The idea that politics would play a role in big cases like this, it’s absolutely ludicrous and it’s totally contrary to my experience as a prosecutor,” Smith said.\n \n\n   \n  The letter from Smith follows House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan’s  October 14 demand  for his testimony.\n \n\n   \n   This story was updated to include additional reporting.

I did an entire opening remarks about what this ballroom project was going to look like,” Leavitt said from the White House briefing room. “With any construction project, there are changes over time, as you assess what the project is going to look like, and we’ll c﻿ontinue to keep you apprised of all of those changes, but just trust the process.”\n \n\n   \n  Appearing to acknowledge changes in demolition plans for the East Wing, Leavitt said, “We’ve shown you the renderings, and if you look at the renderings, it’s very clear the East Wing was going to be modernized instead.”\n \n\n   \n  “The plans changed,” Leavitt said, “when the president heard counsel from the architects and the construction companies, who said that in order for this East Wing to be modern and beautiful for many, many years to come, for it to be a truly strong and stable structure, this phase one that we’re now in was necessary.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump on Thursday said he’s raised $350 million for the project, adding that the cost would be in the “neighborhood” of $300 million, a figure he first unveiled on Wednesday. While the president said he wouldn’t be able to share how much he contributed to the ballroom until it’s completed, he vowed to “donate whatever is needed.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s been expanded and made absolutely — it’ll be the most beautiful ballroom anywhere in the world, I think,” Trump said during a roundtable in the White House State Dining Room.\n \n\n   \n  The sections that have been demolished include both the East Wing, where  first ladies have maintained their offices for several decades , and the East Colonnade, which connected the wing to the main building.\n \n\n   \n  All the historical components of the East Wing, such as elements from Rosalynn Carter’s original Office of the First Lady, have been preserved and stored under the supervision of the White House Executive Residence and the National Park Service with support from the White House Historical Association, a White House official told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Plans are in place for future use, they added.\n \n\n   \n  The East Colonnade, with its herringbone brick floors and large windows along one wall, was often where visitors entered the White House for events.\n \n\n   \n  It also housed the family movie theater along its north wall, which was used for screenings since it was built in the early 20th century. Major American film studios often made first-run films available to the White House for presidential viewing.\n \n\n   \n  The theater also occasionally acted as a coatroom.\n \n\n   \n  The photos also show the grass and plantings in the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden, to the south of the colonnade, torn up.\n \n\n   \n  During a dinner with  donors to the ballroom  in the East Room last week, Trump had the gold curtains behind the podium opened up and forecasted the demolition to guests.\n \n\n   \n  “We collapse that over the next few days, it’s going to be demolished. Everything out there is coming down, and we’re replacing it with one of the most beautiful ballrooms that you’ve ever seen,” Trump said.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/science/duck-billed-dinosaur-mummy-clay-mask","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"18:39:00-04:00","title":"66 million-year-old dinosaur ‘mummy’ skin was actually a perfect clay mask","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a landmark study published in Science, paleontologist Dr. Paul Sereno and colleagues reveal that the famous dinosaur 'mummies' found in the Lance Formation of eastern Wyoming are not preserved soft tissues, but rather thin layers of clay that formed on the carcasses during fossilization.

And one area in particular — a region less than 10 kilometers (6 miles) across — has provided scientists with at least half a dozen remarkably well-preserved dinosaur specimens complete with details of scaly skin, hooves and spikes.\n \n\n   \n  The paleontologist Dr. Paul Sereno and his colleagues dub it “the mummy zone” in a new study that aims to explain why this particular area has given rise to so many amazing finds and define exactly what a dinosaur “mummy” is.\n \n\n   \n  In the early 1900s, a fossil hunter named Charles Sternberg found two specimens of a large duck-billed dinosaur, Edmontosaurus annectens, in the Lance Formation. The skeletons were so pristine that Sternberg, along with H.F. Osborn, a paleontologist at New York’s American Museum of Natural History, could make out what appeared to be large swaths of skin with discernible scales and a fleshy crest that seemed to run along the reptile’s neck.\n \n\n   \n  Sereno, lead study author and a professor of organismal biology and anatomy at the University of Chicago, described the initial discovery as “the greatest dinosaur mummy — until maybe the juvenile that we found” in the year 2000.\n \n\n   \n  Separated by nearly a century, Sereno and his team’s find shared common traits with Sternberg’s: The skeletons were preserved in three-dimensional poses and showed clear evidence of skin and other attributes that don’t usually survive 66 million years in the ground. “Osborn said in 1912 he knew that it wasn’t actual, dehydrated skin, like in Egyptian mummies,” Sereno said. “But what was it?”\n \n\n   \n  Whatever it was, “we actually didn’t know how it was preserved,” he said. “It was a mystery.”\n \n\n   \n  The new research puts that mystery to rest and can help paleontologists find, recognize and analyze future mummy finds for tiny clues into how giant dinosaurs really looked.\n \n\n   \n    A dinosaur death cast in clay\n \n\n   \n  Sereno and his collaborators used CT scanning, 3D imaging, electron microscopy and X-ray spectroscopy to analyze two Edmontosaurus mummies they discovered in the Lance Formation in 2000 and 2001 — a juvenile and a young adult. “We looked and we looked and we looked, we sampled and we tested, and we didn’t find any” remnants of soft tissue, Sereno said.\n \n\n   \n  What the team found instead was a thin layer of clay, less than one-hundredth of an inch thick, which had formed on top of the animals’ skin. “It’s so real-looking, it’s unbelievable,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Whereas Sternberg and Osborn referred to the “impression” of skin in their specimens, Sereno’s paper proposes an alternate term — “rendering” — which he argues is more precise.\n \n\n   \n  The study lays out the conditions that would produce such a rendering. In the Late Cretaceous Period, when Edmontosaurus roamed what is now the American West, the climate cycled between drought and monsoon rains. Drought has been determined to have been the cause of death of the original mummy found by Sternberg and described by Osborn, and of other animals whose fossils were found nearby. Assuming the same is true of the new specimens, the carcasses would have dried in the sun in a week or two.\n \n\n   \n  Then, a flash flood buried the bodies in sediment. The decaying carcasses would have been covered by a film of bacteria, which can electrostatically attract clay found in the surrounding sediment. The wafer-thin coating of clay remained long after the underlying tissues decayed completely, retaining their detailed morphology and forming a perfect clay mask.\n \n\n   \n  “Clay minerals have a way of attracting to and sticking onto biological surfaces, ensuring a molding that can faithfully reproduce the outermost surfaces of a body, such as skin and other soft tissues,” said Dr. Anthony Martin, professor of practice in the department of environmental sciences at Emory University in Atlanta, who was not involved in the research. “So it makes sense that these clays would have formed such fine portraits of dinosaurs’ scales, spikes and hooves.”\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Stephanie Drumheller-Horton, a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, who also was not involved in the study, is an expert in taphonomy, which she described as “the study of everything that happens to an organism from when it dies until when we find it.” She is particularly interested in how these fossils formed.\n \n\n   \n  “Dinosaur mummies have been known for over one hundred years, but there has definitely been more emphasis on describing their skin and less on understanding how they fossilized in the first place,” she said via email. “If we can understand how and why these fossils form, we can better target where to look to potentially find more of them.”\n \n\n   \n    A detailed portrait of a duck-billed dinosaur\n \n\n   \n  Together, the two more recently unearthed mummies allowed Sereno and his team to create a detailed update of what Edmontosaurus probably looked like.\n \n\n   \n  According to their analyses, the dinosaur, which could grow to over 12 meters (40 feet) long, had a fleshy crest along the neck and back and a row of spikes running down the tail. The creature’s skin was thin enough to produce delicate wrinkles over the rib cage and was dotted with small, pebble-like scales.\n \n\n   \n  The clay mask revealed that the animal had hooves, a trait previously preserved only in mammals. That makes it the oldest land animal proven to have hooves and the first known example of a hooved reptile, Sereno said. “Sorry, mammals, you didn’t invent it,” he joked. “Did we suspect it? Yeah, we suspected it had a hoof from the footprints, but seeing it is believing.”\n \n\n   \n  The study was published Thursday in  the journal Science. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/climate/electric-bill-reader-callout","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"16:29:00Z","title":"Is your electric bill going up?

\n        5:24 PM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump has pardoned  Binance  founder  Changpeng Zhao , who pleaded guilty to a money laundering charge in 2023, the White House said Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement that Trump “exercised his constitutional authority by issuing a pardon for Mr. Zhao, who was prosecuted by the Biden Administration in their war on cryptocurrency.” The move could open the door for Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange and the host of the Trump family’s crypto firm, to operate in the US again, and generated some concern that Trump was helping a man who had helped his family reap financial benefits.\n \n\n   \n  Leavitt argued that the Biden administration’s sentencing of Zhao was too harsh — a view the president and his top advisers share after Binance’s monthslong lobbying campaign for a pardon for Zhao, who goes by CZ.\n \n\n   \n  Trump defended his decision on Thursday afternoon, telling CNN’s Kaitlan Collins he issued the pardon, which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal, “at the request of a lot of very good people.”\n \n\n   \n  “Let me just tell you that he was somebody that, as I was told, I don’t know him, I don’t believe I’ve ever met him, but I’ve been told by, a lot of support, he had a lot of support, and they said that what he did is not even a crime,” Trump said during a roundtable in the White House State Dining Room. “It wasn’t a crime, that he was persecuted by the Biden administration, and so, I gave him a pardon at the request of a lot of very good people.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump, a former crypto skeptic who did a 180 on the alternative financial assets while running for a second term, has pledged to make the US the “crypto capital of the planet.” In launching a multi-faceted crypto empire, the Trump family has also established direct financial links to Binance over the past year.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump family’s crypto firm, World Liberty Financial — on which their wealth is increasingly dependent — is hosted on Binance. The exchange has also helped popularize World Liberty Financial’s proprietary tokens, the sale of which has generated hundreds of millions of dollars in fees for the Trump family.\n \n\n   \n  The Wall Street Journal estimated that World Liberty Financial has added  more than $5 billion  in paper wealth to the Trump family fortune — eclipsing the president’s real estate assets.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, MGX, an Emirati-backed investment firm,  agreed to use  World Liberty’s dollar-backed stablecoin, USD1, for a $2 billion investment in Binance. The deal was a huge win for World Liberty Financial, which effectively received a $2 billion bank deposit. At the time, Binance was actively lobbying for Zhao’s pardon.\n \n\n   \n  Trump did not directly address whether his pardon was related to his family’s crypto interests, but acknowledged, “I pardon a lot of people,” during Thursday’s remarks.\n \n\n   \n  Asked at Thursday’s White House press briefing about Democratic criticisms of the pardon as corrupt, Leavitt said the White House has “a very thorough examination of every pardon request that comes to the president’s desk.”\n \n\n   \n  She told reporters that she spoke directly with the White House counsel about the pardon, and that the administration believes Zhao’s case was “overly prosecuted” under the Biden administration, which she claimed was “very hostile to the cryptocurrency industry.”\n \n\n   \n  Zhao was sentenced to four months in prison in May 2024 after  pleading guilty  to charges that he failed to maintain an effective anti-money laundering program.\n \n\n   \n  Zhao stepped down as CEO of Binance, the crypto exchange he founded in 2017, and agreed to pay $200 million in fines. The company agreed to pay more than $4 billion in fines and other penalties as part of a  coordinated settlement  with the federal government in 2023. Binance admitted to engaging in anti-money laundering activities, unlicensed money transmitting and sanctions violations.\n \n\n   \n  Zhao isn’t the only crypto mogul to win a reprieve from Trump since his return to the White House. Shortly after returning to office, Trump pardoned Ross Ulbricht, a cause celebre of the Libertarian crypto world, who had been serving a life sentence for creating the Silk Road marketplace, which the Justice Department had described as “the most sophisticated and extensive criminal marketplace on the Internet today.”\n \n\n   \n  Justin Sun, the Chinese crypto billionaire who poured tens of millions of dollars into World Liberty Financial soon after it launched, had been facing civil fraud charges in the United States under the Biden administration. The Securities and Exchange Commission  dropped the case against Sun  in February. And, in March, Trump  pardoned three co-founders of BitMEX , a crypto exchange, who had pleaded guilty to violating anti-money-laundering programs.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/us/east-wing-white-house-satellite-photos-invs","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"16:46:00Z","title":"White House East Wing Demolished as New Ballroom Project Advances","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Satellite imagery from October 23, 2025, reveals that the entire East Wing of the White House has been demolished, with debris visible where the former First Lady's office stood.

(Player 3) is out tonight. Bet enough so Djones can eat to (sic) now!”\n \n\n   \n  Player 3, it turns out, was LeBron James, whose absence in the Los Angeles Lakers game could understandably affect the outcome. James did not, in fact, play that night which Jones knew because – though he wasn’t an official part of the Lakers staff – he worked with the NBA star during pre-game workouts.\n \n\n   \n   Access equals information , which is, essentially, how the sausage is made in point-shaving.\n \n\n   \n  Much like insider trading on the stock market, inside information on teams – either from peripheral personnel such as Jones, or in the form of a direct link, a la Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier – can be worth a lot of money. And for the co-conspirators it was, including two people indicted in the case involving Rozier.\n \n\n   \n  Shane Hennen and Marves Fairley are career criminals with serious charges on their lengthy rap  sheets . Hennen spent 30 months in prison for intent to distribute cocaine and was separately arrested for assault after stabbing someone. Fairley was accused in 2018 of murdering a man in witness protection. The judge, however, cited a “number of matters involving the defendant, state and others,’’ and he was given a 15-year suspended sentence with no time served.\n \n\n   \n  Now set that aside temporarily and consider all of this under the backdrop of the NCAA’s Wednesday decision to allow student-athletes to gamble on professional sports.\n \n\n   \n  Cursed by undeniable bad timing,  the national body announced just 24 hours before the indictments  that it was reversing its long-standing rule prohibiting college athletes from betting on sports in which an NCAA championship is wagered. Though they still cannot wager on college sports, as of November 1 student-athletes are free to gamble on professionals.\n \n\n   \n  The NCAA’s argument for its about-face is that the world has changed significantly, and it has. At the 2009 Final Four in Detroit, North Carolina guard Ty Lawson decided to take advantage of his head coach’s lenient 1:30 a.m. curfew. He took a quick walk from the team hotel to the nearby casino in the city’s famous Greektown and promptly won $250 at the craps table. He shared the news the next day at a media session when asked if he had any luck at the casinos.\n \n\n   \n  Knickers were twisted and pearls clutched. The NCAA at the time had an uncomfortable relationship with the very concept of gambling, with the organization’s then-president, Myles Brand, going so far as to say that while he couldn’t stop athletes from playing church bingo, he wasn’t going to encourage it, either.\n \n\n   \n  Which now seems so quaint to be almost silly.\n \n\n   \n  Sports gambling is now permissible in some 30 states and online gambling, for better or worse, is everywhere on college campuses. In reversing its stance, the NCAA argued that limiting the betting rules would allow college athletes to “better align with their campus peers.’’\n \n\n   \n  But while a sophomore physics major might have the scoop on what his or her former pal who graduated last year is doing in the lab, no one is terribly interested in shaking them down for that information. But a junior who played in the backcourt alongside a first-round draft pick a year earlier? A different story.\n \n\n   \n  Even without intent, a college athlete, student manager or staff member could innocently be handed a tip that could turn profitable – an innocuous text about a turned ankle or a chat during an Xbox game about an All-Star teammate who just cinched his back might mean thousands to someone.\n \n\n   \n  Rather than trying to legislate ethics, the NCAA is standing on law. Sharing such information is already illegal so, without sounding flippant, it is taking the same approach some have taken toward preventing teen pregnancy. Recognizing that abstinence is improbable, they’ve turned toward education.\n \n\n   \n  The NCAA has blanketed campuses with educational programs via in-person workshops and seminars and created several online resources. It’s partnered with outside groups to monitor online abuse and threats, and it’s pushed states to eliminate prop bets involving college games. To date four (Ohio, Vermont, Maryland and Louisiana) have banned them and two others (New Jersey and North Carolina) have initiated legislation to eliminate them.\n \n\n   \n   It is nearly impossible to eliminate sports gambling,  especially with the proliferation and easy availability of apps, and rather than seek punitive damages for making mistakes, the NCAA hopes it can teach its athletes what not to do.\n \n\n   \n  Still, that asks a lot of college kids, especially when the mixed messages are everywhere. Consider that longtime broadcaster Brent Musburger got summoned to the ESPN offices for referring to an over/under during a college football game, and now game breaks are littered with ads from FanDuel and DraftKings, and the network has its own sportsbook, ESPNBet.\n \n\n   \n  Less than 20 years after Lawson made legal bets at the Detroit casino, 18 teams will convene over Thanksgiving week for the Players Era Tournament. The games will be played at MGM Grand Garden Arena, in the MGM Resort on the Las Vegas Strip.\n \n\n   \n  And if NBA players who make millions can be lured – Rozier is in the last year of a more than $90-million contract – imagine the susceptibility of college students. They are easy marks, equal parts naive and eager for cash.\n \n\n   \n   Just last month, the NCAA announced it, too,  was knee deep in a game-fixing investigation. NCAA enforcement officials were looking at 13 college basketball players from six different schools for betting on or against their own teams.\n \n\n   \n  Conspirators, it would seem, wisely targeted low-major schools – Eastern Michigan, New Orleans, North Carolina A&T and Mississippi Valley State are among them – where athletes don’t have profitable name, image and likeness deals at their disposal, nor do athletic departments have a surplus of funds to provide the staffing to continually monitor and educate their athletes.\n \n\n   \n  While the details of those investigations have not yet been released, according to a Sports Illustrated report, among the outsiders alleged to be involved in the game fixing: Shane Hennen and Marves Fairley.\n \n\n   \n  This is not six degrees of separation.\n \n\n   \n  The foxes are already in the henhouse.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/us/illinois-governor-candidate-family-killed","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"14:48:00-04:00","title":"Four family members of Illinois governor candidate killed in Montana helicopter crash, campaign says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Four members of the family of Darren Bailey, a Republican candidate for Illinois governor, were killed in a helicopter crash in eastern Montana.

2022 gubernatorial election in Illinois and is seeking his party’s nomination again in next year’s race, were killed in the crash Wednesday. Bailey previously served in both the Illinois House and Senate.\n \n\n   \n  Bailey’s son, Zachary, his wife, Kelsey, and their two young children, Vada Rose, 12, and Samuel, 7, died in the crash in a remote area of eastern Montana, his campaign said in a statement. The couple’s third child was not on the helicopter.\n \n\n   \n  “Darren and Cindy are heartbroken by this unimaginable loss.

Bailey and his two brothers helped their father run their farm in south-central Illinois.\n \n\n   \n  Zachary Bailey first got his helicopter license years ago, Del Mar said, so that he could deliver medical supplies and aid to people in third-world countries. “That was a driving force for him to get his license,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The cause of the crash was not known, Del Mar said.

JB Pritzker  in 2022.\n \n\n   \n  Pritzker said on Thursday that he and his wife expressed their condolences to the Bailey family. “I cannot imagine losing a child, losing two grandchildren, and what they must be going through,” the governor said.\n \n\n   \n  Bailey, a  staunch conservative , dramatically increased his statewide profile in 2020 as a frequent critic of Pritzker’s approach to the coronavirus pandemic — including refusing to wear a mask during legislative sessions.\n \n\n   \n  During his run governor, Bailey  railed about crime  in Chicago and proposed eliminating the state’s gun licensing system, saying it doesn’t stop people from using guns illegally. He once supported a resolution seeking to make Chicago a separate state.\n \n\n   \n  Bailey unsuccessfully challenged five-term incumbent  Republican U.S. Rep.

EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Vice President  JD Vance left Israel on Thursday  with an optimistic note, saying Rafah, a city in the southern Gaza strip, could be rebuilt in two to three years.\n \n\n   \n  Vance said Palestinians should be able to move into a “Hamas free zone” in southern Gaza “in the next couple of months.”\n \n\n   \n  He told reporters in Tel Aviv before he boarded Air Force Two that the hope is for people to be able to move back to Rafah. Vance said the reconstruction effort could start “very quickly” in areas not under Hamas control.\n \n\n   \n  “You’re going to have first some people, and then more, and then hopefully in a couple years, a half a million people living in security, living in comfort, and also living in a situation where they’re not threatening their Israeli neighbors,” Vance said.\n \n\n   \n  It is the first time the US administration has spoken in detail about the potential timeline for the  reconstruction of Gaza , which has been devastated in two years of war.\n \n\n   \n  The vice president’s visit this week to the region was meant, at least in part, to ensure Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu remains committed to the US-negotiated deal as some Trump administration officials worry he could work to thwart it,  CNN previously reported .\n \n\n   \n  Vance told reporters Thursday that, so far, both Israel and Hamas are respecting the ceasefire with “exceptions.”\n \n\n   \n  “There are little exceptions to break out here and there that would be expected when these two parties have been at war for two years. But so far, the ceasefire is actually holding. The peace is actually holding,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Vance said he felt “pretty good” about maintaining the fragile peace but did admit there was potential for “little breakouts of violence.”\n \n\n   \n  “Look, if this peace sticks, you’re going to have these little breakouts of violence. Our message to the Israelis has been: ‘help us build this peace.’ Obviously, the Israelis have their own interests, but we’re going to keep on trying to work with both them and the Gulf-Arab states to make this peace stick,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Vance acknowledged the upcoming challenges the ceasefire will face as mediators try to create a mechanism to carry out the disarmament of Hamas. The responsibility will ultimately fall to an international force to be deployed to Gaza, an effort that Vance said will require patience.\n \n\n   \n  “Our hope in the administration is that the International Security Force is going to now take the lead in disarming Hamas,” he said. “That’s going to take some time, and it’s going to depend a lot on the composition of that force.”\n \n\n   \n  Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who landed just hours after Vance flew out, said the ceasefire effort remains a top priority for US President Donald Trump. He said that the efforts to date are “a very important achievement,” but added that “there’s more work to be done and bigger achievements that lie ahead, and so we’re here to work on that.”\n \n\n   \n  “We feel very positive and confident that we’re going to get there, despite substantial obstacles. We’re going to get there,” Rubio said.\n \n\n   \n    Vance criticizes Israeli vote on West Bank\n \n\n   \n  The US vice president slammed a pair of preliminary votes in Israel’s parliament designed to advance annexation of the occupied West Bank – territory that the international community considers part of a future Palestinian state. Vance said he had been told the votes were “symbolic” and a “political stunt.”\n \n\n   \n  “If it was a political stunt, it was a very stupid political stunt, and I personally take some insult to it,” Vance told reporters.\n \n\n   \n  One bill to annex the West Bank passed by a single vote, 25-24, while a more limited bill to annex the settlement of Maale Adumim passed by a much wider margin, 32-9. In both cases, more than half of Israel’s Knesset did not vote. Netanyahu and his Likud party opposed the measure, but it passed in its preliminary reading anyway.\n \n\n   \n  The Israeli prime minister’s office said in a statement that the bills “are unlikely to go anywhere” and were intended by the opposition to “sow discord” during Vance’s visit, even though the West Bank annexation bill only passed because of the support of Netanyahu’s right-wing coalition partners.\n \n\n   \n   Annexing all or parts of the West Bank  has been a goal of Israel’s right-wing for years. Many hardliners had celebrated Donald Trump’s presidency as an opportunity to advance that agenda, believing he would provide American support to a measure that would immediately face a massive international backlash. But Vance poured cold water on the idea of applying Israeli sovereignty to the West Bank.\n \n\n   \n  “The West Bank is not going to be annexed by Israel. The policy of the Trump administration is that the West Bank will not be annexed by Israel. That will continue to be our policy.”\n \n\n   \n  A broad coalition of Arab and Muslim states, led by Saudi Arabia, blasted the Knesset vote as a “blatant violation of international law.”\n \n\n   \n  In a joint statement issued by the Saudi Foreign Ministry, the group said in a sharp rebuke that “Israel’s continued unilateral policies and illegal practices will further undermine international law and morality.” They called on Israel to stop expanding settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration, meanwhile, has made the expansion of  the Abraham Accords  one of its top foreign policy goals. The accords saw Israel normalize relations with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and others, representing Trump’s biggest foreign policy achievement from his first term. The US is now trying to advance normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia, but Riyadh has made clear that it would only happen with a viable pathway to Palestinian statehood, something openly dismissed by Israel’s right-wing.\n \n\n   \n  Trump told  Time Magazine in an interview published on Thursday  that “Saudi Arabia will lead the way toward the Abraham Accords.” When asked whether he thought the country would join the accords by the end of the year, Trump responded, “Yes, I do. I do.”\n \n\n   \n  Israel’s far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, said at a domestic conference on Thursday, however, “If Saudi Arabia tells us, ‘Normalization in exchange for a Palestinian state,’ then friends – no thank you. Keep riding your camels In the desert – and we’ll continue building a technological powerhouse.”\n \n\n   \n  Smotrich has repeatedly made clear that one of his top priorities is annexing the West Bank.\n \n\n   \n  In the Time interview, Trump bluntly said he won’t allow it.\n \n\n   \n  “It won’t happen because I gave my word to the Arab countries. It will not happen,” he said. “Israel would lose all of its support from the United States if that happened.”\n \n\n   \n  Speaking about the Israel-Hamas war, Trump also said that Netanyahu “would have just kept going” were it not for his intervention.\n \n\n   \n  “It would have gone on for years. And I stopped him, and everybody came together when I stopped, it was amazing,” said Trump. He said the failed Israeli strike in Doha targeting senior Hamas leaders was one of the key moments that helped bring about the ceasefire “because it was so out of joint that it sort of got everybody to do what they have to do.”\n \n\n   \n   Jennifer Hansler and Kylie Atwood contributed to this report. \n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/economy/russia-sanctions-gas-prices","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"14:13:00Z","title":"Trump’s Challenge: Hurting Putin Without Harming Americans at the Gas Pump","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump is considering sanctions against Russia, the world’s second-largest crude oil producer, in an effort to pressure Russian President Vladimir Putin into negotiating an end to the war in Ukraine.

      \n  Analysis by Matt Egan, Chris Isidore, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:13 PM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump’s sanctions crackdown on Russia risks undermining one of the bright spots in the Trump economy: tame gas prices.\n \n\n   \n  The surprising  decision to punish Russia , the second-biggest crude oil producer on the planet, instantly sent oil prices surging Wednesday. Analysts say pump prices are likely to rise modestly in the coming days.\n \n\n   \n  The challenge for Trump is how to break the Russian war machine without causing a painful price spike that would exacerbate lingering frustrations about the cost of living among voters.\n \n\n   \n  “The market is reacting with shock today. Many thought Trump would never do this,” Bob McNally, founder and president of consulting firm Rapidan Energy Group, told CNN in a phone interview. “Once the shock wears off, we think prices will settle down. However, it’s a close call. There isn’t a lot of margin for error.”\n \n\n   \n  Record-high gas prices haunted the Biden-Harris administration after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. And high prices across the economy helped propel Trump back to the White House.\n \n\n   \n  Now, Trump is trying to force an end to that deadly war while keeping gas prices low. It’s a risky strategy.\n \n\n   \n  “If Trump does anything that abruptly removes Russian oil exports, we would have an immediate explosion in oil prices,” said McNally, who worked as an energy adviser to former President George W. Bush.\n \n\n   \n  Yet Trump has the advantage of operating from a position of strength when it comes to prices.\n \n\n   \n  Up until the past few days, oil prices were trading near multi-year lows. Gas prices, as measured by AAA, looked destined to break through the psychologically important $3-a-gallon level.\n \n\n   \n  “If you want to send a strong signal to Russia, now is exactly the right time to do it when prices are low,” said Dave Turk, who served as deputy energy secretary under President Joe Biden and is now a distinguished visiting fellow at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy.\n \n\n   \n  This setup gives Trump some breathing room to crank up the pressure on Moscow in a bid to force Russian President Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table.\n \n\n   \n  Trump credits his drill-baby-drill agenda — and it is true that US oil production is at all-time highs. But that world-leading oil output hasn’t changed much since Trump took office.\n \n\n   \n  What has changed is willingness from OPEC and Saudi Arabia to pump lots more oil in a bid to regain market share lost to, among others, frackers in Texas.\n \n\n   \n  “The confluence of events has enabled the United States to take a harder line with Russia,” said Andy Lipow, president of consulting firm Lipow Oil Associates.\n \n\n   \n  But too hard of a line could backfire by driving up the highly visible cost of gasoline, which many Americans view as a proxy for the cost of living.\n \n\n   \n  “It will be a calibrated effort to hurt Putin while protecting motorists,” said McNally.\n \n\n   \n  GasBuddy’s Patrick De Haan expects gas prices to rise in the coming days, but only modestly from $3.07 a gallon on Thursday to $3.10 to $3.15.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not going to be earth-shattering,” De Haan told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  McNally expects the Trump administration to try to thread the needle by making it harder — but not impossible — to buy Russian oil.\n \n\n   \n  If China and others can keep buying Russian barrels, but at a significant discount to world oil prices, it could prevent a shortage that drives up prices for American consumers. But it would also punish Putin by shrinking the oil revenue that funds the Russian war machine.\n \n\n   \n  Will it work?\n \n\n   \n  McNally said the most likely scenario is that Russia keeps oil flowing at a steeper discount to Brent oil prices, but he cautioned there is a real risk that Moscow instead is forced to slash production.\n \n\n   \n  “This is a close call,” McNally said.\n \n\n   \n  The stakes are massive for consumers, the US economy and for the White House.\n \n\n   \n  Polls already indicate voters feel Trump is not doing enough to address affordability. And that’s with low gas prices.\n \n\n   \n  “If you want to remain in power, you’ve got to be laser-focused on affordability,” said Turk, the former Biden official. “That’s a big lesson I took away from the prior four years.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/climate/florida-coral-reef-heatwave-extinct","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"14:00:00Z","title":"Critical Florida corals now ‘functionally extinct’ due to off-the-charts ocean temperatures","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Elkhorn and staghorn corals, once dominant reef builders in Florida’s coastal system, are now functionally extinct due to record-breaking ocean temperatures during the 2023 marine heat wave.

These  crucial coral species  are now “functionally extinct” in the region after record-breaking   ocean temperatures, according to a study published Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  The corals, which have been dominant reef builders in Florida for the past 10,000 years, were already critically endangered due to a host of factors including disease, pollution, hurricanes and ocean warming. But an  unprecedented  marine heat wave may have delivered a fatal blow.\n \n\n   \n  In the summer of 2023, Florida’s water temperatures peaked at more than 90 degrees Fahrenheit, the highest recorded in the region for at least 150 years.\n \n\n   \n  Heat stress is a coral killer. It causes them to eject the algae that provide them with their color and energy, leaving behind a ghostly bleached skeleton. They can recover if temperatures return to normal, but the more intense and prolonged the heat, the more likely it is they will die.\n \n\n   \n  The 2023 heatwave in Florida lasted roughly three months. As the high temperatures persisted, researchers dove beneath the water to closely monitor more than 52,300 Acropora corals, a group that includes staghorn and elkhorn corals. The study area covered all of  Florida’s coral reef system , which stretches nearly 350 miles from the Dry Tortugas and Florida Keys in the southwest to the St. Lucie Inlet on the state’s east coast.\n \n\n   \n  By March 2024, an astonishing 98% to 100% of colonies on the southern end of the system had died, according to the study, led by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Coral Reef Watch and Chicago’s Shedd Aquarium.\n \n\n   \n  The heat wave marks the “functional extinction” of the colonies, the report found, a term marking the stage that often precedes the complete disappearance of a species.\n \n\n   \n  While some elkhorn and staghorn corals remain, they are “no longer in densities high enough to carry out their ecological role — in this case, building and maintaining the reef structure,” said Ross Cunning, a research biologist at Shedd Aquarium and a study author.\n \n\n   \n  The surviving remnants of colonies, mainly located toward the north end of the reef system, are also vulnerable to disease, predators and storm damage.\n \n\n   \n  The loss of these corals sets off “cascading impacts,” Cunning told CNN. “Reef growth slows, habitat complexity declines, and fish and invertebrates lose shelter and resources they depend on,” he said. It also leaves coastlines more exposed to storms and erosion.\n \n\n   \n  The report’s findings are “a stark warning for the future of coral reefs worldwide,” the authors wrote in a statement accompanying their research.\n \n\n   \n  A recent study from the University of Exeter found the planet’s warm water coral reefs have already been pushed  passed a tipping point  by climate change, and   reefs on any meaningful scale will be lost   unless global warming is reversed.\n \n\n   \n  In Florida, natural recovery of Acropora corals is unlikely, the new report concludes. Climate projections suggest severe bleaching will occur every year by 2040 and, as oceans continue to warm, other coral species are likely to die off, too. “True global extinctions” of multiple coral species could happen in the coming decades for the whole Caribbean region, according to the report.\n \n\n   \n  Scientists have tried to  artificially bolster  Florida’s coral populations by rearing colonies in nurseries both onshore and offshore, but the   success of these efforts will depend on the frequency and severity of future bleaching events, the report said.\n \n\n   \n  The findings are “extremely significant” and drive home the importance of immediate action to cut planet-heating pollution, said Keri O’Neil, director and senior scientist of the Coral Conservation Program at the Florida Aquarium, who was not involved in the study.\n \n\n   \n  But functional extinction does not mean the species will go completely extinct, she added. “Human intervention, combined with improved ocean conditions, can reverse this trend.”\n \n\n   \n  Cunning said the report should not be interpreted as “a message of hopelessness” but instead as a call to action. “The window to prevent further losses is rapidly closing, yet targeted interventions and aggressive climate action can still make the difference.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/health/medicaid-work-requirement-apps","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"16:48:00Z","title":"Officials show little proof that new tech will help Medicaid enrollees meet work rules","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A recent investigation by KFF Health News reveals that pilot programs in Louisiana and Arizona to test new technology for verifying Medicaid enrollees' compliance with work rules — such as job training or volunteering — have failed to deliver meaningful results.

that new tech will help Medicaid enrollees meet work rules \n       \n  By Rae Ellen Bichell and Sam Whitehead, KFF Health News\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:48 PM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  This summer, the state of Louisiana texted just over 13,000 people enrolled in its Medicaid program with a link to a website where they could confirm their incomes.\n \n\n   \n  The texts were part of a pilot run to test technology the Trump administration says will make it easier for some Medicaid enrollees to prove they meet new requirements — working, studying, job training, or volunteering at least 80 hours a month — set to take effect in just over a year.\n \n\n   \n  But only 894 people completed the quarterly wage check, or just under 7% of enrollees who got the text, according to Drew Maranto, undersecretary for the Louisiana Department of Health.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re hoping to get more to opt in,” Maranto said. “We plan to raise awareness.”\n \n\n   \n  The clock is ticking for officials in 42 states — excluding those that did not expand Medicaid at all — and Washington, D.C., to figure out how to verify that an estimated 18.5 million Medicaid enrollees meet rules included in President Donald Trump’s tax and spending law. They have until the end of next year, and federal officials are giving those jurisdictions a total of $200 million to do so.\n \n\n   \n  The policy change is one of several to free up money for Trump’s priorities, such as increased border security and tax breaks that mainly benefit the wealthy.\n \n\n   \n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said the  work rules will be the main reason  millions of people won’t be able to access health insurance over the next decade. It estimates changes to the Medicaid program will result in 10 million fewer Americans covered by 2034 — more than half of them because of the eligibility rules.\n \n\n   \n  For now, state officials, health policy researchers, and consumer advocates are watching the pilot program in Louisiana and another in Arizona.  Mehmet Oz , director of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, has touted those test-drives and said they will allow people to verify their incomes “within seven minutes.”\n \n\n   \n  “There have been efforts to do this in the past, but they haven’t been able to achieve what we can achieve because we have technologies now,” said Oz,  during a television appearance  in August.\n \n\n   \n  Brian Blase, the president of the conservative Paragon Health Institute and a key architect of Medicaid changes in the new law, has chimed in, saying during a  recent radio appearance  that with today’s artificial intelligence “people should be able to seamlessly enter how they are spending their time.”\n \n\n   \n  KFF Health News found scant evidence to support such claims. Federal and state officials have offered little insight into what new technology the two pilots have tested. They do say, however, that it connects directly with the websites of Medicaid enrollees’ payroll providers, rather than using artificial intelligence to draw conclusions about their activities.\n \n\n   \n  Oz said the Trump administration’s efforts started “as soon as the bill was signed” in July. But work on the pilot programs  began under the Biden administration .\n \n\n   \n  And Medicaid is a state-federal program: The federal government contributes most of the funds, but it is up to the states to administer them, not the federal government.\n \n\n   \n  “Oz can say, ‘Oh no, we’re going to fix this. We’re going to do this.’ Well, they don’t actually run the program,” said  Joan Alker , a health policy researcher at Georgetown’s Center for Children and Families.\n \n\n   \n  Officials have also offered few details about the pilots’ effectiveness in assisting enrollees in Medicaid or other public benefit programs.\n \n\n   \n  The shortage of information has some state officials and health policy researchers worried that the Trump administration lacks viable solutions to help states implement the work rules. As a result, they say, people with a legal right to Medicaid benefits could lose access to them.\n \n\n   \n  “What actually keeps me up at night is the fear that members that are eligible for Medicaid and are trying to get health care services would fall through the cracks and lose coverage,” said Emma Sandoe, Oregon’s Medicaid director.\n \n\n   \n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said the  work rules will be the main reason  millions of people won’t be able to access health insurance over the next decade. It estimates changes to the Medicaid program will result in 10 million fewer Americans covered by 2034 — more than half of them because of the eligibility rules.\n \n\n   \n  Officials involved in the Louisiana and Arizona projects declined to answer many specific questions about their efforts, instead directing KFF Health News to federal officials.\n \n\n   \n  Spokespeople for Arizona’s Medicaid and Economic Security departments — Johnny Córdoba and Brett Bezio, respectively — did not share data on how many people participated in the state’s pilot test nor describe the outcome. They said the pilot had been used to verify eligibility only for the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, a smaller program than Medicaid.\n \n\n   \n  The  Community Food Bank of Southern Arizona , a nonprofit that helps people sign up for such SNAP benefits, hadn’t heard of the pilot program.\n \n\n   \n  State officials and health policy researchers said neither pilot program could confirm whether a person meets other qualifying activities — such as community service — or any of the numerous exemptions. The tools being tested can verify only income.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew Nixon, director of communications for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees Oz’s agency, wrote in a statement that the digital tools officials aim to share with states “are largely under development.”\n \n\n   \n  One person  doing that development  is Michael Burstein, who until recently worked at the U.S. Digital Service, which later became known as the Department of Government Efficiency.\n \n\n   \n  As the U.S. Digital Service was turned into DOGE, Burstein and other staffers left and started a nonprofit called  Digital Public Works  to finish supporting the technology to make it easier for people to verify their incomes for Medicaid enrollment.\n \n\n   \n  But without permission from state officials, Burstein would not describe the tool in development, aside from saying that it’s mobile-first, can quickly verify income for a new or returning client, “and we’re pretty happy with it.”\n \n\n   \n  The state agencies that manage benefit programs, such as Medicaid and SNAP, are understaffed, and they use different eligibility systems,  many of which need updating , which makes improving them “a challenging task,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The $200 million in start-up costs the federal government has earmarked for systems to track work requirements equals  roughly four times what it cost  to administer Georgia’s Medicaid work requirement program alone.\n \n\n   \n  That state, which has the nation’s only active work requirement program, called Georgia Pathways to Coverage, in September was granted a  temporary extension , despite a  recent report  from a federal watchdog saying it hadn’t received enough federal oversight. A  complicated sign-up process  has kept enrollment in the program far below Georgia’s own projections.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s tax and spending law allows states to ask for extra time — until the end of 2028 — to start enforcing the rules, but only with the approval of HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. It also allows counties with  high unemployment rates to be exempted , but states must apply for that exemption.\n \n\n   \n  Even with an app that states can use to prove people are eligible for Medicaid, enrollees would still need to know that app existed and how to use it — neither of which is a given, Alker said. There is also no guarantee they’d have reliable cell service or internet access. As  KFF Health News has reported , millions of Americans live in rural areas without reliable internet.\n \n\n   \n  Private vendors also have been working on such apps, said  Jennifer Wagner , who researches Medicaid eligibility and enrollment at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Wagner said she has seen several vendors demonstrate products they plan to pitch to states for the work rules. Many are limited in scope, she said, like those in the pilot tests.\n \n\n   \n  “Nobody has a magical solution that’ll make sure eligible people don’t lose coverage,” she said.\n \n\n   \n   Correction:  This article was revised to correct Michael Burstein’s professional background.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/politics/eric-adams-nyc-mayoral-endorsement","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"13:19:00-04:00","title":"NYC Mayor Eric Adams Endorses Andrew Cuomo in Mayoral Race","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"New York City Mayor Eric Adams has officially endorsed former Governor Andrew Cuomo in the upcoming mayoral race, reversing his earlier criticism of Cuomo as 'a snake and a liar.'

Without a subpoena to compel the release of the information, however, it remains unlikely the Democrats’ request will gain much traction.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, the Democrats argue, could have brought his claims to court much earlier. They say that the president is only pursuing this now because he has installed his own personal lawyers within the Department of Justice. It was not immediately clear what steps Trump or his legal team had taken in recent days or weeks to press the claims.\n \n\n   \n  “If either of your claims had any merit, you could have taken them to court by now and litigated them publicly,” Raskin and Garcia wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “You did not do that. Instead, you waited until you became President and installed your handpicked loyalists at DOJ, knowing that you could instruct them to co-sign your demand notes in secret behind closed doors, and then you could present the notes to the U.S. Treasury for cold hard cash courtesy of the American taxpayer.

Thom Tillis of North Carolina – has conceded the president is in a “difficult position” and that the request is “terrible optics.”\n \n\n   \n  “Particularly right now, we’re talking about a quarter of a billion dollars transferring, maybe to the president when we’re in a shutdown posture, so it’s at very best bad timing, but I think it’s horrible optics,” Tillis said Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, Trump said he “could be” seeking the money, though he professed to have little knowledge of the specifics and said he would give the money to charity.\n \n\n   \n  “It could be,” Trump said from the Oval Office when asked about the Times report.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t know about the numbers. I don’t even talk to them about it. All I know is that they would owe me a lot of money. But I’m not looking for money. I’d give it to charity or something,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The president at the time acknowledged the unprecedented nature of the situation in which he would be potentially “paying himself” damages to resolve claims that the Justice Department under his predecessor had wronged him.\n \n\n   \n  “With the country, it’s interesting, because I’m the one that makes the decision,” Trump said Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s awfully strange to make a decision where I’m paying myself. In other words, did you ever have one of those cases where you have to decide how much you’re paying yourself in damages?” he said.\n \n\n   \n  A settlement to Trump would come from taxpayer funds.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/science/new-mexico-dinosaur-site","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"14:32:00Z","title":"Rare look at the last days of the dinosaurs shows they were thriving, scientists say","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A new study of the Naashoibito Member in northwestern New Mexico reveals that dinosaurs were thriving and diverse in the final days of the Cretaceous Period—just before the asteroid impact that led to their extinction.

2:32 PM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A site in the San Juan Basin of northwestern New Mexico is providing a rare glimpse into the last days of the dinosaurs.\n \n\n   \n  Rocks and fossils at the Naashoibito Member site show an ecosystem that was filled with a diverse population of dinosaurs just before they disappeared from Earth.\n \n\n   \n  Paleontologists have long debated if the dinosaurs  suddenly went extinct  when a 6.2-mile-wide (10-kilometer-wide) asteroid crashed into Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula 66 million years ago at the end of the Cretaceous Period, or if they were in a gradual decline and living in weakened ecosystems ahead of the catastrophic event.\n \n\n   \n  Answering that question requires finding fossils and dating the surrounding rock to come up with an accurate timeline of the site. But identifying fossils in an area accurately dated to just before the extinction event is rare.\n \n\n   \n  A key site of interest for paleontologists has been the well-studied Hell Creek and Fort Union Formations, located in what is now Montana, Wyoming and the Dakotas.\n \n\n   \n   Hell Creek  has preserved evidence of multiple species of Triceratops and Edmontosaurus, as well as rocks, dated to the end of the Cretaceous Period, or just before the dinosaurs went extinct. But the dinosaur community there completely lacked any long-necked species, causing scientists to wonder if those had already disappeared.\n \n\n   \n  Now, new research has dated rocks in the Naashoibito Member to the same time period as the Hell Creek Formation, revealing what kinds of dinosaurs lived in different parts of North America just a few hundred thousand years before going extinct.\n \n\n   \n  Among the dinosaurs that lived in the Naashoibito Member was Alamosaurus, one of the largest long-necked dinosaurs that ever lived, according to a new study published Thursday in the journal  Science .\n \n\n   \n  “What our new research shows is that dinosaurs are not on their way out going into the mass extinction,” lead study author Andrew Flynn, assistant professor in the department of geological sciences at New Mexico State University, said in a statement. “They’re doing great, they’re thriving, and that the asteroid impact seems to knock them out. This counters a long-held idea that there was this long-term decline in dinosaur diversity leading up to the mass extinction making them more prone to extinction.”\n \n\n   \n    Cracking the rock time code\n \n\n   \n  Dinosaur fossils were first found in the San Juan Basin beginning in the mid- to late 1800s.\n \n\n   \n  But dating the rock layers containing the fossils is more complicated, Flynn said. First, the layers need to be exposed so they can be studied, and then the rocks themselves must be dated.\n \n\n   \n  “These factors make dinosaur-bearing rocks from the last 400,000 years of the Cretaceous quite rare,” Flynn said.  “Additionally, it takes years of work to establish the ages of rocks, with multiple lines of evidence needing to be collected, which sometimes discourages people from going to new areas to work.”\n \n\n   \n  The fossil record is not neatly organized, and some chapters are missing.\n \n\n   \n  “Species might have failed to enter the fossil record, they might have been preserved as fossils but not yet discovered, or they might have been discovered but lack essential context, such as precise estimates of geological age,” wrote Dr. Lindsay Zanno, head of paleontology at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences, in a  related article  published with the research. Zanno was not involved in the study.\n \n\n   \n  The Naashoibito Member site is problematic because erosion has stripped it of the perfect layers of rock found at other sites in North America, making it difficult to determine when the layers were created, Flynn said.\n \n\n   \n  Work at the site to determine a more detailed timeline of dinosaur habitation began in 2011. The team members measured the thickness and location of different rock layers, collected samples for testing and identified all of the spots where fossils were found over the last century and a half.  Sample collection  lasted about three to four years just for Cretaceous rocks, while another four to five were spent on the overlying rock that shows when mammals lived at the site after the dinosaurs went extinct.\n \n\n   \n  One way the team was able to date the rocks was by comparing the samples with Earth’s magnetic field, which periodically changes direction. For instance, right now,  magnetic north  aligns with the direction of north. But sometimes, magnetic north can align with the direction of south. Scientists have a clear understanding of when these reversals have occurred over time. By measuring the direction of the magnetic field when the rock layers were created, researchers can narrow down the time frame.\n \n\n   \n  “The end-Cretaceous mass extinction, fortunately for us, took place during a relatively short period of reversed polarity, which makes it much easier to say what our data correlates to,” Flynn said.\n \n\n   \n  The team also used radiometric dating — or measuring the decay of certain elements in rocks to determine their ages — on sand grains from sandstone in the Naashoibito Member.\n \n\n   \n  Their results showed that the dinosaur fossils were from a 380,000-year window leading up to the mass extinction event. The team also determined that mammals appeared about 350,000 years after the mass extinction event.\n \n\n   \n    Regions of diverse dinosaurs\n \n\n   \n  The new study paints a portrait of two very different dinosaur communities divided between the north and south regions of the continent.\n \n\n   \n  Both areas had dinosaurs in common, such as Tyrannosaurus rex and Torosaurus. Fossils of duck-billed dinosaurs were also found at each location, but they belonged to different groups. There were no giant, long-necked sauropods to be found in the north, which for a long time led some paleontologists to think that after millions of years of pushing the boundaries of evolution with their humongous sizes, they had gone extinct, said study coauthor Steve Brusatte, a professor of paleontology and evolution at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland.\n \n\n   \n  But they flourished in the south, including Alamosaurus, which reached 100 feet (30 meters) long, a height of 30 to 50 feet (9 to 15 meters) and weighed over 30 tons,   Brusatte said. The fact that one of the biggest dinosaurs, and one of the largest animals ever to live on Earth, witnessed an asteroid striking the planet truly illustrates how dinosaurs were thriving to the very end, he said.\n \n\n   \n  “I can imagine the scene, one minute a jet plane-sized dinosaur was shaking the ground as it walked, the next minute the whole Earth was shaking with the energy unleashed by the asteroid,” Brusatte said.\n \n\n   \n  Part of the reason for the differing groups divided between north and south was likely due to climate conditions, Flynn said.\n \n\n   \n  The Naashoibito Member site   was like a warm and humid tropical forest, similar to conditions in modern Panama, while the Hell Creek area was at a much lower elevation and included the cooler conditions of an inland sea coastal plain.\n \n\n   \n  “They were doing what dinosaurs had been doing for over 150 million years, adapting to their local conditions, dividing up niches in the food chain, varying in size and shape and diet, exhibiting rich diversity across the landscape,” Brusatte said. “There is no sign that these dinosaurs were in any trouble.”\n \n\n   \n  The new evidence about diverse, late-surviving dinosaurs in New Mexico is exciting, said Michael Benton, professor of vertebrate paleontology at the School of Earth Sciences at the UK’s University of Bristol. Benton was not involved in the new study, and his previous research has suggested a decline in dinosaur populations before the asteroid strike.\n \n\n   \n  “However, this is just one location, not a representation of the complexity of dinosaur faunas at the time all over North America or all over the world,” Benton wrote in an email.\n \n\n   \n  “As the authors also show in the paper, in general dinosaurs of the last 6 million years of the Cretaceous were less diverse, falling from 43 species beforehand to 30 species in western North America. We would suggest that there is evidence for overall declines in dinosaurs towards the end of the Cretaceous, with individual rich faunas where climates were favourable.”\n \n\n   \n  But Darla Zelenitsky, associate professor within the department of Earth, energy, and environment at the University of Calgary, said she﻿ believes the new findings   could   change how researchers think about dinosaurs in North America before the mass extinction event.\n \n\n   \n  Zelenitsky was not involved in the new research, but her team’s ongoing work in Alberta uncovering fossil eggshells linked to diverse dinosaur species aligns with the findings about stable dinosaur populations.\n \n\n   \n  “The research team uncovered compelling new evidence (…) that dinosaurs were still going strong ‘til the very end,” Zelenitsky wrote in an email.\n \n\n   \n  The new study may focus on dinosaurs, but the fact that 75% of species on Earth disappeared at the same time contains a lesson that remains applicable today, Brusatte said.\n \n\n   \n  “Sudden climate and environmental change can catch animals and ecosystems unaware,” he said, “and can defeat even the strongest and most iconic of species.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/media/ellison-wbd-trump-warner-bros-discovery-bid","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"13:32:00-10:23","title":"David Ellison May Have a ‘Trump Card’ — Literally — in Warner Bros.

Discovery pursuit \n       \n  Analysis by Brian Stelter, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:32 PM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n   A version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter. You can  sign up for free here . \n \n\n   \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison is “undeterred” after Warner Bros. Discovery rebuffed his first three offers to buy the media giant, according to a person who has been advising Ellison.\n \n\n   \n  The next move is unknown. But both Ellison and Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav are playing their parts perfectly in this M&A struggle over one of the biggest media companies in the world.\n \n\n   \n  Warner Bros. Discovery, the parent of CNN, HBO Max, DC Comics, Cartoon Network, and a storied list of other brands, said earlier this week that it had started a deal review process “after receiving interest from multiple parties.”\n \n\n   \n  The newly formed Paramount Skydance is at the top of the list, as Ellison tries to rapidly grow his media empire.\n \n\n   \n  Ellison’s allies are privately arguing that he is the only buyer who would pass muster with Trump administration regulators. “That’s the Trump card,” an adviser remarked, enjoying the double entendre.\n \n\n   \n  The adviser, like the other sources for this story, spoke on condition of anonymity because the companies are not commenting publicly.\n \n\n   \n  Privately, Ellison is exuding the kind of confidence that comes from having tens of billions in cash. His ambitions are bolstered by his father, Larry Ellison, Oracle’s executive chairman, who currently ranks as the second-richest man in the world. Together they are “building an unprecedented media empire,” as The Washington Post put it earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  However, so far, WBD has turned down the Ellison entreaties. Zaslav, who has led WBD since it was formed through a 2022 combination of WarnerMedia and Discovery, is insisting that the company is worth more than the $23.50 per share that Ellison most recently offered.\n \n\n   \n  And the WBD board agrees, having unanimously voted to reject that bid.\n \n\n   \n  Zaslav is talking internally about how HBO Max and the Warner Bros. movie studio would fit well with Amazon or Netflix, according to a person involved in the conversations.\n \n\n   \n  NBCUniversal’s parent company, Comcast, is also taking a look at WBD’s assets, sources told CNN earlier.\n \n\n   \n  This week’s for-sale announcement signaled that many outcomes are possible: A deal for all of WBD, a deal for the company’s streaming and studio assets to another company, or the already-planned split of WBD into two publicly traded halves.\n \n\n   \n  Lest there is any doubt, Ellison does want to buy all the WBD assets, including CNN, even though Warner is newly willing to sell pieces, sources with knowledge of the talks said.\n \n\n   \n  Ellison’s recent acquisition of The Free Press and installation of Bari Weiss as CBS News editor-in-chief evinces a deep interest in news — in ways that worry some and excite others.\n \n\n   \n    The Trump factor matters\n \n\n   \n  Paramount’s pursuit of WBD raises big questions about billionaire control of major media conglomerates. Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, for one, has been raising her voice about potential consumer harms.\n \n\n   \n  And Wall Street analysts have been asserting that President Trump’s personal preferences may weigh heavily on the deal process. The commentary is a stark reminder of how the president has reshaped the government in his own image.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has repeatedly praised the Ellisons in recent months. “They’re friends of mine. They’re big supporters of mine,” the president said in mid-October.\n \n\n   \n  “They will make the right decisions,” Trump added. “They’re going to revitalize CBS — hopefully, they’ll bring it back to its former glory.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s praise is notable partly because the younger Ellison was a big Democratic donor as recently as last year. He was spotted schmoozing near Trump at two different UFC matches earlier this year, though, and he agreed to several conditions imposed by the Trump-aligned FCC in order to complete his takeover of Paramount.\n \n\n   \n  Additionally, the elder Ellison has expressed support for Trump in the past and has been leading a group of investors who intend to buy TikTok’s US assets, potentially giving Trump a political and cultural win.\n \n\n   \n  Paramount is leveraging these presidential relationships as it pursues WBD. “Trump’s implicit support for the deal is their number one talking point,” a person involved in the negotiations said.\n \n\n   \n  Paramount insiders refute that, noting that Ellison made many pro-deal arguments in a letter to WBD’s board that The New York Times obtained on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  “We are confident that we are the best partner for WBD,” Ellison wrote in the letter, “with a combination of our two companies creating a scaled Hollywood champion to the benefit of both our companies’ shareholders, consumers and the entertainment industry at large.”\n \n\n   \n  Some analysts have backed up those arguments. Paramount’s bid “makes a lot of strategic sense by owning a much stronger slate of I.P. at Warner Bros. and seeking scale with the combined HBO Max and Paramount+ platforms,” Robert Fishman of MoffettNathanson said in a note to investors.\n \n\n   \n  Fishman also said that “combining the linear network portfolios would also likely yield significant cost synergies, while unlocking strategic benefits from pairing CBS News with CNN and leveraging the long-standing CBS-Turner partnership for NCAA’s March Madness Final Four plus other overlapping sports rights portfolios.”\n \n\n   \n  But Warner’s leaders argue that Paramount is not fully valuing its assets. Plus, though the Trump factor looms large, US regulators are not the only government officials to consider.\n \n\n   \n  A Paramount-WBD deal would face regulatory scrutiny in the United Kingdom, the European Union and some Latin American countries. The perception of Trump clearing the way for the Ellisons in the US could hurt them in other markets, sources said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/tech/microsoft-ai-copilot-updates-teen-safety","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"12:32:00-04:00","title":"Microsoft AI CEO: We’re making an AI that you can trust your kids to use","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman is leading a clear ethical stance in the AI industry by developing Copilot as a safe, emotionally intelligent, and trustworthy AI tool that children can use without risk.

kids to use \n       \n  By Clare Duffy, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:32 PM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Popular artificial intelligence chatbots like ChatGPT and Meta AI are increasingly blurring the line between real-world and digital relationships by allowing romantic and sometimes sexual conversations — while  scrambling  to make sure children aren’t accessing that adult content.\n \n\n   \n  But Microsoft wants no part of that, the company’s AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “We are creating AIs that are emotionally intelligent, that are kind and supportive, but that are fundamentally trustworthy,” Suleyman said. “I want to make an AI that you trust your kids to use, and that means it needs to be boundaried and safe.”\n \n\n   \n  Microsoft is locked in a race with tech giants like OpenAI, Meta and Google to make its Copilot the AI tool of choice in what Silicon Valley believes will be the next big computing wave. Copilot now has 100 million monthly active users across Microsoft’s platforms, the company said in its most recent earnings call. That’s well below competitors like OpenAI, whose  ChatGPT has 800 million  monthly active users.\n \n\n   \n  But Microsoft is betting its approach will win it a wider audience, especially as AI companies grapple with how to shape their chatbot’s personalities amid reports of AI  contributing to users’ mental health crises .\n \n\n   \n  “We must build AI for people; not to be a digital person,” Suleyman wrote in a blog post earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  The interview came ahead of a series of  new Copilot features  that Microsoft unveiled on Thursday, which include the ability to refer back to previous chats, engage in group conversations, improved responses to health questions and an optional, sassy tone called “real talk.”\n \n\n   \n    Saying no to erotica\n \n\n   \n  Some of Microsoft’s AI competitors are facing intense pressure to keep young users safe on their platforms.\n \n\n   \n  Families have sued  OpenAI  and  Character.AI  claiming their chatbots harmed their children, in some cases allegedly contributing to their suicides. A string of  reports  earlier this year raised concerns that Meta’s chatbot and other AI characters would engage in sexual conversations even with accounts identifying as minors.\n \n\n   \n  The tech companies behind popular AI chatbots say they’ve rolled out new protections for kids, including content restrictions and parental controls. Meta and OpenAI are also implementing AI age estimation technology aiming to catch young users who sign up with fake, adult birthdates — but it’s unclear how well those systems work. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman  announced  earlier this month that with its new safety precautions in place, ChatGPT will soon let adult users discuss “erotica” with the chatbot.\n \n\n   \n  Suleyman said Microsoft is drawing a bright line at romantic, flirtatious and erotic content, even for adults. “That’s just not something that we will pursue,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  That means, for now, Microsoft is unlikely to roll out a “young user” mode like some of its competitors — because they shouldn’t need it, Suleyman said.\n \n\n   \n    Prioritizing human connection\n \n\n   \n  A key focus for Microsoft is training Copilot to encourage users to interact with other humans, not just AI. That’s key for a company that has built its business around providing work-oriented productivity tools.\n \n\n   \n  Its new “groups” feature will let up to 32 people — think, classmates working on an assignment or friends planning a trip — join a shared chat with Copilot, where the chatbot can chime in with suggestions.\n \n\n   \n  That theme of pointing users to real people applies to Copilot’s health updates, too. The chatbot will recommend nearby doctors for certain medical-related queries, and will otherwise draw on “medically trusted” sources such as Harvard Health.\n \n\n   \n  Suleyman said he believes this push to get Microsoft’s AI chatbot to help strengthen human-to-human relationships “is a very significant tonal shift to other things that are happening in the industry at the moment, which are starting to see these things as deep simulations where you can go off into your own world and have an entire parallel reality, including, in some cases, adult content.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/sport/chess-vladimir-kramnik-daniel-naroditsky-fide-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"12:32:00-04:00","title":"Former World Chess Champion Vladimir Kramnik Investigated for Bullying Following Death of Grandmaster Daniel Naroditsky","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Former world chess champion Vladimir Kramnik is facing an investigation by FIDE for bullying and harassment following the sudden death of grandmaster Daniel Naroditsky, who died at age 29.

No cause of death was announced.\n \n\n   \n  Kramnik, a grandmaster and the world chess champion between 2000 and 2007, had repeatedly accused Naroditsky of cheating in online games.\n \n\n   \n  Naroditsky denied the accusations and, during his final Twitch stream last week, spoke about the mental toll Kramnik’s campaign had taken on him.\n \n\n   \n  “The problem is, ever since the Kramnik stuff, I feel like if I start doing well, people assume the worst of intentions,”  he said , adding: “The issue is just the lingering effect of it.”\n \n\n   \n  Kramnik has denied any wrongdoing and  wrote on X  Thursday that he hopes the “real truth about the curcumstances (sic) and cause of this tradegy (sic) will be revealed, despite all attempts to hide it.”\n \n\n   \n  Speaking to CNN’s Jake Tapper on “The Lead” on Wednesday, FIDE president Arkady Dvorkovich said that the organization “thought that Vladimir’s accusations were reckless and ungrounded.”\n \n\n   \n  He added: “Our fair play commission is looking into that. And I personally, and our management board, decided to pass it to our ethics commission for investigation, an independent investigation. We do believe that any kind of bullying or harassment is intolerable in any life activity — in sports, in chess in particular.”\n \n\n   \n  Dvorkovich explained that “any kind of sanction is possible” for Kramnik, though that decision ultimately rests with the ethics commission.\n \n\n   \n  “In recent times, public debate within the chess world has too often moved beyond the boundaries of acceptable, harming not only people’s reputation but their very well-being,” Dvorkovich  said  in a statement released by FIDE on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  “When this happens, discussions can turn into harassment, bullying, and personal attacks — a particularly serious concern in today’s environment.\n \n\n   \n  “The chess community has long respected the achievements of GM Vladimir Kramnik, and his contributions to our sport are undeniable. The same high standards that accompany great achievements, however, also confer a responsibility to uphold the principles of fairness and respect and to be ambassadors for the sport.”\n \n\n   \n  When contacted by  CNN Sports , Kramnik pointed to his recent interview with Russian outlet Match TV, during which he described FIDE’s investigation as “insulting,” “unfair” and “orchestrat(ing) a shameful campaign of harassment against me and my loved ones”\n \n\n   \n  He added in the interview: “The fact that FIDE makes such statements is unacceptable neither from a moral nor a legal point of view.”\n \n\n   \n  According to  The Associated Press , Kramnik first accused Naroditsky of cheating in online chess last October without providing substantial evidence.\n \n\n   \n  Since Naroditsky’s death, other players have spoken out against Kramnik, with five-time world champion Magnus Carlsen calling his conduct “ horrible ” and world No. 2 Hikaru Nakamura  describing  his campaign against perceived cheating as “nonsense” and “insane.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s time to stop worrying about the backlash. I am calling on the FIDE EDC (Ethics and Disciplinary Commission) to remove Vladimir Kramnik from the FIDE record books, revoke his title, and disqualify his world championship,” streamer and woman grandmaster Nemo Zhou  wrote  on X.\n \n\n   \n  “Chess is one of the most beloved games in the world and should be a place for kindness and inclusion.”\n \n\n   \n  Without naming Kramnik, grandmaster Nihal Sarin  wrote  on X that Naroditsky had faced “relentless, baseless accusations and public interrogations” which caused “immense pressure and pain.”\n \n\n   \n  “Daniel’s smile faded after the attacks began,” Sarin added.\n \n\n   \n  Kramnik has long waged a war against what he believes to be widespread cheating in online chess, describing it as a “rapidly spreading desease (sic)” in a “fair play in chess” fundraising campaign launched earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  Naroditsky was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area. After learning to play chess at the age of six, he would go on to earn the title of grandmaster – the highest title awarded by FIDE – before he was a senior in high school.\n \n\n   \n  A popular figure online, he had half a million subscribers on  his YouTube channel  and 340,000 followers on  Twitch , as well as being hired by the New York Times in 2022 as a chess columnist.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking on “The Lead,” FIDE president Dvorkovich described Naroditsky as “a bright person, a grandmaster, educator, commentator.

It was presided over by Leo and the Church of England’s Archbishop of York, Stephen Cottrell.\n \n\n   \n  A joint choir from St. George’s Chapel and the Chapel Royal performed at the service, alongside the choir of the Sistine Chapel. The British singers performed “If ye love me,” by Thomas Tallis, a prolific composer of sacred choral works from the Renaissance period\n \n\n   \n  The choice was significant because Tallis’ life spanned the split from Rome precipitated by King Henry VIII. Tallis continued to have a successful career after the Reformation, despite never renouncing his Catholic faith.\n \n\n   \n  The sight of the first joint prayer shared by the King and Pope signals the deepening of bonds between Catholics and Anglicans – a theme of the whistlestop visit.\n \n\n   \n  The King and Queen earlier met the new pontiff for the first time since his May election on Thursday morning, following their arrival in Rome the previous evening to celebrate the holy Jubilee year, which takes place every quarter of a century. They also met with Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Holy See Secretary of State.\n \n\n   \n  The British monarch gifted the Pope with a large silver photograph, and Icon of St Edward the Confessor, according to Buckingham Palace. In exchange, Leo presented with a scale version of the mosaic of “Christ Pantocrator,” in the Norman Cathedral of Cefalù, in Sicily.\n \n\n   \n  The Vatican described the discussions as “cordial” and “matters of common interest were discussed, such as environmental protection and the fight against poverty.”\n \n\n   \n  The statement added, “Particular attention was given to the shared commitment to promoting peace and security in the face of global challenges.”\n \n\n   \n  The trip is being seen by both sides as a “significant moment” in reconciling divisions between the British monarchy and the papacy that go back to 1534, when Henry VIII broke with Rome and created the Church of England.\n \n\n   \n  “It would be difficult to overstate the significance of this particular visit,” Rev. Martin Browne, a Vatican official who works at the department for “Promoting Christian Unity,” told CNN. He said it was the first time that a royal visit had an “ecumenical dimension,” meaning that it was focused on building unity between Rome, the Church of England and wider Anglican communion.\n \n\n   \n  “A service in which both the pope and a British sovereign participate has not been experienced since long before the Reformation,” Browne explained. “Its uniqueness is underlined by the fact that it is taking place in the Sistine Chapel, inside the Apostolic Palace, with the music being led by the pope’s ‘own’ choir and two of the King’s ‘own’ choirs.”\n \n\n   \n  Later, the King and Queen took part in an ecumenical service at the Basilica of St. Paul’s Outside the Walls, which has historic ties to the English Crown and is home to the tomb of the apostle St. Paul, for which past British monarchs paid the upkeep. It is one of the four papal basilicas in Rome and also houses a community of Benedictine monks.\n \n\n   \n  Pope Leo has approved making King Charles a “Royal Confrater” of St. Paul’s, as a “gesture of hospitality and spiritual fellowship.” In celebration of this new bond, a special throne-like chair has been commissioned by the place of worship, featuring the King’s coat of arms and the Latin motto “Ut unum sint” (“That they may be one”). It will remain permanently in the basilica for use by his successors.\n \n\n   \n  The pope is also making the King and Queen a knight and dame of the order of Pius IX. Charles has himself decided to honor Pope Leo by making him a “Papal Confrater of St. George’s Chapel, Windsor Castle” and Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath, an honor traditionally given to heads of state.\n \n\n   \n  The state visit concluded with King Charles attending a reception at the Pontifical Beda College, a seminary which trains priests from across the Commonwealth. Meanwhile, Queen Camilla met six Catholic sisters from the International Union of Superiors General, who work to support female empowerment around the world, including through girls’ education.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the turbulence of the past, relations between the Vatican and the British monarchy are today marked by warmth and mutual respect. The UK and the Holy See have had full diplomatic relations since 1982.\n \n\n   \n  Charles and Camilla were supposed to pay a state visit to the Vatican in early April, but the trip was postponed over Pope Francis’ poor health. They continued with an official visit to Italy, visiting Rome and Ravenna in the northeast. But the royal couple were able to privately visit the ailing pontiff a fortnight before he died.\n \n\n   \n  As Prince of Wales, Charles visited Vatican City on five occasions, while his late mother, Queen Elizabeth II, met five popes during her lifetime.\n \n\n   \n  “Yes, there are differences and divisions, some of them very deep,” Browne said. “But this (visit) is a reminder for everyone that what unites is more significant.”\n \n\n   \n  Diarmaid MacCulloch, a church historian from the University of Oxford, said that while there had been some ill-informed “hype” around the King’s visit, “there is some genuine significance in the Papacy showing such formal favor” to Charles.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a nice goodwill gesture on the Vatican’s part, and goodwill gestures are always welcome,” MacCulloch said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/economy/us-cpi-september-inflation-preview","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"12:41:00-04:00","title":"A tiny light in an economic data blackout is about to shine through the shutdown for a brief moment","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During a federal government shutdown that has caused a blackout of economic data, the Bureau of Labor Statistics is set to release the September Consumer Price Index report on Friday, October 24, 2025.

Alicia Wallace, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:41 PM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Nearly two dozen days have passed since a federal agency  has published an economic report . The US government’s shutdown has resulted in a blackout of critical data,  further clouding  an already opaque economic outlook.\n \n\n   \n  That will change – albeit briefly – Friday morning, when the Bureau of Labor Statistics is expected to release the Consumer Price Index report for September.\n \n\n   \n  The September CPI will allow the data-hungry to get a little fix, providing a snapshot of how prices are trending for Americans.\n \n\n   \n  The report is a one-off of sorts:  BLS staff were called back into the office  this month   to allow the government to meet statutory requirements in adjusting Social Security payments for next year. The September CPI is the final piece of data needed for the 2026 cost of living adjustment.\n \n\n   \n  So, after the CPI is released, darkness once again will envelop federal economic data until the government reopens.\n \n\n   \n  (And as for the report itself, economists tell CNN that despite the circumstances behind the delayed release, they’re not concerned about the integrity of the underlying data.)\n \n\n   \n    Expect inflation to move back above 3%\n \n\n   \n  Economists expect the latest data to show   that prices for a slew of commonly purchased goods and services rose at a faster-than-typical clip (0.4%) last month. This would lift the annual rate of inflation from 2.9% to 3.1% – the fastest pace in more than a year.\n \n\n   \n  There are many factors behind the upswing, including: pricier gas, food and tariff-impacted goods as well as slower-than-anticipated reduction in inflation on the services side – notably housing.\n \n\n   \n  It’s helpful to remember that the last time inflation was below 2% was in February 2021, Michael Pugliese, senior economist at Wells Fargo, told CNN in an interview.\n \n\n   \n  “At the macro level, it’s a reminder of how sticky inflation can be when it gets out of the tube and how hard it is to get to back to that 2% once it’s been above target for a while,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    The foods likely to get pricier\n \n\n   \n  American consumers have weathered nearly five years of prices rising faster than they typically should (and prices rose far, far faster than usual for two of those years). However, years of high inflation have taken their toll.\n \n\n   \n  Food prices, for example, have risen 24% between 2020 and 2024, noted Billy Roberts, senior analyst for food and beverage at CoBank, which provides financial services to agribusinesses and rural firms.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve seen smaller degrees of inflation, even over the course of this year, but it’s really that cumulative effect,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  In August,  grocery prices jumped 0.6% , the highest monthly increase in nearly three years, according to BLS data. Economists expect the September gain to be more mellow; however, certain categories likely will highlight pain points.\n \n\n   \n  Beef prices, for example,  have risen dramatically  in recent years as herds have shrunk amid  prolonged drought .  Cocoa  and  coffee prices , which have been pushed higher by  climate change  stifling supply, now  face further pressures from tariffs .\n \n\n   \n  Consumers stocking up for trick-or-treaters are now seeing the effects, Roberts said, noting cocoa prices are “still about double, if not triple, what they were in 2022-’23.”\n \n\n   \n  “Those aren’t items that consumers necessarily buy week in and week out,” but they’re buying in bulk now for Halloween, he said. “Those prices are going to provide a lot of sticker shock for consumers.”\n \n\n   \n    The K-shaped economy fallout\n \n\n   \n  Food prices remain a sore spot for many Americans  as do electricity prices , which also have been on the rise, Joe Brusuelas, RSM chief economist, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to those categories, Brusuelas noted he’ll be monitoring services-related inflation — such as airfare and other discretionary areas — and whether it’s remaining stubbornly high.\n \n\n   \n  “What I am concerned about is the sticky and stubborn service sector costs along with rising food and utility prices, which are really placing stress on middle-class and down-market households,” he said. “And this is a function of that greater discussion around the K-shaped economy, where 40% of this country is thriving.”\n \n\n   \n  A recent analysis by Moody’s Analytics found that the country’s top-earners (who have benefited from a surging stock market, rising wages and increased housing wealth)  are accounting for an even greater share of overall spending .\n \n\n   \n  “Down market,” Brusuelas added, “it’s a very different reality.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/climate/atlantic-tropical-storm-melissa-movement","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"11:45:00-04:00","title":"Tropical Storm Melissa Moves Slowly, Raises Concerns Over Climate-Related Storm Intensification and Flooding","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tropical Storm Melissa is expected to move extremely slowly through the Caribbean, covering just 2 miles per hour, posing a significant flooding threat to Jamaica and Hispaniola due to prolonged rainfall.

It’s a new, troubling tendency for Atlantic storms \n       \n  By Andrew Freedman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:45 AM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   Tropical Storm Melissa  is expected to meander the Caribbean at an agonizingly slow pace in the coming days, even as it’s forecast to strengthen into a hurricane, covering as little as 2 miles in an hour. This is slower than an average person’s walking speed.\n \n\n   \n  Hurricanes are powerful storms, but they require a tug or pull from other weather systems, such as a cold front or a dip in the jet stream, to determine how fast they move and where they go.\n \n\n   \n  When those influences are very weak or absent, however — as is the case with Melissa — a storm can meander for days, dumping torrential amounts of rainfall on anyone unlucky enough to be nearby.\n \n\n   \n  Slow movement and weak upper-level winds can also help a storm like Melissa intensify into a major hurricane — Category 3 or stronger. Right now, the Caribbean Sea has some of the most unusually hot waters of any part of the Atlantic Ocean, and the storm could have the opportunity to tap into that energy.\n \n\n   \n  “The potential intensity is quite elevated in the Caribbean, compared to the 1979-2023 average for this time of year,” said Kerry Emanuel, a meteorologist specializing in tropical cyclones at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. There has not been much storm activity in the Caribbean so far this year due to strong upper-level winds that have inhibited nascent storms from intensifying, he pointed out.\n \n\n   \n  But now, conditions are expected to be primed for Tropical Storm Melissa to keep at its snail’s pace.\n \n\n   \n    Are hurricanes slowing down?\n \n\n   \n  There is evidence that slow-moving tropical storms and hurricanes are occurring more frequently in the Atlantic Basin, particularly near and over land masses, experts say.\n \n\n   \n  Studies in the past several years have showed a slow-down in forward speed at landfall. That’s a critical change, since a slower-moving storm typically means more flooding rainfall, and potentially more storm surge.\n \n\n   \n  Some research has pointed to global warming as a potential cause of this trend, but this is not yet fully established, said meteorologist Kieran Bhatia of the global risk and reinsurance company Guy Carpenter.\n \n\n   \n  Some studies, Bhatia said, show tropical storms and hurricanes have slowed down in recent years over the continental United States and near-coastal US   regions as well.\n \n\n   \n  However, “these observed changes have not yet been confidently linked” to human-caused climate change, he said. The most recent major report from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found a trend that is not explainable solely by natural variability with “medium” confidence, Bhatia said.\n \n\n   \n  Research from hurricane expert James Kossin and his colleagues have in fact pointed to  global slowdowns in tropical cyclone forward speeds . They found this trend was related to changes in upper-level air circulation that are consistent with expectations from global warming.\n \n\n   \n  Other work from Kossin, a former scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who teaches at the University of Wisconsin, stands out for showing a trend toward slower-moving or even stalling North Atlantic tropical storms and hurricanes  at or near landfall .\n \n\n   \n   Additional research by other scientists  provides further evidence of recent slowdowns in the forward movement of tropical cyclones, while some  modeling studies project  that future climate change is likely to result in more meandering storms.\n \n\n   \n  But the broader community of meteorologists and climate scientists are not yet fully in agreement.\n \n\n   \n  Regardless of any climate change ties, any tendency to slow down, like the crawling forward speed of Tropical Storm Melissa, has huge implications for impacts because it allows such storms to dump heavier rainfall totals over land.\n \n\n   \n  Melissa, for example, poses a major flooding threat to Jamaica and Hispaniola in particular, due to its extended proximity to land, the presence of tall mountains that tend to wring out moisture from the atmosphere and the likelihood that heavy rains will fall for many consecutive days.\n \n\n   \n  While the tie between slower-moving storms and climate change is a topic of active research, studies have conclusively shown tropical storms and hurricanes now produce more rainfall than they used to. This is due to warming ocean and air temperatures, since warmer air holds more moisture.\n \n\n   \n  A devastating example of a slow-moving, water-laden storm was Hurricane Harvey in 2017, which produced 60.58 inches of rain in southeastern Texas. This was the highest rainfall total from a tropical cyclone in US history.\n \n\n   \n  As storms slow down, there is potential for more hurricanes to be like Harvey.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/sport/baseball-mlb-seattle-mariners-defeat-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"12:00:00-04:00","title":"It’s a failure: Seattle Mariners feel the deep pain of disappointment after narrowly missing out on first World Series","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Seattle Mariners narrowly lost to the Toronto Blue Jays in a dramatic 4-3 ALCS Game 7, falling just one game short of their first World Series appearance in franchise history.

a first World Series in franchise history, Seattle fell heartbreakingly short in Monday’s 4-3  defeat  against the Toronto Blue Jays.\n \n\n   \n  The gut-wrenching loss ensures that the Mariners’ unwanted record as the only team in Major League Baseball never to appear at the Fall Classic remains very much intact.\n \n\n   \n  To see how much this moment pained Seattle and its players, look no further than MVP candidate  Cal Raleigh , who was reduced to tears at the end of the game.\n \n\n   \n  “I love every guy in this room, but ultimately, it’s not what we wanted,” Raleigh told reporters after the game. “I hate to use the word failure, but it’s a failure.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s what we expected: to get to the World Series and win a World Series. That’s what the bar is and the standard is – that’s what we want to hold ourselves accountable to – but it hurts.”\n \n\n   \n  Raleigh was far from alone in his pain. “We’ve put in so much work and effort through this whole year and it’s over,” said Seattle center fielder Julio Rodríguez. “That’s also part of the game too.”\n \n\n   \n  The disappointment is also felt strongly among the team’s supporters.\n \n\n   \n  “As someone who’s a Seattle transplant, I don’t quite have the decades of embedded angst that some locals may carry with them,” Mariners fan Gabe Guarente, 48, told  CNN Sports . “But I do sort of share their fatalistic view of the team. We don’t really expect good things to happen, so when they do, it’s more of a pleasant surprise.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s why this year’s ALCS Game 7 loss felt both inevitable and completely heartbreaking at the same time.”\n \n\n   \n  Guarente described his emotions after the defeat as “gloomy … with an undercurrent of simmering rage at the cruel baseball gods.”\n \n\n   \n  On several occasions during this year’s American League Championship Series (ALCS), the signs looked so promising for the Mariners. They jumped into a 2-0 series lead, then went 3-2 up after victory in Game 5.\n \n\n   \n  And in the winner-takes-all game at Toronto’s Rodgers Centre, Seattle went 3-1 ahead when Raleigh launched his fifth home run of the postseason and fourth against the Blue Jays, putting his team in control of the contest at the top of the fifth.\n \n\n   \n  That, however, would be the high point of a miserable night for the Mariners. George Springer’s three-run homer saw Toronto move ahead in the seventh inning, and with that, Seattle’s hopes evaporated.\n \n\n   \n  Having never in their 49-season history been so close to appearing at the World Series, right now, it might feel like the Mariners have never been further away.\n \n\n   \n  “There was a lot of anger and some tears from my friends and other fans afterward,” Mariners supporter Joseph Leavitt, 30, told CNN Sports.\n \n\n   \n  In time, fans will be able to reflect on the team’s successful year, reaching a first ALCS since 2001 with a thrilling, near-five-hour win over the Detroit Tigers.\n \n\n   \n  The 28-year-old Raleigh has been the heartbeat of this Seattle team, hitting an MLB-leading 60 home runs in the regular season, only the seventh player in history to reach that mark.\n \n\n   \n  He signed a reported six-year, $105 million contract extension back in March, while Rodríguez is also locked into a long-term contract through 2029.\n \n\n   \n  For the Mariners – just the fourth team to lead a best-of-seven series 2-0 in the postseason and not advance – the ambition of reaching a first-ever World Series is still there, even in the post-mortem of a brutal loss.\n \n\n   \n  “All of us now have had a taste of how close we can get and how good this team can be,” said manager Dan Wilson. “Once you get that, that’s what you’re shooting for the next year and I know that will continue to be the goal … to get to that final step.\n \n\n   \n  “This year, we were one game short.”\n \n\n   \n  Fans like Guarente are cautiously optimistic about the future, given the talent and age profile of the Seattle team.\n \n\n   \n  “If they invest even a little bit in free agency, I think they can get back in this position,” he said. “It helps that the AL West is not a juggernaut, and the Astros’ empire is on the decline.\n \n\n   \n  “So, yes, I do think the Mariners can reach the World Series in the near future. They’ll have to get more of that  Humpy The Salmon  magic back, though.”\n \n\n   \n  Leavitt, meanwhile, calls the season a “massive success” overall, adding: “I would say sting of disappointment still lingers, but there is a lot of optimism about this current roster.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/tech/google-diversity-programs-women-techmakers","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"12:24:00-10:23","title":"'Their history is just erased': Google drops a key program for boosting women in tech","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Google has discontinued its long-standing Women Techmakers program, a global initiative launched in 2012 to support women in technology through community building, training, and funding.

October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The email that said the career resource program for women would no longer be part of Google was terse and followed months of eroding support. But the deletion of years of Women Techmakers’ work came as a significant shock to its members.\n \n\n   \n  “Everything that I ever hosted and facilitated for Women Techmakers is gone. And there are just as many ambassadors who were in the community that put in so much effort to be part of this, (and) their history just erased,” Sherry Yang, an engineering manager in Canada and an ambassador for the group, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Google earlier this month offloaded the key career resource program for supporting women in tech and severed its integration within the company. The decision was communicated to members in a short email with little explanation earlier this month. It left members feeling surprised, upset and sidelined as the company removed years’ worth of content and videos they created.\n \n\n   \n  The end of Women Techmakers served as another sign the search giant is unwinding its diversity programs as such initiatives face increasing political pressure.\n \n\n   \n  Google announced an external organization called Technovation will take over the group, but members of Women Techmakers told CNN they feel they have lost an important direct association and pipeline with one of the world’s most influential technology companies.\n \n\n   \n  “The message it sends to women in tech, and really women in general, is that we cannot count on unwavering support from big corporations,” Vassiliki Dalakiari, a former Women Techmakers ambassador and AI research and development manager in Greece, told CNN. “We need to keep speaking up until we are heard. Google helped to do that, and they decided to quietly turn their back on us.”\n \n\n   \n  Google declined to comment. A person with knowledge of the program said that Google is supporting and providing funding to Technovation through the transition phase and that the company believes in Technovation’s “ability to execute impactful, global programs.”\n \n\n   \n  Technovation CEO Tara Chklovski told CNN that the organization is getting funding from Google “to provide deeper programmatic support” to Women Techmaker members. The group will still have access to events, programs and “technology leaders from multinational companies from around the world (in addition to Google),” she said.\n \n\n   \n  But the members say they feel tossed aside by Google after years of building a community many said helped them in their career and personally, as they forged their careers in a male-dominated industry.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Big fat silence’\n \n\n   \n  Women Techmakers  started at Google in 2012  to provide “visibility, community, and resources for women in technology” around the world through trainings, scholarships and event funding, regardless of whether they worked at Google. The most involved and experienced members could become ambassadors and even get funding to help them attend Google developer events.\n \n\n   \n  But in February, Google  told employees  that it would no longer set diversity hiring targets and would evaluate its other diversity programs. The company said as a federal contractor, it needed to comply with President Donald Trump’s  executive order  on diversity, equity and inclusion programs for government agencies and contractors.\n \n\n   \n  Members of Women Techmakers who spoke to CNN said they started noticing a shift since then.\n \n\n   \n  One member of Women Techmakers based in Asia, who asked to only be identified as Tia, said it became increasingly difficult for ambassadors to get support for events and travel funding.\n \n\n   \n  Dalakiari told CNN that Women Techmakers Ambassadors did not receive the same level of support as they had in the past for the company’s Berlin developers conference over the summer.\n \n\n   \n  “There was no travel coverage, no invitation to the community events or meetups. It felt like we were included in name, but not in practice,” she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Then, in early October, members received short emails, obtained by CNN, informing them that the program would end at Google and shift to Technovation, which started as a youth technology education organization 20 years ago.\n \n\n   \n  Technovation says its mission is expanding to include adults and has vowed to maintain Women Techmakers’ mission and approach – as well as access to Google events and programs. But many women in tech said Google’s handling of the news signalled it wanted to quickly distance itself from diversity programs.\n \n\n   \n  “No global call. No formal announcement. No real explanation… just an email, and a big fat silence since then,” Leyla Damoisaux-Delnoy, a Brussels-based data scientist,  posted  on LinkedIn. “When a company’s commitment to equality ends with an email, it says a lot about what the commitment was really worth.”\n \n\n   \n  Several members CNN spoke to said they were shocked when Women Techmakers YouTube videos and LinkedIn posts were removed without warning. For some members like Yang, that meant vital proof of their work with the global internet juggernaut — like videos of events they led and panels they moderated — suddenly disappeared.\n \n\n   \n  Tia said she and other members are feeling “something between devastation and rage.”\n \n\n   \n  “Ending a global women-in-tech program without informing or engaging its most active contributors sends a clear message and it’s disappointing,” Dalakiari said. “WTM made a real difference, and I’m not sure that decision reflects the values many of us signed up to represent.”\n \n\n   \n    Women in tech programs flailing\n \n\n   \n  Google’s decision to offload oversight of Women Techmakers is just the latest indication that tech giants are scaling back their diversity programs this year.\n \n\n   \n  Tech workers active in programs meant to support women in the field told CNN they have seen a noticeable shift in funding and support in recent years.\n \n\n   \n  Donald Tomaskovic-Devey, a sociology professor at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst who studies workplace inequality, said tech firms previously made investments to improve women’s representation after facing scrutiny from gender equality organizations, federal regulators and their own employees.\n \n\n   \n  But things changed in 2025.\n \n\n   \n  “The pressure from the federal government is off, and now they actually fear that the Trump administration will come after them if they have any targeted programs,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Internally, more tech companies like Amazon and Meta are  culling their diversity programs .\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, Dell shut down its Dell Women’s Entrepreneur Network (DWEN). The company told CNN in a statement that the sunsetting of the women’s program coincided with shutting down their “Dell for Startups” program and is part of a “broader internal business strategy shift.”\n \n\n   \n  “Our commitment to empowering small businesses and entrepreneurs and fostering an inclusive workplace and ecosystem remains unwavering,” the company said in part.\n \n\n   \n  Members of Google’s Women Techmakers program told CNN they believe Technovation is a reputable organization with good intentions. But they’re concerned that it won’t have the same funding or impact as a company with the size, resources and recognition of Google.\n \n\n   \n  Still, company culture matters more than dedicated programs when it comes to supporting women and other groups, Tomaskovic-Devey said.\n \n\n   \n  “It probably does not matter much if targeted programs return. What matters is if Google, or any of the other big tech firms, actually manage their workplaces so that everyone feels respected and included,” Tomaskovic-Devey said. “Poor management will lead to backsliding where it really matters, in the diversity, productivity, and creativity of their workforces.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/business/elon-musk-pay-package-tesla","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"11:45:00-04:00","title":"Elon Musk says he needs $1 trillion to stop ‘corporate terrorists’ from wresting control of Tesla","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Elon Musk is advocating for a $1 trillion pay package to retain control of Tesla, claiming that influential shareholder advisory firms ISS and Glass Lewis — which he labels as 'corporate terrorists' — have made harmful recommendations that could undermine the company’s future.

\nUpdated: \n        11:45 AM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Elon Musk says he needs to build his stake in Tesla so much that he could become the world’s first trillionaire. But this week he said his aim wasn’t to increase his planet-leading wealth. Instead, Musk said the biggest pay package in history was necessary to protect his company.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not like I’m going to go spend the money,” Musk said on a call with investors Wednesday. “There needs to be enough voting control to give (me) a strong influence – but not so much that I can’t be fired if I go insane.”\n \n\n   \n  Musk said he needs to protect Tesla from two influential (but hardly all-powerful) research firms that advise shareholders how to vote – ISS and Glass Lewis, which he described as “corporate terrorists.”\n \n\n   \n  “I just don’t feel comfortable building a robot army here and …then being ousted because of some asinine recommendations from ISS and Glass Lewis, who have no freaking clue,” he said. “They have made many terrible recommendations in the past that if those recommendations had been followed, it would have been extremely destructive to the future of the company.”\n \n\n   \n  Musk claimed that passive index funds that control much of Tesla’s shares blindly follow the recommendations of ISS and Glass Lewis. But shareholder votes have always followed Tesla’s board recommendations. Although shareholders have voted against other companies’ board recommendations, they’re quite rare.\n \n\n   \n  For example, Glass Lewis and ISS recommended votes against a previous massive pay package for Musk. But shareholders approved that package in 2018 with 73% of shares held by investors other than Musk and his brother. After a Delaware judge threw out that pay package ruling it wasn’t in the interest of shareholders, Tesla held another vote and that time it was approved by holders of 84% of the shares.\n \n\n   \n  The two firms have reportedly recommended a vote against Musk’s newest pay package as well. Neither firm responded to a request for comment early Thursday about Musk referring them as terrorists.\n \n\n   \n  Musk now owns 413 million shares of Tesla outright and had options to buy 304 million additional shares at a small fraction of current prices, but those options have been struck down twice by the Delaware judge. The Delaware Supreme Court heard arguments in that case earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  The 413 million shares he owns and 96 million conditional additional shares that Tesla has agreed to give him in case the Delaware court decision is upheld would give him about 16% of the company’s outstanding shares. Musk has repeatedly said he wants roughly 10% more of the company.\n \n\n   \n  The pay package now up for a vote could give him options to buy 423.7 million additional shares of Tesla stock.\n \n\n   \n  But Musk would get those shares only if the value of Tesla stock increases significantly in coming years. The options would be worth close to $1 trillion should the company hit the increased valuation targets laid out in the package.\n \n\n   \n  Tesla’s board said the package is needed keep him focused on Tesla given all his other holdings and interests. He is also CEO of SpaceX and the primary owner of AI company, xAI, which owns social media platform X that he bought when it was Twitter, and several other companies.\n \n\n   \n  “Musk also raised the possibility that he may pursue other interests that may afford him greater influence,” said the company’s proxy proposing the package. “Simply put, retaining and incentivizing Elon is fundamental to Tesla achieving these goals and becoming the most valuable company in history.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/travel/comedy-wildlife-awards-finalists-2025-scli-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"12:04:00.000-04:00","title":"Joyful images from this year’s Comedy Wildlife Awards finalists","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Nikon Comedy Wildlife Awards has selected 40 humorous wildlife images and 10 videos as finalists, receiving nearly 10,000 entries from 108 countries.

The Treasury Department leveled the penalties against Petro; his wife, Veronica del Socorro Alcocer Garcia; his son, Nicolas Fernando Petro Burgos; and Colombian Interior Minister Armando Alberto Benedetti. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Petro \"has allowed drug cartels to flourish and refused to stop this activity,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement. \"President Trump is taking strong action to protect our nation and make clear that we will not tolerate the trafficking of drugs into our nation.\" The move ramps up a growing clash between the Republican U.S. president and Colombia's first leftist leader, notably over deadly American strikes on alleged drug-carrying boats off South America. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       This week, the Trump administration expanded its crackdown to the eastern Pacific Ocean, where much of the cocaine from the world's largest producers, including Colombia, is smuggled. And in an escalation of military firepower in the region, the U.S. military is sending an aircraft carrier to the waters off South America, the Pentagon announced Friday. The U.S. last month added Colombia, the top recipient of American assistance in the region, to a list of nations failing to cooperate in the drug war for the first time in almost 30 years. The penalties were expected after Trump recently said he would slash assistance to Colombia and impose tariffs on its exports, referring to Petro on social media in recent days as \"an illegal drug leader.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"He's a guy that is making a lot of drugs,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Wednesday. \"He better watch it, or we'll take very serious action against him and his country.\" After Trump accused him of having ties to drug trafficking, Petro on Wednesday said he would resort to the U.S. court system to defend himself. \"Against the calumnies that high-ranking officials have hurled at me on U.S. soil, I will defend myself judicially with American lawyers in the U.S. courts,\" Petro wrote on X without naming Trump but citing a news report about his comments. A day earlier, Petro's anti-drug policy was the subject of a meeting between him and the U.S. chargé d'affaires in Colombia, John T. McNamara. McNamara also met with Foreign Minister Rosa Yolanda Villavicencio Mapy on Thursday. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Petro has repeatedly defended his policy, which moves away from a repressive approach and prioritizes reaching agreements with growers of coca leaf — the raw material for cocaine — to encourage them to switch to other crops, pursuing major drug lords and combating money laundering. He has said his government has achieved record cocaine seizures and questioned U.N. figures showing record coca leaf cultivation and cocaine production. The amount of land dedicated to cultivating coca, the base ingredient of cocaine, has almost tripled in the past decade to a record 253,000 hectares (625,000 acres) in 2023, according to the latest report available from the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime. That is about triple the size of New York City. The Trump administration has surged military ships and planes to Latin America to target traffickers accused of funneling drugs to the U.S. Petro has pushed back against the strikes that have killed at least 37 people since they started last month, with the latest two targeting vessels in the eastern Pacific, where Colombia has a coastline. Petro has repeatedly feuded with Trump this year. Petro initially rejected U.S. military flights of deported migrants, leading Trump to threaten tariffs. The State Department said it would revoke Petro's visa when he attended the U.N. General Assembly in New York because he told American soldiers to disobey Trump's orders. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/europe/putin-strategy-trump-russia-sanctions-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"11:25:00-04:00","title":"As US gets tough on Moscow, has Putin’s strategy of playing Trump run its course?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the United States under Donald Trump shifts toward a more aggressive stance on Russia, the Kremlin's long-standing strategy of manipulating Trump’s desire for peace in Ukraine through economic incentives and diplomatic outreach appears to have failed.

Correspondent\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:25 AM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Kremlin may have convinced itself that US President Donald Trump didn’t have the stomach to apply real pressure on Moscow to end the  brutal conflict in Ukraine .\n \n\n   \n  It was, after all, just a carefully timed Kremlin phone call to the White House last week that convinced the US president to back away from his own threats of providing long-range  Tomahawk missiles  to Kyiv, missiles that could have made a real difference on the battlefield.\n \n\n   \n  But the  new US Treasury sanctions  on Russia’s two biggest oil companies may now force the Kremlin strongman, Vladimir Putin, to finally reassess his American counterpart, if not his Ukrainian war.\n \n\n   \n  Already an outspoken Putin ally, Dmitry Medvedev, a former Russian president who is now the deputy chairman of the Russian Security Council, has slammed Trump as “the talkative peacemaker who has now fully embarked on the war path against Russia.”\n \n\n   \n  “This is his conflict now, not the senile Biden’s,” Medvedev added in a social media post, referring provocatively to the former US president.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not that the sanctions themselves are particularly tough. True, oil is essential to the Russian economy, funding the Kremlin’s costly war in Ukraine. It’s also true that Rosneft and Lukoil, sanctioned along with dozens of their subsidiaries, are Russia’s most significant oil producers.\n \n\n   \n  But Russia, one of the world’s most sanctioned countries, has proven adept at finding ways of circumventing these kinds of punitive measures in the past. It will, according to senior Russian officials, seek to do so again.\n \n\n   \n  “The decision will not pose any particular problems for us. Our country has developed a strong immunity to Western restrictions and will continue to confidently develop its economic and energy potential,” said Maria Zakharova, the Russian foreign ministry spokesperson, in a televised press briefing.\n \n\n   \n  The bigger problem for the Kremlin is that its favorite and well-tested strategy to manipulate the Trump White House – holding out the prospect of engagement on peace in Ukraine and dangling lucrative economic deals, while pressing ahead with its relentless military onslaught – appears to have run its course.\n \n\n   \n  Finally, the US president, who has  for months suspected  the Kremlin may be simply “tapping (him) along” on Ukraine, has decided to act.\n \n\n   \n  As well as imposing his first proper sanctions on Russia since the Kremlin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Trump also “canceled” a  proposed summit  with Putin in Budapest, Hungary.\n \n\n   \n  Just hours before, Russian officials – relishing the chance of another face-to-face presidential meeting – insisted there were “no obstacles” and that arrangements were actively being made, dismissing any suggestions of the summit being shelved.\n \n\n   \n  But, in retrospect, that optimism appears to have been Kremlin wishful thinking too. Putin is, of course, extremely keen to show Russians and the wider world that – despite sanctions and an indictment for war crimes at the  International Criminal Court  – that he is far from isolated on the international stage.\n \n\n   \n  When Trump rolled out the red carpet for him in Alaska this August, the leader of the world’s most powerful nation standing  shoulder to shoulder  with the Kremlin boss, it was an easy diplomatic win for the Kremlin, which offered little to the White House in return.\n \n\n   \n  There will, apparently, be no repeat performance in Budapest unless and until progress is made on Ukraine. The US Treasury has even suggested that more powerful American sanctions on Russia could follow, to further pressure the Kremlin into quickly talking peace.\n \n\n   \n  It could be the start of what critics of Trump’s handling of the Kremlin have long been calling for: a tough, new strategy to finally use considerable US leverage to try and force Putin to compromise on his maximalist war objectives.\n \n\n   \n  These include Kremlin demands for Kyiv to surrender strategic swathes of territory in  the Donbas , in eastern Ukraine, which Russia has so far been unable to conquer –  a red line  for the Ukrainian government and its European backers.\n \n\n   \n  Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky has described the US moves as “very important” and crucial to “bring Russia to the negotiating table.” Meanwhile, European officials have also expressed satisfaction with Washington’s apparently more hardline stance.\n \n\n   \n  But after nine months trapped on the rollercoaster ride of this latest Trump presidency, there are ever-present anxieties. And behind the scenes in Kyiv, in Brussels and even in Moscow, few doubt that in the erratic, mercurial world of Trump, a sudden switch back to the Kremlin’s point of view could be just another friendly, carefully-timed phone call with Putin away.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5584173","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"16:01:00-04:00","title":"As strikes on alleged drug boats grow, so do questions about their legality and goal","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration has conducted a series of military strikes on alleged drug boats, with attacks now occurring in both the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean.

Two of those attacks were not in the Caribbean Sea but in the eastern Pacific Ocean, signaling an expansion of the Trump administration's campaign against drug trafficking from South America. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth posted a video on X of a blue speedboat skipping along the ocean waters before being hit and then bursting into flames. \"Just as Al Qaeda waged war on our homeland, these cartels are waging war on our border and our people,\" Hegseth  wrote in the Wednesday message . \"There will be no refuge or forgiveness — only justice.\" The Pacific strikes represented the eighth and ninth known boat attacks. On Friday, Hegseth announced  an additional strike in the Caribbean , raising the known death toll to 43. The Trump administration has yet to provide public evidence to support its assertions that the individuals on the boats were cartel members and that the vessels were transporting drugs, raising concerns about the legality of the strikes and the real goals of the White House campaign. Prior to the strikes in the Pacific, the U.S. military had been ramping up the number of troops and naval ships in the Caribbean Sea off the coast of Venezuela. On Friday, the Pentagon said the Gerald Ford Carrier Strike Group is being sent to the U.S. Southern Command area of responsibility, which includes the Caribbean.  International law experts say it's an unprecedented amount of military hardware to confront suspected drug boats, which has fueled questions about whether the operation is about countering narcotics trafficking or instead toppling Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"It's such overkill in this naval deployment that there could be no justification if all the United States is trying to do is to attack a couple of small boats and intimidate drug traffickers,\" said Benjamin Gedan, who led the Venezuela portfolio at the Obama White House. \"It's either a bluff meant to scare the pants off the Venezuelan generals and encourage them to rise up and remove the president … or actual preparations for some sort of war with Venezuela.\" Trump has insisted that he has the legal authority to launch the attacks in international waters, calling it a national security issue to save American lives. During a meeting on Wednesday with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, Trump boasted about the expanded use of force. \"They had one today in the Pacific. And the way I look at it, every time I look because it is violent and it is very — it's amazing, the weaponry,\" he said. \"They have these boats that go 45, 50 miles an hour in the water, and when you look at the accuracy and the power. Look, we have the greatest military in the world.\" He asserted that his actions are saving the lives of tens of thousands of Americans without providing evidence. He also said the U.S. may conduct strikes on land next. \"We will hit them very hard when they come in by land,\" he said. \"We're totally prepared to do that. And we'll probably go back to Congress and explain exactly what we're doing when we come to the land.\" Some lawmakers are raising concerns  The power to declare war rests with Congress, not the White House. After the al-Qaida attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, which killed some 3,000 Americans, Congress passed an authorization for use of military force, granting the president the ability to use the U.S. military against the terrorist group responsible for the attacks. The Trump administration has designated several South and Central American drug cartels and gangs as foreign terrorist organizations, but Congress has not authorized the use of force against them. Lawmakers — Democrats and some Republicans — have expressed concerns that the strikes on suspected drug boats violate domestic and international laws. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky charged that Trump has set a new precedent of shoot first, ask questions later. \"The idea of indiscriminately killing people without knowing their names, without seeing any evidence, without making a formal accusation or without collecting evidence,\" he said. \"It's kind of ironic that we think these people are so dangerous, we're going to kill them without any information.\" At the White House on Thursday, Trump said he thinks lawmakers will support his administration's efforts, but when asked why he wouldn't just ask Congress for a declaration of war, he said: \"I don't think we're going necessarily to ask for a declaration of war. I think we're just going to kill people that are bringing drugs into our country. OK. We're going to kill them. They're going to be, like, dead.\" The Trump administration has given few specifics about its legal justification for the military strikes other than that the president is taking action under his Article II powers as commander in chief and as a defensive measure. In a notification to Congress last month, the administration said the president has determined that unspecified cartels are nonstate armed groups and that their actions amount to an \"armed attack\" on the United States. The administration also said Trump has determined that the U.S. is in an armed conflict with nonstate actors — cartels in South America — and that the Defense Department is conducting operations against them pursuant to the laws of armed conflict. Questions about the legality of the strikes  But legal experts say the administration's justification is full of holes. \"What this boils down to is the president of the United States asserting a prerogative to kill people based solely on his own say-so,\" said Brian Finucane, a former legal adviser for the State Department. Finucane, who is now with the International Crisis Group, says the pivotal legal conclusions \"are simply reached by executive fiat,\" thus \"making it permissible for the president to engage in premeditated killing.\" \"Outside of armed conflict, there is a word for the premeditated killing of people, and that word is 'murder,'\" he said. \"And just because the administration puts together this fig leaf of a legal justification does not legitimize these premeditated killings in the Caribbean.\" It's not just Venezuela that feels targeted. The latest strikes raised particular concerns in Colombia, which has coastlines on both the Caribbean and Pacific. Colombian President Gustavo Petro has accused the U.S. of murder and charged that some of the strikes killed Colombians. Trump responded by announcing that he would stop aid payments to Colombia. \"They're not going to get away with it much longer,\" Trump said on Thursday. \"We're not going to put up with it much longer. Colombia is very bad.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       This week, a group of independent United Nations experts said even if the boats are transporting drugs, as the White House asserts, \"the use of lethal force in international waters without proper legal basis violates international law of the sea and amounts to extrajudicial executions.\" \"These moves are an extremely dangerous escalation with grave implications for peace and security in the Caribbean region,\" wrote the experts, who are appointed by the U.N. Human Rights Council. On Wednesday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio largely listened as Trump sparred with reporters about his legal authority and allowing Congress to weigh in. When Trump turned to his top adviser on foreign policy for his thoughts, Rubio was blunt. \"Bottom line, these are drug boats,\" he said. \"If people want to stop seeing drug boats blow up, stop sending drugs to the United States.\" Claudia Grisales contributed reporting.  \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-95054","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"21:27:00-04:00","title":"U.S. Sends Aircraft Carrier to South America in Major Escalation of Military Firepower","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. military has deployed the USS Gerald R.

Ford and its strike group to deploy to the U.S. Southern Command region to \"bolster U.S. capacity to detect, monitor, and disrupt illicit actors and activities that compromise the safety and prosperity of the United States,\" Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said on social media. The USS Ford, which has five destroyers in its strike group, is now deployed to the Mediterranean Sea. One of its destroyers is in the Arabian Sea and another is in the Red Sea, a person familiar with the operation told The Associated Press. As of Friday, the aircraft carrier was in port in Croatia on the Adriatic Sea. The person, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive military operations, would not say how long it would take for the strike group to arrive in the waters off South America or if all five destroyers would make the journey. Deploying an aircraft carrier will surge major additional resources to a region that has already seen an unusually large U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean Sea and the waters off Venezuela.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The latest deployment and the quickening pace of the U.S. strikes, including one Friday, raised new speculation about how far the Trump administration may go in operations it says are targeted at drug trafficking, including whether it could try to topple Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. He faces charges of narcoterrorism in the U.S. Moving thousands more troops into the region There are already more than 6,000 sailors and Marines on eight warships in the region. If the entire USS Ford strike group arrives, that could bring nearly 4,500 more sailors as well as the nine squadrons of aircraft assigned to the carrier. Complicating the situation is Tropical Storm Melissa, which has been nearly stationary in the central Caribbean with forecasters warning it could soon strengthen into a powerful hurricane. Hours before Parnell announced the news, Hegseth said the military had conducted the 10th strike on a suspected drug-running boat, leaving six people dead and bringing the death count for the attacks that began in early September to at least 43 people. Hegseth said on social media that the vessel struck overnight was operated by the Tren de Aragua gang. It was the second time the Trump administration has tied one of its operations to the gang that originated in a Venezuelan prison. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"If you are a narco-terrorist smuggling drugs in our hemisphere, we will treat you like we treat Al-Qaeda,\" Hegseth said in his post. \"Day or NIGHT, we will map your networks, track your people, hunt you down, and kill you.\" The strikes have ramped up from one every few weeks when they first began last month to three this week, killing a total of at least 43 people. Two of the most recent strikes were carried out in the eastern Pacific Ocean, expanding the area where the military has launched attacks and shifting to where much of the cocaine is smuggled from the world's largest producers, including Colombia. Escalating tensions with Colombia, the Trump administration imposed sanctions Friday on Colombian President Gustavo Petro, his family and a member of his government over accusations of involvement in the global drug trade. U.S. focus on Venezuela and Tren de Aragua Friday's strike drew parallels to the first announced by the U.S. last month by focusing on Tren de Aragua, which the Trump administration has designated a foreign terrorist organization and blamed for being at the root of the violence and drug dealing that plague some cities. While not mentioning the origin of the latest boat, the Republican administration says at least four of the boats it has hit have come from Venezuela. On Thursday, the U.S. military flew a pair of supersonic heavy bombers up to the coast of Venezuela. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Maduro argues that the U.S. operations are the latest effort to force him out of office. Maduro on Thursday praised security forces and a civilian militia for defense exercises along about 1,200 miles of coastline to prepare for the possibility of a U.S. attack. In the span of six hours, \"100% of all the country's coastline was covered in real time, with all the equipment and heavy weapons to defend all of Venezuela's coasts if necessary,\" Maduro said during a government event shown on state television. The U.S. military's presence is less about drugs than sending a message to countries in the region to align with U.S. interests, according to Elizabeth Dickinson, the International Crisis Group's senior analyst for the Andes region. \"An expression that I'm hearing a lot is 'Drugs are the excuse.' And everyone knows that,\" Dickinson said. \"And I think that message is very clear in regional capitals. So the messaging here is that the U.S. is intent on pursuing specific objectives. And it will use military force against leaders and countries that don't fall in line.\" Comparing the drug crackdown to the war on terror Hegseth's remarks around the strikes have recently begun to draw a direct comparison between the war on terrorism that the U.S. declared after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and the Trump administration's crackdown on drug traffickers. President Trump this month declared drug cartels to be unlawful combatants and said the U.S. was in an \"armed conflict\" with them, relying on the same legal authority used by the Bush administration after 9/11. When reporters asked Trump on Thursday whether he would request that Congress issue a declaration of war against the cartels, he said that wasn't the plan. \"I think we're just going to kill people that are bringing drugs into our country, OK? We're going to kill them, you know? They're going to be like, dead,\" Trump said during a roundtable at the White House. Lawmakers from both major political parties have expressed concerns about Trump ordering the military actions without receiving authorization from Congress or providing many details. \"I've never seen anything quite like this before,\" said Sen. Andy Kim, D-N.J., who previously worked in the Pentagon and the State Department, including as an adviser in Afghanistan. \"We have no idea how far this is going, how this could potentially bring in, you know, is it going to be boots on the ground? Is it going to be escalatory in a way where we could see us get bogged down for a long time?\" he said. Republican Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart of Florida, who has long been involved in foreign affairs in the hemisphere, said of Trump's approach: \"It's about time.\" While Trump \"obviously hates war,\" he also is not afraid to use the U.S. military in targeted operations, Diaz-Balart said. \"I would not want to be in the shoes of any of these narco-cartels.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5581354","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"09:13:00-04:00","title":"Ongoing Shutdown Threatens Food Aid for 42 Million People","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The ongoing federal government shutdown threatens to cut off SNAP benefits for nearly 42 million Americans, with funding expected to run out on November 1.

territory': Ongoing shutdown threatens food aid for 42 million people \n         By Jennifer Ludden \n        \n           Updated Friday, October 24, 2025 • 9:13 AM EDT \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         In just over a week,  nearly 42 million people  in the U.S. who get federal   food assistance are in danger of seeing their benefits disappear because of the ongoing federal shutdown. About 1 in 8 U.S. residents get an average of $187 a month through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. One of those people is Shari Jablonowski. The 66-year-old widow, who lives outside Pittsburgh, is bracing to lose the $291 in food aid her disabled nephew gets each month. She raised her now-adult nephew and two nieces as her own, and even without this looming crisis, her budget is a tightrope. \"This month, I could not afford to pay … anything, gas or electric,\" she says. Instead she paid her monthly car payment, since she needs to drive to doctors' appointments, visit her mother, and one niece uses the car to get to work. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       If her nephew's food benefit disappears in November? \"I am very concerned I will not have heat,\" she says. It would also ruin Thanksgiving. SNAP, formerly known as food stamps, is the country's largest anti-hunger program. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"The vast majority are children, working people, older Americans, veterans and people with disabilities,\" Joel Berg, CEO of Hunger Free America, says of food stamp recipients. \"If the SNAP program shuts down, we will have the most mass hunger suffering we've had in America since the Great Depression.\" For most people, SNAP is the only money they get directly. Cash welfare was dramatically reduced in the 1990s, Berg notes, and Medicaid payments go directly to doctors, hospitals and drug companies.\"The only thing that really helps moderate income and low-income Americans meet their basic monthly expenses is the SNAP program. And that's why it's so vital, not only in terms of fighting hunger, but just keeping tens of millions of Americans afloat each month,\" he says. In addition, a separate nutrition program for 7 million pregnant women and new parents is also at risk of  running out of money . The Trump administration  tapped $300 million in tariff funds  to keep WIC — the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children — afloat, but it's expected to run out within a few weeks. Some states say they'll  help fill that funding gap , but not all have the resources for that. There's pressure on USDA to keep funding SNAP Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins has warned that SNAP funding will run out on Nov. 1, and USDA has told states that payments are on hold \"until further notice.\" The agency blames Democrats, who say they won't vote to end the shutdown unless Republicans agree  to extend tax credits for the Affordable Care Act  to keep health insurance premiums from skyrocketing. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In a statement to NPR a USDA spokesperson said, \"We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats. Continue to hold out for healthcare for illegals or reopen the government so mothers, babies, and the most vulnerable among us can receive timely WIC and SNAP allotments.\" Undocumented immigrants  are not eligible  for the Affordable Care Act. Food aid advocates say USDA can and should keep funding SNAP. \"SNAP still has billions of dollars in what are called  contingency reserves ,\" says Katie Bergh, a senior policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a non-partisan research and policy institute. That wouldn't cover the entire amount, but she says the agency could legally transfer additional funds, as they've done for the WIC nutrition program. In fact, Bergh argues USDA has a legal obligation to fund SNAP since it's an entitlement program. Department officials did not respond to an NPR query about whether there is such a legal obligation. The origins of U.S. food benefits go back to the Great Depression. If funding does lapse next month, Bergh says, \"We would be in uncharted territory.\" And for some SNAP recipients it could be double whammy. That's because many will be subject to  new work requirements  tied to the benefit   starting November 1 – the same day their benefits might end. The work requirements, passed by Congressional Republicans earlier this year, are expected to  push 2.4 million people off the program  over the next decade. States and food banks are scrambling to help In a  letter Thursday ,  the U.S. Conference of Mayors also urged USDA not to let SNAP benefits be disrupted, saying the program helps stabilize local economies.Each month, the federal government pays $8 billion in SNAP benefits. The money is automatically added to a debit-like card that recipients can then use at groceries, farmers markets and other places. More than  250,000 food retailers  count on that income, says Berg with Hunger Free America. It's not clear whether the government will act in time to prevent SNAP benefits from ending. And if it does – but waits until the last minute – it would take days to get the benefits distributed to states and then onto people's spending cards. Meanwhile, states are  preparing for a spike  in demand at  food banks . Virginia, for example, declared a  state of emergency  and said it would provide food benefits. Colorado's governor  urged people to donate  to food banks, and California said it would   send National Guard troops  to help out at food banks, as it did during the COVID-19 pandemic. But advocates say even expanded food charity will nowhere near make up for the loss of billions in federal funding. Meanwhile, Shari Jablonowski struggles to think how she'll cope with a major hole in her budget. She already visits food pantries and plans to step that up. But \"there's nothing I can do to make money,\" she says. \"I'm not in the greatest of health.\" For now, she's making big batches of soup and freezing some for later. \n         \n         Transcript \n         AILSA CHANG, HOST:   The federal government shutdown now threatens the country's largest anti-hunger program, known as SNAP. Here's White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt yesterday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KAROLINE LEAVITT: If Democrats continue to hold Americans hostage, there will not be enough funds to provide SNAP benefits for more than 40 million Americans on November 1. That is next week. CHANG: A disruption like that has never happened before. As NPR's Jennifer Ludden reports, the fallout would be widespread. JENNIFER LUDDEN, BYLINE: Shari Jablonowski is bracing to lose the $291 in food aid her disabled nephew gets each month. The 66-year-old widow lives near Pittsburgh and raised her nephew and two nieces as her own. Even without this looming crisis, her budget's a tightrope. This month... SHARI JABLONOWSKI: I ran short because I didn't have enough to pay all the bills. LUDDEN: She skipped gas and electric to make her car payment. JABLONOWSKI: Because if I don't pay them, I can't go to the doctors, I can't go to visit my mother, go see her and check on her. LUDDEN: So if her nephew's food benefit disappears in November, for sure it would ruin Thanksgiving, but she really worries the family won't have heat as temperatures drop. JABLONOWSKI: I don't have propane heaters. I have an electric heater, and if the electric goes out, we're screwed. LUDDEN: Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, SNAP, formerly known as food stamps, helps 1 in 8 people in the U.S., who get on average $186 a month. JOEL BERG: The vast majority are children, working people, older Americans, veterans and people with disabilities. LUDDEN: Joel Berg is CEO of Hunger Free America. BERG: If the SNAP program shuts down, we will have the most mass hunger suffering we've had in America since the Great Depression. LUDDEN: For most poor people, he says, SNAP is the only money they get directly. Cash welfare was slashed in the '90s, and Medicaid goes to doctors, hospitals and drug companies. BERG: The only thing that really helps moderate-income and low-income Americans meet their basic monthly expenses is the SNAP program, and that's why it's so vital, not only in terms of fighting hunger, but just keeping tens of millions of Americans afloat each month. LUDDEN: On top of this, another nutrition program may also run out. WIC helps 7 million pregnant women and new parents. The Trump administration shifted funding to last a few weeks, and some states say they have money for WIC. But it's harder with SNAP because it's so huge - $8 billion a month. Even amping up food banks can nowhere near make up for that, so there's pressure on the Agriculture Department to keep it going. KATIE BERGH: Not just that they can, but they must do this. LUDDEN: That's Katie Bergh - no relation to Joel - with the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. She argues there's a legal requirement to fund SNAP since it's an entitlement program. Plus... BERGH: SNAP still has billions of dollars in what are called contingency reserves that could fund the bulk of what is needed for November benefits. Situations like this are precisely why Congress provides them. LUDDEN: She says the Trump administration could also shift other money like it's done to help WIC. The Agriculture Department did not respond to an NPR query about whether it has a legal obligation to keep funding SNAP. In a statement, a spokesperson blamed Democrats for risking food aid by keeping the government shut down. Meanwhile, Shari Jablonowski struggles to think how she could bring in more money if her nephew's food aid disappears. JABLONOWSKI: I'm not in the greatest of health. I can't stand on my feet 24/7. LUDDEN: For now, she's making big batches of soup and freezing it for later.

Six Flags. Can Travis Kelce help? \n         By Rachel Treisman \n        \n           Friday, October 24, 2025 • 2:41 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Travis Kelce, the Kansas City Chiefs tight end and fiance of Taylor Swift,  sparked jokes  and hopes this week when he announced his investment in the embattled amusement park company Six Flags Entertainment. The football star, alongside two corporate executives, teamed up with JANA Partners to purchase a combined stake of about 9% of Six Flags' shares, making them one of its largest shareholders, according to  Tuesday's news release . \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       JANA Partners is an  activist investment  firm, meaning it buys a substantial stake in a company's equity in order to push for changes — both operational and managerial — it believes will benefit that company. \"Couldn't pass up the opportunity to continue the tradition and make Cedar Point and Six Flags even more special for the next generation of families!\" Kelce  wrote on Instagram . \"So crazy to even imagine this is real, but you gotta love it when life comes full circle.\" Kelce also shared home video clips of himself as a child enjoying the rides at Cedar Point, the 364-acre amusement park in Sandusky, Ohio, that he and his brother (and retired pro footballer) Jason grew up going to every year, as the two enthusiastically reminisced in an episode of their  New Heights  podcast. Kelce, who grew up in a suburb of Cleveland, calls himself a \"lifelong Six Flags fan.\" Cedar Point's former operator, Cedar Fair,  merged with Six Flags  in 2024 to become the largest amusement park operator in North America, touting 42 parks across the U.S., Canada and Mexico. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       At the time, many amusement parks — and Six Flags especially — were struggling to increase attendance in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Park analysts and enthusiasts hoped the merger would lower ticket costs, raise revenue and make it more competitive against industry heavyweights like Disney and Universal. But that hasn't been the case, says Dennis Speigel, CEO of the  consulting firm  International Theme Park Services. \"As this merger occurred, I think the due diligence was probably done a little too quickly and it had a lot of flaws in it,\" he told NPR. \"And then it was also impacted by what I call the external factors: weather, economy, uncertainty of what's happening in geopolitical areas.\" Six Flags now has  $5.3 billion in debt . Its CEO, Richard Zimmerman, is  set to step down  by the end of the year, after it  reported a net loss  of $100 million for the second quarter of 2025 and combined attendance down 9% year-over-year. It is shuttering one of its parks —  Six Flags America  in Bowie, Md. — in early November and is expected to close another in Santa Clara, Calif., in 2027. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Speigel is hopeful the new shareholders will get Six Flags back on track. And while he was initially surprised to learn of Kelce's involvement, he says it makes sense because \"he's at the zenith of his career in football … and in love.\" \"Having a name like that be associated with Six Flags at this point in time, when they've gone through quite a few years recently of negativity, speaks well to their future and what they're looking to do,\" he says. \"Obviously, he's a younger person. He speaks to the teens, the young adults and the young adults with families. And that's the Six Flags audience.\" Kelce's fame — and high-profile love story — have boosted businesses before. Swift is credited with  increasing female NFL viewership  and ticket sales as their relationship unfolded. And, in recent days, his social media announcement has been flooded with fans' pleas for a Swift-themed park, or at least a rollercoaster. Six Flags' rocky ride  Six Flags opened with the \"Six Flags Over Texas\" park in 1961, and for years was one of America's most iconic theme park companies (along with Disney). But for the last decade, Speigel says, it has been \"a ship at sea without a captain.\" \"I would have to say [out of] the top five or six operators during the last couple of years, Six Flags has suffered the most,\" he says. Six Flags has had four CEOs since 2015. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       It  shifted its pricing strategy  in 2022 to target a more affluent demographic, confusing and alienating core customers in the process. And in recent years, a number of high-profile ride malfunctions have  stranded  and  even injured   visitors.  This year, extreme temperatures and economic uncertainty drove attendance down even further. \"To see Six Flags have fallen off the precipice and down to where it is now, it's sad,\" Speigel says. \"And everybody in the industry, competitors and alike, are all rooting for their return and their comeback.\" What might change?  JANA Partners said in its announcement that it plans to engage with Six Flags' management and board of directors \"regarding opportunities to enhance shareholder value and improve the guest experience.\" NPR has reached out to Jana Partners for more information about its goals but did not hear back by publication time. The  Wall Street Journal   reports  that the investment firm wants to \"modernize technology, refresh leadership and evaluate a potential sale as ways to boost the company's share price.\" In a statement shared with NPR, a Six Flags spokesperson said it appreciates the perspectives of shareholders and takes their feedback seriously. Speigel says Six Flags' debt could force the new investors to take \"some drastic measures,\" like selling some of its parks, either to commercial real estate or even private equity groups. And he stresses that foot traffic is key in the industry. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"We live on repeat visitation, and repeat visitation is driven by capital improvements, new rides and attractions,  dark rides , the new technologies,\" he says. \"So we have to hopefully see the growth from that.\" Speigel says even though U.S. amusement parks may not be experiencing the same rate of growth that they did several decades ago, they still attract some  400 million  visitors each year — most of whom don't care who owns a park as long as their experience is clean, fun and safe. He hopes JANA recognizes Six Flags, and the industry in general, as \"the last real bastion of family fun in the United States, in fact globally, where a family can go as a total unit. And I hope they put their capital behind that and lift it out of the ashes where it is now.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5581432","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"10:39:00-04:00","title":"Boston bar stirs outrage with its mobster mugshots as decor","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Savin Bar + Kitchen in Boston's Dorchester neighborhood has become the center of a public controversy after installing framed mugshots of notorious mobsters James 'Whitey' Bulger and Stephen 'The Rifleman' Flemmi as part of its décor.

October 24, 2025 • 10:39 AM EDT \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         BOSTON — File this one under \" Boston bar fight .\" But it's not your typical brawl over a jealous boyfriend or a spilled beer. This dust-up is about décor, and at the center of the trouble are some of Boston's most notorious mobsters: James \"Whitey\" Bulger, now deceased, and his partner in crime, Stephen \"The Rifleman\" Flemmi, now serving life behind bars. The place is the Savin Bar + Kitchen, in Boston's Dorchester neighborhood, where immediately inside the front door, patrons are greeted by a larger-than-life framed mugshot of Bulger — the mob-boss, murderer, bank robber, drug dealer and extortionist — peering cooly out from under his fedora. \"Funny enough, a lot of people have said, 'Oh, he's very good looking,\" says Savin co-owner Kenneth Osherow. But that's exactly what's making many locals upset. They see the décor as glamorizing and glorifying Bulger and the other gangsters. The restaurant, they say, should not be serving up such an unsavory slice of the city's past. \"Why would you promote the people who are thugs and murderers and everything else,\" muses Teddy Ryan, an older man sipping wine at the bar. It's especially appalling at  this  place, Ryan says, that used to be a bar owned by Eddie Connors, who was one of Bulger's and Flemmi's victims. Connors was shot to death in a phone booth down the road. \"I was very close to Eddie,\" Ryan says. \"And these [photos] are guys who killed him, so yeah, it offends me. Of course it does.\" Connors' family feels the same way. \"Take that f****** thing down,\" says his son, Timmy Connors, who was a baby when his father was murdered by the guy whose image hangs in a gold frame on the wall. \"We all know what [Bulger] did, he killed women, innocent people. He was a rat. Who would want someone like Whitey hanging in their place?\" The pictures went up in the bar last spring with little objection, but complaints rapidly escalated in recent weeks. What started with conversation at a community meeting intensified online and in real life. Osherow says he and the staff have endured threatening emails and scary, in-your-face confrontations. Server Josh Garner says he was accosted last week by an angry man. \"He definitely came in hot, swearing and stuff, and saying his friends were murdered by [those gangsters],\" Garner recalls. He says the man finally left after warning him '[the pictures] better be down by Tuesday. We're coming back.' \" But so far, Savin's owners have refused to take down the mobster photos, insisting they're not glorifying gangsters, they're only reflecting Boston's gritty, gory and well-known past. \"People are definitely overreacting,\" Osherow says. He says he and the staff feel misunderstood and unfairly targeted, in no small part, they say, because they actually had nothing to do with choosing or installing the mob-themed décor. Instead, it was all the doing of the restaurant makeover show  Secret Service  starring celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay, who surprised Savin with the makeover last April. \"Savin Bar + Kitchen desperately needed a new and coherent identity, so our renovation team have gone in to give them one,\" Ramsey intones in the episode that aired in August. After the transformation's big reveal, Ramsey admires the bar's new decor. \"It's got that old 1970 mobster feel,\" he says. \"Finally, [Savin] has an identity. There's nothing like this in this neighborhood, so this should stand out for all the right reasons.\" Or course, it didn't quite turn out that way. Some have likened the controversy surrounding Savin's display of old-time mobsters to the debate swirling around old statues of Confederate generals. But Osherow insists it's not at all analogous. \"If you put up a statue in a park, let's say, you do that because it's a famous person that you want to glorify. It's a given. You're trying to say that's a good person,\" he says. \"Our pictures were not put up to say that these people were good people or that they were heroes. It's very obvious that they were bad people and criminals. They're  mug shots !\" To underscore the point, Osherow wrote up a page-long explanation and taped it right onto Bulger's picture shortly after it was hung last spring. \"This isn't an homage,\" the note reads. \"We display this photo  not  to celebrate [these mobsters] but to acknowledge a chapter in the complex, gritty history of our neighborhood [and the bar that] was a front-row seat to a notorious era in Boston's underworld […] By recognizing this past we remember where we've been and how far we've come.\" The note also includes links to more history. Savin's general manager, Angelique Johnson, agrees that it would be wrong to simply erase or ignore history, whether it's about the Boston mob or, she says, the many streets and schools in Boston named for slaveowners. \"We can't change that because that's history,\" she says. \"It's all very painful, but that is how we learn. That's how we make sure it doesn't get repeated. I don't want to erase history at all. Kids in this generation need to know what happened.\" In any case, Savin is certainly not alone in leaning into the city's sordid past. Along with the countless books and movies, there is plenty of mobster merch on the market – from T-shirts to trading cards, as well as popular mobster tours. One in Boston is called \"Lobsters and Mobsters,\" another has been dubbed \"Mobsters Mayhem and Murder,\" and yet another promises tourists will visit \"the exact spot where men and women were shot down, butchered, and buried in cold blood.\" It's a continuous source of fascination in Boston and beyond. And even at Savin bar, there are plenty of fans of the mobster photos. \"What's wrong with them? I think it looks nice,\" says Sheree Hagler, sharing oysters at the bar with a friend. \"It to me is décor. This is just a vibe, and it is what it is,\" she says. \"I don't think it's even that serious. I mean everyone in this world today is just too sensitive.\" But Savin's owners are growing weary of the fight and are now considering a change. One idea is to simply replace the mobster photos with pictures of some locals-done-good. The running list includes everyone from actor Mark Wahlberg to the founder of the nation's first animal rescue league. Gordon Ramsay's show did not respond to requests for comment, but Savin's owners say Ramsay's team is also now eager to put an end to the controversy — they're offering to come swap out the photos, no charge. \n         \n         Transcript \n         ADRIAN FLORIDO, HOST:   File this one under Boston bar fight, but it's not a brawl started by a jealous boyfriend or a spilled beer. This is a case of the bar itself in a slugfest over its decor. As NPR's Tovia Smith reports, some locals say they are offended by the photos of notorious gangsters like Whitey Bulger. TOVIA SMITH, BYLINE: At Savin Bar and Kitchen, he greets you immediately inside the front door. KEN OSHEROW: So here is the piece. SMITH: Oh, it's right here. OSHEROW: Yeah. SMITH: A larger-than-life, black-and-white framed mug shot of a young James Whitey Bulger, the mob boss, murderer, bank robber, drug dealer and extortionist staring out from under his fedora. It's definitely eye-catching says Savin co-owner Ken Osherow. OSHEROW: Funny enough, a lot of people have said, oh, he's very good-looking. SMITH: That's part of the problem to those who see the print as glamorizing Bulger and the other gangsters pictured around the restaurant, including his partner-in-crime, Stephen The Rifleman Flemmi. The restaurant, many neighbors say, should not be serving up such an unsavory slice of the city's past. TEDDY RYAN: Well, why would you promote these people who are thugs and murderers and everything else? SMITH: Especially here, says Teddy Ryan, an older man sipping wine at the bar. This very place used to be a bar owned by Eddie Connors, one of Bulger and Flemmi's victims. He was shot to death in a phone booth down the road. RYAN: I was very close to Eddie. And these are the guys who killed him. So yeah, it offends me. Of course it does. TIMMY CONNORS: Take that [expletive] thing down. SMITH: That's Eddie Connors' son, Timmy Connors, who was a baby when his father was murdered by the guy whose image is now in a gold frame on the wall. CONNORS: We all know what he did - killed women, innocent people. He was a rat. Who would want someone like Whitey hanging in their place? SMITH: But so far, Savin's owners have refused to take down the photos, insisting they're not glorifying the gangsters. They're only reflecting Boston's gritty, gory and well-known past. OSHEROW: People are definitely overreacting. SMITH: Co-owner Osherow says the blowback has been intense, with threatening emails and scary in-your-face confrontations. It's all left the staff rattled and feeling unfairly targeted because, among other things, they did not select the mob theme decor. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"SECRET SERVICE\") GORDON RAMSAY: Savin Bar and Kitchen desperately needed a new and coherent identity. SMITH: It was all done this past spring by the restaurant makeover show \"Secret Service\"... (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"SECRET SERVICE\") UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Oh. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Oh, my God. SMITH: ...With celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"SECRET SERVICE\") RAMSAY: It's got the old 1970 mobster feel. SMITH: Some have compared those mobster displays to old statues of confederate generals, but Osherow says it's not at all analogous. OSHEROW: Our pictures were not put up to say that these people were good people. It's very obvious that they're bad people and criminals, OK? They're mugshots. SMITH: To drive the point home, a page-long explanation taped right on Bulger's picture explains, quote, \"this is not an homage.\" It's just meant to acknowledge the spot's unique history. And for sure, there are fans of the Savin Bar's mobster photos. SHEREE HAGLER: Why? What's wrong with them? I think it looks nice. SMITH: Like Sheree Hagler, sharing oysters with a friend at the bar. HAGLER: It, to me, is decor. This is just a vibe. Everybody in this world today is a little too sensitive. SMITH: Still, the owners are tiring of the fight and now considering a change. One idea is to simply replace the mobsters with some locals, like actor Mark Wahlberg. Gordon Ramsay's show did not respond to requests for comment, but his team seems just as eager to put all this to rest, the bar says. They're offering to come swap out the photos no charge.

Scientists find clues in DNA from fallen soldiers' teeth \n         By Ari Daniel \n        \n           Friday, October 24, 2025 • 11:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         By 1812, Napoleon was all powerful. Nearly all of Europe was under his control. He had succeeded in forbidding most of the continent from trading with Britain in an effort to bring the island nation to heel. And he was married to Marie Louise, daughter of the emperor of Austria, a major superpower at the time. (The dazzling emerald and diamond necklace that he gifted her when they were wed was one of the objects stolen in last weekend's  heist at the Louvre .) But the Russian Empire had been resisting his efforts to cut off all trade with Britain. That summer, he ordered his army, some 600,000 strong, to invade Russia. It would prove to be a terrible decision. \"This is one of the most infamous military campaigns in the last centuries,\" says  Nicolás Rascovan , the head of the microbial paleogenomics unit at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. \"He believed that he was going to be able to conquer the whole world, more or less. It was probably the beginning of the end.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In October, Napoleon called his soldiers back after barely engaging the Russian army. It wasn't a defeat, but it was no win either. And during the march home, winter arrived early. \"They started to die of cold, hunger, and also infectious diseases,\" says Rascovan. All told, hundreds of thousands perished. And in a new study published in the journal  Current Biology , Rascovan and his colleagues say those diseases likely include two unexpected pathogens that would have helped hasten the soldiers' demise. Combined with earlier work, it's become clear that these men were under microbial assault on all fronts. \"These wars were anything but glamorous,\" says  Michaela Binder , a bioarchaeologist with Novetus, an archaeology company based in Vienna, who wasn't involved in the study. \"For some of them, the death in battle would have been a relief.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       A rich and bloody history, reconstructed Typhus and trench fever have long been thought to be among the afflictions that Napoleon's soldiers suffered. This is based on a mix of historical accounts, the discovery of body lice on the remains of soldiers (which carried the pathogens that transmitted the ailments), and  DNA analyses  conducted nearly a decade ago. But molecular techniques have improved dramatically since then. And so a pair of archaeologists asked Rascovan, who studies the DNA of ancient pathogens, to see what other afflictions he might be able to turn up in the remains of a mass grave in Lithuania. The site had been discovered accidentally during a construction project in one the northern suburbs of Vilnius in 2001. Two-to-three thousand of Napoleon's men had been buried there soon after they died. \"Europe has such a rich history that we have archaeological sites pretty much everywhere,\" says Rascovan. \"So you dig a hole in the ground and then you find something.\" Among the remains that the archaeologists had unearthed were 13 teeth, each from a different soldier. These teeth would have had blood flowing through their interiors long ago. \"If you have DNA of the pathogen in the blood because you have an infection, that DNA can get into the tooth,\" explains Rascovan. \"So then it's kind of a time machine in which you can really see the blood of the individual back then.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Only after decontaminating the teeth, grinding them into a powder, and dissolving the bone dust could the ancient DNA be studied. But naturally, that genetic code was in rough shape. It consisted of super short fragments that had undergone chemical changes. Rascovan sequenced all of it. Some of the genetic material came from the soldiers themselves. Some of it derived from organisms in the soil in which they were buried. And some of it — perhaps — was from pathogens that helped kill these men. \"Once we have a huge list of all the different things that have been detected, we try to find which are the species that match a human pathogen,\" he says. \"It's like doing a puzzle.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       'A story of hardship' After Rascovan and his team finished that puzzle, they had two hits. Both of them were bacteria: one that caused paratyphoid fever and the other relapsing fever, a pathogen transmitted by body lice that dated back to the Iron Age. \"This paper shows clearly how complex these types of analyses are and the extreme level of skill required to work with these types of data,\" says  Leslie Quade , a paleopathologist at the Austrian Archaeological Institute who didn't participate in the research. She says that discerning the emergence, spread, and evolution of diseases in the past can also help us navigate the pathogens of today. \"Understanding how certain types of pathogens developed can give us a better chance of anticipating what a pathogen's next step might be,\" says Quade. In addition, if a certain once-widespread pathogen has become rare today, these infection-laden historical events may offer lessons to learn to keep it from returning and to contain other similar modern pathogens. These findings are another reminder that war has always been ugly, Binder says. \"We have these paintings in the museums of soldiers in shiny armors, of Napoleon on his horse, fit young men marching into battle.\" \"But in the end, when we look at the human remains, we see an entirely different picture,\" she says. It's a picture of lifelong malnutrition, broken feet from marching too far, too quickly, and bodies riddled with disease. \"Their bones tell a story of hardship,\" says Binder. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-95069","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"12:31:00-04:00","title":"Blue Jays rout Dodgers 11-4 in World Series opener","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the opening game of the 2025 World Series, the Toronto Blue Jays defeated the defending champion Los Angeles Dodgers 11-4, with a historic performance including Addison Barger hitting the first pinch-hit grand slam in World Series history and a nine-run sixth inning fueled by multiple home runs.

October 25, 2025 • 12:31 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         TORONTO — Addison Barger launched the first pinch-hit grand slam in World Series history, Alejandro Kirk added a two-run homer in a nine-run sixth inning and the Toronto Blue Jays overwhelmed the defending champion Los Angeles Dodgers 11-4 in the opener Friday night. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"That's the epitome of our offense,\" said Blue Jays third baseman Ernie Clement, who laced a tiebreaking single in the sixth. \"It's a collective effort and everybody just doing their job.\" Daulton Varsho started Toronto's comeback from a 2-0 deficit with a two-run drive in the fourth off two-time Cy Young Award winner Blake Snell. \"I've faced him before plenty of times. He's obviously dominated me,\" Varsho said. \"It's one of those guys where you've got to get your best swing off and whatever happens, happens.\" The longball barrage was fitting as the Fall Classic returned to Toronto for the first time since 1993, when Joe Carter hit the second walk-off homer to end a World Series. And in an unusual tie to that night 32 years ago, Varsho is named after Darren Daulton, the Philadelphia Phillies catcher Mitch Williams was throwing to when Carter connected. Shohei Ohtani hit his first Series home run for the heavily favored Dodgers, seeking to become the first repeat champion since the New York Yankees took three titles in a row from 1998-2000. Los Angeles was trailing by nine when he went deep off Braydon Fisher for a two-run shot in the seventh, his fourth homer in two games. Fans angry that Ohtani spurned the Blue Jays to sign a $700 million contract with the Dodgers in December 2023 chanted: \"We don't need you!\" when he came to the plate in the ninth. \"Don't poke the bear,\" Toronto pitcher Chris Bassitt said. Game 2 in the best-of-seven series is at Rogers Centre on Saturday night. \"They bring it every night,\" Clement said, referring to Blue Jays fans. \"The last few months, honestly, they've been selling this place out and giving us a ton of energy. We're lucky to have these fans.\" Playing after a one-week layoff following its National League Championship Series sweep, Los Angeles took a 2-0 lead against 22-year-old rookie Trey Yesavage on RBI singles by Kiké Hernández in the second and Will Smith in the third. Yesavage made his fourth postseason start — one more than his regular-season career total. At 22 years, 88 days old he became the second-youngest pitcher to start a World Series opener behind Brooklyn's Ralph Branca at 21 years, 267 days in 1947 at Yankee Stadium. Yesavage made some key pitches during his four innings, leaving the bases loaded in the second by retiring Ohtani on a groundout and stranding a runner at third the next inning when he struck out Max Muncy. Seranthony Domínguez got the win with 1 1/3 hitless innings. Varsho's homer was the first off Snell by a left-handed hitter since Juan Soto connected for the Yankees on June 2 last year. Snell gave up a career-high five hits on changeups and allowed five runs, eight hits and three walks in five-plus innings. \"Blake just didn't have good fastball command,\" Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. \"There were just a couple bad walks in there.\" Snell pitched in the Series for the first time since 2020 with Tampa Bay, when he was removed in the sixth inning of Game 6 while pitching a shutout against the Dodgers. Los Angeles rallied against the Rays' bullpen for its first championship since 1988. Now the Dodgers are chasing their third title in six years. Coming off a seven-game ALCS against Seattle that ended Monday, Toronto got 14 hits and key contributions from Bo Bichette and Varsho, who combined with Vladimir Guerrero Jr. to become the first trio of sons of former major leaguers to start for one team in a Series game. Returning from a sprained left knee that had sidelined him since Sept. 6, Bichette played second base for the first time in six years and favored the knee. He singled in the first, ranged to the left side of the infield to field a grounder and save a run, then with the score 2-2 drew a full-count walk from Snell starting the sixth. Twelve batters went to the plate in the inning. Clement singled off reliever Emmet Sheehan for a 3-2 lead, pinch-hitter Nathan Lukes drew a bases-loaded walk and Andrés Giménez added an RBI single. Barger greeted left-hander Anthony Banda with a 413-foot drive to right-center on a hanging slider to put Toronto ahead 9-2. \"Just a blackout moment. Just crazy,\" Barger said. \"I was choking up a little bit, just trying to put the ball in the air and get a run in.\" Kirk, who singled off the right-field wall a pitch before Varsho's homer, added his fourth home run of the postseason. \"We just didn't make pitches when we need to to keep that game close,\" Roberts said. \"We need to be better.\" Up next Dodgers RHP Yoshinobu Yamamoto and Blue Jays RHP Kevin Gausman start Saturday night. Yamamoto won Game 2 of the Series last year, allowing one run and one hit over 6 1/3 innings in a 4-2 victory over the Yankees and is coming off the first postseason complete game in eight years, a three-hitter against the Milwaukee Brewers. Gausman will be making his Series debut. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5582259","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"09:09:00-04:00","title":"Boo to spooky chocolate prices!

It's the year of chewy, fruity Halloween treats \n         By Alina Selyukh \n        \n           Updated Friday, October 24, 2025 • 9:09 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         NPR's series  Cost of Living: The Price We Pay  is examining what's driving price increases and how people are coping after years of stubborn inflation. How are higher prices changing the way you live? Fill out  this form  to share your story with NPR. What's the item? Candy How has the price changed since before the pandemic? The price of chewing gum and candy has risen 39%   since February 2020, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  Why has the price gone up?  The cost of chocolate's main ingredient — cocoa — has nearly doubled since the beginning of last year, hitting historic records  again  and  again . That's because harvests of cocoa have come up short for three years straight. The vast majority of the world's cocoa beans grow in West Africa, where farmers have dealt with  extreme weather , changing climate patterns and disease in their aging trees. What are people doing about it?  All the major chocolate brands have raised their prices, including Nestlé, Lindt, Hershey and Mars, which makes M&Ms, Snickers and Twix. And they're resorting to tricks to make their treats, says David Branch, who tracks the cocoa market at Wells Fargo's Agri-Food Institute. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"We're seeing a lot more fillers going in,\" Branch says. \"They're putting more nuts, less chocolate, keeping the price the same, just reducing the amount of cocoa cost.\" Reese's makes a Halloween-themed peanut butter cup called \"White Ghost\" that's dipped in \"white creme\" instead of chocolate. KitKat's Halloween flavors include cinnamony \"Ghost Toast\" and marshmallowy green-colored \"Witch's Brew,\" both very light on cocoa. And shoppers like Stephanie Espinosa are noticing another tactic. \"The bags for chocolate are definitely smaller now and there's less pieces,\" says Espinosa, whose town of Babcock Ranch, Fla., takes Halloween  very  seriously, with palm trees sprouting glowing eyeballs and ghosts haunting yards and porches. Shrinkflation has taken a gnarly bite out of Espinosa's budget, as she and her husband — in their best pirate chic — expect to \"Ahoy!\" at hundreds of trick-or-treaters. At that scale, chocolate prices hit with much more of a fright. And many shoppers feel that way. Enter: gummy, sour, fruity options. \"The mixed bags are definitely — you can see that there's less of the chocolate pieces in the mixes and more like SweeTARTS or gummies or things like that,\" says Espinosa, who begrudgingly switched to more affordable Tootsie Roll bags for this Halloween. Sales of non-chocolate candy have been growing  much faster  than those of chocolate in recent years. Retail data firm Circana finds that people are still spending more dollars on chocolate treats, but they're buying fewer of them. Overall, Halloween is still a splurgy holiday. The National Retail Federation  forecasts  that spending might surpass the 2023 record with an estimated $114.45 per shopper, as people see the higher prices but choose to let the ghoul times roll. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5577963","dateOfPublication":"2024-04-24","timeOfPublication":"20:15:23.000Z","title":"The Evolving Role of the Judiciary in the Digital Age","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The legal system continues to adapt to the changing landscape of society and technology.

He describes the iconic scene where the monster first lurches into the doorway as nothing short of \"an epiphany.\"   \"I saw the resurrection of the flesh, the immaculate conception, ecstasy, stigmata. Everything made sense,\" del Toro says. \"I understood my faith or my dogmas better through  Frankenstein  than through Sunday mass.\"  It was then, at age 7, that del Toro decided the creature of  Frankenstein  would be \"my personal avatar and my personal messiah,\" he says.  Del Toro's film credits include  Pan's Labyrinth , Nightmare Alley  and  The Shape of Water,  which won four Oscars, including best picture and best director. Now, with  Frankenstein , he reimagines Mary Shelley's 1818 classic, telling the final part of the story from the creature's point of view. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Some of the film's themes echo ideas del Toro's explored throughout his career, including misunderstood creatures, men who behave like monsters and science experiments gone awry. A self-described \"groupie for death,\" del Toro's also interested in the allure — and the torment — of everlasting life. \"I'm a huge fan of death. ... I think it's the metronome of our existence,\" he says. \"Without rhythm, there is no melody, you know? It is the metronome of death that makes us value the compass of the beautiful music.\" Interview highlights On designing a creature that looked nothing like the original Frankenstein \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       It has a very Byronian, very doomed, very  Wuthering Heights  sort of look of a doomed hero. And when he's first born, and is bald and almost naked, I wanted it to feel like an anatomical chart, like something newly minted. ... The head is patterned after phrenology manuals from the 1800s. So they have very elegant, almost aerodynamic lines. I wanted this alabaster or marble, statue feel, so it feels like a newly minted human being. And we also tried to make it the way I remember the Jesus images, life size, in the churches of my childhood. On getting over his fear of death when he was younger As a young man, my grandmother and I had a very precarious sense of death and life. My grandmother would say good night to me every day and say, \"Let us pray that I'm here tomorrow.\" And that is pretty intense for a 4 or 5 year old to hear. Sometimes I would sleep at the foot of her bed and I would be listening in the dark for her breathing. And if the breathing ceased, even for two seconds, I would be jolted and take a look to see if she was OK. And that stayed with me for many decades.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       I don't fear that anymore. I feel losing people, yes, but me, I'm not afraid of dying. … Right when the lights flutter and you are no longer a director or a general or a pope — right when you become just you and and the lights are flickering out that's when you realize what you did or didn't do in your life and that's the most momentous thing anyone can experience and you can go with great agitation or great peace. On how his life changed after his father won the lottery in 1969 when he was 5 We moved into a house and lived a very sort of strange life. I mean, we had all sorts of pets. We had eagles, a pet lion, 30 dogs, deer. … We had a zoo. Like Danny in  The Shining , I could go on my tricycle for hours in the long corridors sometimes, like a magic realism novel. I would go for weeks without seeing a single adult. I would find food on the fridge, I would find clean clothes on my drawers, and I didn't interact with many adults. I was existing in a mysterious life in an enchanted castle. … One of the things [my father] did is he bought a library and filled it with books that he never read, but I read them all. And that's where I read the encyclopedia of anatomy and health, and that's where I read all the classics,  Moby Dick, Tom Sawyer, Huckleberry Finn , Edgar Allan [Poe], Oscar Wilde. On generative AI My concern is not artificial intelligence, but natural stupidity. I think that's what drives most of the world's worst features. But I did want it to have the arrogance of Victor [Frankenstein] be similar in some ways to the tech bros. He's kind of blind, creating something without considering the consequences and I think we have to take a pause and consider where we're going. ... AI, particularly generative AI — I am not interested, nor will I ever be interested. I'm 61, and I hope to be able to remain uninterested in using it at all until I croak. ... The other day, somebody wrote me an email, said, \"What is your stance on AI?\" And my answer was very short. I said, \"I'd rather die.\"  On the current  ICE crackdowns  in LA I have a wallet the size of a leather portfolio and I always carry my papers. I have been stopped in the past and asked to show my papers in the past, and asked pointed questions in the past, pulled aside in immigration in the past. So I have all my papers with me at all times and it is a very difficult time when there is no voice for the other. And I think that understanding that the other is you is crucial.

The great filmmaker Guillermo del Toro has written and directed a new reimagining of \"Frankenstein.\" It takes inspiration from the 1931 film \"Frankenstein,\" one of the first, best and most enduring horror monster films, but mostly from Mary Shelley's 1818 novel, \"Frankenstein,\" which many consider to be the first science fiction book. She was only 18 when she wrote it. In del Toro's movie, the final part of the story is told from the creature's point of view. Some of the themes of his new film echo themes that he's been obsessed with for years - misunderstood creatures, men who behave like monsters, father-son relationships, religion, empathy, cruelty, misguided scientific experiments that take a terrible turn and what del Toro describes as the uneasy truce between science and religion, machine and man, and the realization that you are inescapably alone. His other movies include, \"Pan's Labyrinth,\" \"The Shape Of Water,\" which won four Oscars, including best picture and best director, \"Nightmare Alley,\" a reimagining of \"Pinocchio\" filmed in stop-motion animation and two \"Hellboy\" films. In del Toro's \"Frankenstein,\" Oscar Isaac plays Dr. Victor Frankenstein, the surgeon who wants to create new life - a new man built out of body parts from the newly dead. The creature he creates is played by Jacob Elordi, who's best known for co-starring in \"Euphoria\" and also played Elvis Presley in the Sofia Coppola movie \"Priscilla.\" Del Toro grew up in Guadalajara, Mexico, and lives in LA. Guillermo del Toro, welcome to FRESH AIR. Congratulations on your new film, which brings together so much of your other work. And I know it's a dream come true for you to do your own version of \"Frankenstein.\" You first saw the movie - the 1931 movie, which is totally different from the book and your new movie, but that movie really had a hold on you. Tell us why it had such meaning for you. GUILLERMO DEL TORO: Well, it was, curiously enough, on a Sunday after Catholic Mass. We came back home, and then we would watch horror movies on Channel 6 all day. And it was the first time I saw \"Frankenstein.\" And the moment Boris Karloff crossed the threshold, I have an epiphany. I have a St. Paul on the road to Damascus kind of experience. I realized I understood my faith or my dogmas better through \"Frankenstein\" than through Sunday Mass. I saw the resurrection of the flesh, the immaculate conception, ecstasy, you know, stigmata. Everything made sense. And I decided at age 7 that the creature of Frankenstein was going to be my personal avatar and my personal messiah. It was a really profound transformation, and it made an impression that lasted my whole life. GROSS: Can you compare how you saw the story as a 7-year-old to how you see it now? DEL TORO: Well, I saw it as a son when I saw it first, and now I see it as a father. And more poignantly, I have become my father whilst trying to run away from the same mistakes of absence or, you know, mysterious emotions that I couldn't figure out as a kid. And I had a really profound moment to be able to reconcile this knowledge with a beautiful talk with my own kids and stop this lineage of pains. And, you know, fathers are a big shadow, particularly in Latin American families, I imagine. GROSS: What's the pain you're referring to... DEL TORO: You know, the... GROSS: ...When talking about your relationship with your father? DEL TORO: It is - my father was always a mystery, and he was really funny and warm. But by turns, he was also aloof and distant and had a lot of problem. Even, you know, when he came back from the kidnapping - he was taken 72 days, and I said, I'm going to get to know him real well. And our conversations never lasted more than a few minutes, you know? And he just couldn't, and I didn't understand that. And I realized that particularly with my profession, I have a huge alibi to repeat this distance. And I unfortunately couldn't either leave on time to really change it and become a very dedicated father. GROSS: You mentioned the kidnapping. He was kidnapped and held for a million-dollar ransom. DEL TORO: Yeah. GROSS: And you managed to get the money... DEL TORO: Yeah. GROSS: ...To pay the kidnappers... DEL TORO: Yeah. GROSS: ...And rescue your father. DEL TORO: Yes. GROSS: And that's - my understanding is that's why you moved to the U.S. - because... DEL TORO: Yeah. GROSS: ...Of death threats. DEL TORO: Yeah. Well, it was the constant threat and the PTSD, et cetera. But a lot of the moments that happened during that kidnapping are actually obliquely reflected in the film. I tried to make it an autobiography of the soul for me. GROSS: There's three parts of the movie. There's the introduction. DEL TORO: Yes. GROSS: Then there's the story told pretty much from Dr. Frankenstein's point of view. And then the final part is told from the creature's point of view. DEL TORO: Yes. GROSS: I really wanted to read Mary Shelley's novel, which I've never read, before speaking to you again. DEL TORO: Yeah. GROSS: And I wasn't able to find the time to do it. DEL TORO: Yes. GROSS: I did, however, read your introduction to, like - I think it's a 2021 annotated version of... DEL TORO: Yes. GROSS: ...Her novel. But anyways, in Mary Shelley's original telling of the story, is there a chapter that's from the creature's point of view, or is that just something you wanted to do? DEL TORO: No, no, no, it is. And there are so many things that are in the novel. You know, that is one of them. When the creature meets Victor in the frozen North, he says, well, this is what happened to me. And he proceeds to tell him his itinerary of degradation and humanization and learning the language with the family of the hermit. You know, all of that is in the novel, but it's been rarely articulated. And I found that hinging the movie in the middle was structurally the best way to make the audience almost get a jolt and say, oh, I've never seen this before. Even if it's been dramatized briefly in other versions, this is the one that tracks the creature in a distinct chapter. It starts in the frozen North and is very discreet in color. Then you have childhood and young age of Victor, which is idealized and very heightened visually by the fact that Victor is telling the story. And then the fairy tale, like... GROSS: I'm glad you said fairy tale. DEL TORO: Yeah. Yeah. GROSS: 'Cause it seems - that seems to me like the part from Dr. Frankenstein's point of view, you know, has elements of, like, horror film... DEL TORO: Yes. GROSS: ...And monster film. DEL TORO: Yeah. GROSS: But the second part, it's set in the woods. DEL TORO: Yeah. GROSS: It's like a fairy tale. DEL TORO: In that little cabin. GROSS: Yeah. And the old blind man, it's kind of a very fairy tale... DEL TORO: Yes. GROSS: ...Benevolent character. DEL TORO: Yes. GROSS: There are spirits in the woods, and... DEL TORO: And he's guided. The creature is guided by all sorts of animals into understanding the world. GROSS: Yeah. And the blind old hermit thinks that - because he can't see, he doesn't see the monster that... DEL TORO: Yeah. GROSS: ...Other people see. And in fact, he thinks the creature is the spirit of the woods. DEL TORO: Yes. And that was very important to me, that the three chapters were very distinct in style and very distinct in energy. The camerawork is very different. The color palette is very different. And I think that I would say, having seen most every version of \"Frankenstein\" on film, this is very unique. The scale of the movie, both being epic and intimate, is very unique. But the fairy tale breadth of it all and the parable - it feels like a parable of the prodigal father, I'd say, jokingly. GROSS: Are you trying to interpret Frankenstein? People always call the monster Frankenstein. DEL TORO: Yeah. That's a mistake that came... GROSS: Yeah, that's... DEL TORO: ...From a play, yeah. GROSS: Yeah. So are you trying to compare the creature in \"Frankenstein\" to Jesus? DEL TORO: I think so. I mean, I think the parallels are very, very curious. I triangulate the creature with Jesus and Pinocchio. GROSS: Yeah, in your version of Pinocchio, and I don't know if this is in other stories or in the original fairy tale, Geppetto, who creates the puppet, Pinocchio, also has built or carved, I should say, a huge depiction of... DEL TORO: Jesus. GROSS: ...Jesus being crucified. DEL TORO: Yeah. GROSS: And for the church. DEL TORO: Yeah, no, that's completely original, too. GROSS: That's original? DEL TORO: Yes. To me, the myths are very related. The two biggest mysteries in the Bible for me growing up - and I am a lapsed Catholic. But the two mysteries were the Book of Job, in which man questions God, why do bad things happen to good people? And the answer, basically, of God is, why not? (LAUGHTER) DEL TORO: You know? GROSS: It's very comforting the way you put it (laughter). DEL TORO: Well, that's the way God put it. He says, who are you to question my wisdom? You were not there when I created the world, basically. GROSS: When we talked a few years ago, you mentioned that your grandmother, who was very Catholic. DEL TORO: Very. GROSS: Exorcised you. And not exercise, but as an exorcism. She exorcised you twice. DEL TORO: Yeah, with the Holy Water, yeah. GROSS: Did you feel like people saw you as unholy and a sacrilege in the same way that people see the creature in \"Frankenstein\"? DEL TORO: Yeah, in so many ways, yeah. GROSS: And even Pinocchio. DEL TORO: Yeah. GROSS: When Pinocchio is kind of rowdy in church because he's never been there before, he doesn't understand what church is, the people in the church call him unholy and a sacrilege. DEL TORO: Well, you know, I'm very used to not fitting. I'm always looking through the window into the world, you know, a little bit with a set of thoughts and a set of principles and ideas that don't necessarily conform. So my grandmother was in great pain that I would draw monsters all day. I would talk about the Bible, asking questions that were maybe too poignant. You know, but we loved each other. And that is salient in my movies. No matter how different we were, we can love each other. And that is, again, in \"Frankenstein.\" There's \"Frankenstein\" in all my movies from \"Cronos\" all the way to \"Pinocchio.\" Every single movie. I hesitate to think of one that doesn't have elements of it. GROSS: Well, let me reintroduce you. If you're just joining us, my guest is filmmaker Guillermo del Toro. His new film is the reimagining of \"Frankenstein,\" and it's called \"Frankenstein.\" We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with filmmaker Guillermo del Toro. He wrote and directed the new film \"Frankenstein,\" a new interpretation of the story inspired by Mary Shelley's 1818 novel. He also loves the 1931 film, which starred Boris Karloff as the creature. He first saw it when he was 7. You could say in some ways that, like, the creature in \"Frankenstein\" is like artificial intelligence, because he's created by man but then lives on its own and can destroy man, you know, without even understanding quite what he's doing. So what are your thoughts about AI? And did that kind of inform the movie in any way? DEL TORO: It did and it didn't. It didn't in the sense that my concern is not artificial intelligence, but natural stupidity. I think that's what drives most of the world's worst teachers. But I did want to have the arrogance of Victor be similar in some ways to the tech bros, you know? He's kind of blind, creating something without considering the consequences, you know? And I think we have to take a pause and consider where we're going. If you have to teach an AI to think in ones and zeros - you know, oh, my God, I would love for a generation to get raising kids right one time, one time. In the entire history of mankind, there hasn't been a single generation that was raised right all across the globe. And I think that's our biggest failure in a way, you know? Ones and zeros don't get the alchemy that you get with emotion and experience. You get the information, but you don't get the alchemy of emotion, spirituality and feeling. I'm not saying it's impossible to replicate. But we have it readily available with the next generation of children. And that's why the painful thing that Jacob Elordi and Victor enact is a father and son relationship that is very relatable in the film, very relatable and very moving by the end. GROSS: Did you take advantage of any AI in making Frankenstein? DEL TORO: AI, particularly generative AI, I am not interested, nor will I ever be interested. I'm 61, and I hope to be able to remain uninterested in using it at all until I croak. GROSS: (Laughter). DEL TORO: I really don't. The other day, somebody wrote me an email, said, what is your stance on AI? And my answer was very short. I said, I'd rather die. GROSS: Oh, those are strong words. DEL TORO: Not for me. I'm Mexican. I think... GROSS: (Laughter). DEL TORO: But I think, Terry, that even when a human sings a song that has already been recorded six, seven times, they're filtering their experience, their life. I often think of, you know, Johnny Cash singing \"Hurt,\" the Trent Reznor song, and making it entirely his own. Or Joe Cocker singing the Beatles. You know, that's not a version. That's not remixing. That is filtering through alchemical pain and experience a work of art into making it your own. GROSS: The creature in \"Frankenstein\" is endowed with eternal life in your film. DEL TORO: Yes. Cursed, cursed. GROSS: Well, that's what I was going to ask you. What do you think about - you know, his eternal life is hell. The creature is alone. And he wants to end his tormented life, but he can't. There's no one in the world who's like him, and Dr. Frankenstein refuses to make a companion for him. And the creature says, there was only one remedy for pain - death. And you took that away from me too. After the creature survived something that other people assume would've killed him, he says, there was silence and then merciless life. I felt lonelier than ever. So when you think of eternal life, do you think that that's torment? DEL TORO: Oh, I do. I'm a huge fan of death. GROSS: (Laughter). DEL TORO: I'm a groupie for death. I think it's the metronome of our existence. And without rhythm, there is no melody, you know? It is the metronome of death that makes us value the compass of the beautiful music, you know? I'm going to say, this comes - when my father was taken, every day was torment, and I used to see the sun rising and resent it. And I said, the sun doesn't care about my pain. But then eventually, I realized it was my pain that didn't care about the sun and that I needed to change that, that I needed to accept it. I needed to understand that the rhythm of the cosmos is different than that of my little heart, you know? GROSS: You mentioned the fear of death every day that your father was held hostage - kidnapped for ransom. Of course, you'd be worried about death then. I mean, it was the threat of death hanging over him, and his life was in your hands to save. Putting that aside, as major as that is, did you have a fear of death growing up and as a... DEL TORO: Yes. GROSS: ...Young man? DEL TORO: Yes, as a young man. And my grandmother and I had a very precarious sense of death and life. My grandmother would say goodnight to me every day and say, let us pray that I'm here tomorrow. And that is very - that is pretty intense for a 4 or 5-year-old to hear. And I would spend - sometimes I would sleep at the foot of her bed, and I would be listening in the dark for her breathing. And if the breathing ceased even for two seconds, I would be jolted and take a look to see if she was OK. And that stayed with me for many decades. It's - I don't fear it anymore. I don't fear that anymore. I fear losing people, yes, but me, I'm not afraid of dying, I hope. You know, really, Terry, all these great questions, you know, when they get resolved? Right when the lights flutter and you are no longer a director or a general or a pope. Right when you become just you and the lights are flickering out, that's when you realize what you did or didn't do in your life. And that's the most momentous thing anyone can experience. And I - and you can go with great agitation or great peace. GROSS: We were talking earlier about the \"Book Of Job.\" DEL TORO: Yes. GROSS: You asked your cast to read the \"Book Of Job.\" DEL TORO: Yes, and the Tao. Yeah. GROSS: What did you want them to take from it? DEL TORO: Because ultimately that's the plea of the creature too. And the plea of the creature is why? You know, why do this thing happened to me? And the answer comes at the end. The final image of the film is what tells you what we can do. I mean, acceptance is so profound. You know, we are building a culture in which we have the idea of what things should be. And when they don't happen, you can feel frustrated, rebel against them. But at the end of the day, they are what they are. Marty Scorsese tackled the same sort of question in \"The Irishman.\" And the answer is very, very beautiful. He says, it is what it is. You know, that's the \"Book Of Job\" - it is what it is. And the Tao says all pain comes from desire, which is absolutely true. You want more awards. You want more money. You find yourself in pain. I do, you know? But if you don't want more, there's a zero that gives you peace. And the same with life. GROSS: So you found feeling insignificant... DEL TORO: All great. GROSS: ...Liberating. DEL TORO: Liberating, which can happen with reviews. (LAUGHTER) GROSS: Do you read them? DEL TORO: Not anymore. Not anymore. I'm 61. I don't. But I did. I did. Oh, my God. When I was younger, I would read every single one until I found the one that would never leave my brain. I remember a few that are really well-phrased. GROSS: Do you want to quote one? DEL TORO: Well, J. Hoberman of The Village Voice wrote a great - he put down \"Blade II.\" Beautiful. He said, the only thing remotely scary about \"Blade II\" is that it's done by the same man that did \"Devil's Backbone,\" which is beautiful. (LAUGHTER) DEL TORO: So... GROSS: On that note, let me reintroduce you again. We have to take a break. If you're just joining us, my guest is filmmaker Guillermo del Toro. He wrote and directed the new film \"Frankenstein\" - his own interpretation of the Frankenstein story, inspired by Mary Shelley's 1818 novel. We'll be back after a short break. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to my interview with filmmaker Guillermo del Toro. He wrote and directed the new film \"Frankenstein,\" a new interpretation of the story inspired by Mary Shelley's 1818 novel. He also fell in love at the age of 7 with the 1931 film \"Frankenstein,\" which starred Boris Karloff as the creature. The creature is played by Jacob Elordi in the new film. Dr. Victor Frankenstein, the surgeon who creates the creature and brings it to life, is played by Oscar Isaac. Del Toro's other films include \"Pan's Labyrinth,\" \"The Shape Of Water,\" \"Nightmare Alley,\" a stop motion animation PG reimagining of the Pinocchio story and two Hellboy movies. I want to talk with you about the 1931 film \"Frankenstein,\" which was directed by James Whale, who also directed the first film version of \"Show Boat,\" which is quite a contrast (laughter). DEL TORO: And the first version of \"Waterloo Bridge,\" which is his version is so brutal and sort of Brechtian. He was a very interesting director and a very interesting man. GROSS: Well, you know, I watched that movie so many times when I was a child because it used to be run frequently on \"Million Dollar Movie\" in New York. And they would show one movie and run it over and over all week. And then I watched it again a few nights ago because I wanted to refresh my memory. And part of what I love about the movie is just the otherworldliness of it. The cinematography is so good. And it reminds me of, like, film noir, German expressionism. And it's misty, it's stormy, it's dreamlike. DEL TORO: It's very modern, by the way. GROSS: Yeah. DEL TORO: Yeah. I mean, for 1931, this film, Whale and a lot of this era of Hollywood filmmaker is extremely influenced by German cinema. And to the point where Whale does an artifice that is not apparent to the audience until you tell them to look for it. If the shadows on the set didn't fall the way Whale liked it, he would spray paint them. GROSS: Whoa, really? DEL TORO: Yeah. There's a lot of shadows on the window that don't correspond to the light that is being poured on the set. And the light is - the shadows are painted with spray paint on the walls. And nobody knows. Now that I told you, if you watch it again, you'll see it here and there. GROSS: Did the style of filmmaking - the shadows, the lighting, the mist, the nightmarish quality of the images - did that influence you as a filmmaker? DEL TORO: It did up to a certain point, and it did only on certain movies. Like, for example, in \"Pinocchio,\" the creation of Pinocchio is shot like a horror film. But the creation of the creature in this film is shown like a concert, like a joyful cornucopia of anatomical parts, blood, ligaments and muscles, which has never been shown in any other versions before. But to me, it was mandatory because I wanted to see Victor at his professional best and at his artistic best. So I talked to my composer, Alexandre Desplat. And I said, we're going to do it with a waltz. And I'm going to shoot it like a like a fun-filled concert of anatomical parts. GROSS: Did you study anatomy in order to do that? DEL TORO: Yes. First of all, I've been obsessed by medicine and anatomy. I was the world's youngest hypochondriac when I was a kid. I would come to my... GROSS: (Laughter) Congratulations. That's quite an achievement. DEL TORO: It is. And there must be a Boy Scout patch for that. But I went to my mother every day and I said, Mother, I think I have trichinosis of the brain. Mother, I have cirrhosis. You know, I read an entire encyclopedia of health as a kid, and I've been very taken by anatomy ever since. And we had a Victorian consultant. And I used an entire medical library that I purchased from 1835. I bought it in London, and I used it to make sure the terms and the procedures were up to speed but not too advanced. GROSS: What did you tell your collaborators about what you wanted your Frankenstein to look like? Because he looks nothing like Boris Karloff. DEL TORO: No. GROSS: I don't just mean his face. But he doesn't have, like, a bolt in his neck. DEL TORO: No, no. GROSS: He doesn't look all stitched together. DEL TORO: What I was trying to capture is the beautiful style of the illustrations of an American artist called Bernie Wrightson, who illustrated for me the best illustrated version of the novel ever, and who collaborated with me earlier on. And it has a very irony and very doomed, very \"Wuthering Heights\" sort of look of a doomed hero. And when he's first born, and he's bald and almost naked, I wanted it to feel like an anatomical chart, like something newly minted. Not a repair job on an ICU victim, but the skills of Victor, his exquisite sense of design. The head is patterned after phrenology manuals from the 1800s. So they have very elegant, almost aerodynamic lines. I wanted this alabaster or marble statue feel. So it feels like a newly minted human being. And we also tried to make it the way I remember the Jesus images, life-sized in the churches of my childhood. GROSS: The original \"Frankenstein\" movie is so dreamlike, nightmare-like. And I think several of your films have very nightmarish imagery in it. DEL TORO: Yes. GROSS: I read you were a lucid dreamer. DEL TORO: Yes, as a kid. GROSS: As a kid. DEL TORO: Yeah. GROSS: So explain what you mean when you say a lucid dreamer? DEL TORO: A lucid dream for me - or waking nightmares it used to be called, too - is you wake up in your dream in the exact environment that you fell asleep in. But there are elements that are not normal. I used to see monsters. I saw a burning figure at the foot of my bed, which is where the burning archangel comes in \"Frankenstein.\" And that figure extended its arms and said, I live. And I woke up screaming. When I was a very young child, I used to see a fawn. A goat man come from behind an armoire while the church chimed midnight in the neighborhood. And with each chime, the figure would come up. And then you wake up and nothing is there. And you're covered in sweat. And that's sort of lucid dreaming or waking nightmare states, which are a disruption of the REM cycle on the brain. But to you as a kid, it's truly harrowing. GROSS: So you would dream that you woke up... DEL TORO: Yes. Exactly. GROSS: ... And escaped the nightmare... DEL TORO: Yeah. GROSS: ...Only to find that the nightmare is still... DEL TORO: Standing there. GROSS: Is going on. So it makes the nightmare seem even more like reality. DEL TORO: Yes, which is why one of the best images in the novel of Mary Shelley's \"Frankenstein\" is - had never been rendered on film until now. And it was my favorite moment reading it as a - at age 11, I read the novel. And it's the moment Victor wakes up from the night of creation, and the creature is standing at the foot of the bed looking back at him. As a kid, I held my breath. I was shocked, and I prayed for decades that I could make that moment come to life on a film before anyone, and fortunately, nobody did it. GROSS: Well, we have to take a short break here. If you're just joining us, my guest is Guillermo del Toro. He wrote and directed the new film \"Frankenstein,\" a new interpretation of the story. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Guillermo del Toro. He wrote and directed the new film \"Frankenstein,\" a new interpretation of the story inspired by Mary Shelley's 1818 novel. When we left off, we were talking about how as a child, del Toro experienced lucid dreaming or waking nightmares. That's when you think you've awakened from a nightmare, but you haven't really. You're just dreaming you woke up, and the nightmare continues. Do you think that your lucid dreams when you were a child relate to how you fell in love with movies when you were a child? DEL TORO: Yes. Yes. GROSS: Because movies are so dreamlike... DEL TORO: Yes. GROSS: ...But they might haunt your dreams. You might be afraid of them, but you're not literally going to think that you live in that world. DEL TORO: And you are absolutely right. The first film I saw was William Wyler's \"Wuthering Heights,\" with Laurence Olivier. I went with my mother to a cinema downtown that was super cheap and showed very old movies. It was really gothic atmosphere with rain and the moors and Olivier. It's basically a ghost story in many ways, \"Wuthering Heights.\" And I fell asleep full of fear. I dreamt my dream and woke up in the theater with the movie still playing. So exactly my first movie was part of a lucid dream. Exactly. GROSS: Wow. What was your emotional reaction to that? DEL TORO: You're looking at it. GROSS: (Laughter). DEL TORO: I mean, it - that's when I fell in love with gothic romance. And I was - I couldn't have been more than 4. Why do I know it? Because I remember the house we were living in where I was born, and my father won the lottery - the national lottery in 1969, which would make me 5 years old when we moved from that house to a giant house in the outskirts of the city. GROSS: Your father won the lottery. Like... DEL TORO: Yeah, in 1969. GROSS: ...How much money did he win? DEL TORO: Six million dollars in '69. GROSS: Whoa. DEL TORO: Which is the entire budget of \"Planet Of The Apes.\" (LAUGHTER) GROSS: That's amazing. How did it... DEL TORO: Yeah. GROSS: ...Change your life? DEL TORO: Completely. I mean, completely. We moved into a house and lived a very sort of strange life. I mean, we had all sorts of pets. We had eagles, a pet lion, 30 dogs, deer. GROSS: A what? Oh, boy. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You had a zoo. DEL TORO: Yeah, we had, like, a zoo, and we had - I could go like Danny in \"The Shining.\" I could go on my tricycle for hours in the long corridors. Sometimes, like a magic realism novel, I would go for weeks without seeing a single adult. I would find food in the fridge. I would find clean clothes on my drawers, and I didn't interact with many adults. I would just, you know, exist in a mysterious life in an enchanted castle. GROSS: Six million dollars was a lot more then than it is now. DEL TORO: Oh, it was. And one of the things he did is he bought a library and filled it with books that he never read, but I read them all. And that's where I read the \"Encyclopedia Of Anatomy And Health\" (ph). And that's where I read all my classics, you know, \"Moby Dick,\" \"Tom Sawyer,\" \"Huckleberry Finn,\" Edgar Allan Poe, Oscar Wilde. GROSS: Wow. So what happened to the money? Because he was held for a million-dollar ransom... DEL TORO: Yeah. Yeah. GROSS: ...About 30 years later... DEL TORO: Yes. GROSS: And didn't have the money. DEL TORO: Well, what happened is my dad controlled every cent. None of us had access to that money. My father raised us - he would say, you want? And I would say, I want to buy film for my camera, and he would say, OK, go to the car dealership and clean all the cars all week. And Saturday, I'll give you a third of it. You come back another three weeks, I'll buy you a reel of Super 8. He didn't want to raise us as if we had everything. So, you know, none of us had access to that money. He had the money to pay for the ransom, but none of us could access it. GROSS: Oh. DEL TORO: Yeah. I had some money left from \"Mimic.\" When he was kidnapped, I put it all in. Friends of his gave us loans. It's a long story, and not a very pleasant one about the nature of humanity, but we managed to collect it. We had a negotiator that came from England, and that negotiation was paid by Jim Cameron who has been my friend for more than 30 years. GROSS: The director... DEL TORO: The director, yeah. We were friends, yeah. GROSS: ...Who directed \"Titanic\" among other films. DEL TORO: Titanic, \"Terminator 2,\" \"Avatar.\" Yeah. GROSS: Did your father ever pay you back? DEL TORO: Yeah, eventually. I mean, that was a source of disconnect. I had to move to Texas, and for a couple of years, you know, we didn't stay in very close contact. He - you know, it's too personal to discuss, but, you know, eventually, he came around and he did pay me back, and we - I think we ended up in great love and great understanding of the fact that my dad was not my dad. He was a guy that played my dad on my particular sitcom, you know? And my dad and I understood each other. We're, at the end of the day, very similar and very different, but I loved him so much. GROSS: So I have to ask  - you live in LA. There's been quite a large ICE crackdown there. And you're Mexican. You have an accent. DEL TORO: Yeah. Oh, yeah. GROSS: Has anybody from ICE stopped you and asked for your papers? DEL TORO: Not yet, but if we ever meet in person, I'll show you. I have a wallet the size of a leather portfolio, and I always carry my papers. I have been stopped in the past and asked to show my papers in the past and ask pointed questions in the past, pulled aside in immigration in the past. So I have all my papers with me at all times. And it is a very difficult time when there is no voice for the other. And I think that understanding that the other is you is crucial. GROSS: Well, you experienced that when you were very young, too. DEL TORO: Exile has been momentous and extremely traumatic. I haven't processed it, but I did it in the best way possible. I looked for a home in Spain. I looked for a home in Toronto. I made a home in Toronto, in a way. And I - you know, when I go to Mexico, I love going to Mexico, and at the same time, I have to admit that I get a sort of PTSD here and there, you know? GROSS: PTSD? DEL TORO: Yeah. I feel like something may happen at any moment or... GROSS: Because of the kidnapping? DEL TORO: Yes, because, I mean, when it lasts 72 days, you go through all the stages of grief five times. GROSS: Right. DEL TORO: You know? It increased my sense of being unmoored in my existence, not belonging in my existence. You know, it reaffirmed that feeling that was originally from childhood. And now as an adult, I feel it in a different way. But, you know, as Marty Feldman puts it in \"Young Frankenstein,\" it could be worse. It could be raining. (LAUGHTER) GROSS: Do you like \"Young Frankenstein\"? DEL TORO: I adore it. That's a movie that is more - people think is based on the Whale movies. It's partially based on that. But more than any other movie - and I recommend this movie wholeheartedly - it's based very much on \"Son Of Frankenstein,\" which is a great Frankenstein movie - really, really terrific. GROSS: Do you have a favorite song from \"Young Frankenstein\"? DEL TORO: (Laughter) Yes. I think that the point of disagreement between Gene Wilder and Mel Brooks, which is the most brilliant moment, is \"Puttin' On The Ritz,\" of course. GROSS: Yes. DEL TORO: I think that's not only one of the greatest comedies ever made. It's one of the great Frankenstein movies ever made. It is so much its own identity that people believe erroneously that the blind hermit comes from \"Young Frankenstein\" sometimes. And it comes obviously from the novel and from \"Bride Of Frankenstein,\" the Whale movie, which is an exquisite sequel to the first \"Frankenstein.\" GROSS: Guillermo del Toro, it's been such a pleasure talking with you. DEL TORO: Same here. GROSS: Thank you so much for coming... DEL TORO: No. GROSS: ...Back to the show. DEL TORO: Always a pleasure. And thank you for the wisdom and the careful guiding of this lengthy interview, which I adored every second of. GROSS: I really appreciate you saying that. I love talking with you. DEL TORO: Same here. GROSS: Guillermo del Toro wrote and directed the new film \"Frankenstein.\" (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN\") GENE WILDER: (As Dr. Frederick Frankenstein) Ladies and gentlemen, mesdames and messieurs, damen und herren, from what was once an inarticulate mass of lifeless tissues, may I now present a cultured, sophisticated man-about-town. Hit it. (Singing) If you're blue and you don't know where to go to, why don't you go where fashion sits? PETER BOYLE: (As the Monster, singing) Putting on the Ritz. WILDER: (As Dr. Frederick Frankenstein, singing) Different types who wear a day coat, pants with stripes or cutaway coat. Perfect fits. BOYLE: (As the Monster, singing) Putting on the Ritz. WILDER: (As Dr. Frederick Frankenstein, singing) Dressed up like a million-dollar trooper, trying mighty hard to look like Gary Cooper. BOYLE: (As the Monster, singing) Super-duper. WILDER: (As Dr. Frederick Frankenstein, singing) Come, let's mix where Rockefellers walk with sticks or umbrellas in their mitts. BOYLE: (As the Monster, singing) Putting on the Ritz. GROSS: That was Gene Hackman (ph) and Peter Boyle from the film \"Young Frankenstein.\" After we take a short break, Justin Chang reviews a new film by the Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi after he spent seven months in prison.

Trump to end trade talks \n         By The Associated Press \n        \n           Updated Friday, October 24, 2025 • 8:15 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         WASHINGTON — President Trump announced he would end \"all trade negotiations\" with Canada because of a television ad sponsored by one of its provinces that used the words of former President Ronald Reagan to criticize U.S. tariffs — prompting the province's leader to later pull the ad. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The post on Trump's social media site Thursday night ratcheted up tensions with the U.S.'s northern neighbor after Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said he plans to double his country's exports to countries outside the U.S. because of the threat posed by Trump's tariffs. White House officials said Trump's reaction was a culmination of the administration's long, pent-up frustration about Canada's strategy in trade talks. Later Friday, Ontario Premier Doug Ford, whose province had sponsored the ad, said it would be taken down. Ford said after talking with Prime Minister Carney he's decided to pause the advertising campaign effective Monday so that trade talks can resume. Ford said they've achieved their goal, having reached U.S. audiences at the highest levels. \"Our intention was always to initiate a conversation about the kind of economy that Americans want to build and the impact of tariffs on workers and businesses,\" Ford said. \"We've achieved our goal, having reached U.S. audiences at the highest levels.\" The U.S. president alleged the ad misrepresented the position of Reagan, a two-term president who remains a beloved figure in the Republican Party, and was aimed at influencing the U.S. Supreme Court ahead of a hearing scheduled for next month that could decide whether Trump has the power to impose his sweeping tariffs, a key part of his economic strategy. Trump is so invested in the case that he has said he'd like to attend oral arguments. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"CANADA CHEATED AND GOT CAUGHT!!!\" Trump wrote on his social media site Friday morning. \"They fraudulently took a big buy ad saying that Ronald Reagan did not like Tariffs, when actually he LOVED TARIFFS FOR OUR COUNTRY, AND ITS NATIONAL SECURITY. Canada is trying to illegally influence the United States Supreme Court in one of the most important rulings in the history of our Country.\" Canadian premier digs in after Trump ends talks The ad was paid for by Ontario's government, not the Canadian federal government. Ford, the premier, didn't initially back down, posting Friday that Canada and the U.S. are allies \"and Reagan knew that both are stronger together.\" Ford then provided a link to a Reagan speech where the late president voices opposition to tariffs. Ford had said the province plans to pay $54 million (about $75 million Canadian) for the ads to air across multiple American television stations using audio and video of Reagan speaking about tariffs in 1987. Even though the ad will eventually be taken down, it'll still run this weekend, including Game 1 of the World Series between the Toronto Blue Jays and Los Angeles Dodgers on Friday night. Ford is a populist conservative who doesn't belong to the same party as Carney, a Liberal. For his part, Carney said his government remains ready to continue talks to reduce tariffs in certain sectors. \"We can't control the trade policy of the United States. We recognize that that policy has fundamentally changed from the 1980s,\" he said Friday morning before boarding a flight for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit in Malaysia. Trump is set to travel to the same summit Friday night. Reagan's foundation speaks out against ad Earlier Thursday night, the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute posted on X that the ad \"misrepresents the 'Presidential Radio Address to the Nation on Free and Fair Trade' dated April 25, 1987.\" It added that Ontario did not receive foundation permission \"to use and edit the remarks\" and said it was reviewing legal options. The foundation in Simi Valley, California, is perhaps best known for maintaining the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum. Its board includes longtime Republican Party stalwarts such as former Trump Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, who resigned after the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the Capitol, and former House Speaker Paul Ryan, whose free-market philosophy often clashes with Trump's protectionist tendencies. Another board member is Lachlan Murdoch, the son of Rupert, who is executive chairman and CEO of Fox Corporation. The board is chaired by Fred Ryan, the former publisher and CEO of The Washington Post. Trump wrote Thursday night that \"The Ronald Reagan Foundation has just announced that Canada has fraudulently used an advertisement, which is FAKE, featuring Ronald Reagan speaking negatively about Tariffs.\" He added, \"TARIFFS ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO THE NATIONAL SECURITY, AND ECONOMY, OF THE U.S.A. Based on their egregious behavior, ALL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WITH CANADA ARE HEREBY TERMINATED.\" Reagan did not actually love tariffs. He often criticized government policies — including protectionist measures such as tariffs — that interfered with free commerce and he spent much of that 1987 radio address spelling out the case against tariffs. Blowup was a long time coming, administration officials indicate White House spokesman Kush Desai said the ad was the \"latest example of how Canadian officials would rather play games than engage with the Administration.\" Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, told reporters at the White House on Friday that Canada has shown a \"lack of flexibility\" and also cited \"leftover behaviors from the Trudeau folks,\" referring to former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who had a frosty relationship with the Trump administration. \"If you look at all the countries around the world that we've made deals with, and the fact that we're now negotiating with Mexico separately reveals that it's not just about one ad,\" Hassett said. Carney met with Trump earlier this month to try to ease trade tensions, as the two countries and Mexico prepare for a review of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, a trade deal Trump negotiated in his first term but has since soured on. More than three-quarters of Canadian exports go to the U.S., and nearly $3.6 billion Canadian ($2.7 billion U.S.) worth of goods and services cross the border daily. Trump initially appeared unfazed by the ad Trump said earlier in the week that he had seen the ad on TV and didn't seem bothered by it. \"If I was Canada, I'd take that same ad also,\" he said Tuesday during a lunch with Republican senators. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Ontario bought more than $275,000 of ad reservations for the spot to air in 198 of the nation's 210 media markets this month, according to data from the nonpartisan media tracking firm AdImpact. It was broadcast most frequently in the New York market, with more than 530 airings, followed by Washington, D.C., at around 280. The only other markets with more than 100 airings were those around Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and West Palm Beach, Florida. Ford previously got Trump's attention with an electricity surcharge to U.S. states. Trump responded by doubling steel and aluminum tariffs. The president has moved to impose steep U.S. tariffs on many goods from Canada. In April, Canada's government imposed retaliatory levies on certain U.S. goods -- but it carved out exemptions for some automakers to bring specific numbers of vehicles into the country, known as remission quotas. Trump's tariffs have especially hurt Canada's auto sector, much of which is based in Ontario. This month, Stellantis said it would move a production line from Ontario to Illinois. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-95027","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"19:03:00-04:00","title":"DOJ hires immigration judges after months of layoffs","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Justice Department has hired 36 immigration judges — 25 temporary and 11 permanent — to restore operations at the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) after months of massive layoffs.

Earlier this summer,  the Pentagon authorized about 600 military lawyers  to work for the DOJ. The DOJ  changed  who could qualify as a temporary immigration judge — effectively lowering the requirements and removing the need to have prior immigration law experience. Immigration judges are the only ones who can revoke someone's green card or issue a final order of removal for people who have been in the country for more than two years and are in the process of being deported. Their backgrounds have often varied. Some come to the position after several years working for ICE's legal branch. Others come to it after working for immigrant defense nonprofits or private practice. Some have no immigration law experience. The new cohort was trained at the EOIR headquarters in Virginia this month and are expected to start hearing immigration cases soon. Immigration courts have continued to operate during the government shutdown. As part of its aggressive immigration policy, the Trump administration has moved fast to increase the rate of arrests of undocumented immigrants, and scale up detention space and deportations. But the rapid pace of arrests has contributed to the backlog of  millions of cases  at immigration courts. Over the past 10 months, EOIR has lost more than 125 judges to firings and voluntary resignations, down from about 700  judges  at the start of the year. The loss has resulted in immigration cases being delayed as far out as 2029, NPR previously reported, as vacancies increase despite open job postings to fill roles in those courts.

body \n         By Gabrielle Emanuel \n        \n           Friday, October 24, 2025 • 12:49 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Viruses are tiny — and sneaky. So sneaky that some play a deadly game of hide and seek. The \"seek\" part is all too familiar: They're always looking for ways to infect humans. Their ability to hide is far less well-known and can have devastating implications. The human body holds several effective hiding spots that some of the world's nastiest viruses have discovered — like the eyes and the testes — that are beyond the reach of the immune system. It's here that submicroscopic viral RNA can safely linger. Often the human hosts have no idea. They'd fallen ill, then appeared to beat the virus. Their blood tested negative. They show no symptoms. But that hidden virus is capable of springing back into action. It can emerge from hiding — either sickening the original host or slipping into semen or breast milk and infecting someone new. Which viruses have mastered this technique? A number of notorious ones from Zika to measles to highly deadly viruses like Nipah,  Marburg  and Lassa fever. And the virus that terrified the world in 2014: Ebola. In the decade since, the Democratic Republic of Congo has experienced more than its fair share of Ebola crises — with nine outbreaks, including one that is ongoing — and more than its fair share of hidden viruses that spring back into action. \"Almost all the outbreaks recently — maybe not every single one of them but the vast majority — are traced back to a previous outbreak,\" says Dr. Elizabeth Higgs, who is with the Division of Clinical Research at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. She says once the genetics of the virus are sequenced it is clear that many of the outbreaks haven't come from an animal — like a bat — but from a human who unwittingly carried the virus after surviving a previous outbreak. While most survivors will never start a new outbreak, it is happening enough that Higgs says, \"I think it's top of the research agenda.\" \"Everybody was panicking\" Dr. Soka Moses first grasped the significance of these virus hideouts a decade ago. It was in mid-March 2015 when people in his West African country of Liberia were heaving a collective sigh of relief. The country was emerging from a nightmare, recalls Moses, then the medical director at an Ebola treatment center. Nearly 5,000 people died over the previous year. Some perished in the streets, unable to find a hospital bed. Schools shuttered, markets closed. Finally, in early March of 2015, there were no more Ebola cases. But the crisis was not over. Shortly after Liberia had reached zero cases, Moses recalls sitting in a daily meeting led by Liberia's National Epidemic Response Team when \"boom! A case was identified.\" As word got out, he says: \"Everybody was panicking: 'Oh, my God. Are we starting this again?'\" Part of the panic was the mystery. How could this woman have contracted Ebola when there were no active cases? The virus spreads easily when someone comes into contact with an infected person's bodily fluids, even sweat or saliva, but it was not clear where or how this new patient could have been exposed. Family members eventually pointed medical investigators to the woman's sexual partner. Five months ago he'd recovered from Ebola. \"[He'd] tested negative on two different occasions,\" says Moses. \"[He was] doing perfectly fine, no symptoms whatsoever.\" The man was terrified and, initially, avoided the authorities. \"He thought he was in really big trouble,\" says Moses. Once he was reassured that he was not in trouble, he agreed to cooperate. The challenge for scientists: Find out if the virus was hiding somewhere in his body. They ultimately determined that the Ebola virus was no longer in his blood … but lived on in his testes and had been transmitted in his semen. \"So that was the  first documented sexually transmitted  case of Ebola virus disease,\" says Moses. While he'd read about a 1967 case in which another virus hid out in the body, the implications were now much clearer. This prompted Moses to act. He's now the director of PREVAIL or the Partnership for Research on Vaccines & Infectious Diseases in Liberia, which studies the phenomenon of hidden viruses, among other things. The body's sanctuary sites Researchers have identified a number of spots where the viruses can hide — not only eyes and testes but also the brain, the placenta and vaginal fluids as well as the mammary glands. \"We call them sanctuary sites,\" says  Joel Montgomery , chief of the Viral Special Pathogens Branch at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For the virus, these are havens protected from the immune system. Scientists think this is likely because these body parts are critical for survival — and vulnerable to damage if the immune system overreacts. For example, \"in the process of making eggs and sperm, we mix and match the genes. So they're not really us anymore,\" says  Dr. John Schieffelin , an associate professor at Tulane University School of Medicine. That means the immune system might see eggs or sperm as foreign invaders and try to attack them, so it's helpful if those parts of the body are outside the reach of the immune system. The brain has a special level of protection   in the blood brain barrier which limits the entry of immune cells. As for the eye? \"An eye doctor might scold me for this, but to me, it's really an extension of the brain. There's a large nerve that goes from your eye directly into your brain,\" Schieffelin says. Many mysteries There's still a lot scientists don't know about how viruses behave in these sanctuary sites. For example, exactly how long can a virus stay there? In many cases where individuals were tested, it appears to be a matter of months. In some cases, it's years. There have even been semen samples that test negative for the virus at one point then return to positive later. It's not clear to scientists what prompted this reversal. And researchers haven't followed enough people who've harbored one of these infections long enough to know the outer limit. Another big unknown: What is the virus doing in the sanctuary site? It seems as if it's almost dormant, barely replicating. \"But we don't know why someone relapses. We don't know if it's a drop in their immune system or if there's some other factor,\" says Montgomery. Fear and stigma Montgomery says the goal is to identify medications for survivors that can reach into sanctuary sites and root out any hidden virus. For this, he says, the size of the molecule in the drug is key. \"We really need to explore the use of small-molecule drugs,\" he says, suggesting the smaller the drug's molecule the more likely it can penetrate the protective barrier around a sanctuary site. Moses' team has been studying exactly this with the drug remdesivir — and results have been promising. Survivors who got the drug cleared the virus from their semen more quickly than survivors who got the placebo. While many of the researchers are focused on the biology, something that's never far from their mind is the psychological part of the equation. Ebola survivors can face intense fear and stigma. When Dr. Dehkontee Dennis — who works at PREVAIL in Liberia — was enrolling for the study, she says she noticed \"there was one thing that  all  of these men have expressed: They have this fear. They don't want to transmit the virus to their families. They want to have children. They want to stop using condoms [to prevent transmission].\" The flip side of their fear is that many of the community members — who may have lost their partners and other family members to Ebola — fear the survivors may still pose a threat, even if they don't know about sanctuary sites. \"Community members did not even want them back in the communities,\" says Moses. This level of stigma makes it tricky to talk about the risk that the virus could hide in a survivor and then resurface. Survivors and their community need to know there's a chance this could happen, the scientists say — but only in a small percentage of cases. Reassurance can also come from survivor programs that test semen and vaccination campaigns to protect the community. But scientists say the solution will be finding medications that can ferret out these hidden, potentially lethal viruses. \"It's great that we have vaccines,\" says Joel Montgomery of the CDC. \"It's great that we have therapeutics. It's great that we're saving people's lives. But now we need to figure out a way to make sure the virus is completely eliminated from them.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5580558","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"06:00:00-20:00","title":"This is not your grandmother's 'Hedda'","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Nia DaCosta’s film 'Hedda' reimagines Henrik Ibsen’s classic play 'Hedda Gabler' with a bold, modern twist: featuring a mixed-race, out-of-wedlock Black woman, Tessa Thompson’s Hedda, who manipulates her social circle to assert power in a rigid 1950s English society.

Friday, October 24, 2025 • 6:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         In  Hedda , an   intoxicating headrush of a film written and directed by Nia DaCosta, party guests are descending upon an English estate when the 1951 Betty Hutton song \" It's A Man! \" begins playing. The needle drop is brief, but the lyrics you don't hear in the film reveal the song to be a pointed insertion. \"If it acts just like it's the boss / When it knows that  you  are, of course … It's a man!\" \"It's A Man!\" is a cheeky ode to the ineptitude of manhood, poking fun at patriarchy's trappings while imploring women to half-heartedly accept them. How fitting for it to soundtrack this spirited take on  Hedda Gabler , about a woman seeking to escape boredom with her bland academic husband by manipulating the affections and interests of everyone in her orbit. Henrik Ibsen's 19th century   play has been adapted for stage and screen many times, providing generations of powerhouse actresses (Ingrid Bergman, Glenda Jackson, Cate Blanchett) with a dastardly title role to play. With DaCosta's interpretation, a slinky and mischievous Tessa Thompson comfortably sashays into that lineage, and the result is a dazzling rendering of caste, lust and ambition in 1950s England. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       This  Hedda's  Hedda stands out from her predecessors, as a mixed-race woman born out of wedlock to the renowned General Gabler. All her father left her when he died were his prized guns and a scant proximity to high society, which will hardly do for someone like Hedda — who, as one character puts it, possesses an \"insatiable appetite.\" To maintain a foothold in the upper echelons, she's married handsome scholar and \"dull fool\" George Tesman (Tom Bateman), convincing him to go into debt to purchase a grand countryside estate they cannot afford. Naturally, the occasion calls for a fabulous party they cannot afford. DaCosta confines  Hedda  to a roughly 24-hour period, including said party, during which unfolds a wickedly absorbing chain of events. As guests pour into the decadent digs (the film was  shot on the grounds of Flintham Hall  in Nottinghamshire), the married hosts' many worlds — professional, personal, or as is often the case, both — collide consequentially throughout the evening. Hedda's \"bohemian\" friends mix and mingle with George's stuffy academic cohort; Thea (Imogen Poots), an old schoolmate of Hedda's, crashes the party and finds herself unwittingly ensnared in Hedda's web of machinations. But the most crucial visitor is the formidable Eileen Lövborg (Nina Hoss, a force), Hedda's one-time paramour, and George's present rival for a university position. The women have plenty of unfinished business between them that Hedda is more than eager to exploit, to the most extreme ends. As Hedda, Thompson has a ball being the agent of chaos, asserting her dominance through calculated mannerisms: an affected way of speaking that's vaguely Brit- ish  and calls to mind the Transatlantic accents of classic Hollywood stars like Katharine Hepburn; curt remarks accompanied by her gentle yet potent guiding touch of an arm or shoulder with those white-gloved fingers. The actress understands Hedda is herself doing a  performance , a putting on of airs that seems to have been perfected through years of being an outsider, an act she envisions as a necessary tool for survival. Very rarely does that mask slip and reveal vulnerability, but when it does — it  goes.  Though this façade is apparent to pretty much everyone except the clueless George, her natural magnetism nevertheless allows her to impulsively scheme and play her party guests like a fiddle to get what she wants — to a point. DaCosta's most significant alterations to Ibsen's text serve  Hedda  well. Bending Eileen's gender (previously Ejlert) while setting the events post-World War II but pre-Swinging '60s lends that character's professional aspirations added heft, and puts her in tension with Hedda for reasons stretching beyond that of a mere scorned lover. (The best scenes involve the two women verbally sparring over the life choices each has made.) And Hedda's race is integral to the interplay. Though hardly overstated and rarely commented upon directly, the viewer can infer and understand plenty about her twisted relationship with the acerbic family friend Judge Brack (Nicholas Pinnock). As her closest confidante and another Black person who's managed to accrue some standing among the white elite, he's the only one who truly \"gets\" Hedda as much as she can be \"gotten\" — the  Addison DeWitt to her Margo Channing  via dry, scathing observations of Hedda's diabolical behavior, who sometimes, even, goads her on. To choreograph this bumpy night, DaCosta assembles a stellar team that includes cinematographer Sean Bobbitt, production designer Cara Brower, and editor Jacob Secher Schulsinger. They find the beat and make the film dance, sometimes literally: a standout moment finds the revelers swinging in the golden-hued ballroom to a live band playing another Betty Hutton number, \" It's Oh So Quiet ,\" a song that oscillates between a whispered, serene waltz and the explosion of a big, strutting brass band, not unlike the structure and cadence of  Hedda . Suddenly, the music fades to a dim echo but DaCosta's camera keeps swirling close-up on Hedda letting loose, her exerted gasps and breaths amplified. (Those sonic exhalations echo throughout composer Hildur Guðnadóttir's evocative score.) This sequence sets the stage for the seamless transition into the pivotal next act – and presents a visually effective moment which struck me as a possible homage to Spike Lee. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The filmmaking industry's progress being as slow and nonlinear as it is, DaCosta occupies a rare space as a Black woman filmmaker. Unlike many of her peers and forebears, she's had the opportunity to helm five features in less than a decade, and each has been a totally different vibe: her feature debut  Little Woods , for one, is a quiet and very good indie about a parolee hustling to survive and support her sister in North Dakota (also starring Thompson); her next film is the zombie franchise installment  28 Years Later: The Bone Temple . But  Hedda  suggests DaCosta's at her most creatively free, at least thus far, in this mode. For the viewer, she excavates the pleasures in watching an antiheroine meddle maniacally and unabashedly, spinning a spectacular mess that's impossible to look away from. Hedda may or may not possess any real, tangible power in her day-to-day life. But for a few hours at least, she is the boss.

Behind them stood a smiling Ghislaine Maxwell, the longtime partner of the late Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein himself took the photo. Her name was Virginia Roberts Giuffre, one of the most public accusers of abuse by Epstein and the many powerful men Giuffre says she was trafficked to in the early 2000s. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Epstein was convicted in 2008 in Florida on charges related to soliciting prostitution. His 2019 federal sex-trafficking charges were dismissed after his death by suicide while awaiting trial in New York. Maxwell was later convicted of crimes related to the sexual abuse of minors and is serving a 20-year sentence in Texas. Days before the publication of Giuffre's memoir,  Nobody's Girl,  Buckingham Palace released a statement from Prince Andrew. It said he had agreed to give up his title as Duke of York amid fresh scrutiny of the allegations. In  Nobody's Girl , Giuffre says she first met Prince Andrew in 2001 and that he guessed correctly she was then 17 years old. \"My daughters are just a little younger than you,\" she recalls him saying. \"He was friendly enough, but still entitled — as if he believed having sex with me was his birthright,\" she wrote. Prince Andrew has consistently denied Giuffre's accusations. Epstein  reached a financial settlement  with Giuffre in 2009. Prince Andrew  later settled  with Giuffre in 2022. Giuffre died by suicide in April, at age 41, just months before her book's release. Her collaborator on  Nobody's Girl , author and journalist Amy Wallace, and Giuffre's younger brother, Sky Roberts, spoke about the memoir with  Morning Edition's  Leila Fadel. Here are five takeaways from the conversation.  1. Giuffre called her father \"the original betrayer\" The memoir begins with the abuse Giuffre said started when she was about 7 years old. Before calling out Epstein, Maxwell and their wealthy friends, Wallace said Giuffre wanted to name her \"original betrayer.\" \"When we began unpacking all of that, she had always said 'I was abused by a family friend,' and that was true as far as it went, but she had also been abused by her own father,\" Wallace said. \"You have to understand Virginia's history… victims of sexual trafficking are not born, they are made, and they are made by terrible experiences that they have over years.\" Giuffre was 16 when she met Maxwell at Mar-a-Lago resort, where she worked as a locker room attendant in the spa. \"And up to that point, the world that had been revealed to her, was a world in which adult men had sex with young girls, children, and didn't pay the price for it,\" Wallace added. Giuffre's father denies these accusations. 2. Her \"toughest battle\" came at home  Giuffre was married for over 20 years and had three children. Near the end of her life, she was estranged from her husband. Her brother said she had begun to speak openly about the domestic abuse she had allegedly experienced over the years. \"She fought off Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein, and she was very proud of that with her survivor sister. She wanted to continue that advocacy work. But I would say, the hardest fight of her battle was in her backyard with her husband, and she was a little embarrassed about that, as anybody would be coming forward,\" Roberts said. Giuffre's husband denies these allegations. 3. Her brothers were by her side before her death in Australia Earlier this year, Giuffre was recovering from a car crash and renal failure. Her brothers traveled to Australia to help care for her. \"At one point, we had a jet lined up for her on a tarmac ready to bring her home so she could get medical treatment,\" Roberts shared. \"We were with her in her final couple of weeks. And, you know, I was, I was, I was the one that found my sister.\" Having displayed so much strength facing the legal and public battles against Epstein and others, her brother says they thought she \"would make it through because she'd pulled through so many times before.\" 4. Giuffre wanted the Epstein files released President Trump has not ruled out a pardon for Maxwell. \"Well, I'll take a look at it. I'll speak to the DOJ,\" Trump  said earlier this month  to a CNN reporter regarding a possible pardon for Maxwell. \"I wouldn't consider it or not consider — I don't know anything about it. I will speak to the DOJ.\" Wallace said those who doubt Maxwell's involvement in the abuse, \"will get their answers in this book.\" \"She was not on the sidelines,\" Wallace said. \"She was sexually abusing herself. She was telling girls to sexually service her. She was hurting some of those girls when she was angry at them in a sexual way.\" Roberts said he was astounded to hear the president's stance on a possible pardon for Maxwell. \"At one point he ran his campaign on the fact that he would release these [Epstein] files,\" Roberts said. \"My sister had hope that he would. She was hopeful.\" 5. Giuffre's story is larger than the narrative of sex abuse Wallace said Epstein was not an anomaly or \"some super apex predator,\" but rather a sign of our times. \"This is part of our culture,\" she said. \"Wealthy people, powerful people get to treat people less wealthy terribly,\" she said. \"And I think that's why it resonates beyond sexual abuse. I think people are sick of it.\" This article discusses suicide.

It's of now-disgraced Prince Andrew with his hand around the waist of a teen girl in a pink top and jeans. That was Virginia Roberts Giuffre. As an adult, she was one of the most outspoken survivors of abuse at the hands of Jeffrey Epstein and convicted sex offender Ghislaine Maxwell. Prince Andrew was one of many powerful men that Giuffre says she was trafficked to by the wealthy pair. On Friday, Buckingham Palace released a statement from Prince Andrew. It said he had given up his title as Duke of York amid fresh scrutiny of the allegations, which he has consistently denied. Virginia wrote about this and all she endured in a book called \"Nobody's Girl.\" But before it was published, she died by suicide in the spring. I spoke to Amy Wallace, her collaborator on the book, along with her brother Sky Roberts. And a warning - sexual abuse and suicide come up in our conversation. The book opens with the last email Wallace received from Virginia. AMY WALLACE: She basically just said, in the case of my passing, I need and want this book to be published - not just for me, but for all survivors. FADEL: Sky, you're written about so lovingly. You were her baby brother. You were with her in Australia near the end of her life. What do you want the world to know about your sister? SKY ROBERTS: I look at my sister as a hero. But at a very fundamental level, like, you can tell in that book, like, how loving she was and how much she wanted to kind of protect me in a lot of ways. But then, as she progressed and she got older and became a mother, you know, there's even circumstances where she was protecting her own daughter. And then I think that expanded to her protecting your daughters, because when she held her daughter for the first time, it was like, this can never happen again. FADEL: Amy, I want to talk more about the beginning of the book and her childhood. The book goes back much further, to abuses that she first encountered at - what? - 7 years old? If you could just talk about what it was like for Virginia to write in such detail. WALLACE: Well, I mean, the entire book is an exercise in trying to show her in all her complexity. FADEL: Yes. WALLACE: And when we began unpacking all of that, she had always said, I was abused by a family friend. And that was... FADEL: Yeah. WALLACE: ...True, as far as it went. But she had also been abused by her own father. As we worked on the book, she said, how can I be calling out all these people who came later - Epstein, Maxwell, all of their wealthy and influential friends who she was trafficked to - and not acknowledge or name the original betrayer of me, the original abuser of me? You have to understand Virginia's history, which is a lot of the victims have tragedy in their pasts, to understand that victims of sexual trafficking are not born. They are made. And they are made by a terrible experience that they have over years. And when you understand that Virginia was just 16 years old when she met Ghislaine Maxwell at Mar-a-Lago, where she was working as a $9-an-hour towel girl in the spa. And up to that point, the world that had been revealed to her was a world in which adult men had sex with young girls - children - and didn't pay the price for it. FADEL: Yeah. And when you say her original betrayer, you're referring to her father? WALLACE: Her father. So you have to understand - she didn't believe that if she walked out the door of Epstein's Manhattan townhouse that the world outside was going to be any better to her. FADEL: Yeah. And you note in the book that you reached out to her father. Actually, there's a lot of meticulous reporting done in this, reaching out to everybody she's accused, and he's continued to deny that. Throughout Virginia's pages, she writes about not being believed - about how it made her feel worthless as a child and teen, about the way she was broken down and used. What Virginia didn't write and what came to light later was that she says her husband was physically abusing her. It's something he denies. ROBERTS: Our sister was very transparent with us, especially towards the end of her relationship, about the abuse that she was incurring for 22 years throughout her marriage, on and off. She fought off Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein, and she was very proud of that with her survivor sisters. She wanted to continue that advocacy work. But, like, I would say the hardest fight of her battle was in her backyard with her husband. And she was a little embarrassed about that, as anybody would be coming forward. She's a strong figure. FADEL: At the end of her life, Sky was with her. ROBERTS: She was laughing when we were there 'cause the chickens would chase me around, and we nicknamed one Raptor at one point. (LAUGHTER) ROBERTS: But, yes. We were with her in her final couple of weeks, and... FADEL: Yeah. ROBERTS: You know, I was the one that found my sister. And... FADEL: I'm so sorry, Sky. I didn't know that. ROBERTS: Yeah. It was - you know, I think we all thought she would make it through because she'd pulled through so many times before. FADEL: You know, I've been thinking a lot. The fight around Epstein is not over. Right now there is a battle over the release of more Epstein documents. And then there's the question of whether Ghislaine Maxwell might get a pardon, which is something President Trump has not ruled out. I mean, what are you thinking, Sky, as you see what's happening around Epstein and Maxwell even today and what she would think? ROBERTS: I think it's very important to first start with the fact that this is the president of the United States. And at one point, he ran his campaign on the fact that he would release these files. My sister had hope that he would. WALLACE: Yeah, and I would add to that. Anyone who has any questions about how involved Ghislaine Maxwell was in the actual sexual abuse of girls will get their answers in this book. She was involved. She was not on the sidelines. This is a woman who has never offered any solace or empathy to the people that she hurt or that Epstein hurt. Jeffrey Epstein has been dead for years, but the specter of him lives on. And I'm so grateful for that, frankly, because this didn't die with him. He's not just some super apex predator who was an anomaly. This is part of our culture. Wealthy people, powerful people get to treat people less wealthy terribly. And I think that's why it resonates beyond sexual abuse. I think people are sick of it. FADEL: Amy Wallace and Sky Roberts, thank you so much for speaking with us. WALLACE: Thank you for having us. ROBERTS: Thank you. FADEL: The book \"Nobody's Girl\" is out this week. It's Virginia Roberts Giuffre's story. If you or someone you know may be considering suicide or is in crisis, call or text 988, the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.

The dark comedy stars Emma Stone as a high-powered  CEO who gets kidnapped by a pair of cousins convinced she's an alien . In the process, they shave her head bald. The film opens nationwide on October 31, but one audience in Culver City, Calif., was treated to a special advance screening this week. It was part of a publicity stunt. In the lobby of the Culver Theater, a tattooed barber named K.C. shaved heads bald in exchange for free tickets for  Bugonia . First in line was Matt Lopez, a 29-year-old Disneyland ride operator. \"Ever since I saw the trailer about six months ago, I'm like 'yeah, I'm definitely down for this,'\" he said as his shoulder length brown locks were lopped off. \"So if I'm able to see this early and get a free haircut at the same time, it's a no-brainer.

If they stopped, they were escorted out. Beyond using traditional media, Craig says studios are trying everything they can to get people back to the cinema. \"Something that's off the wall and gets the internet's attention,\" he says.

\n         By Colin Dwyer \n        \n           Tuesday, October 21, 2025 • 1:03 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Don't even think about reading these new books — at least, not unless they shape up real quick and start respecting the venerable genre distinctions of our forebears. The last thing we want to do is encourage the kind of troublingly seductive world they represent, in which memoir can just be mixed willy-nilly with fiction, and history, and fantasy and philosophy and … well, you get the idea. We teeter on the cusp of utter madness. Won't somebody  please  think of the genres! OK, I'll admit: I'm being a bit facetious here. All six of the following notable releases do deserve your attention for one reason or another — many, precisely  for  their spry dance with the expectations established by the genres they invoke. But I do ask that, when you pull one of them down and crack it open, you at least spare a thought for the poor, polite label that has been left behind, flaunted and dejected, on the bookshelf where it had stood. Looking for Tank Man , by Ha Jin Jin Xuefei had been in the U.S. for what was to be a temporary stay, pursuing graduate studies after his time in the Chinese army, when tanks rolled into Tiananmen Square in 1989. He never returned to China; he began writing in English as Ha Jin,  condemned Chinese censorship  and claimed several of America's highest regarded  literary prizes . But the violent suppression of student protests at Tiananmen —  his \"turning point,\"  he told NPR in 2014 — continues to haunt him in his effective exile. In his latest novel, a fictional Chinese graduate student, studying in the U.S. years later, turns her research toward comprehending and coming to terms with the massacre — and reckoning with the urgency of keeping its memory alive. Bad Bad Girl , by Gish Jen  Don't call Jen's new book a memoir, exactly. This gimlet-eyed account of a difficult mother-daughter relationship makes up too much stuff to qualify; but then, to call the book a novel feels misleading too. The book  is  a candid portrait of her relationship with her mother, Agnes, even if it steers more toward emotional truth than factual accuracy. We can leave these questions for the philosophers, or whoever decides the genre tags on Amazon. (Same difference?) The point is, Jen has applied her peculiar set of skills — a candid but big-hearted style once described by  Fresh Air's  Maureen Corrigan as  \"Frank Capra-esque\"  — to one of the central dramas of her own life. Big Kiss, Bye-Bye , by Claire Louise-Bennett Louise-Bennett's books don't tend to lend themselves to snappy back-cover summaries. Conflict and other traditional fiction-fuels  are  found in them, sure; it's just that those external stimuli often end up feeling secondary to the expansive inner life of her unnamed narrator. In her latest novel, as in  Pond  and  Checkout 19  before it, a snapshot of the action — in this case, a woman reflecting on her memories of a fading relationship and wondering at the nature of love — doesn't exactly scream \"page-turner.\" But when the pages are actually turning, the effect,  as a reviewer explained for NPR , can be \"unusual, and so unsettlingly pleasurable.\" Motherland: A Feminist History of Modern Russia, from Revolution to Autocracy , by Julia Ioffe Now here's another book with no respect for the sanctity of bookshelf labels. The veteran journalist's first book is a mongrel mixed from memoir, history and reportage, in which Ioffe's own memories mingle with archival dives and on-the-ground conversations. What emerges is a portrait of Russia's past and present, viewed from the fluctuating social and legal positions of its women. For what it's worth, the trajectory of their social standing under today's oligarchy doesn't appear particularly positive.  Motherland  is one of just five books that  still stand a chance of winning  this year's National Book Award for nonfiction. This Is the Only Kingdom , by Jaquira Díaz The hardscrabble early years of Díaz's life in Puerto Rico and Miami, veined as they were with poverty, casual peril and a precarious mother-daughter relationship, boasted enough drama to fill a book in their own right — and indeed they did: her first book,  the 2019 memoir  Ordinary Girls . In her second book, Díaz plies her skills in fiction, with a debut novel that spans generations and centers some rather shaky mother-daughter bonds of its own, amid the tumult of the Puerto Rican barrio. The Rose Field: The Book of Dust, Volume 3,  by Philip Pullman It was in the mid-1990s Pullman published  The Golden Compass , his first novel in what became the His Dark Materials trilogy. An all but immediate international sensation, the original trilogy spawned dozens of translations and a veritable host of screen and radio adaptations — and now, just about three decades later, a completed  follow-up trilogy in print .  The Rose Field  answers the cliff-hangers of  its direct predecessor,  The Secret Commonwealth , and puts a bow on this heady, hefty return to Pullman's beguiling world of daemons, witches and armored ursines. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/picasso-auction-dora-maar-ded858e6f38a8c807553e3a4d522619f","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"15:04:10+00:00","title":"Picasso’s Dora Maar Portrait Sells for $37 Million at Paris Auction","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A vivid 1943 portrait of Dora Maar by Picasso, painted during the end of their relationship, sold at auction in Paris for 32 million euros (about $37 million), surpassing expectations and setting the highest price for any artwork at auction in France this year.

public view for more than eight decades sold Friday at auction for 32 million euros (about $37 million), including fees — surpassing expectations but far from the artist’s most expensive work ever auctioned. Painted in July 1943, “Bust of a Woman with a Flowered Hat (Dora Maar)” depicts Maar in a brightly colored floral hat. Maar, an artist and photographer herself, had been Picasso’s partner and muse for about seven years, and the relationship was coming to a painful close. The work was purchased in 1944 and had not been on the market since, remaining in the family collection. The painting, part of Picasso’s “Woman in a Hat” series, was auctioned at the Drouot auction house in Paris. Auctioneer Christophe Lucien called the final sale, to a buyer in the room, “an enormous success,” as well as a very emotional moment. He said the price — 32,012,397 euros after adding buyer fees to the 27-million hammer price — was not only well above estimates but also the highest paid at auction this year for any artwork in  France . \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Lucien called the painting “a little piece of the story of love” — albeit a bittersweet one — between Picasso and Maar. She was 29 when she met the artist and quickly became his muse and the model for  “Guernica,”  among other works. He later left her for the younger Francoise Gilot and she died at 89, having lived an increasingly reclusive life. \n\n Theirs “was not a very simple story,” Lucien said, adding that the painting came at the end of it. “You see that she was containing tears because she understood that Picasso was leaving her.” \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n At a preview this week, Picasso specialist Agnès Sevestre-Barbé marveled at how vivid the portrait has remained. “We have a painting that is exactly as it was when it left the studio,” she said. “It wasn’t varnished, which means we have all its raw material, all of it. It’s a painting where you can feel all the colors, the entire chromatic range.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “It’s a painting that speaks for itself,” she added. “You just have to look at it — it’s full of expression, and you can see all of Picasso’s genius.” Previously, Sevestre-Barbé noted, the work had only been seen in a black-and-white photograph. “We couldn’t imagine from this photo that this painting was so colorful, so amazing, really.” Auctioneer Lucien said before the sale that the work was of huge interest across the globe. “It’s being talked about in all the world capitals with a strong art market, from the United States to Asia, and of course through all the major European markets,” he said.  Though selling above expectations, the work was far from the most expensive Picasso work sold at auction. In 2023, the artist’s famed “Femme à la montre” (“Woman with a Watch”) — portraying another muse, Marie-Thérèse Walter — sold for $139.4 million, the second most valuable Picasso sold at auction. The most valuable was $179.4 million, paid in 2015 for a version of “Les Femmes d’Alger” (“Women of Algiers”). ____ Associated Press writer Jocelyn Noveck contributed from New York."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/storm-melissa-caribbean-jamaica-haiti-dominican-republic-5532dedc71d40c74a88679ee899ffc5d","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"04:48:59+00:00","title":"Tropical Storm Melissa poised to become a hurricane and drop torrential rain on Caribbean","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tropical Storm Melissa, currently near Jamaica and southwest Haiti, is expected to strengthen into a major hurricane with up to 35 inches of rain falling on Haiti’s Tiburon Peninsula and up to 25 inches in Jamaica and the Dominican Republic.

(AP) —  Tropical Storm Melissa  was nearly stationary in the central  Caribbean  on Friday as forecasters warned it could strengthen and swipe Jamaica as a powerful hurricane and dump a staggering amount of rain — up to 35 inches (89 centimeters) — on southwest Haiti, where they warned of catastrophic flooding and landslides.  The erratic storm was expected to drop copious rain on Jamaica and the southern regions of Haiti and the  Dominican Republic . At least three people were killed in Haiti, and one person was killed and one reported missing in Dominican Republic. “These heavy rains are just going to sit over one area for several days,” said Jamie Rhome, deputy director at the U.S. National Hurricane Center. The storm was located about 180 miles (290 kilometers) southeast of Kingston,  Jamaica , and about 245 miles (390 kilometers) southwest of Port-au-Prince, Haiti. It had maximum sustained winds of 65 mph (100 kph) and was moving northwest at 3 mph (6 kph), the U.S. center said. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n A hurricane watch and a tropical storm warning were in effect for Jamaica and Haiti’s southwest peninsula. \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Russia faces a shrinking and aging population and tries restrictive laws to combat it \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             6 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Tropical Storm Melissa poised to become a hurricane and drop torrential rain on Caribbean \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             2 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Europe fights to avoid being sidelined by Trump’s world-shaping plans \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             6 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n The center of Melissa is expected to move near or over Jamaica early next week, forecasters said.

Haiti’s Civil Protection Agency said a landslide in Port-au-Prince killed two people and injured another, with the death toll rising to three. Earlier this week, a large tree fell on an elderly man in southern Haiti and killed him, while five other people in the country’s central region were injured in flooding, The U.N. said it has prepared more than 100 emergency shelters in Haiti’s southern region. Wilgar Joseph said he and his family were leaving their home in Les Cayes out of safety because it has a zinc roof. “I’ll stay with a friend whose home is on higher ground so I can protect myself in case it gets out of control,” he said. Meanwhile, thousands of people living in makeshift shelters across Port-au-Prince after gangs forced them to flee their homes worried about the storm. “The message on the radio is to protect ourselves,” said Dina Georges. “How can I protect myself if I don’t have a home? I’m on the streets. And on top of that, I have two kids to protect.” Nephtali Johnson Pierre, 35, echoed those sentiments: “I’m dealing with two storms: the gangs and the weather.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n ‘A slow-moving disaster’ Melissa was expected to move toward Jamaica over the weekend. It was forecast to strengthen into a hurricane by Saturday and become a major hurricane by Sunday, possibly reaching Category 4 status before dawn on Monday. Forecasters said that Jamaica could see life-threatening flooding and landslides because the ground is already saturated from recent heavy rains unrelated to the storm. The storm is moving so slowly that parts of Jamaica could experience hurricane conditions for 72 hours or longer, said Alex DaSilva, AccuWeather’s lead hurricane expert. “Melissa is evolving into a slow-motion disaster,” he said. “Millions of people are at risk of catastrophic impacts. We are increasingly concerned about the threat of a humanitarian disaster unfolding, especially if this storm stalls.” Marcus Thompson, who lives in Kingston, said he covered his windows and stocked up on water and canned food. “We’ve been through storms before, but it’s better to be prepared early this time,” he said. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Others checked their roofs, cleaned gutters and charged electrical devices. “I moved my car to higher ground and gathered all essential documents just in case,” said Alton Williams, who lives in Mandeville. In eastern Kingston, Veronica James said she was following updates and keeping her children informed. “If officials decide evacuation is necessary, we have a small bag ready with medicine and important papers,” she said. Schools, health centers and government offices closed across Jamaica on Thursday, with authorities warning that all airports would close within 24 hours if a hurricane warning is issued. More than 650 shelters were activated. Jamaican  Prime Minister Andrew Holness  said the storm’s slow movement posed planning difficulties but noted the public sector would close by Friday afternoon. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “Jamaica is at risk,” he said. “There is a threat.” The Bahamas’ Foreign Affairs Ministry announced it would evacuate Bahamian students out of Jamaica on Friday ahead of the storm. Flooding persists in Dominican Republic The storm has damaged nearly 200 homes in the  Dominican Republic  and knocked out water supply systems, affecting more than half a million customers. It also downed trees and traffic lights and unleashed a couple of small landslides. All public schools across the Dominican Republic were closed Friday, as were government offices in 12 provinces under alert. More than two dozen communities were cut off by floodwaters. “This is an event that we should be following minute by minute,” said Juan Manuel Méndez García, emergency operations director in the Dominican Republic.  Officials noted that evacuations in areas under alert were mandatory. “The main thing here is to save lives. The risk is the enormous amount of rain,” said Dominican President Luis Abinader. Melissa is the 13th named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30. The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration had predicted an above-normal season with 13 to 18 named storms. ___ Myers Jr. reported from Kingston, Jamaica and Sanon from Port-au-Prince, Haiti."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/lithuania-russia-military-planes-airspace-f9d31aa920ee91c95103d902967d3b24","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"18:06:20+00:00","title":"Russian Military Aircraft Briefly Violate Lithuanian Airspace, Sparking NATO Response","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On October 23, 2025, Russian military aircraft, including a Su-30 fighter and an IL-78 refueling plane, briefly violated Lithuanian airspace, prompting President Gitanas Nausėda to condemn the act as a blatant breach of international law and territorial integrity.

condemning what he called a blatant breach of the territorial integrity of his European Union and NATO-member country.  Lithuania’s foreign ministry planned to summon Russian Embassy representatives in the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius to protest the violation, President Gitanas Nausėda said in a post on the social media platform X.  “This is a blatant breach of international law and territorial integrity of Lithuania,” Nausėda wrote on X. “Once again, it confirms the importance of strengthening European air defence readiness.” Russia’s Defense Ministry, meanwhile, rejected the Lithuanian claim that Russian fighter jets had intruded into its airspace.

constituency that helped secure his victory  in the 2024 election.  The October survey from  The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research  finds that 25% of Hispanic adults have a “somewhat” or “very” favorable view of Trump, down from 44% in  an AP-NORC poll  conducted just before the Republican took office for the second time.

But the poll now finds that Hispanic adults are slightly less likely to approve of Trump’s handling of the economy and immigration — two issues that were major strengths for him in last year’s presidential campaign — and their views of his overall presidential performance have slipped a little as well. In March, 41% of Hispanic adults approved of the way Trump was handling his job as president, but now that has fallen to 27%.  \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n Over the past few months, Hispanic communities have also been a target of  the president’s hard-line immigration tactics . The poll found that Hispanic adults’ approval of his handling of immigration has declined slightly since March. Some see the two issues as linked. Trump’s attacks on immigration have  affected low-wage and high-skilled workers alike , at a moment when the economy is already uncertain because of his erratic trade policies.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Fel Echandi, of Winter Haven, Florida, is a behavioral specialist who identifies as a Democrat but sometimes votes for Republican candidates. He said he appreciates  Trump’s views on transgender issues , including restroom access for transgender women. But he’s concerned that Trump’s immigration policies leave many people living in fear, with negative effects on the economy.  “A lot of people rely on immigrants to do labor in certain areas,” Echandi said. “When that gets affected, all prices go up. Our food costs more because of the costs to get people to do that work.”  The poll found particularly high levels of financial stress among Hispanic adults, compared with the rest of the country. More Hispanics say the cost of groceries, housing and health care and the amount of money they get paid are “major” sources of stress, compared with U.S. adults overall. \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     !function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][a]+\"px\"}}}))}(); \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n Favorability among Hispanic Republicans drops slightly Views of Trump have even soured a little among Hispanic Republicans.  In the latest poll, 66% of Hispanic Republicans said they have a “very” or “somewhat” favorable view of Trump. That’s a slight shift compared with where Trump stood in  an AP-NORC poll from September 2024 , when 83% of Hispanic Republicans viewed him at least “somewhat” favorably. About 8 in 10 white Republicans had a favorable view of Trump in the new poll, which was unchanged from the year before. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n In another potentially worrying sign for the president, younger Hispanics and Hispanic men — two groups that  swung particularly dramatically  toward him in last year’s election — also see him a bit more negatively. About two-thirds of Hispanic adults under age 45 and Hispanic men now view Trump unfavorably, according to the new poll. That’s a slight uptick from September 2024, when about half in both groups had a negative opinion of him. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Other concerns about Trump’s chaotic second term emerged in interviews. Teresa Covarrubias, a 65-year-old retired schoolteacher from Los Angeles, feels things are going in the wrong direction and said she was troubled by how some of Trump’s actions have defied norms and may impact social safety net programs. “My major concern is the disregard for the Constitution and the law, and then also the level of cronyism,” said Covarrubias, who is an independent voter. “The people at the top are just grifting and taking, and then there’s the rest of us.” Hispanic adults are more likely to prioritize immigration There are signs in the poll that Trump’s tough immigration approach may be alienating some Hispanic adults. Over the past few months, the president has  doubled down on his pledge  of mass deportations, with  escalating crackdowns  in Latino neighborhoods in cities including Chicago. The poll found that, in general, Hispanic adults are more likely to say immigration is an important issue to them personally. About two-thirds of Hispanic adults prioritize immigration, compared with about 6 in 10 white adults and about half of Black adults. And although their views on immigration enforcement aren’t uniform, Hispanic adults are much less likely than U.S. adults overall to favor deporting all immigrants living in the U.S. illegally. About one-quarter of Hispanic adults support this policy, the new poll found, while roughly half of them are opposed and the rest don’t have an opinion. Among U.S. adults overall, about 4 in 10 favor deporting all immigrants in the U.S. illegally, while 34% are opposed and about 2 in 10 don’t have an opinion. Rick Alvarado, 63, a Republican who lives in San Diego, says he still supports Trump and praised his actions to cut public spending. Alvarado, a property manager, is behind Trump’s  immigration crackdown  in cities including Los Angeles and Chicago, saying he believes some immigrants are involved in organized crime. But he added that he would like to see a solution for those without criminal records to obtain legal residency status. “The people who are productive should have a pathway to stay here somehow,” Alvarado said. ___ The AP-NORC poll of 1,289 adults was conducted Oct. 9-13, using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for adults overall is plus or minus 3.8 percentage points. The margin of sampling error for Hispanic adults overall is plus or minus 6.9 percentage points."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/canada-trump-tariffs-reagan-tariffs-e0e6a8f1fa49f00c9e8d08df405ee299","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"14:10:35+00:00","title":"Ontario Pauses Anti-Tariff Ads After Trump Ends Trade Talks","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ontario Premier Doug Ford announced he would pause a taxpayer-funded anti-tariff advertising campaign that used audio from former President Ronald Reagan’s 1987 radio address on trade, following U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to end all trade negotiations with Canada.

Trump  announced he’s ending “all trade negotiations” with Canada because of a television ad sponsored by Ontario that used the words of former President Ronald Reagan to criticize U.S. tariffs.  “We’ve achieved our goal, having reached U.S. audiences at the highest levels,” Ford said in a statement.  “Our intention was always to initiate a conversation about the kind of economy that Americans want to build and the impact of tariffs on workers and businesses.” Ford said the commercials will continue to run this weekend including during the first World Series games between the Toronto Blue Jays and Los Angeles Dodgers.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “I’ve directed my team to keep putting our message in front of Americans over the weekend so that we can air our commercial during the first two World Series games,” he said.  \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Europe fights to avoid being sidelined by Trump’s world-shaping plans \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             6 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 More anti-abortion pregnancy centers offer medical services as Planned Parenthood clinics close \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             6 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Early voting begins in New York City mayor’s race and contest to pick New Jersey’s next governor \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             2 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n Indeed, the ad aired Friday night during the seventh inning of Fox’s national broadcast of Game 1.

Trump’s call for an  abrupt end to negotiations  has further inflamed trade tensions between the neighbors and longtime allies.  Carney said this week he aims to double his country’s  exports to countries outside the U.S.  because of the threat posed by Trump’s tariffs. Canadian officials remain ready to continue talks to reduce tariffs in certain sectors, he said.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “We can’t control the trade policy of the United States. We recognize that that policy has fundamentally changed from the 1980s,” Carney said Friday morning before boarding a flight to Asia. “We have to focus on what we can control and realize what we can’t control.” Carney is trying to secure  a trade deal with Trump , but tariffs are  taking a toll  in the aluminum, steel, auto and lumber sectors. Carney spoke to Ford Thursday night and again Friday.  White House spokesman Kush Desai said talks with Canada have not led to any constructive progress.  “Ontario’s taxpayer-funded ad campaign on American TV networks — that misleadingly edited President Reagan’s 1987 radio address about trade — is the latest example of how Canadian officials would rather play games than engage with the Administration,” Desai said in a statement.  “As President Trump made clear on Truth Social, further talks are a futile effort if Canada can’t be serious.” The Ontario government has said it would pay about $75 million Canadian (US$54 million) for the ads to air across multiple American television stations using audio and video of Reagan speaking about tariffs in 1987. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Ford said earlier this week he had heard that Trump had seen the ad.  “I’m sure he wasn’t too happy,” Ford said.  He said the aim is to “blast” the pro-trade message to Americans.  “It’s real, because it was coming from the best president the country’s ever seen, Ronald Reagan,” Ford said. “I feel the Reagan Republicans are going to be fighting with the MAGA group, and let’s hope, Reagan Republicans win.” Ford is a populist conservative who doesn’t belong to the same party as Carney, a Liberal.  Manitoba Premier Wab Kinew and British Columbia Premier David Eby backed Ford.  “It’s clear that these ads are working. If you throw a rock at a lake and you don’t hear a splash, you probably missed. So to my good friend Doug Ford, keep the ads on TV. They’re effective, and this country is behind you,” Kinew said.  Daniel Béland, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal, said the ad has backfired “big time.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Trump has been threatening Canada’s economy and sovereignty with  tariffs , most offensively by claiming Canada could be  “the 51st state.” Jason Kenney, a former Conservative cabinet minister under ex-Prime Minister Stephen Harper, called Trump’s posts “just embarrassing.” “The Ontario ad does not misrepresent President Reagan’s anti-tariff radio address in any respect whatsoever. It is a direct replay of his radio address, formatted for a one minute ad,” Kenney posted on social media. Kenney also took aim at the Reagan Foundation, saying it “now has gormless leadership which is easily intimidated by a call from the White House, yet another sign of the hugely corrosive influence of Trump on the American conservative movement.”"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/doj-election-monitors-new-jersey-california-voting-30d355a9ced990218772eeff1b6642b3","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"14:34:30+00:00","title":"DOJ Prepares to Send Federal Election Observers to California and New Jersey","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Department of Justice is preparing to send federal election observers to Passaic County, New Jersey, and five California counties (Los Angeles, Orange, Kern, Riverside, and Fresno) ahead of the Nov. 4 off-year elections.

and New Jersey next month, targeting two Democratic states holding off-year elections following requests from state Republican parties. The DOJ announced Friday that it is planning to monitor polling sites in Passaic County, New Jersey, and five counties in southern and central California: Los Angeles, Orange, Kern, Riverside and Fresno. The goal, according to the DOJ, is “to ensure transparency, ballot security, and compliance with federal law.” “Transparency at the polls translates into faith in the electoral process, and this Department of Justice is committed to upholding the highest standards of election integrity,” Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement to The Associated Press. Election monitoring is a routine function of the Justice Department, but the focus on California and New Jersey comes as both states are set to hold closely-watched elections with national consequences on Nov. 4. New Jersey has an  open seat for governor  and California is holding a special election aimed at  redrawing the state’s congressional map  to counter Republican gerrymandering efforts elsewhere ahead of the 2026 midterms. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The DOJ’s efforts are the latest salvo in the GOP’s preoccupation with election integrity after President  Donald Trump  spent years  refusing to accept the results  of the 2020 election and falsely  railing against mail-in voting  as rife with fraud. Democrats fear the new administration will attempt to gain an upper hand in next year’s midterms with similarly unfounded allegations of fraud. \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Early voting begins in New York City mayor’s race and contest to pick New Jersey’s next governor \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             2 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Mitchell scores 35 as Cavaliers outlast Nets 131-124 \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             1 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Brunson scores 31 points, Knicks ride huge 2nd quarter to 105-95 victory over the Celtics \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             1 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n The announcement comes days after the Republican parties in both states wrote letters to the DOJ requesting their assistance. Some leading Democrats in the states blasted the decision. New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin called the move “highly inappropriate” and said the DOJ “has not even attempted to identify a legitimate basis for its actions.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n California’s House districts at stake The letter from the California GOP, sent Monday and obtained by the AP, asked Harmeet Dhillon, who leads the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division, to provide monitors to observe the election in the five counties. “In recent elections, we have received reports of irregularities in these counties that we fear will undermine either the willingness of voters to participate in the election or their confidence in the announced results of the election,” wrote GOP Chairwoman Corrin Rankin. The state is set to vote Nov. 4 on a redistricting proposition that would  dramatically redraw California’s congressional lines  to add as many as five additional Democratic seats to its U.S. House delegation.  California is one of at least  eight states  the Justice Department has sued as part of a wide-ranging request for  detailed voter roll information  involving at least half the states. The department has not said why it wants the data. Brandon Richards, a spokesman for Gov. Gavin Newsom, said the DOJ has no standing to “interfere” with California’s election because the ballot contains only a state-specific initiative and has no federal races. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “Deploying these federal forces appears to be an intimidation tactic meant for one thing: suppress the vote,” he said in an email.  But Orange County Registrar of Voters Bob Page said it’s common to have local, state, federal and even international observers and welcomes anyone who wants to watch the county’s operations. Los Angeles County Clerk Dean Logan said election observers are standard practice across the country and that the county, with 5.8 million registered voters, is continuously updating and verifying its voter records. “Voters can have confidence their ballot is handled securely and counted accurately,” he said. Most Californians vote using mail ballots returned through the postal service, drop boxes or at local voting centers. But in pursuit of accuracy and counting every vote, the nation’s most populous state has gained a reputation for tallies that can drag on for weeks — and sometimes longer. In 2024, it took until early December to declare Democrat Adam Gray the  winner  in his Central Valley district, the final congressional race to be decided in the nation last year. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Passaic County the target in New Jersey California’s request echoed a similar  letter sent by New Jersey Republicans  asking the DOJ to dispatch election monitors to “oversee the receipt and processing of vote-by-mail ballots” and “monitor access to the Board of Elections around the clock” in suburban Passaic County ahead of the state’s governor’s race. The New Jersey Republican State Committee told Dhillon that federal intervention was necessary to ensure an accurate vote count in the  heavily Latino county  that was  once a Democratic stronghold , but shifted to President  Donald Trump’s  column in last year’s presidential race. The county could be critical to GOP gubernatorial nominee Jack Ciattarelli’s hopes against Democrat Mikie Sherrill.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The letter, which cited previous voter fraud cases in the county and alleged a “long and sordid history” of vote-by-mail shenanigans, came after Republicans said Democratic members of the Passaic County Board of Elections voted against implementing additional security measures, including using cameras in ballot storage areas.  In 2020, a judge  ordered a new election  for a city council seat in Paterson — the largest city in Passaic County — after the apparent winner and others were charged with voter fraud. “The reason that we have concerns about this is because there’s been a significant history of fraud,” said Kate Gibbs, executive director of the NJGOP, which is also weighing whether to request additional DOJ monitoring in a number of other counties.  Platkin said the state is committed to ensuring its elections are fair and secure. With the DOJ’s announcement, he said the attorney general’s office is “considering all of our options to prevent any effort to intimidate voters or interfere with our elections.” Election observers are nothing new Local election offices and polling places around the country already have observers from both political parties to ensure rules are followed. The DOJ also has a long history of sending observers to jurisdictions that have histories of voting rights violations to ensure compliance with federal civil rights laws. Trump has for years railed against mail voting as part of his repeated  false claims  that former President  Joe Biden’s victory  in 2020 was rigged. He alleges it is riddled with fraud, even though numerous studies have found no evidence of widespread fraud in U.S. elections. Earlier this year,  Trump pledged  to ban vote-by-mail across the country, something he has  no power to do  under the U.S. Constitution. The DOJ’s effort will be overseen by Dhillon’s Civil Rights Division, which will deploy personnel in coordination with U.S. attorney’s offices and work closely with state and local officials, the department said. The department also is soliciting further requests for monitoring in other jurisdictions. David Becker, a former DOJ attorney who has served as an election monitor and trained them, said the only federal laws the department has the jurisdiction to enforce in state elections are ones that prevent discrimination against racial minorities. “It’s a very high bar to justify Washington’s intervention into state-only elections,” said Becker, executive director of the Center for Election Integrity & Research. Still, Becker said that if monitors obey rules about not interacting with voters, poll workers or ballot counting, “I don’t think this is going to make any difference for voters.” ___ Colvin reported from New York.

2025-10-24T02:52:31+00:00\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — President  Donald Trump  announced he’s ending “all trade negotiations” with Canada because of a television ad sponsored by one of its provinces that used the words of former President Ronald Reagan to criticize U.S. tariffs — prompting the province’s leader to later pull the ad.  The post on Trump’s social media site Thursday night ratcheted up  tensions with the U.S.'s northern neighbor  after Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said he plans to double his country’s  exports to countries outside the U.S.  because of the threat posed by Trump’s tariffs.

Ford , the premier, didn’t initially back down,  posting Friday  that Canada and the U.S. are allies “and Reagan knew that both are stronger together.” Ford then provided a link to a Reagan speech where the late president voices opposition to tariffs.  Ford had said the province plans to pay $54 million (about $75 million Canadian) for the ads to air across multiple American television stations using audio and video of Reagan speaking about tariffs in 1987. Ford is a populist conservative who doesn’t belong to the same party as Carney, a Liberal. For his part, Carney said his government remains ready to continue talks to reduce tariffs in certain sectors. “We can’t control the trade policy of the United States. We recognize that that policy has fundamentally changed from the 1980s,” he said Friday morning before boarding a flight for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit in Malaysia. Trump is also traveling to the summit. But he told reporters on Air Force One that he had no intention to meet Carney there. “I don’t think there’s much they can do,” Trump said, noting he was inclined to leave the trade deal with Canada “the way it is.”  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Reagan’s foundation speaks out against ad Earlier Thursday night, the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute posted on X that the ad “misrepresents the ‘Presidential Radio Address to the Nation on Free and Fair Trade’ dated April 25, 1987.” It added that Ontario did not receive foundation permission “to use and edit the remarks” and said it was reviewing legal options.  The foundation in Simi Valley, California, is perhaps best known for maintaining the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum. Its board includes longtime Republican Party stalwarts such as former Trump Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, who resigned after the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the Capitol, and former House Speaker Paul Ryan, whose free-market philosophy often clashes with Trump’s protectionist tendencies. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Another board member is Lachlan Murdoch, the son of Rupert, who is executive chairman and CEO of Fox Corporation. The board is chaired by Fred Ryan, the former publisher and CEO of The Washington Post. Trump wrote on social media Thursday night that “The Ronald Reagan Foundation has just announced that Canada has fraudulently used an advertisement, which is FAKE, featuring Ronald Reagan speaking negatively about Tariffs.” He added, “TARIFFS ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO THE NATIONAL SECURITY, AND ECONOMY, OF THE U.S.A. Based on their egregious behavior, ALL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WITH CANADA ARE HEREBY TERMINATED.” Reagan did not actually love tariffs . He often criticized government policies — including protectionist measures such as tariffs — that interfered with free commerce and he spent much of that 1987 radio address spelling out the case against tariffs. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Blowup was a long time coming, administration officials indicate White House spokesman Kush Desai said the ad was the “latest example of how Canadian officials would rather play games than engage with the Administration.” Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, told reporters at the White House on Friday that Canada has shown a “lack of flexibility” and also cited “leftover behaviors from the Trudeau folks,” referring to former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who had a frosty relationship with the Trump administration. “If you look at all the countries around the world that we’ve made deals with, and the fact that we’re now negotiating with Mexico separately reveals that it’s not just about one ad,” Hassett said. Carney  met with Trump earlier this month  to try to ease trade tensions, as the two countries and Mexico prepare for a review of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, a trade deal Trump negotiated in his first term but has since soured on. More than three-quarters of Canadian exports go to the U.S., and nearly $3.6 billion Canadian ($2.7 billion U.S.) worth of goods and services cross the border daily. Trump initially appeared unfazed by the ad Trump said earlier in the week that he had seen the ad on TV and didn’t seem bothered by it. “If I was Canada, I’d take that same ad also,” he said Tuesday during a lunch with Republican senators.  Ontario bought more than $275,000 of ad reservations for the spot to air in 198 of the nation’s 210 media markets this month, according to data from the nonpartisan media tracking firm AdImpact. It was broadcast most frequently in the New York market, with more than 530 airings, followed by Washington, D.C., at around 280. The only other markets with more than 100 airings were those around Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and West Palm Beach, Florida. Ford previously got Trump’s attention with an electricity surcharge to U.S. states. Trump responded by doubling steel and aluminum tariffs. The president has moved to impose steep U.S. tariffs on many goods from Canada. In April, Canada’s government imposed retaliatory levies on certain U.S. goods -- but it carved out exemptions for some automakers to bring specific numbers of vehicles into the country, known as remission quotas. Trump’s tariffs have especially hurt Canada’s auto sector, much of which is based in Ontario. This month, Stellantis said it would  move a production line  from Ontario to Illinois. ___ Associated Press writers Maya Sweedler, Paul Wiseman and Darlene Superville in Washington contributed to this report."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/trump-canada-ad-tariff-reagan-trade-talks-f711559b0084b377d82d964893c67c78","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"17:16:43+00:00","title":"Trump Pulls Out of Canada Trade Talks Over Alleged Fake Reagan Tariff Ad","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump withdrew from trade negotiations with Canada after accusing Ontario’s provincial government of running a false ad that misrepresented former President Ronald Reagan’s 1987 views on tariffs.

years ago criticizing tariffs -- Trump’s favorite economic tool.

He often criticized government policies – including protectionist measures such as tariffs – that interfered with free commerce and he spent much of 1987 radio address spelling out the case against tariffs. \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n “High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars,’' he said. “The result is more and more tariffs, higher and higher trade barriers, and less and less competition. So, soon, because of the prices made artificially high by tariffs that subsidize inefficiency and poor management, people stop buying. Then the worst happens: Markets shrink and collapse; businesses and industries shut down; and millions of people lose their jobs.’' \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n But Reagan’s policies were more complicated than his rhetoric. In addition to taxing Japanese semiconductors, Reagan slapped levies on heavy motorcycles from Japan to protect Harley-Davidson. He also strong-armed Japanese automakers into accepting “voluntary’’ limitations on their exports to the United States, ultimately encouraging them to set up factories in the American Midwest and South. And he pressured other countries to push down the value of the currencies to help make American exports more competitive in world markets. Robert Lighthizer, a Reagan trade official who served as Trump’s top trade negotiator from 2017 through 2021, wrote in his 2023 memoir that “President Reagan distinguished between free trade in theory and free trade in practice.’’ In 1988, an analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute even declared Reagan “  the most protectionist president since Herbert Hoover,  the heavyweight champion of protectionists.’’ Reagan, though, was no trade warrior. Discussing his semiconductor tariffs in the April 1987 radio address, he said that he was forced to impose them because the Japanese were not living up to a trade agreement and that “such tariffs or trade barriers and restrictions of any kind are steps that I am loath to take.’’  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Trump, on the other hand, has no such reticence. He argues that tariffs can protect American industry, draw manufacturing back to the United States and raise money for the Treasury. Since returning to the White House in January, he has slapped double-digit tariffs on almost every country on earth and targeted specific products including autos, steel and pharmaceuticals. The average effective U.S. tariff rate has risen from around 2.5% at the start of the 2025 to 18%, highest since 1934, according to the Budget Lab at Yale University. Trump’s enthusiastic use of import taxes — he has proudly called himself “Tariff Man’’ — has drawn a challenge from businesses and states charging that he overstepped his authority. The Constitution gives Congress the power to levy taxes, including tariffs, though lawmakers have gradually ceded considerable authority over trade policy to the White House. The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments in the case early next month. Trump claimed Thursday that the Canadian ad was intended “to interfere with the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court, and other courts.’’"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/","dateOfPublication":"2510-10-25","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00Z","title":"News | Today's latest from Al Jazeera","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In October 2025, global political tensions intensified with the US launching military actions against Venezuelan boats and deploying its largest military presence in Latin America in decades.

2025-10-24T05:21:45+00:00\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks hit records on Friday after  an update on inflation  came in a bit less painful than feared. The S&P 500 rose 0.8% and topped  its prior all-time high , which was set earlier this month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 472 points, or 1%, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 1.1%. Both also set records.  The data on inflation is encouraging because it could mean less pain for lower- and middle-income households struggling with  still-high increases in prices  every month. Even more importantly for Wall Street, it could also clear the way for the Federal Reserve to keep cutting interest rates in hopes of giving a boost to  the slowing job market . \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     <img src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/hBG8j/full.png\" alt=\"Major US stock indexes 2025 (Line chart)\" /> \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n The Fed  just cut its main interest rate  last month for the first time this year, but it’s been hesitant to promise more relief because lower rates can make inflation worse, beyond goosing the economy and prices for investments. Following the inflation report, traders continue to bet on a near certainty that the Fed will cut rates at its next two meetings, including one next week.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “Right now, Fed officials are more concerned about the labor market than about inflation,” according to Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. “Without any evidence to the contrary, there’s nothing to really change their minds about cutting.” \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Reddit sues AI company Perplexity and others for ‘industrial-scale’ scraping of user comments \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             3 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Google and Apple face extra UK scrutiny over ‘strategic’ role in mobile platforms \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             2 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 AI can help the environment, even though it uses tremendous energy.

Criticism climbed that  stocks became too expensive  after their prices rose much faster than corporate profits. Worries also flared about  potentially bad loans  that banks made following a period of calm that may have encouraged too much risk-taking. And  President Donald Trump rattled markets  after threatening much higher tariffs on China, the world’s second-largest economy.  \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n But stocks have rebounded each time, only to push higher. Banks have characterized the industry’s hiccups as just a collection of one-offs, while  Trump is set to meet China’s leader , Xi Jinping, at a conference next week.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n And most big U.S. companies are reporting stronger profits for the latest quarter than analysts expected, as is usually the case.  Ford Motor revved 12.2% higher to lead all companies in the S&P 500 after the automaker topped analysts’ expectations for profit in the latest quarter. The company said its business is running at the high end of its  forecasted range  for financial performance this year that it set out in February.  Intel added  0.3% after reporting profit for the latest quarter that blew past analysts’ expectations. CEO Lip-Bu Tan credited the artificial-intelligence boom with “accelerating demand for compute and creating attractive opportunities.” \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     !function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][a]+\"px\"}}}))}(); \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n Google’s parent company climbed 2.7% after Anthropic announced an expansion worth  tens of billions of dollars , through which it would increase usage of Google cloud technologies for its AI chatbot, Claude.

They helped offset a drop for Newmont Mining, which fell 6.2% even though it also reported a stronger profit than expected.  The miner’s stock came into the day with a stunning gain of nearly 139% for the year so far, thanks to the surging price of gold. But gold’s run has stalled in the past few days since setting its latest record. No investment’s price goes up forever, and criticism had been growing that gold’s price had gone too far, too fast after it shot up even more than the U.S. stock market.  Many of the same factors that attracted buyers to gold this year are still there, including concerns about the mountains of debt that the U.S. and other governments worldwide are amassing. The U.S. government’s gross national debt  topped $38 trillion   this week, and the worry is that a continued acceleration will only worsen inflation. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n All told, the S&P 500 rose 53.25 points to 6,791.69. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 472.51 to 47,207.12, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 263.07 to 23,204.87. In stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. South Korea’s Kospi jumped 2.5%, and Japan’s Nikkei 225 rallied 1.4% for two of the world’s bigger moves.  In the bond market, Treasury yields held relatively steady, as the inflation solidified already high expectations for coming cuts to rates by the Fed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury edged down to 3.99% from 4.01% late Thursday. A report from the University of Michigan on Friday also said expectations for inflation among U.S. consumers remains mixed. Such numbers are important because expectations for high inflation can encourage behavior that pushes inflation even higher, creating a vicious cycle.  ___ AP Writers Teresa Cerojano and Matt Ott contributed."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/18/thousands-evacuate-philippine-coast-as-tropical-storm-fengshen-approaches","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"06:05:43+00:00","title":"Thousands evacuate Philippine coast as Tropical Storm Fengshen approaches","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Thousands of residents in Catanduanes, a vulnerable island in the Philippines, have evacuated their homes ahead of Tropical Storm Fengshen, which is expected to bring heavy rainfall and a moderate risk of coastal flooding from waves up to 1.2 meters.

fled their homes along the Pacific coast as weather experts warned of coastal flooding ahead of the approach of Tropical Storm Fengshen, rescue officials said.\n\nThe eye of the storm was forecast to brush past Catanduanes, an impoverished island of 270,000 people, later on Saturday with gusts of up to 80km/h (50mph).\n\nFengshen will bring heavy rainfall, along with a “minimal to moderate risk” of coastal flooding from 1.2-metre (3.2-foot) waves being pushed ashore, the government weather service said.\n\nMore than 9,000 residents of Catanduanes moved to safer ground, the provincial disaster office said, in an often-repeated drill on the island that has previously been the first major landmass hit by cyclones that form in the western Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe Catanduanes provincial government ordered local officials to “activate their respective evacuation plans” for residents of “high-risk areas”, including the coast, low-lying communities and landslide-prone slopes, rescue official Gerry Rubio told the AFP news agency.\n\nThe Philippines is hit by an average of 20 storms and typhoons each year, striking disaster-prone areas where millions of impoverished people live.\n\nScientists warn that storms are becoming more powerful as the planet warms due to human-driven climate change.\n\nFengshen comes as the country is still reeling from a series of major earthquakes and typhoons

China-owned chipmaker Nexperia?\n\nThe Dutch government has intervened to take effective control of technology group Nexperia, which is owned by Chinese group Wingtech Technology.\n\nThe decision comes amid a growing rift between China and the West over the development of technology such as computer chips and semiconductors, which are essential components for the manufacture of artificial intelligence (AI) technology.\n\nHere is more about what the Dutch government announced, why and what happens next.\n\nIn a statement released on Sunday, the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs said it had invoked the “highly exceptional” Goods Availability Act to intervene and take control of Nexperia on September 30.\n\nThe Goods Availability Act allows the Netherlands to intervene in privately owned companies in exceptional circumstances, such as if the government perceives a threat to the country’s economic security or if it is necessary to ensure that critical goods remain available.\n\nThe move followed an emergency hearing by the Dutch Enterprise Chamber on October 7, which concluded that there may be “valid reasons to doubt sound management at Nexperia under the leadership of former CEO Zhang Xuezheng”, a statement from the company said.\n\nThe Dutch Enterprise Chamber is a special division of the Amsterdam Court of Appeal, which hears corporate law cases and other matters that could have major social or financial consequences.\n\nIn its statement, the government said the intervention had been carried out “due to serious administrative shortcomings” at Nexperia, which “posed a threat to the continuity and safeguarding on Dutch and European soil of crucial technological knowledge and capabilities”.\n\nIt claimed that the intervention would ensure Nexperia’s finished and semi-finished products would remain available in case of an emergency.\n\nThe ministry added that “losing these capabilities could pose a risk to Dutch and European economic security.”\n\nFollowing this intervention, it said, “the company’s regular production process can continue.”\n\nHowever, it added, “Based on the order, decisions within the company can be blocked or reversed if they are (potentially) harmful to the company’s interests, its future as a Dutch and European company, and/or the preservation of this crucial value chain for Europe.”\n\nThe statement said that “involved parties” can appeal the decision in court.\n\nNexperia is a global semiconductor manufacturer headquartered in Nijmegen, the Netherlands. It emerged as a result of electronics group Philips’ purchase of London-based Mullard Radio Valve Company and Hamburg-based Valvo in the 1920s, ultimately forming Philips’ semiconductor operation. In 2006, Philips spun off its semiconductor division, which became NXP Semiconductors, and this was later sold to a consortium of investors led by Beijing Jianguang Asset Management (JAC Capital). Wingtech acquired Nexperia from that consortium for $3.63bn in 2018.\n\nAccording to its website, Nexperia employs 12,500 people in Europe, Asia and the United States.\n\nNexperia’s manufacturing site spans more than 80,000 square metres (861,000dsq feet) and has the capacity to build more than 50 billion components annually. It also has sales offices and research-and-development sites in China.\n\nOn Tuesday, Nexperia announced that it had suspended Zhang, founder of Wingtech, as a director and removed him as chief executive officer (CEO). It has appointed Stegan Tilger, chief financial officer (CFO), as interim CEO.\n\n“Due to the same serious managerial shortcomings, the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs observed that Nexperia’s operations in Europe were being compromised in an unacceptable manner. This situation raised broader concerns for the Dutch government about the availability of semiconductor products critical to the European industry,” Nexperia’s statement said.\n\n“The combination of Zhang Xuezheng’s behaviour as CEO and (indirect) shareholder, as well as concerns about the semiconductor product availability in the Netherlands and Europe, ultimately led the Dutch government to intervene with an exceptional emergency order on the basis of the Goods Availability Act.”\n\nThe statement added that the government’s order has also prohibited Nexperia from relocating company assets, firing existing executives or making important decisions without explicit government approval for one year.\n\nNexperia said it is confident its daily operations will continue as usual.\n\nOn October 9, China  tightened export controls  for critical rare-earth metals, citing national security interests. Foreign companies must now obtain approval from Beijing before they can export the named rare-earth metals or any products that contain them. Exporters must tell the government how the products will be used.\n\nThe US is a major consumer of Chinese rare-earth metals, which are critical for its defence industry. Following China’s announcement about new export restrictions, US President Donald Trump responded by  threatening to impose a new 100 percent trade tariff  on China.\n\nBesides being used for the manufacture of smartphones, electric cars and weapons, rare-earth metals are also used in the manufacture of semiconductors, which are essential for the development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology.\n\nThe US and its Western allies in Europe have, in recent years, passed regulations restricting China’s access to Western semiconductor technology, fearing that China could reverse-engineer and manufacture the technology, moving ahead in the technological race.\n\nIn 2022, former Democratic US President Joe Biden  restricted China’s access  to US semiconductors. The new rules extended restrictions on chipmaking tools being sold to industries which support the semiconductor supply chain. They blocked these industries from accessing US technical expertise, as well as the key components required to build the machines that produce microchips.\n\nThe US further tightened these restrictions in October 2023 and, again, in December 2024.\n\nOn September 29, 2025, the US Bureau of Industry and Security extended US export control restrictions to all groups which are at least 50 percent-owned by one or more entities on the US Entity List, a list of foreign organisations and companies believed to be participating in, or are at significant risk of participating in, activities that go against US national security or foreign policy interests. These entities are subject to sanctions, export restrictions or licensing requirements. While Nexperia itself is not on the list, Wingtech was added in December 2024.\n\nThen, on October 4, China’s Ministry of Commerce announced export controls preventing Nexperia China and its subcontractors from exporting certain finished components and sub-assemblies made in China.\n\n“Nexperia is actively engaging with the Chinese authorities to obtain an exemption from these restrictions and has deployed all available resources to that end,” the Nexperia statement said.\n\n“While Nexperia has made sufficient preparations to ensure business continuity – and as the BIS rule provides for a 60-day grace period – we are confident that a solution will be found,” Nexperia said in its statement on Tuesday.\n\nCompounding all this, earlier in the year, US President Donald Trump imposed tariffs of 145 percent on Chinese imports to the US. China retaliated with a tariff of 125 percent on US goods. Both countries then reduced their tariffs for 90 days in  May  to allow for trade talks. In August, the two agreed to another 90-day pause, with the most recent round of talks taking place between US and Chinese officials in Spain last month.\n\nBut the US has also imposed restrictions on most Chinese cars from being sold in the US. These include high tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles.\n\nIn addition to its standard 10 percent car import duty, the EU announced last year that it would impose a range of additional tariffs on electric vehicles, from 7.8 percent for Tesla vehicles to 35.3 percent on China’s state-owned SAIC [Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation] vehicles.\n\nWingtech released a social media statement saying it “firmly opposes the politicisation of commercial matters”.\n\nIn the post, it deemed the Dutch government’s move “an excessive intervention based on geopolitical bias rather than a fact-based risk assessment” that is based on the “unfounded pretext of national security”.\n\nShares in Wingtech have plummeted by 10 percent on the Shanghai Stock Exchange since the announcement. As a result, Wingtech was forced to explain the situation to the exchange, saying that the Dutch government’s decision “temporarily restricts” its control over Nexperia.\n\nBeijing “consistently opposes the overstretching of national security concepts and discriminatory practices targeting companies from specific countries”, Lin Jian, spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said on Monday.\n\n“Relevant countries should genuinely uphold market principles and avoid politicising economic and trade issues.”\n\nThe European Union has been closely coordinating with Dutch officials and will now work with the Netherlands to decide what to do next to protect important tech capabilities in Europe, according to European Commission spokesperson Olof Gill."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/13/trumps-100-tariff-threat-history-of-us-trade-measures-against-china","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-13","timeOfPublication":"14:52:29Z","title":"Trump’s 100% tariff threat: History of US trade measures against China","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article details the escalating trade tensions between the United States and China, centered on a recent threat from US President Donald Trump to impose a 100% tariff on Chinese goods in response to China's export controls on rare earth metals.

of US trade measures against China\n\nChina has accused the United States of “double standards” after US President Donald Trump threatened to impose an additional 100 percent tariff on Chinese goods in response to Beijing’s curbs on exports of rare earth minerals.\n\nChina says its export control measures  announced  last week were in response to the US restrictions on its entities and targeting of Beijing’s maritime, logistics and shipbuilding industries.\n\nTrump’s tariff threats, which come weeks before the likely meeting between the US president and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, have the potential to reignite a trade war, months after Washington lowered the China tariffs from 125 to 30 percent.\n\nThe actions by the world’s two largest economies threaten to ignite a new trade war, adding further uncertainty to global trade. So what’s the recent history of US trade measures against China, and will the two countries be able to resolve their differences?\n\nOn October 9, China expanded export controls to cover 12 out of 17 rare-earth metals and certain refining equipment, effective December 1, after accusing Washington of harming China’s interests and undermining “the atmosphere of bilateral economic and trade talks”.\n\nChina also placed restrictions on the export of specialist technological equipment used to refine rare-earth metals on Thursday.\n\nBeijing justified its measures, accusing Washington of imposing a series of trade curbs on Chinese entities despite the two sides being engaged in trade talks, with the last one taking place in Madrid, Spain, last month.\n\nForeign companies now need Beijing’s approval to export products containing Chinese rare earths, and must disclose their intended use. China said the heightened restrictions come as a result of national security interests.\n\nChina has a near monopoly over rare earths, critical for the manufacture of technology such as electric cars, smartphones, semiconductors and weapons.\n\nThe US is a major consumer of Chinese rare earths, which are crucial for its defence industry.\n\nAt the end of this month, Trump and Xi are expected to meet in South Korea, and experts speculate that Beijing’s move was to gain a bargaining advantage in trade negotiations with Washington.\n\nChina’s tightening of restrictions on rare earths is “pre-meeting choreography” before Trump’s meeting with Xi, Kristin Vekasi, the Mansfield chair of Japan and Indo-Pacific Affairs at the University of Montana, told Al Jazeera.\n\nOn October 10, Trump announced the imposition of a 100 percent tariff on China, effective from November 1.\n\n“Based on the fact that China has taken this unprecedented position … the United States of America will impose a Tariff of 100 percent on China, over and above any Tariff that they are currently paying,” Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform.\n\nHe added that this would come into effect on November 1 or before that. Trump added that the US would also impose export controls on “any and all critical software”.\n\nEarlier on October 10, Trump accused China of “trade hostility” and even said he might scrap his meeting with Xi. It is unclear at this point whether the meeting will take place.\n\n“What the United States has is we have a lot of leverage, and my hope, and I know the president’s hope, is that we don’t have to use that leverage,” US Vice President JD Vance told Fox News on Sunday.\n\nChina deemed the US retaliation a “double standard”, according to remarks by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce spokesperson on Sunday.\n\nChina said Washington had “overstretched the concept of national security, abused export control measures” and “adopted discriminatory practices against China”.\n\n“We are living in an era of deeper intertwining of security and economic policies. Both the US and China have expanded their conceptions of national security, encompassing a range of economic activities,” Manoj Kewalramani, chairperson of the Indo-Pacific Studies Programme at the Takshashila Institution in Bangalore, India, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Both have also weaponised economic interdependence with each other and third parties. There are, in other words, no saints in this game.”\n\nKewalramani said China started expanding the idea of “national security” much earlier than others, especially with its “comprehensive national security concept” introduced in 2014.\n\nThrough this, China began to include many different areas, such as economics, technology, and society, under the term “national security”. This shows that China was ahead of other countries in broadening what counts as a national security issue.\n\nChina threatened additional measures if Trump went ahead with his pledge.\n\n“Willful threats of high tariffs are not the right way to get along with China. China’s position on the trade war is consistent: We do not want it, but we are not afraid of it,” the Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson said in a statement.\n\n“Should the US persist in its course, China will resolutely take corresponding measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,” the statement said.\n\n“US policy explicitly targets Chinese firms linked to the military or advanced technology sectors. Whether that’s justified national security screening or discrimination is a matter of framing, but the policy design is undeniably China-specific,” Vekasi said.\n\nA month after taking office for his second term, Trump signed an executive order imposing a 10 percent tariff on all imports from China, citing a trade deficit in favour of China. In this order, he also imposed tariffs on Mexico and Canada. China levied countermeasures, imposing duties on US products in retaliation.\n\nIn March, the US president doubled the tariff on all Chinese products to 20 percent as of March 4. China imposed a 15 percent tariff on a range of US farm exports in retaliation; these took effect on March 10.\n\nTrump announced his  “reciprocal tariffs” , imposing a 34 percent tariff on Chinese products. China retaliated, also announcing a 34 percent tariff on US products. This was the first time China announced export controls on rare earths.\n\nHours after the reciprocal tariffs went into effect, Trump paused them for all his tariff targets except China. The US and China continued to hike tit-for-tat levies on each other.\n\nTrump slapped 145 percent tariffs on Chinese imports, prompting China to hit back with 125 percent tariffs. Washington and Beijing later cut tariffs to 30 percent and 10 percent, respectively, in May, then agreed to a 90-day truce in August for trade talks. The truce has been extended twice.\n\nIn December 2024, Trump’s predecessor, former US President Joe Biden, tightened controls on the sale of microchips first introduced in October 2022.\n\nUnder the new controls, 140 companies from China, Japan, South Korea and Singapore were added to a list of restricted entities. The US also banned more advanced chip-making equipment to certain countries. Even products manufactured abroad with US technology were restricted.\n\nBiden signed a bill into law that would ban TikTok unless it was sold to a non-Chinese buyer within a year. The US government alleged that TikTok’s Chinese parent company ByteDance was linked to the Chinese government, making the app a threat to national security.\n\nByteDance sued the US federal government over this bill in May 2024.\n\nIn September this year, Trump announced that a deal was finalised to find a new owner of TikTok.\n\nIn October 2023, Biden restricted US exports of advanced computer chips, especially those made by Nvidia, to China and other countries.\n\nThe goal of this measure was to limit China’s access to “advanced semiconductors that could fuel breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and sophisticated computers that are critical to [Chinese] military applications”, Gina Raimondo, who was secretary of the US Department of Commerce during the Biden administration, told reporters.\n\nPrior to this, Biden signed an executive order in August 2023, creating a programme that limits US investments in certain high-tech areas, including semiconductors, quantum computing, and artificial intelligence, in countries deemed to be a security risk, like China.\n\nBiden restricted China’s access to US semiconductors in October 2022. The rules further expanded restrictions on chipmaking tools to include industries that support the semiconductor supply chain, blocking both access to US expertise and the essential components used in manufacturing the tools that produce microchips.\n\nSemiconductors are used in the manufacturing of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. The US government placed these restrictions back then to limit China’s ability to acquire the ability to produce semiconductors and advance in the technological race.\n\nThe restrictions made it compulsory for entities within China to apply for licences to acquire US semiconductors. Analysis by the US-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace described these licences as “hard to get” back then.\n\nRecently, some US lawmakers are calling for even more restrictions, warning that China could quickly reverse-engineer advanced semiconductor technologies on its own, outpace the US in the sector, and gain a military edge.\n\nIn May 2020, the US Bureau of Industry and Security intensified rules to stop Huawei, the Chinese tech giant, from using US technology and software to design and make semiconductors in other countries.\n\nThe new rules said that semiconductors designed for Huawei using US technology or equipment, anywhere in the world, would need US government approval before being sent to Huawei.\n\nTrump signed an executive order blocking Chinese telecommunications companies like Huawei from selling equipment in the US. The Shenzhen-based Huawei is the world’s largest provider of 5G networks, according to analysis by the New York City-based think tank the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR).\n\nUnder this order, Huawei and 114 related entities were added to a list that requires US companies to get special permission (a licence) before selling certain technologies to them.\n\nThe rationale behind this order was the allegation that Huawei threatened US national security, had stolen intellectual property and could commit cyberespionage. Some US lawmakers alleged that the Chinese government was using Huawei to spy on Americans. The US did not publicise any evidence to back these allegations.\n\nOther Western countries had also cooperated with the US.\n\nDuring his first administration, Trump imposed sweeping 25 percent tariffs on Chinese goods worth as much as $60bn. In June of 2018, Trump announced more tariffs.\n\nChina retaliated by imposing tariffs on US products. Beijing deemed Trump’s trade policies “trade bullyism practices”, according to an official white paper, as reported by Xinhua news agency.\n\nIn September 2018, Trump issued another round of 10 percent tariffs on Chinese products, which were hiked to 25 percent in May 2019.\n\nIn 2011, during US President Barack Obama’s tenure, the US-China trade deficit reached an all-time high of $295.5bn, up from $273.1bn in the previous year.\n\nIn March 2012, the US, European Union, and Japan formally complained to China at the World Trade Organization (WTO) about China’s limits on selling rare earth metals to other countries. This move was deemed “rash and unfair” by China.\n\nIn its ruling, the world trade body said China’s export restraints were breaching the WTO rules.\n\nIn 2014, the US indicted five Chinese nationals with alleged ties to China’s People’s Liberation Army. They were charged with stealing trade technology from US companies.\n\nTrump and Xi are expected to meet in South Korea on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, which is set to begin on October 31.\n\nBut the latest trade dispute has clouded the Xi-Trump meeting.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump posted on his Truth Social platform, downplaying the threat: “Don’t worry about China, it will all be fine! Highly respected President Xi just had a bad moment. He doesn’t want Depression for his country, and neither do I. The U.S.A. wants to help China, not hurt it!!!”\n\nIn an interview with Fox Business Network on Monday, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said, “President Trump said that the tariffs would not go into effect until November 1. He will be meeting with [Communist] Party Chair Xi in [South] Korea. I believe that meeting will still be on.”\n\nWhen it comes to which of the two players is more affected by the trade war, Kewalramani said he thinks “what matters is who is willing to bear greater pain, endure greater cost.\n\n“This is the crucial question. I would wager that Beijing is probably better placed because Washington has alienated allies and partners with its policies since January. But then, China’s growing export controls are not simply aimed at the US. They impact every country. So Beijing has not also endeared itself to anyone,” Kewalramani said, pointing out how Trump’s tariffs and China’s rare earth restrictions target multiple countries.\n\n“The ones affected the most are countries caught in the midst of great power competition.”\n\nVekasi from the University of Montana said both economies are absorbing real pain in different ways.\n\n“The US can cushion the shock better because of its large domestic consumer base and still-strong upper-end spending. Inflation has hit lower-income households, but overall consumer demand remains solid,” she said.\n\n“China, by contrast, relies more heavily on exports, and the US remains a key market. Sustained export restrictions or new tariffs could make it hard for Beijing to meet its growth targets.”\n\nOn Sunday, US VP Vance told Fox News about China: “If they respond in a highly aggressive manner, I guarantee you, the president of the United States has far more cards than the People’s Republic of China.”\n\nKewalramani said so far, Beijing has been more organised, prepared and strategic than the US in its policies.\n\n“That said, it has overreached with the latest round of export controls. US policy, meanwhile, has lacked strategic coherence. The US still is the dominant global power and has several cards to play. What matters, however, is whether it can get its house in order.”\n\nVekasi said we are likely to see both the US and China keeping escalation tools in reserve, each claiming the upper hand. She added that how long that lasts will depend less on diplomacy and more on how the markets and broader global economy react in the coming weeks.\n\n“Neither side wants to look like it’s backing down. The rare earth regulations give Beijing flexibility – they can be implemented slowly, signalling resolve without fully cutting off exports. Trump, meanwhile, seems to be calibrating pressure (100% tariffs! Or maybe not!) to avoid spooking markets while still projecting toughness.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/19/pakistan-launches-its-first-hyperspectral-satellite","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"10:16:08+00:00","title":"Pakistan launches its first hyperspectral satellite","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pakistan has successfully launched its first hyperspectral satellite, H1, from China’s Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre on October 19, 2025, marking a major milestone in its space programme.

2025-10-10T11:47:27+00:00\n\nTitle: China tightens export controls on rare-earth metals: Why this matters\n\nChina tightened export controls for critical rare-earth metals on Thursday.\n\nThe new restrictions, announced by the Ministry of Commerce, come in advance of an expected meeting between United States President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, later this month.\n\nThe world’s two largest economies have been locked in trade negotiations aimed at calming tensions, after their tit-for-tat tariffs against each other earlier this year, before agreeing to pull back some of those duties.\n\nRare-earth metals are one of China’s major levers of influence with the US.\n\nIn “announcement number 61 of 2025”, China said it was increasing export controls for five rare-earth metals in addition to the  seven it announced in April this year .\n\nThe five metals added to the list are holmium, erbium, thulium, europium and ytterbium.\n\nThe seven minerals China placed export restrictions on earlier this year are samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium and yttrium.\n\nThere are 17 rare-earth metals in total – the 15 lanthanides (metallic elements) on the periodic table, as well as scandium and yttrium. China now has export restrictions on 12 of them.\n\nAdditionally, China also placed restrictions on the export of specialist technological equipment used to refine rare-earth metals on Thursday. Most of these restrictions will come into effect on December 1.\n\nThe announcement means that foreign companies will need to obtain special approvals from Beijing if they wish to export rare-earth magnets and certain semiconductor materials that have at least 0.1 percent heavy rare-earth metals from China.\n\nTo obtain the licence, foreign companies must explain the intended use of the product they wish to make using Chinese rare-earth metals.\n\nChina cited national security interests as the reason for these new restrictions.\n\n“Rare-earth-related items have dual-use properties for both civilian and military applications. Implementing export controls on them is an international practice,” a Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson told reporters.\n\nThe spokesperson added that “certain” foreign organisations and individuals have been directly transferring – or processing and then transferring – controlled rare-earth materials originating from China to “relevant organisations and individuals directly or indirectly for military and other sensitive applications”.\n\n“This has caused significant damage or posed potential threats to China’s national security and interests, adversely affected international peace and stability, and hindered global non-proliferation efforts.”\n\nRare-earth metals are essential for the production of technological equipment such as electric cars, lithium-ion batteries, LED televisions and camera lenses.\n\nThe metals are crucial for the US defence industry. According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) think tank, rare earths are used to manufacture components of F-35 fighter jets, Virginia and Columbia-class submarines, Tomahawk missiles, radar systems, Predator unmanned aerial vehicles and the Joint Direct Attack Munition series of smart bombs.\n\nAdditionally, rare earths are used to create semiconductors, which are used in artificial intelligence (AI) technology.\n\nThis is a strategic move on the part of China, analysts say.\n\nChina is the largest producer of these rare-earth metals. It mines at least 60 percent and processes about 90 percent of the world’s rare-earth metals, CSIS reported in 2024.\n\nThe new restrictions have been announced just three weeks before Trump visits South Korea to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in late October.\n\nDuring his visit, Trump is expected to meet Xi. The leaders last met in person in 2019.\n\nEarlier this year, Trump imposed tariffs of 145 percent on Chinese imports to the US. China retaliated with 125 percent tariffs. After reducing their tariffs to 30 percent and 10 percent, respectively, in May, the two sides struck a truce in August, agreeing on a 90-day pause to allow time for trade talks. That pause has since been renewed twice as talks continue – most recently between US and Chinese officials in Spain last month.\n\nChina’s new restrictions on rare-earth metals, which Trump is known to want badly, give it more leverage for these talks.\n\nGracelin Baskaran, director of the CSIS Critical Minerals Security Program, explained that the US defence industry is facing significant challenges caused by its limited production ability to meet rising defence technology needs. By restricting exports, China may be able to accelerate the expansion of its military strength at a faster pace than the US.\n\n“The new restrictions will only deepen these vulnerabilities, further widening the capability gap,” Baskaran said.\n\n“The move both strengthens Beijing’s leverage in upcoming talks while also undercutting US efforts to bolster its industrial base at a time where Indo-Pacific tension is climbing,” she said.\n\n“Most [restrictions] don’t go into effect until December 1, 2025, leaving close to 2.5 months for these negotiations.”\n\nThe Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson told reporters on Thursday: “China is willing to strengthen communication and cooperation through bilateral and multilateral export control dialogue mechanisms, promote compliant trade, and ensure the security and stability of global industrial and supply chains.”\n\nKristin Vekasi, the Mansfield chair of Japan and Indo-Pacific Affairs at the University of Montana, said Beijing’s latest moves are about leverage. She said this is a part of “pre-meeting choreography” before Trump’s meeting with Xi during the APEC summit in South Korea.\n\n“China hasn’t yet pulled the trigger on export restrictions, but it’s reminding Washington that it could. This move signals that Beijing is willing to weaponise its dominant position in the rare earths supply chain, especially as both governments prepare for a potential Trump-Xi meeting at APEC. It’s a classic signalling manoeuvre designed to strengthen China’s negotiating hand.”\n\nThe US will be especially hit hard. In 2023, it was the largest importer of Chinese rare-earth minerals and products, importing $22.8m worth of products from China, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC). In total, China exported $117m in rare-earth metals and products that year.\n\nThe US sourced 70 percent of its rare-earth compounds and metals imports from China between 2020 and 2023, according to a US Geological Survey report.\n\n“On the defence side, we’re talking about inputs for fighter jets, missile guidance systems, and more. On the civilian side, everything from smartphones and medical imaging equipment to electric vehicles depends on rare earth magnets. In other words, this isn’t just about defence but touches the everyday technologies that enable our modern life,” Vekasi said.\n\nHong Kong ($12.1m), Russia ($12.2m) and Japan ($9.42m) also import significant amounts.\n\nThe US restricted China’s access to its semiconductors in 2022 under the administration of Democratic former President Joe Biden. Some US lawmakers have pushed for greater restrictions, warning that China could reverse-engineer or independently develop advanced semiconductor technologies, overtaking the US in the industry and securing a military advantage.\n\n“China’s move shows it can make life very difficult for US manufacturers – but doing so would also hurt its own economy, since many of these supply chains run both ways. It’s a reminder that the US-China economic relationship isn’t a clean decoupling story; the two markets are still very much intertwined,” Vekasi from the University of Montana said.\n\nYes.\n\nThe Commerce Ministry spokesperson said exports pertaining to emergency medical needs, in response to public health emergencies or for disaster relief, will be exempt from the restrictions."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/23/tropical-storm-melissa-takes-aim-at-caribbean-islands-on-alert","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"06:29:43Z","title":"Tropical Storm Melissa takes aim at Caribbean, islands on alert","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tropical Storm Melissa, the first named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season to form in the Caribbean, is threatening multiple islands with life-threatening flooding and landslides due to heavy rainfall.

Organization (WMO) called for gaps in global monitoring and forecasting networks to be plugged. Timely alerts are crucial to saving lives as extreme weather events multiply due to climate change, it warned.\n\n“Many millions of people lack protection against dangerous weather, which is inflicting an increasing toll on economic assets and vital infrastructure,” said a statement by the WMO, noting that disaster-related deaths are six times higher in countries without early-warning systems.\n\nThe organisation said weather, water and climate-related hazards have killed more than 2 million people in the past 50 years. It added that 90 percent of those deaths occurred in developing countries.\n\n“Impacts are spiralling as weather becomes more extreme,” it said.\n\nThe WMO acknowledged that there has been “huge progress” in climate monitoring over the last decade. The number of countries using some form of multi-hazard early warning systems has jumped from 52 to at least 108.\n\nHowever, it continued, an assessment of 62 countries showed half of them possess only basic capacity and 16 percent have less than basic capacity.\n\n“The situation is worst in fragile, conflict and violence-affected contexts,” the organisation said.\n\nNevertheless, the WMO is seeing progress in Africa, with more countries having functioning websites and issuing standardised alerts.\n\n“Early warning means early action.

2025-10-21T02:23:04+00:00\n\nTitle: What caused Amazon’s AWS outage, and why did so many major apps go offline?\n\nA  major outage  at the Amazon Web Services (AWS) on Monday disrupted a large portion of the internet, taking down apps, websites and online tools used by millions of people around the world, before services were eventually restored.\n\nThe hours-long  breakdown  of the cloud system that supports a portion of the internet revealed just how much of modern-life depends on the infrastructure – from banking apps and airlines to smart home devices and gaming platforms.\n\nHere is what we know:\n\nAt about 07:11 GMT, Amazon’s cloud service experienced a major outage, meaning some of its systems stopped working, which disrupted many popular apps and websites, including banks, gaming platforms and entertainment services.\n\nThe problem started in one of AWS’s main data centres in Virginia, its oldest and biggest site, after a technical update to the API – a connection between different computer programmes – of DynamoDB, a key cloud database service that stores user information and other important data for many online platforms.\n\nThe root cause appears to have been an error in the update that affected the Domain Name System (DNS), which helps apps find the correct server addresses. A DNS works like the internet’s phone book, turning website names into the numeric IP addresses that computers use to connect to servers.\n\nBecause of the DNS issue, apps could not find the IP address for DynamoDB’s API and were unable to connect.\n\nAs DynamoDB went down, other AWS services also began to fail. In total, 113 services were affected by the outage. By 10:11 GMT, Amazon said that all AWS returned to normal operations, but there was a backlog “of messages that they will finish processing over the next few hours”.\n\nAt the time of publication, Downdetector, a website that tracks internet outages based on user reports, was still showing problems with platforms such as OpenAI, ESPN and Apple Music.\n\nUpdated look at the total impact of the AWS Outage up to this point! https://t.co/Bgpm1fFGtf   pic.twitter.com/TAAxjagNl6\n\n— Downdetector (@downdetector)  October 20, 2025\n\nA cloud is a way of storing and using data or programmes over the internet instead of on your computer or other physical storage devices.\n\nWhen people say something is “in the cloud”, it means the files, apps or systems are running on powerful computers (called servers) in data centres owned by companies like Amazon (AWS), Google or Microsoft, not on your personal device.\n\nIn this case, AWS allows companies to rent computing power and storage. It supplies the technology that runs websites, apps and many online services behind the scenes.\n\nOne of AWS’s core services is DynamoDB, a database that stores important information for companies, such as customer records. On Monday, Amazon reported that customers were unable to access their DynamoDB data.\n\nAWS is the biggest cloud service provider in the world.\n\nCloud outages are not rare, but they have become more noticeable as more companies rely on these services every day.\n\n“The fallout impacted people across a number of different spheres,” Joshua Mahony, the chief market analyst at Scope Markets, told Al Jazeera. [But] of course this kind of comes with the territory with tech companies; the key is they can resolve it quickly, and it doesn’t cost them a lot of money.”\n\nHe said Amazon would likely weather the storm from the incident.\n\n“You’re looking at something that is relatively contained,” he said. “Amazon Web Services has cornered 30 percent of the market alone. Their users are not going to suddenly jump ship. Their businesses are deeply ingrained.”\n\nThe outage affected dozens of websites, including Snapchat, Pinterest and Apple TV, according to Downdetector.\n\nOther communication apps were also affected including: WhatsApp, Signal, Zoom and Slack; gaming services such as Roblox, Fortnite and Xbox; and places like Starbucks. Etsy also experienced issues.\n\nIn the United States, people were having issues with financial apps too, including Venmo.\n\nSome users said their Ring doorbells and Alexa speakers stopped working, while others could not access the Amazon website or download books on their Kindles.\n\nThe language app Duolingo and creative tool Canva were among those reporting errors on their websites, and several media organisations were hit, including the Associated Press news agency, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal.\n\nBanks, the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, and AI firm Perplexity also reported issues, along with US airlines Delta and United.\n\nWhen AWS had its outage, it was not just Amazon’s tools that were affected. Thousands of other companies that use AWS for storage, databases or web hosting were also hit. These companies include many major apps that rely on AWS to run key parts of their systems.\n\n“Whenever we see these headlines, the first thought that goes through everybody’s mind, that sends a shiver up the spine, is, ‘Is this one of those cyberattacks? Is this a military or intelligence-led thing that has led to this disruption?’ And in this case, it’s not,” Bryson Bort chief executive of the cybersecurity company Scythe told Al Jazeera.\n\n“In fact, most of the time, it isn’t. It’s usually human error.”\n\nAWS  acknowledged  the outage and said engineers were “immediately engaged” to fix the problem.\n\nAWS said it worked on “multiple parallel paths to accelerate recovery”. It also reported that the main issue had been fully resolved, though some users continued to face minor delays as systems recovered.\n\nThe company also said it would publish a detailed post-event summary explaining what happened."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/24/croatia-reintroduces-mandatory-military-conscription-after-17-years","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"19:39:20+00:00","title":"Croatia reintroduces mandatory military conscription after 17 years","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Croatia has voted to reintroduce mandatory military conscription after 17 years, following the abolition in 2008, in response to rising global tensions, particularly Russia’s war in Ukraine.

after 17 years\n\nCroatian lawmakers have voted to reintroduce mandatory military service to boost the Balkan nation’s defence, in response to rising global tension and conflicts, including Russia’s war in Ukraine.\n\nThe parliament in the capital Zagreb approved an amendment to the law enacting the reinstatement by a large majority on Friday.\n\nThe country had abolished conscription in 2008, a year before joining NATO, in an effort to professionalise its military.\n\nBut top officials have since argued that international tensions require the restoration of basic military training to bolster Croatia’s defence forces.\n\n“We are seeing a rise in various types of threats … that demand swift and effective action from the broader community,” Defence Minister Ivan Anusic, from the governing conservative HDZ party, told the lawmakers this week.\n\n“In the face of any threat, defending the country is crucial.”\n\nApproximately 18,000 men would be enlisted each year for two months of training annually as they turn 18. The initiative is expected to start next year.\n\nWomen will be exempt, while conscientious objectors will be able to serve three or four months in civil service roles, including disaster response teams.\n\nDeputies amended two laws to allow the change. A total of 84 deputies of those present in the 151-seat assembly backed amendments to the defence law, while 110 voted to amend the law on service in the armed forces.\n\nAnusic’s department has been stepping up efforts to meet the potential challenges posed by Russia since the outbreak of the war in Ukraine three years ago.\n\nCroatia also wants to be better prepared for “increasing natural disasters” and other crises with more soldiers, according to the Defence Ministry.\n\nAfter the vote, people speaking to the AFP news agency on the streets of Zagreb mostly hailed the move.\n\n“The army would bring more structure – waking up early, spending less time on phones, and learning things that are very important for life, like survival skills,” said student Luka Budiselic, 23.\n\nManuela Skoblar, 51, who counts two sons among her four children, said in general military training could help young generations to “ground them a bit, help them grow up and accept life as it really is”.\n\nRegular conscripts will be paid 1,100 euros ($1,280) per month, while the amount for those serving in the alternative civil service has yet to be determined, but reports suggested it could be considerably lower.\n\nMilitary conscripts will also have an advantage when applying for jobs at public and state-run institutions after their service.\n\nLeft-wing opponents said the law discriminated against women and those who chose civil protection, as they would receive a lower wage and not be afforded preferential treatment for government jobs.\n\nThe NATO member nation of 3.8 million people joined the European Union in 2013."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/24/lithuania-shuts-airports-belarus-border-crossings-after-balloon-sightings","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"21:53:26+00:00","title":"Lithuania shuts airports, Belarus border crossings after balloon sightings","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Lithuania has closed its main airports—Vilnius and Kaunas—and border crossings with Belarus following multiple sightings of helium balloons allegedly used by smugglers to transport contraband cigarettes.

in the country losing its status as one of the only places in the world without them. The findings were confirmed by the country’s national science institute on Monday.\n\nThis follows record-breaking heat this past summer, which has sped up glacial melting in the country.\n\nOn October 16, insect enthusiast Bjorn Hjaltason posted on a Facebook group  Skordýr og Nytjadýr Á Íslandi  (Insects in Iceland) that he had spotted mosquitoes in Kjos at dusk that day.\n\nHe said he had caught some using a red wine ribbon, a trap using sweetened wine as bait to attract insects. Kjos is a glacial valley 52km (32 miles) northeast of the Icelandic capital, Reykjavik.\n\nHjaltason sent the mosquitoes to the Natural Science Institute of Iceland, where entomologist Matthias Alfredsson confirmed they were indeed mosquitoes.\n\nAlfredsson identified the mosquitoes as belonging to the Culiseta annulata species. This cold-resistant species is native to the Palearctic, which refers to Europe, North Africa and most of Asia north of the Himalayas. The Culiseta annulata are not known to carry disease but are generally considered a nuisance.\n\n“It has adapted to a rather cold climate, surviving the winter as an adult and then staying in shelter, such as outbuildings and basements. The fly stings but is not considered dangerous to humans as it does not carry any known infections in these areas,” a news release published by the Natural Science Institute on Tuesday stated.\n\nMosquito species that are well adapted to cooler conditions and can survive winters as eggs or larvae do not tend to carry disease.\n\n“Their development is slower, their active season shorter and most tropical diseases cannot complete their life cycle before cold weather sets in,” British entomologist Luke Tilley from the Royal Entomological  Society told Al Jazeera. “Cooler regions, therefore, tend to have mosquitoes but with lower disease risk.”\n\nThere are more than 3,500 species of mosquitoes around the globe, and they can be found in most parts of the world, bar a very few, including Antarctica.\n\nMosquitoes breed in shallow, stagnant bodies of water, which Iceland has in abundance. Despite having many marshes and ponds, however, it has never had a native mosquito population.\n\nThis is because mosquitoes are cold-blooded, which means they thrive in warmer environments. Male mosquitoes also feed on flowers, which thrive in warmer temperatures.\n\n“Warmer air and water speed up their growth, feeding and reproduction and also allow disease‑causing organisms inside them to develop more quickly. Longer warm seasons mean more generations of mosquitoes each year, and changes in rainfall can create new pools and puddles for breeding,” Tilley said.\n\nIceland is generally cold throughout the year. Its average temperature varies from minus 1 degree Celsius (30 degrees Fahrenheit) in the winter to 11C (52F) in the warmest months.\n\nMosquitoes lay their eggs during cold weather, and when the water thaws, the larvae hatch from the eggs. In Iceland, however, water typically freezes and thaws several times a year, making the landscape generally inhospitable for mosquitoes.\n\nBefore mosquitoes were spotted this month, the closest they had come to Iceland was in the 1980s when biologist Gisli Mar Gislason spotted one inside his aeroplane that had arrived at Keflavík International Airport from Greenland. The mosquito is preserved at the Icelandic Institute of Natural History.\n\nGislason told Al Jazeera that more mosquito species are in warm climates than cold, and the greatest diversity of mosquitoes is seen in tropical areas.\n\n“There is one species in Greenland, Aedes nigripes. It is a high Arctic species, and their density is controlled by the abundance of hosts, [such as] muskoxen, Arctic foxes, reindeers, polar bears and humans.”\n\nIn a statement, the Natural Science Institute said it is unclear how this particular mosquito species came to be in Iceland. However, it added: “It is likely that it was transported by freight. It is uncertain whether it has settled here permanently, but everything indicates that it can survive in Icelandic conditions.”\n\nA growing number of new insect species are being observed in Iceland due to a warming climate and increased transportation, the institute said.\n\nThe country is warming at an unprecedented rate. In May, Iceland and neighbouring Greenland experienced record-breaking heat due to a persistent weather pattern that brought unusually warm air from the south. In May, temperatures recorded in Iceland were 13 degrees Celsius (23.4 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the 1990-2020 average – 10 times higher than the average warming of 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) across the world as a whole.\n\nThe country’s glaciers have been rapidly melting and are projected to lose about half their volume by 2100, the country’s Vatnajokull National Park website said.\n\nYes. Warming temperatures are changing how mosquitoes behave in many parts of the world.\n\nThe World Health Organization has identified an increase in insect-borne disease as one of the biggest health threats to humans associated with climate change.\n\n“Warmer conditions can allow mosquitoes and the pathogens they carry to survive in new regions, extending the potential range of diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and West Nile virus,” Tilley said.\n\n“International travel, trade and changes in land use also play a part. The key is careful monitoring and preparedness to prevent local transmission.”\n\nIn September 2023, the United Kingdom found the eggs of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in the country for the first time near Heathrow Airport. Then in August 2024, four Aedes albopictus eggs were found at a motorway service station in Kent. No further specimens were found on investigation.\n\nThe Aedes aegypti is responsible for the spread of diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika. Aedes albopictus can also transmit diseases such as dengue and chikungunya.\n\nEuropean countries have reported increasing cases of mosquito-borne illnesses recently. Last year, Italy had more than 200 local dengue cases. France and Spain also reported cases of the disease. This year, France has recorded 500 cases of chikungunya.\n\nWarmer countries that already have high rates of mosquito-borne illnesses are seeing a surge in numbers. In September, Bangladesh recorded the largest single-day rise in both deaths and hospital admissions from dengue fever when 12 people died and 740 new people were hospitalised in just 24 hours.\n\nBesides increasing temperatures, heavy rainfall can also allow mosquitoes to thrive. The rain flushes mosquito eggs, larvae and pupae from areas where they breed to new areas. If rainwater does not drain away properly, it leaves pools of shallow, stagnant water, the ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes.\n\nTilley explained that besides the spread of disease, changing mosquito populations can also create shifts in the ecosystem. “More mosquitoes can benefit their predators such as bats, dragonflies and birds, but disease in wildlife may also rise,” he said.\n\n“A mosquito in a new area will be a prey for predators like fish, waterfowl and insect-eating insects. There is, therefore, more diversity of food for these predators,” Gislason told Al Jazeera, adding that it is difficult to predict accurately what will happen if a mosquito enters a new area. He said, however, that major changes in aquatic ecosystems in Iceland have not been observed yet.\n\nTilley said these shifts in mosquito behaviour also allow insect scientists to study climate change patterns, noting, “Insects like mosquitoes are valuable indicators of environmental change, helping insect scientists track how ecosystems respond to a warming climate.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/24/nigeria-replaces-top-security-officials-days-after-coup-plot-denial","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"20:29:21Z","title":"Nigeria replaces top security officials days after coup plot denial","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Nigeria's President Bola Tinubu replaced three top military officials—Chief of Defence Staff Christopher Musa, Chief of Naval Staff Emmanuel Ogalla, and Chief of Air Staff Hassan Abubakar—on October 24, 2025, amid allegations of a coup plot stemming from the September arrests of over a dozen military officers.

the West African country grapples with unabated violence in the conflict-hit north and myriad security challenges.\n\nFriday’s shake-up comes as the government has denied rumours of a coup plot in the wake of local media reports that more than a dozen military officers were arrested in September, including a brigadier general and a colonel.\n\n“I have approved changes in the hierarchy of our armed forces to further strengthen Nigeria’s national security architecture,” President Bola Tinubu said in a brief statement.\n\nAccording to the presidential spokesperson, Tinubu fired three top security officials on Friday – Christopher Musa, chief of defence staff; Emmanuel Ogalla, chief of naval staff, and Hassan Abubakar, chief of air staff.\n\nTinubu appointed Olufemi Oluyede, the former chief of army staff, as the new chief of defence staff.\n\nShaibu, I Abbas and SK Aneke were appointed as the chiefs of army, air force, and naval staff.\n\nThe president tasked them with improving “the professionalism, vigilance and comradeship that define the Armed Forces of Nigeria,” spokesperson Sunday Dare said in a statement.\n\nWhile the military on Saturday denied that there was a coup plot, local media and some analysts are not convinced.\n\n“Military leadership reshuffle is a very normal and regular procedure in Nigeria,” Confidence MacHarry, a security analyst at Lagos-based consultancy SBM Intelligence, told the AFP news agency.\n\nAt the same time, the “military has failed to convincingly deny” the alleged coup plot, he said.\n\n“This shake-up could thus be a means of taking the wind out of the sails of coup plotters” who reportedly complained about career stagnation “or as a means of punishment for the military chiefs for their failure to improve security”, he added.\n\nThe changes also come as Nigeria’s capital, Abuja, was shaken by protests this week. Police fired tear gas and arrested dozens of demonstrators who took to the streets to demand the release of Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra separatist group that seeks independence for Nigeria’s southeastern region.\n\nA wide spectrum of armed groups operate across the country.\n\nIn the north, Boko Haram, Nigeria’s homegrown armed group, this year mounted a major resurgence. The group took up arms in 2009 to fight Western education and impose its radical version of Islamic law.\n\nMeanwhile, criminal groups specialising in kidnapping for ransom and looting – commonly referred to as bandits – are also dominant.\n\nIn recent months, armed group fighters have repeatedly overrun military outposts, mined roads with bombs and raided civilian communities, raising fears of a possible return to the peak insecurity of a decade ago.\n\nEarlier this year, the US government approved the sale of $346m in arms to bolster Nigeria’s fight against insurgency and criminal groups.\n\nMeanwhile, regionally in the past three years, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger each saw a military takeover – a trend that analysts warn could continue across West Africa.\n\n“Some of us saw these changes coming,” said Senator Iroegbu, a security analyst based in Abuja told The Associated Press.\n\n“This also means that in the current state of events, the administration [in Nigeria] might be prioritising regime protection above any other security threats.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/23/why-has-pakistans-hpv-vaccine-campaign-faced-a-backlash","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"08:09:33+00:00","title":"Why has Pakistan’s HPV vaccine campaign faced a backlash?","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In September 2025, Pakistan launched its first national HPV vaccine campaign, aiming to vaccinate over 13 million girls aged 9 to 14 against cervical cancer, which kills eight women daily.

papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine campaign, aiming to immunise more than 13 million girls aged nine to 14 in its first phase.\n\nHPV is the most common cause of cervical cancer, which kills eight Pakistani women every day, according to Dr Dapeng Luo, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) in Pakistan. The United Nations health agency has set a goal of  eradicating cervical cancer  globally by 2030.\n\nBut the vaccine has met resistance in Pakistan, as conspiracy theories about inoculations have circulated.\n\nHere is more about what HPV is, how it causes cervical cancer, and why the vaccine rollout in Pakistan has faced a backlash.\n\nHPV is a common group of viruses that enter the body via skin-to-skin contact, typically through a cut or abrasion.\n\nThere are more than 100 types of HPV, and they are often spread through sexual contact.  Infection can be hard to identify because many people who have contracted an HPV have no symptoms at all, and it can take many years for cancer to develop.\n\nSome types of the virus eventually cause warts on the genitals or other parts of the body. These may appear flat or bumpy.\n\nMore than 95 percent of the 660,000 cervical cancer cases recorded each year worldwide are caused by HPV, according to the WHO. In Pakistan, more than 5,000 new cases of cervical cancer are reported every year, it said.\n\nSome strains of HPV can cause different types of cancer, such as cervical cancer, vulvar cancer or vaginal cancer. However, cervical cancer typically develops 20 years after the onset of the HPV infection.\n\nWhile the body’s immune system can clear away many strains of HPV within two years of infection, certain strains are more persistent. When the body’s immune system is unable to fight off the more persistent HPV strains, the virus interferes with normal cell growth, causing cells to become abnormal and potentially leading to a pre-cancerous state. If this is left untreated, cancer can develop.\n\nSufferers of cervical cancer do not experience symptoms in its early stages. Hence, women aged 30 to 65 are advised to have a pap smear every three years, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nPakistan’s HPV vaccine campaign began on September 15. While the first phase was scheduled to run until September 27, it was later extended to October 1.\n\nSome 49,000 government health workers – all women – have been trained by the WHO to administer the vaccines across the country. The WHO and Pakistan’s government partnered to conduct this training with funding support from GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, a public-private partnership that works to improve access to immunisations.\n\nIn advance of the first phase, vaccine centres were set up in public buildings such as schools. Health workers also went door-to-door to administer the HPV vaccine.\n\nA single dose of Cecolin, an HPV vaccine developed in China, was administered free of charge. While most HPV vaccines require either two or three doses, WHO confirmed in October last year that Cecolin could be used as a single dose.\n\nIn the first phase of the rollout in Pakistan, girls between the ages of nine and 14 from Sindh, Punjab, Pakistan-administered Kashmir and the Islamabad Capital Territory received the single-dose vaccine.\n\nPakistan’s federal health minister, Syed Mustafa Kamal, said at a launch ceremony for the vaccine on September 16 in Islamabad, “I urge all parents to ensure their daughters and sisters are vaccinated. Do not fall prey to negative campaigns. This vaccine is safe, effective and essential for protecting our girls.”\n\nKamal told Al Jazeera that when the vaccine campaign started, there was a lot of criticism and scepticism towards it. “A few unknown people had spread some fake videos and fake information.”\n\nHe said that during the first four days of the campaign, the response to the vaccine was negative. “The refusals were very high, so much so that there are schools which had committed before [to serve as vaccination centres], but refused our workers entry into the school.”\n\nOn the fifth day, Kamal got his own daughter publicly vaccinated during a ceremony at the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) office in Karachi. During the event, Kamal told journalists: “I have never brought my family into the public eye in my 30-year political career. But to put an end to these baseless rumours, I have taken this step.”\n\nHe said that after this, the refusals went down and acceptances went up. He added that this upward trend of acceptance and vaccine administration continued till the end of the campaign.\n\n“It was noticed that after clarifying rumours, people started to get vaccine. Especially, schools were requesting to send teams as parents were agreeing to get their daughters vaccinated,” Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho, the health minister of Sindh province, told Al Jazeera in a written statement.\n\nThe initial reluctance is why, she said, the vaccination campaign was extended by four days.\n\nThe Cecolin vaccine does not contain the live HPV virus. Instead, it contains recombinant L1 capsid proteins, laboratory-made proteins that mimic the outer shell of the virus but do not have any viral DNA and therefore cannot cause infection.\n\nOther countries have used the US-manufactured Gardasil HPV vaccine, which also does not contain the live HPV virus and contains recombinant L1 capsid proteins.\n\nThe government says that this particular age group of girls was selected per the recommendations of the WHO’s National Immunisation Technical Advisory Groups (NITAGs), responsible for providing evidence-based recommendations for immunisation.\n\n“As per WHO, the immune response generated by the body after the vaccine jab is maximum at this age of 9-14 years, and the child gets the best and long-term protection. Hence, this particular age group,” Pechuho said.\n\n“Currently, the vaccine is available free of cost for 9-14-year-old girls only. There have been talks at the federal ministry level to make this vaccine available commercially so others [boys, women and teenage girls, etc] can benefit, as well.”\n\nIn September, Sana Ali Manzoor and her husband – who say they are strongly in favour of vaccinations for their children – took their 11-year-old daughter to be vaccinated at her private school campus in Karachi after school hours. The whole process took about 20 minutes.\n\nManzoor said she heard about the vaccine rollout via a mobile application operated by her daughter’s school, Haque Academy, which is located in the upmarket neighbourhood of Defence Housing Authority. Parents were invited to register on the mobile app and accompany their children for the vaccination.\n\nManzoor, a lactation specialist who supports new mothers, said approximately 30-40 other children were also present when her daughter received her vaccination.\n\n“So we went to school, and there were two or three tables set up. The health workers were there. They first checked if our name was on the list. After that, we went and got the vaccination done. And then right after that, there was a manual card entry filling that was done, then they gave us the card.”\n\nShe described the process as “very organised”. Manzoor says she was encouraged by friends, including a paediatrician and a gynaecologist, to get the HPV vaccine for her daughter. She has also had her children vaccinated against chickenpox, which she travelled to Dubai to get.\n\nThe rollout has not hit its target, authorities say — though they insist that despite this, the campaign counts as a success.\n\n“Around 13 million girls were supposed to be vaccinated in the first phase of the HPV vaccine campaign. So far, 9.2 million have been vaccinated, which is 78 percent of the total target,” Pechuho said.\n\nIn the southern province of Sindh, the estimated target for the HPV campaign was 4,081,279 girls. Sixty-six percent of the total target was reached, with 2,674,210 girls vaccinated.\n\nThe low take-up is down to a general hesitancy towards vaccines in Pakistani society, experts say. Compounding this, specific concerns about the HPV vaccine have been fuelled by misinformation, particularly online.\n\nThe vaccine will eventually roll out to other provinces, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2026, and Balochistan and Gilgit-Baltistan in 2027. The government has not yet announced when the next phase will begin.\n\n“Every age girl will be vaccinated periodically,” Kamal, the federal minister, said. He added that the government hopes to vaccinate boys and men against HPV once girls and women have been vaccinated.\n\nWhile vaccine hesitancy is a global phenomenon, in Pakistan it was aggravated by the CIA’s use of a fake hepatitis B vaccination campaign in Pakistan’s Abbottabad as cover for a manhunt for fugitive al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.\n\nThe vaccine campaign, carried out in collaboration with a local doctor, was used to covertly collect blood samples to find links to bin Laden and his family. The plan was to compare the DNA of any of bin Laden’s children to that of his sister, who had died in Boston in 2010. The al-Qaeda leader was eventually killed in a military operation in Abbottabad by US Marines in 2011.\n\nIt was never revealed whether the CIA obtained any DNA from bin Laden’s family. However, news outlets at the time said that one source suggested the operation had not succeeded. In 2014, the White House promised that the CIA would never again use a false vaccination campaign for espionage. However, mistrust towards vaccines persisted.\n\nThis was apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic, when vaccines were free, but according to a recent study, 30 percent of people in Pakistan did not want to get vaccinated. An opinion piece, co-written by a Pakistani doctor and published on the website of GAVI, said: “Misconceptions that the [COVID] vaccine could lead to infertility, death or be tied into shadowy foreign agendas circulated rapidly through social media and community gossip.”\n\nManzoor said she has herself noticed “anti-vaxxer” sentiment among some of her clients. She recalled advising a young mother not to bring her unvaccinated newborn into her house, explaining that it is not a sterile environment. The young mother responded, “It’s fine, we don’t believe in such things.”\n\nThe HPV vaccine has faced especially heated pushback in Pakistan.\n\nSome argue that, as HPV is a sexually transmitted infection, it is not required in Pakistan, where consensual sex before marriage is not only culturally frowned upon, but is also illegal.\n\nA Pakistani user wrote on X, “Cerv. Cancer is spread via Sexual contact which is NOT IN PAKISTAN for 9-14 year old – only in west.”\n\nAnother user wrote, referring to the vaccine, “its common in societies where women has multiple sex partners!”\n\nManzoor said that she had her daughter vaccinated because, to her, it made sense to ensure that her daughter remains safe from the virus.\n\n“It’s not even about being sexually active, it’s even about, God forbid, molestation. It’s not always consensual,” Manzoor said.\n\nIn 2023, Islamabad-based NGO Sahil reported that, on average, one child was sexually abused every two hours in Pakistan. According to the  World Population Review , 5,867 rape cases were reported in Pakistan in 2023.\n\nAnother conspiracy theory circulating online is that the HPV vaccine causes infertility. There is no evidence to support this claim. Pakistan, with a population in excess of 250 million, is the fifth most populous country in the world, according to World Population Review. While  birthrates  in the country have declined, much like the rest of the world, Pakistan’s current birthrate is 3.32, well above the replacement rate of 2.1 required to maintain current populations.\n\nIn May 2020, a peer-reviewed US study found no evidence of increased infertility among women who received the HPV vaccine. However, this study was conducted in the US, and the sample was inoculated with a different vaccine – Gardasil.\n\nOther rumours, along with pictures and videos, have spread online. A video which attracted more than 340,000 views on X this year shows girls in school uniforms collapsing, with the caption asserting that these girls became sick after “forced vaccinations”.\n\nIn fact, the video was filmed last year and shows a scene in which police are clashing with protesters over electricity taxes in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Tear gas shells fired by the police are what caused the girls at the school to collapse.\n\n“The vaccine has an excellent safety profile. It has been around for almost two decades now. It doesn’t contain any virus, but the active component is the HPV L1 protein,” Pechuho said.\n\nIn an assessment of Cecolin published last year, the WHO said that “the vaccine was safe and showed a good immunogenicity”.\n\nIt can cause a few mild side effects, Pechucho said. “Most common side effects are related to any other vaccine, like fever, pain at the injection site and, rarely, allergic reactions,” he said.\n\nKamal too insisted that the most common side effect is a fever, which subsides in a day or two with the help of over-the-counter medicines.\n\n“People used to die of diseases like polio and tuberculosis. They’re not dying today because we now have vaccines. People are not dying of COVID because we have vaccines. The world has moved to prevention,” Kamal said.\n\n“The point of an effective healthcare system is to prevent people from becoming patients. And people will be safe from becoming patients when they take preventative measures and get their children vaccinated.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/24/russias-top-indian-oil-buyer-to-comply-with-western-sanctions","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"17:46:00+00:00","title":"Russia’s top Indian oil buyer to comply with Western sanctions","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Reliance Industries Ltd, India’s top importer of Russian oil, has confirmed it will comply with new Western sanctions targeting Rosneft and Lukoil, following US Treasury OFAC designations and EU transaction bans.

children in child labour: Report\n\nNearly two-thirds of South Sudanese children are engaged in the worst forms of child labour, with rates reaching as high as 90 percent in the hardest-hit regions, according to a government study released with the charity Save the Children.\n\nThe National Child Labour Study,  published  on Friday, surveyed more than 418 households across seven states and found that 64 percent of children aged between five and 17 are trapped in forced labour, sexual exploitation, theft and conflict.\n\nThe findings reveal a crisis far more complex than poverty alone, intensified by relentless flooding, the spread of disease, and conflict that have uprooted families and left millions on the brink of hunger.\n\nIn Kapoeta South, near the border with Uganda, nine out of 10 children work in gold mining, pastoralism and farming instead of attending school, the report said.\n\nYambio region, the country’s southwest, recorded similarly dire rates, with local conflict and child marriage driving children into labour.\n\nChildren typically start with simple jobs before being drawn into increasingly dangerous and exploitative work, the report found. About 10 percent of those surveyed reported involvement with armed groups, particularly in Akobo, Bentiu and Kapoeta South counties.\n\nThe types of exploitation children face differ by gender. Boys are more likely to work in dangerous industries or join armed groups, while girls disproportionately face forced marriage, household servitude and sexual abuse.\n\nKnowing the law does not stop child exploitation, researchers found.\n\nThe surveys showed that 70 percent of children stuck in dangerous or illegal work lives came from homes with adults who were familiar with legal protections. Two-thirds of children were unaware that help existed.\n\n“When nearly two-thirds of a country’s children are working – and in some areas, almost every child – it signals a crisis that goes beyond poverty,” said Chris Nyamandi, Save the Children’s South Sudan country director.\n\nSouth Sudan’s child labour prevalence vastly exceeds regional patterns. While East Africa has the continent’s worst record at 30 percent, according to ILO-UNICEF data, South Sudan’s 64 percent is more than double that figure.\n\n“Education remains the strongest protective factor,” Nyamandi said, noting that children who attend school are far less likely to be exploited.\n\nThe government acknowledged the crisis at the report’s launch in Juba. Deng Tong, undersecretary at the Ministry of Labour, said officials would use the evidence as a “critical foundation for action”.\n\nThe report comes as nearly one million people have been impacted by severe flooding across South Sudan, with 335,000 displaced and more than 140 health facilities damaged or submerged.\n\nThe country faces a related malaria outbreak with more than 104,000 cases reported in the past week, while 7.7 million people confront acute hunger, the United Nations said.\n\nSouth Sudan has also been gripped by fears of renewed civil war. A fragile 2018 peace deal between President Salva Kiir and First Vice President  Riek Machar  appears increasingly strained, with armed clashes now occurring on a scale not seen since 2017, according to UN investigators.\n\nMachar was arrested in March and charged in September with treason, murder and crimes against humanity. He has rejected all charges.\n\nAbout  300,000  people have fled the country this year as violence has escalated."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/24/trump-administration-investigating-chinas-compliance-with-2020-trade-deal","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"22:51:17Z","title":"Trump administration investigating China’s compliance with 2020 trade deal","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration has launched a formal investigation into China's compliance with the 2020 Phase One trade deal, alleging that China has failed to meet its commitments to purchase more US agricultural goods, including soybeans, and to uphold intellectual property protections.

level of military firepower far beyond the  Trump administration’s  stated goals of combating drug trafficking, and comes as the US takes an increasingly hard line against Caracas, a longtime target of US ire.\n\nThe US already has about 6,000 sailors and Marines in the region on board eight warships, now to be joined by the USS Gerald Ford and the five destroyers in its strike group, along with an additional 4,500 personnel. The carrier is currently in the Mediterranean Sea, and it is unclear when it will arrive in Latin America.\n\nTrump said last week that he had authorised the  Central Intelligence Agency  (CIA), the US international spy agency, to carry out operations in Venezuela, and has suggested that attacks on Venezuelan territory could soon follow.\n\nAs a pretext for those moves, the Trump administration has pushed the baseless claim that the government of President Nicolas Maduro is coordinating with criminal groups to “invade” the US via drugs and immigration. Venezuela plays a minor role in the global drug trade, and internal US intelligence assessments have found little evidence for the claim that the Maduro government controls criminal groups.\n\nSince early September, the US has carried out an  increasing number  of military strikes on vessels in the region that it has alleged, often without corroborating evidence, are transporting drugs from Venezuela. UN officials and scholars of international law have said that the strikes are in  clear violation  of US and international law and amount to extrajudicial executions.\n\nThe Maduro government has said that it will respond forcefully to any attempt to topple the government by the US.\n\n“Interpret it however you want: the Armed Forces will not allow a government here that is subservient to the interests of the United States,” Foreign Minister Vladimir Padrino said on Friday.\n\n“This is the most significant military threat in the last 100 years,” he added. “We do not want war, we want peace.”\n\nThe US has thus far rebuffed calls to lower tensions, with Trump responding affirmatively last week when asked about reports that Maduro had offered significant concessions but seemed to wave them aside."},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/1234569831","dateOfPublication":"2024-02-28","timeOfPublication":"14:20:00-05:00","title":"A Collection of Featured Tiny Desk Concerts","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On February 28, 2024, NPR's homepage features a collection of Tiny Desk Concerts, highlighting the intimate and diverse music performances that have become a significant cultural touchpoint in public media.

Department of the Treasury has slapped sanctions on Colombian President Gustavo Petro, his family and the South American country’s interior minister, Armando Benedetti.\n\nFriday’s decision marks a significant escalation in the ongoing feud between the left-wing Petro and his US counterpart, the right-wing Donald Trump.\n\nIn a  statement , the US Treasury accused Petro of failing to rein in Colombia’s cocaine industry and of shielding criminal groups from accountability.\n\nThe Treasury cited Petro’s “Total Peace” plan, an initiative designed to bring an end to Colombia’s six-decade-long internal conflict through negotiations with armed rebels and criminal organisations.\n\n“Since President Gustavo Petro came to power, cocaine production in Colombia has exploded to the highest rate in decades, flooding the United States and poisoning Americans,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement.\n\n“President Petro has allowed drug cartels to flourish and refused to stop this activity.”\n\nPetro, a prolific social media user, quickly shot back that the Treasury’s decision was the culmination of longstanding Republican threats, including from US Senator Bernie Moreno, a critic of his presidency.\n\n“Bernie Moreno’s threat has indeed been fulfilled,” Petro wrote on the social media platform X. “My wife, my children, and I have been placed on the OFAC [Office of Foreign Assets Control] list.”\n\nHe argued that his country had been “fighting drug trafficking effectively for decades” and suggested he would contest the sanctions in the US court system.\n\n“Not one step back and never on my knees,” Petro wrote, pledging not to back down.\n\nFriday’s designation puts Petro in a relatively small group of top international leaders to be personally sanctioned by the US.\n\nExamples include Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, who was sanctioned for human rights abuses, and Russian President  Vladimir Putin , who faced economic restrictions following his country’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\nThe sanctions against Petro, however, come as the left-wing leader and former rebel reaches the twilight of his presidency. Term-limited, he is slated to step down in 2026.\n\nPetro is considered the first left-wing president in modern Colombian history.\n\nIt also marks the latest action the Trump administration has taken against one of its most prominent critics in Latin America.\n\nThe  feud between Petro and Trump  began shortly after the US president returned to the White House for a second term on January 20.\n\nTrump moved swiftly to fulfil a campaign promise: the mass deportation of undocumented immigrants from the US.\n\nImages of shackled immigrants being herded onto US military aeroplanes soon filled the international media. Petro was among those who expressed outrage on social media.\n\nIn the wee hours of January 26, he threatened not to accept two deportation flights that were in midair from the US. “The US cannot treat Colombian migrants as criminals,” he wrote on social media.\n\nTrump responded by threatening the country with 30 percent tariffs, and Petro backed down.\n\nBut the two have continued to butt heads over issues ranging from immigration to human rights to how Colombia should tamp down on its illicit cocaine production.\n\nThe South American country remains the world’s largest source of coca, a leaf that can be processed into cocaine. Last year, the United Nations reported that Colombia had marked its 10th consecutive year of increasing cocaine production, with a 53 percent increase over 2022, when Petro took office.\n\nTrump, however, has increasingly leaned into the fight against drug trafficking as he flexes his might abroad, particularly in Latin America.\n\nHe has, for example, wielded the threat of elevated tariffs on US imports to pressure other countries, including neighbours like Canada and Mexico, to combat drug smuggling.\n\nSince September 2, Trump has followed his threats with military action, carrying out a series of deadly missile strikes on nautical vessels in the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe targets, Trump has said, were drug traffickers. But Petro has argued that the strikes amount to extrajudicial killings.\n\nThe Colombian leader has  highlighted cases  like that of fisherman Alejandro Carranza, who reportedly died in one of the strikes. At least 34 people have been killed in the bombings, some of them Colombian.\n\n“These are not war casualties,” Petro wrote in  one social media post  on Friday, shortly before the sanctions were announced. “They are murders.”\n\nPetro took that message to the stage at the United Nations in New York in September, blasting the Trump administration for its actions.\n\n“The violent war on drugs was a failure, and I replaced it with an effective anti-trafficking policy,” Petro told the international body.\n\n“Was it really necessary to shoot missiles on unarmed poor young people in the Caribbean?

The anti-drug policy is to dominate the peoples of the south as a whole.”\n\nPetro  was seen afterwards  on the streets of New York City rallying with pro-Palestinian protesters in opposition to Israel’s war on Gaza.\n\nWithin hours, the Trump administration  yanked Petro’s visa  “due to his reckless and incendiary actions”. It has previously compared such demonstrations to “terrorism”.\n\nThat same month, the administration also decertified Colombia as a partner in the US’s ongoing “war on drugs”.\n\nRelations between Trump and Petro have only grown more tense since.\n\nJust this week, Trump  announced  on his platform Truth Social that he would be ending all aid to Colombia, the largest recipient of US funds in South America. In fiscal year 2023 alone, Colombia received more than $743m in US aid.\n\nTrump also warned the US could take a more active role in the Colombia if Petro does not do more to stem the cocaine trade.\n\n“Petro, a low rated and very unpopular leader, with a fresh mouth toward America, better close up these killing fields immediately, or the United States will close them up for him, and it won’t be done nicely,” Trump wrote in his October 19 post.\n\nIt was a threat Trump  would repeat  days later, on October 22, in a meeting with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte.\n\n“He’d better watch it, or we’ll take very serious action against him and his country,” Trump said of Petro. “What he has led his country into is a death trap.”\n\nPetro, in response, threatened to sue Trump for slander. The US leader has called Petro a “drug dealer”, “thug”, and “bad guy”, among other things.\n\nThe spat between the two presidents has left their countries’ diplomatic relations frayed, with Colombia recently  recalling its ambassador  from Washington, DC.\n\nBut traditionally, Colombia had been one of the US’s top allies in the region and a key partner in its efforts to combat the drug trade.\n\nFriday’s sanctions freeze all property Petro, his family and Interior Minister Benedetti may have in the US. They bar US-based entities from doing business with the sanctioned parties.\n\nBenedetti, for his part, framed the sanctions as a form of retribution for standing up for Petro.\n\n“For the US, a nonviolent statement is the same as being a drug trafficker,” he  wrote  in a post. “Gringos, go home.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/25/as-southeast-asia-welcomes-trump-it-battles-headwinds-unleashed-by-him","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"01:52:34+00:00","title":"As Southeast Asia welcomes Trump, it battles headwinds unleashed by him","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Southeast Asia, once a beneficiary of the 2018 US-China trade war due to the 'China Plus One' supply chain model, now faces intense economic headwinds from renewed US tariffs under President Donald Trump.

2025-10-25T01:52:34+00:00\n\nTitle: As Southeast Asia welcomes Trump, it battles headwinds unleashed by him\n\nSoutheast Asia was one of the biggest winners from United States President Donald Trump’s trade war with China in 2018, luring manufacturers to the region to avoid new tariffs on Chinese goods.\n\nIt benefitted from investment, tax revenues and technology transfers that came with the expanding “China Plus One” supply chain concept.\n\nSeven years later, Southeast Asia finds itself in a very different situation as Trump’s second trade war drags on, and it gets squeezed by the world’s top two economic powers. New tariffs from the US threaten its export-driven economy, while it’s also facing a separate surge in Chinese goods looking for an alternative to the US market.\n\nIt’s now trying to find its way forward despite the economic pressure, said Jayant Menon, a senior fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore.\n\n“Southeast Asia has been trying to walk the tightrope and do a balancing act of not picking sides between the US and China. Both are important economic partners,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nChina is the largest trading partner of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) – a regional bloc of 10 countries plus new member, East Timor. The US is its fourth-largest trade partner, but it holds an outsized importance in other areas like regional security.\n\nThe region’s relationship with the US has been under significant stress since Trump returned to the White House earlier this year on the promise of slashing the US trade deficit by imposing tariffs on most trade partners.\n\nSoutheast Asia was hit hard in April by Trump’s “liberation day” tariffs, when he added duties of 49 percent on Cambodia, 48 percent on Laos, and 46 percent on Vietnam. Even Thailand and the Philippines, both US military allies, were initially hit with tariffs of 36 percent and 17 percent.\n\nRegional tariffs have since fallen to 10 to 20 percent for most ASEAN countries after individual countries negotiated with Trump, but they remain at a high 40 percent for Myanmar and Laos. Further tariffs remain on specific exports like steel, aluminium and auto parts. In late July, the White House announced an additional 40 percent tariff on so-called “transshipments”.\n\nThe term refers to goods that are shipped through the region to avoid tariffs – in this case, pre-existing tariffs on Chinese goods – as Beijing and Washington continue to negotiate a separate tariff deal.\n\nThe transshipment tariff has put the China Plus One production model in the “crosshairs” of Washington, said Nick Marro, lead analyst for global trade at the Economist Intelligence Unit.\n\n“[It’s] a risk, especially now because you have a threatened tariff of 40 percent on transshipments which seems pretty squarely aimed at emerging markets,” he said.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the Asian Development Bank revised its 2025 growth forecast for Southeast Asia from 4.7 percent to 4.3 percent, citing the emergence of a “new global trade environment, shaped by tariffs and updated trade agreements”. ADB’s growth forecast for 2026 is also 4.3 percent.\n\nComplicating the picture, though, is that Chinese exports to Southeast Asia are on the rise. The trend began before Trump returned to the White House, but it’s accelerated over the past year.\n\nChinese customs data shows that exports to ASEAN rose 12 percent to $586bn year on year in 2024. The trend is set to continue in 2025 as Chinese exports to the region are up 14.7 percent, hitting $487.5bn in the first nine months of the year. The total volume of trade in 2025 is also up 8.6 percent and hit $776.7bn in September.\n\nConversely, Chinese exports to the US have been falling. They hit $317bn between January and September 2025, a drop of 16.9 percent over the same period, according to Chinese customs data. China’s total volume of trade has also fallen 15.6 percent year on year to $425.8bn, according to the same data.\n\nCustoms data alone doesn’t explain the reasons for these parallel trends, according to experts, but they say that two factors could be driving this shift.\n\nExperts told Al Jazeera that Chinese manufacturers might be shipping more goods through Southeast Asia.\n\n“Exports from Southeast Asia to the US have grown in tandem with exports from China to Southeast Asia. This tells you that this trade is being diverted through these countries to some extent,” said ISEAS’s Menon.\n\nASEAN exported $352.1bn worth of goods and services to the US in 2024, up 13.3 percent from a year earlier, according to data from the US Trade Representative.\n\nThe figure is also nearly double the value of ASEAN’s US exports in 2017, just before Trump started his first trade war. That year, ASEAN exported $192bn in goods and services to the US, according to the USTR.\n\nBut Chinese companies are also shipping finished goods to Southeast Asia as the final destination, as they seek out new customers to replace the US.\n\n“There’s no precise data on how much is exported and how much is then re-exported. Survey [data] seems to suggest that the majority is part of the supply chain, but there’s a growing share of exports that are destined to be finally consumed in the Southeast Asian countries,” Menon said.\n\nA survey of more than 300 companies in the Asia Pacific exporting to the US and 30 US importers by New York-based consultancy GLG in July found that 66 percent of Chinese exporters said they were looking for markets beyond the US, as it had become a “challenging and less predictable trade partner”.\n\nEighty-three percent said they were looking at the European Union as an alternative, followed by another 71 percent who cited ASEAN as a potential market, according to the report, which was written by Menon.\n\nWhile consumers in Southeast Asia may welcome more products on e-commerce sites like Shein, Temu, Alibaba, Lazada and Shoppee, the uptick in Chinese goods is also making some local industries nervous, said the EIU’s Marro.\n\nChinese exports are extra competitive this year thanks to a depreciation in the dollar, and with it the Chinese renminbi, but China also has a longstanding problem of making more than it needs. The issue has been exacerbated with its post-pandemic economic slowdown and a fall in domestic demand, which means it needs somewhere to send this “overcapacity”.\n\nWhile exporters have looked for new markets overseas, some have been accused of “dumping,” or deliberately undercutting local markets with artificially low prices in countries like Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia.\n\n“We have started to see a lot more anxiety among various governments in the last couple of months around a potential flood of Chinese goods into certain markets. This doesn’t necessarily restrict itself to things like phones or electric vehicles. It can also include commodities like steel or other types of things like textiles or apparel,” Marro said.\n\n“There is a very big risk that Southeast Asia is also going to get hit by the distortions in China’s economy,” he added.\n\nMuch like transshipments, whether exports are “dumping” is in the eye of the beholder, said Chris Beddor, deputy director of China Research at the Beijing-based Gavekal Dragonomics.\n\nInvestigating another country for dumping can be a politically and economically costly move that can end in tariffs or trade disruptions on both sides. It’s a risk many countries are not willing to take with China, he said.\n\n“A lot of the ASEAN countries, frankly, don’t have a lot of incentive to be pointing fingers at China for dumping because of the supply chains being rerouted. They want a slice of the action,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nIt’s much like the approach that Southeast Asia has taken with the US. Rather than push back against Trump’s tariffs, regional leaders lined up to negotiate with the White House one-on-one rather than as a bloc – much the way that Trump prefers.\n\nIan Chong, a political scientist at the National University of Singapore, told Al Jazeera this strategy could, however, cost Southeast Asia in the long run.\n\n“This is a result of ASEAN’s passive ‘not choosing sides’. They thought they could have some side help them or that Washington and Beijing could always court them,” he said. That optimism ignored the possibility that they could be squeezed by both sides. They may end up not having to make choices, since these have been made for them elsewhere.”\n\nISEAS’s Menon said he was also worried that more trouble could still be on the horizon. The US and China have yet to reach a deal on tariffs, and even if they succeed, the famously mercurial Trump could still change his mind.\n\n“My big fear is that this is not the end, but the beginning of a continuing process of tariff increases,” said ISEAS’s Menon. “Trump has been very clear about two things. One is that he loves tariffs. The second thing is that he wants to use them to reduce bilateral deficits. The bottom line is, I don’t think he can be stopped.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/25/russia-backed-arson-attack-ringleaders-handed-hefty-jail-sentences-in-uk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"01:53:06+00:00","title":"Russia-backed arson attack ringleaders handed jail sentences in UK","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Two young British men, Dylan Earl and Jake Reeves, were convicted under the UK’s 2023 National Security Act for planning and carrying out arson attacks in support of the Russian-backed Wagner Group.

election observers to California, New Jersey\n\nThe United States Department of Justice is preparing to send federal election observers to California and New Jersey next month, targeting two Democratic strongholds holding off-year elections following requests from state Republican parties.\n\nThe Justice Department announced Friday that it is planning to monitor polling sites in Passaic County, New Jersey, and five counties in southern and central California: Los Angeles, Orange, Kern, Riverside and Fresno.\n\nThe goal, according to the department, is “to ensure transparency, ballot security, and compliance with federal law”.\n\n“Transparency at the polls translates into faith in the electoral process, and this Department of Justice is committed to upholding the highest standards of election integrity,” Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement to The Associated Press.\n\nElection monitoring is a routine function of the Justice Department, but the focus on California and New Jersey comes as both states are set to hold closely watched elections with national consequences on November 4.\n\nNew Jersey has an open seat for governor that has attracted major spending by both parties, and California is holding a special election aimed at redrawing the state’s congressional map to counter Republican gerrymandering efforts elsewhere in the run-up to the 2026 midterms.\n\nThe Justice Department’s efforts are also the latest salvo in the Republican Party’s preoccupation with election integrity, after President Donald Trump spent years refusing to accept the results of the 2020 election.\n\nDemocrats fear the new administration will attempt to gain an upper hand in next year’s midterms with similarly unfounded allegations of fraud.\n\nThe announcement comes days after the Republican leaders in both states wrote letters to the Justice Department requesting their assistance. Some leading Democrats in the states blasted the decision.\n\nNew Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin called the move “highly inappropriate” and said the Justice Department “has not even attempted to identify a legitimate basis for its actions”.\n\nIn a statement, Rusty Hicks, chair of the California Democratic Party, said, “No amount of election interference by the California Republican Party is going to silence the voices of California voters.”\n\nThe letter from the California Republican Party, sent on Monday and obtained by The Associated Press, asked the Justice Department’s civil rights head, Harmeet Dhillon, to provide monitors to observe the election in the five counties.\n\n“In recent elections, we have received reports of irregularities in these counties that we fear will undermine either the willingness of voters to participate in the election or their confidence in the announced results of the election,” wrote GOP Chairwoman Corrin Rankin.\n\nThe state is set to vote on a redistricting proposition that would dramatically redraw California’s congressional lines to add as many as five additional Democratic seats to its US House delegation.\n\nEach of the counties named, state Republican leaders alleged, has experienced recent voting issues, such as sending incorrect or duplicate ballots to voters. They also take issue with how Los Angeles and Orange counties maintain their voter rolls.\n\nCalifornia is one of at least eight states the Justice Department has sued as part of a wide-ranging request for detailed voter roll information. The department has not said why it wants the data.\n\nBrandon Richards, a spokesperson for Governor Gavin Newsom, said the Justice Department has no standing to “interfere” with California’s election.\n\nHe pointed out that November’s ballot contains only a state-specific initiative and has no federal races.\n\n“Deploying these federal forces appears to be an intimidation tactic meant for one thing: suppress the vote,” Richards said in an email.\n\nOrange County Registrar of Voters Bob Page said he welcomes anyone who wants to watch the county’s election operations and said it is common to have local, state, federal and even international observers. He described Orange County’s elections as “accessible, accurate, fair, secure, and transparent”.\n\nLos Angeles County Clerk Dean Logan said election observers are standard practice across the country and that the county, with 5.8 million registered voters, is continuously updating and verifying its voter records.\n\n“Voters can have confidence their ballot is handled securely and counted accurately,” he said.\n\nMost Californians vote using mail ballots returned through the postal service, drop boxes or at local voting centres, which typically leaves polling places relatively quiet on Election Day.\n\nBut in pursuit of accuracy and counting every vote, the nation’s most populous state has gained a reputation for tallies that can drag on for weeks — and sometimes longer.\n\nIn 2024, it took until early December to declare Democrat Adam Gray the winner in his Central Valley district, the final congressional race to be decided in the nation last year.\n\nCalifornia’s request echoed a similar letter sent by New Jersey Republicans.\n\nThey asked the Department of Justice to dispatch election monitors to “oversee the receipt and processing of vote-by-mail ballots” and “monitor access to the Board of Elections around the clock” in suburban Passaic County in advance of the state’s governor’s race.\n\nThe New Jersey Republican State Committee told Dhillon that federal intervention was necessary to ensure an accurate vote count in the heavily Latino county that was once a Democratic stronghold but shifted to President Donald Trump’s column in last year’s presidential race.\n\nThe county could be critical to Republican gubernatorial nominee Jack Ciattarelli’s hopes against Democrat Mikie Sherrill. But the letter cited previous voter fraud cases in the county and alleged a “long and sordid history” of vote-by-mail shenanigans.\n\nIn 2020, a judge ordered a new election for a city council seat in Paterson — the largest city in Passaic County — after the apparent winner and others were charged with voter fraud.\n\nPlatkin said the state is committed to ensuring its elections are fair and secure. With the Justice Department’s announcement, he said the attorney general’s office is “considering all of our options to prevent any effort to intimidate voters or interfere with our elections”.\n\nLocal election offices and polling places around the country already have observers from both political parties to ensure rules are followed.\n\nThe Justice Department also has a long history of sending observers to jurisdictions that have histories of voting rights violations to ensure compliance with federal civil rights laws.\n\nLast year, when the administration of President Joe Biden was still in power, some Republican-led states said they would not allow federal monitors to access voting locations on Election Day.\n\nTrump has railed for years against mail voting as part of his repeated false claims that Biden’s victory in 2020 was rigged. He alleges it is riddled with fraud, even though numerous studies have found no evidence of widespread fraud in US elections.\n\nEarlier this year, Trump pledged to ban vote-by-mail across the country, something he has no power to do under the US Constitution.\n\nThe Justice Department said its effort will be overseen by Dhillon’s Civil Rights Division, which will deploy personnel in coordination with US Attorney’s Offices and work closely with state and local officials.\n\nThe department is also soliciting further requests for monitoring in other jurisdictions.\n\nDavid Becker, a former Justice Department lawyer who has served as an election monitor and trained them, said the work is typically done by department lawyers who are prohibited from interfering at polling places.\n\nBut Becker, now executive director of the Center for Election Integrity & Research, said local jurisdictions normally agree to the monitors’ presence.\n\nIf the administration tried to send monitors without a clear legal rationale to a place where local officials did not want them, “that could result in chaos,” he said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/25/trump-open-to-meeting-north-koreas-kim-on-asia-trip-but-nothing-scheduled","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"04:07:14+00:00","title":"Trump open to meeting North Korea’s Kim on Asia trip but nothing scheduled","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Despite speculation, Donald Trump is not scheduled to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during his upcoming Asia trip, although he has expressed openness to such a meeting in the future.

mother of the current Thai King Maha Vajiralongkorn and wife of the nation’s late and longest-reigning monarch Bhumibol Adulyadej, has died at the age of 93.\n\n“Her Majesty’s condition worsened until Friday and she passed away at 9:21pm … at Chulalongkorn Hospital at age 93,” the palace said in a statement on Saturday.\n\nSirikit was married to King Bhumibol, who died in 2016 after seven decades on the throne.\n\nShe had been dealing with a blood infection since October 17, and despite her medical team’s efforts, her condition did not improve, according to reports.\n\nA government spokesman said Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul had cancelled his Saturday flight to Malaysia – where the ASEAN leaders’ summit will be held from Sunday to Tuesday – following news of the Queen Mother’s death.\n\nThe Thai leader instead held a cabinet meeting to discuss funeral arrangements. The atmosphere at the meeting was sombre, according to Thai news outlet The Nation, with all government officials present dressed in black.\n\nPrime Minister Anutin will now fly to Malaysia on Sunday, according to The Nation, the same day US President Donald Trump is set to oversee the signing of a peace agreement between Thailand and Cambodia after a border dispute escalated into  all-out conflict  in July.\n\nKing Vajiralongkorn has decreed that a one-year official mourning period will be observed by members of the royal family and royal servants from the date of his mother’s passing, according to the Thai PBS media outlet.\n\nThe late Queen Mother’s remains will be enshrined in Bangkok’s Grand Palace.\n\nAlthough overshadowed by the stature of her late husband and her son, who is now king, Sirikit was a similarly beloved figure across much of the country, with her August 12 birthday celebrated as Mother’s Day.\n\nEven during widespread  student-led protests  in 2020 and 2021 – which morphed into unprecedented public criticism of the monarchy and calls to repeal draconian lese-majeste laws – protesters’ ire was largely directed at the king rather than his parents.\n\nThe royal family is venerated in Thailand, and the monarchy is protected by some of the  world’s harshest laws  banning criticism of the institution.\n\nRoyal family members are treated by many as semi-divine figures and lavished with glowing media coverage and gold-adorned portraits hanging in public spaces and private homes nationwide.\n\nKing Bhumibol’s death  in 2016 was followed by intense displays of public grief and a yearlong official mourning period, with many Thais choosing to wear black for its duration.\n\nSirikit was born into a rich, aristocratic family in Bangkok in 1932, the year absolute monarchy was replaced by a constitutional system in Thailand.\n\nShe met Bhumibol in 1948 in Paris, where her father was the Thai ambassador and the 16-year-old Sirikit was studying music and languages.\n\nThe pair would marry two years later on April 28, 1950, a week before Bhumibol was officially crowned as Rama IX of the Chakri Dynasty.\n\nSirikit was given the royal title Somdet Phra Nang Chao Sirikit Phra Borommarachininat. The couple had four children – King Vajiralongkorn, and princesses Ubolratana, Sirindhorn and Chulabhorn.\n\nDuring their early decades on the throne, the young Thai royals crisscrossed the world as goodwill ambassadors, forging personal ties with world leaders, with Sirikit becoming known internationally for her fashion sense.\n\nBy the 1970s, the royals had turned to Thailand’s domestic problems, setting up development programmes to address social and environmental issues, including deforestation, rural poverty and opium addiction among hill tribes in the north of the country.\n\nTheir charitable activities were televised each evening on the country’s Royal Bulletin.\n\n“Misunderstandings arise between people in rural areas and the rich, so-called civilised people in Bangkok,” she told The Associated Press news agency in 1979.\n\n“People in rural Thailand say they are neglected, and we try to fill that gap by staying with them in remote areas,” she said.\n\nBy the 1980s, Sirikit was often ill, at one point disappearing from public view for several months. By the early- to mid-2000s, she had taken on a more politicised role in public life amid a period of heightened tension between Thailand’s royalist Yellow Shirts and the Red Shirt movement of the rural underclass.\n\nSirikit expressed public sympathy with royalist demonstrators, and in a highly symbolic act, attended the 2008 funeral of People’s Alliance for Democracy member Angkhana Radappanyawutt, who died during clashes with police.\n\nSirikit suffered from numerous ailments in her later life, rarely appearing in public after suffering a debilitating stroke in 2012.\n\nShe was admitted to Bangkok’s Chulalongkorn Hospital in September 2019, receiving long-term care there until her passing."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/25/ivory-coast-presidential-election-whos-standing-and-whats-at-stake","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"02:22:06+00:00","title":"Ivory Coast presidential election: Who’s standing and what’s at stake?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ivory Coast is facing a high-stakes presidential election on October 25, 2025, as citizens protest President Alassane Ouattara’s decision to seek a fourth term, which violates the two-term constitutional limit.

standing and what’s at stake?\n\nIvorians will head to the polls on Saturday, October 25, to vote in the presidential election amid widespread anger over incumbent President Alassane Ouattara’s decision to run for a fourth consecutive term. Under the constitution, presidents may only serve a maximum of two terms; however, Ouattara argues major constitutional change which was implemented in 2016 “reset” his limit.\n\nIvory Coast, the world’s largest cocoa and cashew nut producer, is a regional powerhouse and West Africa’s second-largest economy. Perched along the coast of the western Atlantic, between Ghana and Liberia, it boasts vast swaths of rainforest and pristine beaches. About one-quarter of the 32 million population is concentrated in the commercial hub of Abidjan, while the government has its headquarters in the inland capital city of Yamoussoukro. French is the official language in the former colony of France, while the main indigenous languages are Bete, Baoule, Dioula and Senufo.\n\nThe nation has seen steady economic advancement under Ouattara, according to metrics from the World Bank, but citizens complain of the rising cost of living and what they say is the unequal playing field for political contenders.\n\nIvory Coast has historically experienced deadly pre- and post-electoral violence. Election violence escalated into the second Ivorian civil war in 2011, when more than 3,000 people were killed after then-President Laurent Gbagbo refused to concede defeat to Ouattara. This time around, sporadic  protests  have already erupted in the weeks leading up to the election in response to a  ban on key contenders  from the polls, particularly Tidjane Thiam, the popular former head of Credit Suisse bank.\n\nThe government has cracked down on these protests, issuing a ban on demonstrations and arresting at least 237 people from the Common Front political movement, which campaigns against the exclusion of political candidates. By Tuesday this week, 58 people had been sentenced to 36 months in prison for protesting.\n\nMore than 44,000 police officers and military personnel have been deployed across the country to maintain calm at the polls, but analysts worry that election-day violence will be inevitable.\n\nSome 8.7 million registered citizens aged above 18 will be eligible to vote this time, but the country has a low average voter turnout. In the 2020 elections, only 53 percent turned up at the polls.\n\nThe winning candidate must take an absolute majority of the votes; a second round will take place if no one clears a majority in the first.\n\nThe Constitutional Council shocked Ivorians in June when it upheld a lower court ruling that Tidjane Thiam, leader of the main opposition Democratic Party of the Ivory Coast (PDCI) and Ouattara’s biggest challenger, would be barred as a result of his erstwhile dual nationality.\n\nThe 63-year-old has widespread support from young people. He formerly worked in leading financial institutions, including Credit Suisse.\n\nThiam, a cousin of the first Ivorian president from 1960 to 1993, Felix Houphouet-Boigny, was born in the Ivory Coast but also received French nationality in 1987. Although he renounced it in March, the court ruled this was too late.\n\nAlso barred is former president and arch Ouattara rival Laurent Gbagbo of the African People’s Party of the Ivory Coast (PPA-CI), who was charged with crimes against humanity in connection with the 2011 election-related civil war, when he refused to step down for the declared winner, Ouattara.\n\nGbagbo, 80, was indicted at the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague, Netherlands, but returned to the Ivory Coast in 2021 following a lengthy trial and his ultimate acquittal. He was still barred from standing as president because of a criminal conviction in an Ivorian court, also related to the war.\n\nGbagbo’s close ally, Charles Ble Goude, who was also indicted and acquitted alongside him at the ICC, was excluded, as was Ouattara’s former prime minister, Guillaume Soro, who was convicted by an Ivorian court in 2021 on allegations of plotting a coup two years before.\n\nCritics say the exclusion of key candidates, particularly Gbagbo and Thiam, has given Ouattara an unfair head start and essentially cleared the way for his fourth term.\n\n“The exclusion of Gbagbo and Thiam has diminished political competition and will continue to drive political grievances that underpin civil unrest and political violence, including on the election day,” Beverly Ochieng, a Senegal-based political analyst at consulting firm Control Risks, told Al Jazeera.\n\nThe incumbent, Ouattara, 83, has been in office since December 2010.\n\nHe is the leader of the ruling Rally of Houphouetistes for Democracy and Peace (RHDP), and his government has been praised by observers for its efforts to restore unity following the bitter civil war, which was fuelled by ethnic tensions or ” Ivoirite ” – claims that particular ethnic groups were more “Ivorian” than others. The controversial term pitted groups in the predominantly Muslim north against the mainly Christian south. During his presidency, Gbagbo and his supporters had aimed to discredit Ouattara by calling him “non-Ivorian” because of rumours he has roots in neighbouring Burkina Faso.\n\nOuattara has a strong economic record, boosted by exports of cocoa and other agricultural products, as well as big infrastructure projects. Gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 8.2 percent on average each year in the first decade of Ouattara’s administration, according to the World Bank, and has continued to grow steadily since then, even during the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nHe was voted in as president for a second term in 2015 in a landslide victory. However, support for him has slipped since he decided to run again in 2020, as many Ivorians say it violated the two-term constitution limit. At the time, Ouattara initially said he would not run, but changed his mind after his party’s candidate died during the pandemic.\n\nBacked by the Constitutional Council, Ouattara’s supporters argue that the adoption of a new constitution in 2016, which removed age limits for presidential candidates and revised nationality requirements, automatically reset the clock on his terms. In effect, they argued, Ouattara was eligible for two more terms, starting with the 2020 election.\n\nViolent protests broke out following the president’s decision to run in 2020, and opposition parties boycotted the election, handing Ouattara another landslide. At least 85 people died in pre- and post-election riots.\n\nThere is widespread hostility across the Francophone West African countries towards their former coloniser, and the president’s decision to run for a fourth term has prompted protests in Abidjan, partly because of his perceived closeness to France.\n\nIn January 2025, the Ivorian government  shut down French military bases , which had been operating in the country for decades, a move analysts say was designed to appease the public.\n\nStill, Ouattara remains the clear favourite out of those who have been allowed to run, and he has promised to escalate infrastructure development and focus on education and health.\n\nAnalyst Ochieng noted that while the president retains support in the northern region, where he hails from, his party is also making inroads into the south, but is ultimately buoyed by state resources.\n\n“With each electoral cycle, the playing field continues to be uneven due to strong institutional control and influence by the ruling camp over the political and security apparatus,” she said.\n\nThe head of the Movement of Capable Generations party, formed in 2022, Simone Gbagbo, 73, was widely known as the Ivory Coast’s “Iron Lady” during the turbulent administration of her then-husband, Laurent Gbagbo, who led the country during the first civil war between 2002 and 2007, and provoked a bloodbath in 2011 when he refused to concede to Ouattara.\n\nSimone Gbagbo was widely viewed as a major orchestrator behind her husband’s decision. The couple were arrested together at their Abidjan residence in April 2011 in a raid by regional forces deployed to restore peace, leading to the end of the war.\n\nAlthough both Laurent and Simone Gbagbo were indicted by the ICC for alleged war crimes related to the conflict, Ouattara’s government did not extradite the former first lady. Instead, she went on trial in the country and was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2015 for crimes against the state. In 2018, Ouattara granted her amnesty. The couple divorced in 2023 following Laurent’s return from his trial at The Hague.\n\nIt is unclear why Simone has not been blocked from running for president despite her conviction. During her political rallies, she has stated that while Ouattara’s government has led infrastructure projects, she will address ongoing gaps in healthcare and job opportunities. She has also spoken out against the use of force against protesters and alleged raids on the homes of some opposition leaders.\n\nHaving resigned recently as trade minister, the 60-year-old is the candidate for the Democratic Congress (CODE), a new coalition of 18 parties and political movements. Billon has referred to himself as a right-leaning politician.\n\nThe businessman and parliament member previously tried and failed to become a candidate for the opposition PDCI party after Thiam was barred from running. The PDCI has not presented another candidate, and many of its supporters say they have been left not knowing who to vote for.\n\nBillon, who was a member of the cabinet until early this year, when he resigned to run for the elections, is promising “generational change” in leadership for Ivorians and has pledged to attract rapid private sector investment in the country. He is the son of Pierre Billon, founder of Ivory Coast’s agroindustrial company SIFCA Group, credited as the largest private employer in the country with about 17,000 workers.\n\nA former ally of Gbagbo, the ex-president, and his spokesperson during the 2011 crisis, Mello, 67, is running as an independent candidate after Gbagbo’s PPA-CI kicked him out over his decision to participate in the elections at all.\n\nMello, like other Gbagbo allies, has been subject to sanctions from the United States and the EU and was in self-exile from the Ivory Coast until 2021.\n\nThe 66-year-old leader of the centrist coalition, Group of Political Partners for Peace, is a campaigner for women in politics. She was briefly minister of social affairs between October and December 2000 under Gbagbo and was one of the first two women to ever run for the presidency during the 2015 elections.\n\nOpponents of Ouattara have strongly criticised the government’s ban on key political candidates, the blocking of protests and the arrests of demonstrators, and accuse the current president of backsliding on democratic values. There are concerns that there will be violent clashes between demonstrators calling for a vote boycott and security officials during the voting process.\n\nHowever, Ochieng, the analyst, noted that while violence may occur in the opposition strongholds of Abidjan and Yamoussoukro, it is unlikely it will spread across the country, as seen in the 2011 crisis, because of the heavy presence of government forces.\n\n“Despite political misgivings about Ouattara’s re-election bid, politicians do not want to appear as if they are encouraging acts of violence or vandalism that will likely lead to their prosecution,” Ochieng said, adding that there have so far been no signs of any sort of systematic mobilisation which could disrupt the polls.\n\nCritics of Ouattara say his progress on the economy has been largely buoyed by International Monetary Fund-backed loans and, importantly, has not been equally experienced, with development centred on urban areas.\n\nAt present, the country  owes  more than $4bn to the IMF, and is one of the eight most indebted countries to the institution.\n\nMore than 39 percent of the population was living below the national poverty line in 2023, according to the World Bank.\n\nThe household consumption of the richest 20 percent of the population is about six times what the poorest 20 percent consume, according to the World Bank.\n\nThere is also sharp economic disparity between urban areas, where the poverty rate is an already very high 31 percent, and rural areas, where it is 54.6 percent. The quality and availability of crucial infrastructure such as water, schools and healthcare centres also differ sharply between the more deprived north and the wealthier south.\n\nClimate change is adding to inequality, with heatwaves disrupting cocoa production as well as the harvest of tomatoes, chillies and other food crops in poorer, rural areas. The country has been forced to rely on neighbouring countries like Burkina Faso and Niger for food imports.\n\nIvory Coast is also vulnerable to spill-over violence from its Sahel neighbours,  Mali  and Burkina Faso, where armed groups such as Jama’a Nusrat ul-Islam wa al-Muslimin (JNIM) and the ISIL affiliate in the Greater Sahara (ISGS) have been conducting a violent rampage, attacking communities and military bases.\n\nIn March 2016, three armed men attacked a hotel at the beach resort of Grand Bassam, killing 19 people. Two groups – al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and al-Mourabitoun – later claimed responsibility for the attack. It marked the first such attack on Ivorian soil.\n\nAgain, in June 2020, armed men raided a military outpost in northern Kafolo, on the border with Burkina Faso, killing 14 soldiers and injuring others.\n\nThis is a key issue in the campaign of Ouattara, who has pledged to ensure security. He has harped on the need for stability at a time of rising regional insecurity. His government, since 2022, has boosted the defence budget, increased troop deployments in the northern regions neighbouring the Sahel, and bought armoured tanks from countries like China."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/18/trump-torpedoes-international-deal-to-reduce-shipping-emissions","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"07:32:37+00:00","title":"Trump torpedoes international deal to reduce shipping emissions","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The International Maritime Organization (IMO) postponed the formal adoption of the Net Zero Framework (NZF), a global carbon-pricing system aimed at reducing shipping emissions, by at least 12 months after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened sanctions on countries supporting the plan.

emissions\n\nMembers of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) have voted to postpone approving a plan to curb shipping emissions, after United States President Donald Trump threatened to impose sanctions on countries that supported the measure.\n\nThe vote on Friday set back plans to regulate the shipping industry’s contributions to climate change by at least 12 months, even though the Net Zero Framework (NZF) had already been approved by members of the London-based IMO, a United Nations body,  in April .\n\nThe decision to formally delay adopting the framework until late next year came a day after President Trump took to his Truth Social platform, saying: “I am outraged that the International Maritime Organization is voting in London this week to pass a global Carbon Tax.”\n\n“The United States will NOT stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping,” he said, telling countries to vote against the plan.\n\nWashington also threatened to impose sanctions, visa restrictions and port levies on countries that supported the deal.\n\nIn advance of this week’s meeting in London, about 63 IMO members who had voted for the plan in April were expected to maintain their support for curbs on emissions, and others were expected to join the initiative to formally approve the framework.\n\nFollowing Trump’s social media threat, delegates in London instead voted on a hastily arranged resolution to push back proceedings on the matter, which passed by 57 votes to 49.\n\nThe IMO, which comprises 176 member countries, is responsible for regulating the safety and security of international shipping and preventing pollution on the high seas.\n\nSince returning to power in January, Trump has focused on reversing Washington’s course on climate change, encouraging fossil fuel use by deregulation, cutting funding for  clean energy projects  and promising businesses to  “drill, baby drill”.\n\nA spokesman for UN chief Antonio Guterres called Friday’s decisions “a missed opportunity for member states to place the shipping sector on a clear, credible path towards net zero emissions”.\n\nThe International Chamber of Shipping, representing more than 80 percent of

Weather Attribution and United States-based Climate Central has calculated the increase in dangerous “superhot days” – defined as warmer than 90 percent of comparable days between 1991 and 2020 – due to climate change.\n\nThe report, which is not yet peer-reviewed but uses established techniques for climate attribution, was released on Thursday. It highlights the significant effect of the  Paris Climate Agreement .\n\nBefore the 2015 accord, the world was on track for a catastrophic 4C (7.2F) of warming by the end of the century, which would have resulted in an additional 114 superhot days per year.\n\nBy fulfilling current commitments to curb emissions, the world is now heading towards 2.6C (4.7F) of warming. Under this scenario, the Earth will still add 57 superhot days annually by 2100 – nearly two months of dangerously high temperatures – but this is half the increase of the worst-case scenario. Since 2015, the world has already added 11 superhot days on average.\n\nPotsdam Climate Institute Director Johan Rockstrom, who was not part of the research team, said people should not be relieved that we are no longer on the 4-degree warming pre-Paris trajectory because the current track “would still imply a disastrous future for billions of humans on Earth”.\n\nThe report does not say how many people will be affected by the additional dangerously hot days, but coauthor Friederike Otto of Imperial College London said “it will definitely be tens of thousands or millions, not less”. She noted that thousands die in heatwaves each year already.\n\nThe study also underscores the profound unfairness of the impact of climate change across the world, showing a massive disconnect between carbon pollution and expected heat exposure.\n\nThe 10 countries that will experience the biggest increase in dangerous heat days are almost all small, ocean-dependent nations like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa. These countries are expected to see the largest spikes, with Panama projected to face 149 extra superhot days a year. These 10 nations collectively produce only 1 percent of global heat-trapping gases.\n\nIn stark contrast, the top carbon-polluting countries – the United States, China, and India – are predicted to get only between 23 and 30 extra superhot days.

Mamdani defends his Muslim faith amid ‘racist, baseless attacks’\n\nNew York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani gave an emotional speech addressing “racist, baseless attacks” from his opponents, a day before early voting begins in the race he is projected to win.\n\nSpeaking outside a mosque in the Bronx on Friday, Mamdani criticised his opponents for bringing “hatred to the forefront”, noting that their Islamophobia not only affects him as the Democratic nominee for mayor but also  close to one million Muslims  living in New York.\n\n“To be Muslim in New York is to expect indignity, but indignity does not make us distinct. There are many New Yorkers who face it. It is the tolerance of that indignity that does,” Mamdani said in his speech, less than two weeks ahead of the November 4 general election.\n\nMamdani, who is currently a member of the New York State Assembly, said that while he had tried to focus his election campaign on his  core message of affordability , his opponents in recent days had shown that “Islamophobia has emerged as one of the few areas of agreement”.\n\nHis speech also came a day after his top opponent, former New York State Governor  Andrew Cuomo , laughed after radio host Sid Rosenberg said that Mamdani “would be cheering” if another September 11 attack occurred.\n\nCuomo, who is a member of the Democratic Party but lost the Democratic primary election to Mamdani in June, responded in agreement with Rosenberg: “That’s another problem.”\n\nBasim Elkarra, the executive director of Muslim advocacy group CAIR Action, described Cuomo’s appearance on the radio programme as “despicable, dangerous, and disqualifying”.\n\n“By agreeing with a racist radio host who suggested a Muslim elected official would ‘cheer’ another 9/11, Cuomo has crossed a moral line,” Elkarra said.\n\n“Cuomo’s willingness to engage in this kind of hate speech, on this kind of platform, shows exactly the kind of leader he is: someone who would rather stoke fear than bring people together,” he said.\n\nSpeaking on Friday, Mamdani said he had also been “slandered” by Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa on the debate stage, “when he claimed that I support global jihad”, and faced advertisements from  Super Political Action Committees  that “imply that I am a terrorist, or mock the way I eat”.\n\nHe also shared his memories of his “aunt who stopped taking the subway after September 11 because she did not feel safe in her hijab”, and a staff member who had the “word terrorist spray painted” on their garage, as well as the advice he had received that he “did not have to tell people” he was Muslim, if he wanted to win elections.\n\nEarlier on Friday, Mamdani received a long-anticipated endorsement from Hakeem Jeffries, the leader of the Democratic Party in the US House of Representatives and the representative of New York’s eighth congressional district, which includes the Brooklyn neighbourhoods of East Flatbush, Coney Island and Brownsville.\n\nWhile Mamdani has earned endorsements from top Democrats, including  New York Governor Kathy Hochul , New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and independent Senator  Bernie Sanders , the vocally pro-Palestinian candidate has struggled to win over other top New York Democrats, such as Senator Chuck Schumer.\n\nDespite the reluctance of some establishment figures within the Democratic Party, Mamdani  resoundingly won  the party’s primary election to choose its candidate for the general election back in June.\n\nCurrent NYC Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat who did not contest the primary after  facing corruption allegations , endorsed Cuomo this week after withdrawing from the race, although his name will still appear on the ballot.\n\nA recently published poll from AARP and Gotham Polling and Analytics shows Mamdani well ahead of his opponents with the support of 43.2 percent of voters.\n\nHe is followed by Cuomo with 28.9 percent and Sliwa with 19.4 percent, while 8.4 percent said they were undecided or preferred another candidate.\n\nCost of living was the main issue for nearly two-thirds of voters, with public safety and housing affordability also areas of concern, in the same poll."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/25/what-military-force-has-the-us-positioned-off-venezuelas-coast","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"04:51:17+00:00","title":"What military force has the US positioned off Venezuela’s coast?","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United States has conducted at least ten deadly military strikes on Venezuelan vessels off its coast since September 2025, under the authority of US Southern Command (SOUTHCOM).

2025-10-25T04:51:17+00:00\n\nTitle: What military force has the US positioned off Venezuela’s coast?\n\nUnited States President Donald Trump’s campaign against “narcoterrorists” has transformed the Caribbean into a new battlefield.\n\nSince August, Washington has deployed thousands of troops, warships and aircraft across the region, and reopened military bases in Puerto Rico and conducted drills, in what analysts describe as the largest US presence in Latin America in decades.\n\nIn September, the US began a series of  strikes  on Venezuelan boats it claims were trafficking drugs to the US, with the latest attack on Friday killing six people on board. Last week, Trump  announced  that he had authorised covert CIA operations in Venezuela and that he was even mulling a land attack.\n\nHowever, on Thursday, Trump denied that all this amounts to a declaration of war on Venezuela.\n\n“Well, I don’t think we’re going to necessarily ask for a declaration of war,” he said.\n\n“I think we’re just going to kill people that are bringing drugs into our country. OK? We’re going to kill them,” Trump said.\n\nThe US military has carried out at least ten deadly strikes on vessels off Venezuela’s coast, and in the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean since September 2, marking the most intense American military activity in Latin America since the US invasion of Panama in 1989.\n\nThe operations, conducted under the authority of the US Southern Command (SOUTHCOM), have killed at least  43 people , according to statements by Trump and senior defence officials.\n\nThe map below shows the approximate locations of at least six of these attacks, according to data compiled by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data (ACLED). Most of these attacks occurred close to the Venezuelan coast and in international waters – raising questions about the legality of the US’s use of force, especially when no imminent threat was present.\n\nUS Southern Command (SOUTHCOM), headquartered in Doral, Florida, is one of 11 unified combatant commands of the US Department of War (renamed by Trump from the Department of Defense). It oversees operations in Central and South America and the Caribbean, including the defence of the Panama Canal.\n\nThe other 10 commands cover different regions or functions such as North America (NORTHCOM), Europe (EUCOM), Africa (AFRICOM), the Middle East (CENTCOM), and the Indo-Pacific (INDOPACOM), while others have global responsibilities like cyber operations (CYBERCOM), space (SPACECOM), nuclear deterrence (STRATCOM), strategic logistics (TRANSCOM) and Special Operations forces worldwide (SOCOM).\n\nWhile SOUTHCOM’s current stated mission is to counter narcotics flows into the US, its growing presence near Venezuela has been interpreted as a sign of Trump’s strategic interest in the region.\n\nThe military buildup is considerable and includes ready-to-deploy expeditionary forces, US naval and air assets, and special operations units.\n\nAl Jazeera’s Defence Editor, Alex Gatopoulos, said, “It’s already the biggest build-up of US military assets in the region for decades. The present force is oriented for land attack and not for counter-narcotics operations.\n\nThe Iwo Jima Amphibious Ready Group (ARG) forms the expeditionary core of the US presence in the Caribbean. This group of Navy ships carrying marines, vehicles and helicopters, named after the famous World War II battle of Iwo Jima, is designed to land on a shore quickly, often in emergencies or combat situations.\n\nAlong with the USS San Antonio (LPD 17) and the USS Fort Lauderdale (LPD 28), the expeditionary force houses 4,500 sailors and marines, including 2,200 marines trained for amphibious assault and rapid reaction missions.\n\nThe group has also conducted live-fire drills on board the Iwo Jima and amphibious landing rehearsals off St Croix, the largest of the US Virgin Islands and a key training site for US forces.\n\nThe fleet is also reinforced with several naval assets. Late on Friday, the US announced it will send an aircraft carrier strike group to Latin America, in a major escalation of its military presence.\n\nA spokesperson for the US military said that Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth ordered the USS Gerald Ford and five destroyers in its accompanying strike group to deploy to the region.\n\nAs of September 25, SOUTHCOM’s task force includes 10 major warships and several support vessels, exceeding the number normally assigned to the region. Among them are four surface combatants and one submarine capable of carrying Tomahawk long-range missiles.\n\nThe destroyers, USS Jason Dunham (DDG-109), USS Stockdale (DDG-106) and USS Gravely (DDG-107), are multi-role warships armed with Tomahawk land-attack missiles as well as advanced anti-air and anti-submarine systems. All three were reportedly deployed to the Red Sea in 2024 to counter Houthi attacks in the region.\n\nAlongside them, the USS Newport News (SSN-750), a nuclear-powered fast attack submarine, provides capabilities for strikes, antiship and antisubmarine operations, as well as intelligence, reconnaissance and special operations.\n\nThere are also several noncombatant support ships, as well as the US Coast Guard.\n\nThe air component deployed under SOUTHCOM includes some of the most advanced aircraft in the US Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force.\n\nGatopoulos states that, added to the various deployments “have been the intimidation tactics of flying strategic bombers close to Venezuelan airspace… The B-52 is designed to destroy land-based targets, from some distance away, usually using long-range cruise missiles.”\n\nThese heavy bombers can fly at altitudes of up to 50,000 feet (15,000 metres) and carry cruise missiles or nuclear-capable weapons. They also support naval operations by monitoring the ocean, targeting ships and laying mines.\n\n“The B-1 strategic bomber is designed to penetrate enemy airspace to deliver 37 tonnes of ordnance onto its target. Neither jet is in any way useful for stopping drug-smuggling. This plus President Trump’s public announcement to the CIA to start operations within Venezuela tells me they have something very different in mind, namely to destabilise the Maduro government,” says Gatopoulos.\n\n“The latest development, the ordering of the Gerald Ford Carrier Strike Group to the Caribbean further cements this idea. The Carrier group is immensely powerful, bringing with it 75+ fighter jets, helicopters and early warning aircraft. The USS Ford will be accompanied by three missile destroyers, each capable of attacking targets deep within Venezuela – a huge amount of firepower.”\n\nThere are also at least 10 F-35 stealth fighters – highly versatile jets which can strike, fight and gather intelligence while remaining hard to detect by radar.\n\nMQ-9 Reaper drones are remotely piloted aircraft used for surveillance and precision strikes, with a range of 1,851km (1,150 miles) and speeds up to 370km/h (230mph). They can carry up to 16 Hellfire missiles, allowing them to strike multiple targets in a single mission.\n\nCH-53E Super Stallions are heavy-lift helicopters that move troops and equipment from ship to shore. They can carry 16 tonnes of cargo 80km (50 miles) before returning to base.\n\nOther air assets include P-8 Poseidon patrol aircraft, MH-60 Seahawk helicopters, AC-130J gunships, and various support and reconnaissance aircraft.\n\nSOUTHCOM’s special operations component consists of MH-60 Black Hawks and AH-MH-6 Little Bird helicopters for troop insertion and reconnaissance. The MC Ocean Trader, which is part of the deployment, acts as a mobile forward base for these units.\n\nAbout 10,000 troops have also been sent to the US territory of Puerto Rico, while the White House has authorised the CIA to carry out covert operations inside Venezuela.\n\nOn September 4, two Venezuelan F-16 fighter jets flew over the USS Jason Dunham in what was seen as a highly provocative act, according to Washington. In response, the US deployed 10 F-35B fighters and two MQ-9 Reapers to Puerto Rico.\n\nOn September 17, Venezuela launched large-scale naval and air exercises, while President Nicolas Maduro ordered the mobilisation of the Bolivarian militia, a reserve force which is part of Venezuela’s armed forces, the Bolivarian National Armed Forces (FANB), and called for millions of volunteers to defend the country’s sovereignty.\n\nWhile President Trump insists that US operations in the Caribbean Sea are lawful counter-narcotics missions, Venezuelan officials regard them as an escalation in tensions and attacks on vessels as a violation of international law. It says there has been no evidence that targeted vessels have posed any imminent threat."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1lqmmp2lg2o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"23:05:24.954+00:00","title":"Irish presidential election: Counting due to get under way on Saturday","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Irish presidential election concluded on Friday, with voting taking place across the country to elect the 10th president to succeed Michael D Higgins.

in the Republic of Ireland went to the polls on Friday to elect the 10th Irish president, who will replace current head of state Michael D Higgins.\n\nThere are two contenders to become the next president, but voters had a choice of three candidates - Catherine Connolly, Heather Humphreys and Jim Gavin, whose  withdrawal from the race  came too late to have his name removed from the ballot paper.\n\nBallot boxes will open at 09.00 local time on Saturday and the result is due to be announced at Dublin Castle later that evening.\n\nEarly unofficial indications have suggested the turnout could potentially struggle to reach the record low of just under 40% recorded in the last presidential election in 2018.\n\nConnolly is an independent politician backed by a number of left-wing parties including Sinn Féin.\n\nShe has been a TD (member of parliament) since 2016 and previously worked as a psychologist and barrister. She is from Galway.\n\nHumphreys is the Fine Gael candidate. She was a TD from 2011 to 2024 and served in a number of senior cabinet ministerial positions, including social protection and justice.\n\nShe comes from a Protestant background and is from Monaghan.\n\nThe votes, which will be counted in each of the 43 constituencies, will be tallied by political parties as soon as boxes open and these will give early indications of the result.\n\nSome 3.6 million people were eligible to vote in the election, which comes to an end after months of campaigning by both candidates.\n\nTo get nominated, candidates needed either 20 members of the Oireachtas, the Irish houses of parliament, or four city and county councils, to back them.\n\nConnolly was the first to declare her intention to run last July.\n\nShe has the support of a number of left-wing parties, including Sinn Féin, Labour and the Social Democrats as well as independent politicians.\n\nHumphreys was selected to run for Fine Gael after the party's initial candidate, former EU Commissioner Mairead McGuinness, withdrew from the race in August for medical reasons.\n\nA third candidate, Jim Gavin, who was selected by the main coalition party, Fianna Fáil, withdrew from the campaign earlier in October after  intense controversy over a 16-year-old rental dispute  in which he owed €3,300 (£2,870) to a former tenant.\n\nHowever, as his withdrawal came after the close of nominations, the law states his name must remain on the ballot paper.\n\nAny votes cast for him will be counted as legitimate and transferred to the two other candidates if necessary."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/15/is-your-beef-linked-to-amazon-deforestation-a-report-highlights-loopholes","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-15","timeOfPublication":"13:18:36+00:00","title":"Is your beef linked to Amazon deforestation?

2025-10-15T13:18:36+00:00\n\nTitle: Is your beef linked to Amazon deforestation? A report highlights loopholes\n\nThe world’s largest meat company, JBS, has allegedly fuelled illegal deforestation, land grabs and human rights abuses in the Brazilian Amazon by sourcing cattle from ranches operating inside protected areas, according to a new Human Rights Watch investigation.\n\nOn Wednesday, the nonprofit issued an 86-page report focusing on the state of Pará, where the United Nations will hold its annual climate change summit, COP30, next month.\n\nThe report highlights a gap in JBS’s supply chain: Human Rights Watch claims the meat company does not track its indirect cattle suppliers.\n\nInvestigators found that cattle raised on illegally deforested land were moved through a “laundering” system that concealed their origins before they reached JBS.\n\nThat, in turn, means JBS cannot guarantee that its beef or leather products are not contributing to deforestation and related abuses.\n\nWithout a better system for tracing livestock, JBS will continue to be “unable to root out illegal cattle ranches”, according to Luciana Téllez, a senior environment researcher at Human Rights Watch.\n\nAnd what JBS does not know could make it responsible for bankrolling illegal ranches that clear-cut the Amazon, she explained.\n\n“We cannot say with 100-percent certainty that the cattle that JBS purchased from its direct suppliers are the same ones that are coming from illegal cattle ranches, but neither can JBS,” Téllez told Al Jazeera.\n\n“That’s a problem, because they are responsible for what they are procuring.”\n\nWednesday’s report is part of an ever-growing body of literature delving into the impact agriculture has had on the Amazon rainforest.\n\nThe construction of ranches and farmland is considered the single biggest direct cause of deforestation in the world’s tropical regions.\n\nThe Amazon rainforest is no exception. In recent years, cattle ranching has emerged as a primary culprit in the levelling of its tangled, biodiverse jungles.\n\nThe northern state of Pará is key to the fight against further loss. It has consistently recorded the highest levels of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon since 2016.\n\nIn 2024 alone, 17,195 square kilometres (6,639 sq miles) of forest in the state were degraded, a 421-percent increase over the previous year, according to Human Rights Watch.\n\nThe state also reports the second-largest number of land conflicts in Brazil, with illegal ranchers, farmers and criminal groups seeking to invade protected land.\n\nFor Indigenous and traditional communities that consider the Amazon home, these invasions have been devastating. Residents have seen their crops destroyed, the forest burned, and their lives displaced.\n\nIn some cases, community members have even been threatened, attacked or killed after denouncing the land grabs.\n\nThough federal law prohibits such activity, some land-grabbers have succeeded in fraudulently registering protected rainforest as private properties.\n\nWednesday’s report documented encroachments in two protected areas: the Cachoeira Seca Indigenous territory and the Terra Nossa sustainable development area.\n\n“The level of violence and intimidation by land grabbers in Terra Nossa is truly frightening, and the absolute impunity they’ve enjoyed for years is astonishing,” Tellez told Al Jazeera.\n\nHuman Rights Watch said that Pará’s state animal health agency, Adepará, had registered ranches in both tracts of land. It also authorised the transportation of cattle in and out of the two areas.\n\nAccording to the report, Adepará claimed that it has not historically been tasked with observing environmental criteria when authorising livestock movements.\n\nBut with the state agency’s approval, Human Rights Watch said cattle were raised illegally inside the protected rainforest zones and then transferred out to other ranches.\n\nFrom there, they could reach major slaughterhouses, including JBS facilities.\n\nEach transfer helped obscure the cattle’s illegal origin, effectively laundering the animals into the meat trade.\n\nPart of the problem, according to Human Rights Watch, is Brazil’s system for tracking livestock.\n\nBrazil does not keep full histories of individual animals. Instead, their movements are documented with “animal transit permits”, known as Guias de Trânsito Animal or GTAs.\n\nThose permits collect information about overall shipments of animals: the number of cattle involved, plus data about the sex and the age of those in the group.\n\nBut without an individual record for every cow, calf and bull, it is difficult, if not impossible, to trace their origins.\n\nIn an April filing to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, JBS acknowledged the loopholes in how the GTA system traces cattle.\n\n“As a result, there can be no assurance that available monitoring procedures can ensure that the origin of any head of cattle was in full compliance with applicable laws,” JBS wrote.\n\nThe company has promised to require its suppliers to declare their suppliers by 2026. Yet, Human Rights Watch says it remains unclear how such information would be verified or enforced.\n\n“The best solution is for the federal government itself to institute a traceability mechanism for cattle across Brazil,” Tellez said. “The Brazilian government is moving towards that, but it’s moving extremely slowly.”\n\nJBS also made a similar commitment more than a decade and a half ago. In 2009, the company signed the G4 Cattle Agreement with environmental group Greenpeace, pledging to identify all its indirect suppliers by 2011. It failed to meet that deadline.\n\n“It’s unacceptable that companies such as JBS have not fulfilled the promises that they made in the past,” Cristiane Mazzetti, a forest campaign coordinator at Greenpeace Brazil, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“It’s something that now governments need to reflect upon and regulate in a more stringent way, because only believing in voluntary corporate commitments is not going to deliver.”\n\nJBS did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment by publication.\n\nBut reform may be on the horizon. In 2023, Pará’s governor introduced a decree requiring all animal movements in the state to be fully traceable by the end of 2026.\n\nAt the federal level, the Ministry of Agriculture announced a similar plan in December 2024, mandating that all states implement tracking systems by 2032.\n\nHowever, Human Rights Watch warns that this timeline is too slow and could allow illegal ranching to persist for years.\n\nExperts and advocacy groups say that Brazil should take immediate steps, including by making GTA data publicly accessible. Such measures would help law enforcement agencies identify fraudulent movements and trace cattle back to illegal ranches.\n\n“Companies struggle with traceability, firstly because they have minimal access to public data on the production chain,” said Lisandro Inakake, an agronomist with the Brazilian environmental nonprofit Imaflora.\n\nHe added that the struggle is compounded “because there are no universal market requirements covering all of the companies’ operations”.\n\nWhile Human Rights Watch has called on JBS to voluntarily start tracing the lifespan of its cattle, Mazzetti, the Greenpeace campaigner, believes more decisive action is necessary if deforestation is to be stopped.\n\n“It’s not time for new promises,” she said. “It’s time to be held accountable for all the impacts that their supply chain generated in the Amazon, in other ecosystems, and also on the climate.”"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c04g5x1wq5vo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"19:27:18.977+00:00","title":"Men jailed over arson attack for Russia on Ukrainian business in London","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Six men have been jailed in the UK for carrying out an arson attack on a Ukrainian aid warehouse in Leyton, east London, on 20 March 2024.

Her body was discovered in a plastic storage box in the courtyard of the building where she lived in north-eastern Paris.\n\nBenkired is an Algerian immigrant who was under orders to leave the country. French right-wing and far-right politicians have seized on the case.\n\nThe prosecutor in trial had argued for Benkired to received the longest sentence possible. Benkired was examined by psychiatric experts and found to have \"psychopathic\" traits but otherwise sane.\n\nThe prosecutor told a panel of three judges and six jurors: \"Make no mistake no drug treatment can fundamentally transform Ms Benkired's personality. When there is no illness, there is no treatment.\"\n\nBefore jurors began their deliberations on Friday, Benkired told the court: \"I ask for forgiveness and what I did is horrible.\n\n\"That's all I have to say.\"\n\nCCTV footage from the afternoon of 14 October, 2022 showed Benkired, then 24 years-old, approaching Lola after she returned home from school.\n\nAccording to reports, Benkired lured Lola into an apartment her older sister was sub-letting in the building.\n\nOver an hour-and-a-half, Benkired subjected the 12-year-old to a sexual assault before attacking her with scissors and a box cutter.\n\nBenkired bound Lola with duct tape, including around her head, leading to her death by asphyxiation.\n\nAs he read out the verdict, the presiding judge referred to the \"extreme cruelty of the criminal acts\" which he described as \"true torture\".\n\n\"In determining the appropriate sentence, the court took into account the unspeakable psychological damage to the victim and her family in such violent and almost unspeakable circumstances,\" he said.\n\nBenkired was in France on a student visa but had failed to renew it. In July 2022, she was stopped at an airport in Paris and was given 30 days to leave the country.\n\nDays after Lola's murder in October that year, Jordan Bardella, president of France's far-right National Rally party wrote on X that the woman \"had no business being in France\".\n\nHard-right rival Éric Zemmour also took to social media to write: \"Lola's murderer should never have crossed her path.\"\n\nFrance's Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin criticised the \"indecency\" of politicians who, he said, \"should reflect on the consequences of their words\".\n\nLola's mother and her father, Johan Daviet, denounced \"any use of the name and image of [our] child for political ends\".\n\nMr Daviet died in 2024, aged 49."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn09j4xw7jeo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"02:29:17.902+00:00","title":"The $500m slugger who is taking Canada to the World Series","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Vladimir Guerrero Jr., the Toronto Blue Jays' first baseman and a Canadian-born, Dominican-raised player, is leading the team to its first World Series appearance in 32 years after signing a record-breaking $500 million contract.

2025-10-25T02:29:17.902+00:00\n\nTitle: The $500m slugger who is taking Canada to the World Series \n\nToronto Blue Jays first baseman Vladimir Guerrero Jr wants fans to have no doubt: He was \"born ready\".\n\nThe Canadian-born, Dominican Republic-raised slugger who just signed a $500m (£374m) contract - the third largest in Major League Baseball (MLB) history - is widely viewed as the team's best player and a key reason why Toronto is finally in the World Series for the first time in 32 years.\n\nIn many ways, his life had led up to this very moment. His father, baseball Hall of Famer Vladimir Guerrero Sr, spent the bulk of his career playing for the now-defunct Montreal Expos, but a World Series title always eluded him.\n\nHis son, who was born in Montreal, is now vowing to bring the championship ring home and give it to his father.\n\n\"My personal goal is to win a World Series and give the ring to my dad,\" the younger Guerrero said in an interview with Tom Verducci of Fox Sports and Sports Illustrated.\n\nGuerrero has played a massive role in Toronto's postseason success, and was crowned Most Valuable Player in the division series leading up to the championship.\n\nNow, the Toronto Blue Jays are facing the Los Angeles Dodgers in Game 1 of the World Series on Friday, in what promises to be a storybook match-up between the defending champions and the underdogs.\n\nBoth teams are anchored by two of the most exciting talents in modern baseball. For Los Angeles, that's Shohei Ohtani, the Japanese superstar whose record-breaking $700m deal made headlines around the world, and who is hailed for being elite both as a pitcher and a hitter.\n\nFor Toronto, it's Guerrero Jr - affectionately nicknamed Vladdy Jr among fans - who made his own headlines earlier this year in April after signing the astonishing 14-year, multi-million deal with Toronto.\n\nThat deal was newsworthy not only for its size, but also for what it symbolised. Guerrero Jr, whose baseball career was closely-watched since he was a three-year-old warming up with his father and the Expos, effectively committed the rest of his playing life to Canada's sole MLB team.\n\nAt the time, Guerrero Jr said he felt \"fortunate to carry my dad's legacy and represent an entire country,\" and vowed to bring the World Series championship back to Canada.\n\nBefore April, that promise felt like a long shot. The Blue Jays finished the 2024 season at the bottom of their division, and this year's start was tinged with uncertainty over whether Toronto had what it takes — financially and culturally — to keep a superstar like Guerrero Jr.\n\n\"Toronto is known for not signing big, free agents because they don't want to play here,\" preferring more lucrative hubs like New York or Los Angeles, said Liz McGuire, a life-long Blue Jays fan who hosts a podcast called Jay Bird Watching.\n\nThe Canadian city had been burned before. In 2017, fan-favourite Jose Bautista was lured away by the promise of bigger money.\n\nIn 2023, Toronto went into a frenzy over a rumour that Ohtani was going to sign with the Blue Jays. Fans obsessively tracked a private jet flying from Orange County to Toronto in hopes of catching a glimpse of his arrival to the city.\n\nBut when the plane's doors opened, it was Canadian businessman and television personality Robert Herjavec who stepped out instead. The next day, Ohtani announced he had signed a 10-year contract with the Dodgers in sunny Los Angeles. Hearts sank across Toronto.\n\nBut the Blue Jays still had Guerrero Jr, who had been playing with them since he was just 16 years old.\n\n\"He was hitting dingers as a kid,\" recalled Ms McGuire, using the slang term for a home run. When she learned the team had signed him to a 14-year contract, she celebrated by spending $2,500 on a game-used bat signed by him.\n\nGuerrero Jr has earned his eye-watering salary not just on the field, but by being \"incredibly likeable,\" said Rob Silver, an Expos-turned-Blue Jays fan who lives in Ottawa, and who hosts a baseball podcast called Launch Angle.\n\n\"The fact that he's a big kid who happens to be this unworldly superstar and future Hall of Famer, and he chose us, that's everything.\"\n\nFans are quick to point out Guerrero Jr's sportsmanship and his dedication to Toronto on and off the diamond. During Game 5 against the Seattle Mariners, he rushed to the field to help his teammate, outfielder George Springer, limp to the bench after getting hit in the kneecap with a ball. Springer would go on to score the winning three-run home run in Game 7.\n\nOff the field, Guerrero Jr appears humble. He lives with his grandmother, and he even incorporated her traditional Dominican dishes into his trainer's diet plan. In recent years, the native Spanish speaker has begun giving more interviews in English to connect with Canadian fans.\n\nAnd in what may be the biggest sign of his complete embrace of the city, Guerrero Jr donned an Auston Matthews Toronto Maple Leafs jersey ahead of the Game 7 match-up against Seattle - ignoring any warnings of alleged curses (the hockey team has famously failed to make it to the Stanley Cup year after year).\n\nIt was a cheeky nod to Canada's most popular sport. While baseball - known colloquially  as \"America's pastime\" -  does not hold the same place in Canadians' national identity as ice hockey, the Jays win has become a rallying moment for the whole country.\n\nIn Toronto, hundreds flooded the streets, climbing poles, playing bagpipes and waving Canadian flags as they broke into impromptu renditions of the national anthem. In Calgary, a hockey game was briefly interrupted to announce the Blue Jays' victory. In New Brunswick, a local church put up a sign that read: \"Thank you God for your love and for George Springer!\"\n\nThe Blue Jays are getting support from Americans, too. Cole Greenhouse, a Lieutenant Commander in the US Navy originally from Missouri, said he typically cheers for the St Louis Cardinals. This World Series, however, he is backing Toronto.\n\nHis first baseball hat at age 11 was a Blue Jays one, he recalled. On Tuesday, he wore a similar cap \"so everybody can see\" his support.\n\nNichole Perry, a Chicago Cubs fan who lives in Phoenix, Arizona, said that she, too, is backing the Blue Jays. Ms Perry said she and other baseball fans are fatigued with the Dodgers' seemingly unlimited budget and \"super team,\" and that it is heartwarming to see how much Canada has embraced the sport she loves.\n\nThe win was also felt in Guerrero Jr's hometown of Don Gregorio in the Dominican Republic, with videos circulating online showing fans celebrating the team.\n\nMany acknowledge that the Los Angeles Dodgers are a tough squad to beat. But plenty of fans still believe the Blue Jays could win it all. \"The nature of baseball is unlike any sport,\" noted Mr Silver. \"Truly, any team could win.\"\n\nAfter the win against Seattle on Monday, the cameras caught Guerrero Jr fighting back tears. The internet was soon flooded with that image, paired with photos of him as a young boy standing beside his father in a Montreal Expos uniform – an emotional snapshot of a journey years in the making.\n\n\"This kid is heading to the World Series.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdx4g2pke12o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"23:03:46.031+00:00","title":"Tanzania election: The fears that voting time brings for those with albinism","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During Tanzania’s upcoming presidential and parliamentary elections, a wave of fear grips people with albinism, who face violent attacks driven by superstitions that falsely believe their body parts bring wealth or power.

But for those with albinism, they bring terror.\n\nWarning: This article contains details of graphic violence that some people may find upsetting\n\n\"The first thing that comes to me is fear,\" Mariam tells the BBC as people prepare to vote for a president and parliament on Wednesday.\n\n\"I know that killings of people with albinism happen especially at election time in Tanzania, when witchcraft beliefs intensify. That's why I don't take part in campaigns… I am so afraid.\"\n\nAlbinism, which affects an estimated 30,000 people in Tanzania, is a rare genetic condition that reduces melanin - the pigment that gives colour to skin, eyes and hair.\n\nSuperstition has made those with the condition targets. The false belief that body parts of people with albinism bring wealth, luck, or political success have driven attacks and killings across Tanzania.\n\nActivists say such assaults intensify in the run-up to an election as people vie for political influence.\n\nMariam knows what this danger looks and feels like personally.\n\nIn 2008, one of the bloodiest years for people with albinism in Tanzania as preparations for local elections were under way, machete-wielding men stormed into her bedroom in Kagera, a north-western border region.\n\n\"They came at a late hour of the night, cut off my right hand [from above the elbow] and took it away, and then they also cut off my left hand.\n\n\"The next day I was taken to a dispensary, unconscious, and the doctor who saw me said: 'This person is already dead, take her back home and bury her'\".\n\nAgainst the odds, Mariam survived; but she was five months pregnant and her unborn child did not.\n\nThe attack not only left her with permanent disabilities but forced her to abandon Kagera, one of the epicentres of ritualistic killings of people with albinism at the time.\n\nShe eventually resettled in the relative peace of Kilimanjaro region, where a rights group for people with albinism, Under the Same Sun, built her a house and trained her to use a knitting machine. She now makes sweaters.\n\nSeventeen years on, the trauma has not faded.\n\n\"Even now, I sometimes dream of that night,\" Mariam says. \"When I wake up, I touch my arms and remember they are not there. It is something I will never escape.\"\n\nWhat happened to Miriam was one of scores of attacks targeting people with albinism and their body parts.\n\nUnder The Same Sun says there have been 211 such incidents in Tanzania since 2008:\n\nIn 2008 alone as many as 35 people with albinism were murdered, while many other deaths probably went unreported.\n\nThose killings drew global condemnation, prompting a government crackdown. The president at the time, Jakaya Kikwete, condemned the attacks and called for tough action against the killers.\n\nAs a result, Tanzania stepped up investigations when it came to witchcraft-related  killings of people with albinism and tightened laws against discrimination.\n\nThere have also been attempts to raise public awareness about the issue.\n\nAt a traffic roundabout in the town of Sengerema  in the north-west, a monument has been built to commemorate the children, women and men with albinism who have lost their lives or were maimed in attacks.\n\nThe life-size metal statue shows a father lifting a child with albinism onto his shoulders while the mother shields it from the sun.\n\nMariam's name is carved in the monument.\n\nSo is that of Mariamu Emmanuel, who was just five when she was killed in 2008.\n\nSitting at his home in Mwanza, her brother, Manyashi Emmannuel, now 25, recalls that day. The pain still haunts him.\n\n\"I was eight years old, and saw her legs, hands and tongue removed by the attackers. Ever since then, I have been scared. It is most difficult at times when we hear of attacks close to elections.\"\n\nDespite the awareness campaigns, the attacks are still continuing.\n\nOne has been recorded this year, in the north-western town of Simuyu, in June. The victim was unharmed but has now been moved to a safe house.\n\nPresident Samia Suluhu Hassan recently warned against what she called harmful traditional beliefs, saying they had no place in Tanzania's elections.\n\nSenyi Ngaga, a district commissioner of one of the areas prone to attacks, says government education campaigns have raised understanding, but rural areas remain vulnerable to superstitions as well as discrimination.\n\nShe wants more involvement from everyone in the community to stop the attacks.\n\n\"We recently held a festival with traditional healers where we sat together and talked,\" the commissioner tells the BBC.\n\n\"As the election approaches, we also advised them to be good ambassadors to tell others to reject such acts and ensure that people with albinism are protected.\"\n\nWhile campaign groups and survivors say much more work still needs to be done by the government, some progress has been made.\n\nAwareness drives, civil society programmes, and school inclusion initiatives have helped reduce attacks in some areas.\n\nCommunities are slowly beginning to understand that people with albinism are not cursed and that superstitions can have deadly consequences.\n\nBut the murder last year of two-year-old Asimwe Novath, abducted from her home in Kagera region, was a reminder that the issue has not gone away.\n\nWitnesses said the toddler was taken by force by two unidentified men while she played with her mother.\n\nSeventeen days later, parts of Asimwe's body were found in a sack, discarded under a bridge in the same region. Her remains were later buried at her family home.\n\nNine suspects have been charged with premeditated murder in connection with the killing, but the case has not concluded.\n\nFor Mariam, the case brought up troubling memories.\n\n\"It took me back to my own night of attack back in 2008. I know that pain, and I know her mother will never forget it.\"\n\nHer experience means that fear is part of her everyday life. She avoids crowds and rarely leaves home unaccompanied.\n\nAs Wednesday's vote approaches, Mariam says she will not cast a ballot, sceptical about what difference it will make to her life.\n\nInstead, she will spend the day quietly at home in Kilimanjaro.\n\nGo to  BBCAfrica.com  for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter  @BBCAfrica , on Facebook at  BBC Africa  or on Instagram at  bbcafrica"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c17p54edxljo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"19:10:15.351+00:00","title":"Ukraine allies pledge to 'take Russian oil and gas off global market'","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ukraine's Western allies, including the UK, US, and EU, have pledged to 'take Russian oil and gas off the global market' as part of a coordinated effort to pressure President Vladimir Putin to end the war.

pledge to 'take Russian oil and gas off global market'\n\nMore than 20 nations supporting Ukraine have pledged to \"take Russian oil and gas off the global market\" as part of efforts to pressure President Vladimir Putin to end the war.\n\n\"We're choking off funding for Russia's war machine,\" said UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, after hosting a summit of the so-called \"coalition of the willing\" in London.\n\nThe UK and US have in recent days sanctioned Russia's two biggest oil companies, while the EU targeted Moscow's liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who was also in London, said \"pressure\" on Russia was the only way to stop the fighting. However, no long-range missile deliveries were announced at the summit.\n\nZelensky has long argued that US-made Tomahawks and European missiles would help make the war costs heavier for Moscow by hitting key military targets – including oil refineries and weapons depots – deep inside Russia.\n\nBut during last week's talks in Washington, US President Donald Trump indicated to Zelensky that he was not ready to supply Tomahawks.\n\nOn Thursday, Putin warned that if \"such weapons are used to strike Russian Federation territory the response will be... overwhelming\".\n\nRussia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022 and currently controls around a fifth of Ukrainian territory, including the Crimean peninsula that it annexed in 2014.\n\nSpeaking at a joint press conference after the London summit, Sir Keir said Putin was \"not serious about peace\", and therefore Ukraine's allies agreed a \"clear plan for the rest of the year\" on supporting Ukraine.\n\nThe UK prime minister said this also included targeting Russia's sovereign assets to \"unlock billions to help finance Ukraine's defence\". He gave no further details.\n\nOn Thursday, EU leaders agreed to help support Ukraine's \"financial needs\" for the next two years -  but stopped short of agreeing to use frozen Russian assets worth €140bn (£122bn).\n\nAsked about a so-called \"reparations loan\" for Ukraine funded by the Russian assets, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said she hoped a decision would be made by Christmas Eve.\n\nIn London, the \"coalition of the willing\" also pledged to strengthen Ukraine's air defences\" amid almost daily Russian air assaults on Ukrainian civilians and energy infrastructure.\n\nZelensky warned that Russia \"wants to make the winter cold a tool of torment\", adding: \"They want to break us.\"\n\nComments by the leaders in London will be disappointing for those who were hoping to hear specific examples of how Kyiv's allies were planning to prevent Russia from attacking Ukraine.\n\nNo doubt, a lot of the words said will be pleasing to the Ukrainian ear. For example, Sir Keir said the UK and Ukraine's other allies were prepared to ratchet up pressure on Moscow.\n\nBut there were no concrete examples of how exactly the allies were planning to force a change on the battlefield or force Putin to the negotiating table.\n\nIn Ukraine, several people who spoke to the BBC said they were more focused on everyday problems, rather than following Zelensky's trip to the UK.\n\nYana Kolomiets, from Odesa, said there was a lack of electricity, heating and water in the southern city.\n\n\"The more scary thing is that the Russians started launching guided bombs on our region,\" she added.\n\nTetiana Dankevych, from the capital Kyiv, said power outages and a problems with water supplies caused by Russian strikes were making life \"very difficult\".\n\n\"I don't have a feeling this war will end soon,\" she said.\n\nFurther support for Ukraine's energy infrastructure was among the issues discussed at the London summit - however, no specific announcements were made.\n\nDutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof and Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte also took part in the London meeting, while other leaders - including French President Emmanuel Macron - participated via a video link.\n\nUkraine and its Western allies have publicly agreed with Trump's proposal that the fighting should be immediately frozen along the vast front line for negotiations to begin.\n\nRussia has rejected this idea, repeating demands that Kyiv and its allies describe as de facto capitulation by Ukraine.\n\nEarlier on Friday, Zelensky held talks with King Charles at Windsor – their third meeting this year."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c891gzx7xn4o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"02:16:00.883+00:00","title":"Venezuela's Maduro says US 'fabricating war' after it deployed huge warship","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro has accused the United States of fabricating a war after the US deployed its largest warship, the USS Gerald R Ford, to the Caribbean as part of a major military buildup.

accused the US of \"fabricating a war\", after it sent the world's largest warship towards the Caribbean in a major escalation of its military build-up in the region.\n\nDefence Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier, which can carry up to 90 aircraft, to move from the Mediterranean on Friday.\n\n\"They are fabricating a new eternal war,\" Maduro told state media. \"They promised they would never again get involved in a war, and they are fabricating a war.\"\n\nThe US has been increasing its military presence in the Caribbean, sending warships, a nuclear submarine and F-35 aircraft in what it says is a campaign to target drug traffickers.\n\nIt has also carried out ten airstrikes on boats it says belong to traffickers, including one on Friday when Hegseth said \"six male narco-terrorists\" had been killed.\n\nThat operation took place in the Caribbean Sea, against a ship Hegseth said belonged to the Tren de Aragua criminal organisation.\n\nThe strikes have drawn condemnation in the region and experts have questioned their legality.\n\nThe Trump administration says it is conducting a war on drug trafficking, but it has also been accused by both experts and members of Congress of launching an intimidation campaign in an effort to destabilise Maduro's government.\n\nMaduro is a longtime foe of Trump, and the US president has accused him of being the leader of a drug-trafficking organisation which he denies.\n\n\"This is about regime change. They're probably not going to invade, the hope is this is about signalling,\" Dr Christopher Sabatini, a senior fellow for Latin America at the Chatham House think tank, told the BBC.\n\nHe argued the military build-up is intended to \"strike fear\" in the hearts of the Venezuelan military and Maduro's inner circle so that they move against him.\n\nIn its Friday announcement, the Pentagon said the USS Gerald R Ford carrier would deploy to the US Southern Command area of responsibility, which includes Central America and South America as well as the Caribbean.\n\nThe additional forces \"will enhance and augment existing capabilities to disrupt narcotics trafficking and degrade and dismantle TCOs\", or transnational criminal organisations, spokesman Sean Parnell said.\n\nThe carrier's deployment would provide the resources to start conducting strikes against targets on the ground. Trump has repeatedly raised the possibility of what he called \"land action\" in Venezuela.\n\n\"We are certainly looking at land now, because we've got the sea very well under control,\" he said earlier this week.\n\nIt comes as  CNN reports Trump is considering targeting cocaine facilities  and drug trafficking routes inside Venezuela, but is yet to make a final decision.\n\nThe aircraft carrier last publicly transmitted its location three days ago off the coast of Croatia, in the Adriatic Sea.\n\nIts deployment marks a significant escalation in the US military buildup in the region. It is also likely to increase tensions with Venezuela, whose government Washington has long accused of harbouring drug traffickers.\n\nThe carrier's large aircraft load can include jets and planes for transport and reconnaissance. Its first long-term deployment was in 2023.\n\nIt is unclear which vessels will accompany it when it moves to the region, but it can operate as part of a strike group that includes destroyers carrying missiles and other equipment.\n\nThe US  has carried out a series of strikes  on boats in recent weeks, in what President Donald Trump has described as an effort to curtail drug trafficking.\n\nThe strike announced on Friday was the tenth the Trump administration has carried out against alleged drug traffickers since early September. Most have taken place off of South America, in the Caribbean, but on 21 and 22 October it carried out strikes in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nMembers of US Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, have raised concerns about the legality of the strikes and the president's authority to order them.\n\nOn 10 September, 25 Democratic US senators wrote to the White House and alleged the administration had struck a vessel days earlier \"without evidence that the individuals on the vessel and the vessel's cargo posed a threat to the United States\".\n\nSenator Rand Paul of Kentucky, a Republican, has argued that such strikes require congressional approval.\n\nTrump said he has the legal authority to order the strikes, and has designated Tren de Aragua a terrorist organisation.\n\n\"We're allowed to do that, and if we do [it] by land, we may go back to Congress,\" Trump told White House reporters on Wednesday.\n\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio added that \"if people want to stop seeing drug boats blow up, stop sending drugs to the United States\".\n\nThe six deaths in the operation Hegseth announced on Friday brings the total people killed in the US strikes to at least 43.\n\nBrian Finucane, a former US State Department lawyer, told the BBC the situation amounted to a constitutional crisis that the US Congress, controlled by Republicans, has not appeared willing to challenge Trump on.\n\n\"The US is experiencing an Article 1 crisis,\" said Mr Finucane, who now works at the International Crisis Group. \"It is the US Congress that has principal control over the use of military force. That control has been usurped in this instance by the White House, and so it's up to Congress to push back.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdx4g5ndnkyo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"23:56:54.397+00:00","title":"Printing photos: How to keep your memories safe","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the growing concern over the fragility of digital photo storage, using real-life cases such as Stephen Buffardi losing photos during a phone transfer and the 2019 MySpace data loss.

He and his wife Weena, 32, now have a six-year-old daughter, Sophia.\n\n\"When you have a kid you're like, it would have been nice to have those photos now - to save them for her.\"\n\nSophia will never be able to see the pictures of her parents when they first met.\n\nFor Stephen, this was a moment of realisation that digital photos don't always stand the test of time. So he decided to start making physical albums for her.\n\nHe's documented her life as a newborn - featuring her hospital tag and ink prints of her tiny feet - as well as one for each year of her childhood so far.\n\nAnd he's currently putting together an album which will show her life as a five-year-old. Earlier this week he ordered 300 photographs to be printed.\n\nThis is nothing new - people have been compiling photo albums and scrapbooks for more than 100 years. It took off after World War Two when film photography became much more affordable.\n\nBut what should you think about if you want to keep your photos safe?\n\nExperts broadly agree you should keep three versions of your most treasured pictures: the original on your phone, one copy online and one on a hard drive.\n\nSome suggest going one step further - printing them out.\n\nIn a digital world, preserving information is everyone's problem.\n\nLast week the UK government told businesses they  should have contingency plans on paper in case of cyber-attacks . And just days ago, a problem with Amazon Web Services  disrupted more than 1,000 businesses globally .\n\nChristopher Barnatt, a former computing and future studies lecturer and YouTuber, says this is why we should think about making physical copies of all important documents - for example birth certificates, insurance papers and passports.\n\nPhotos are arguably no different. And there are plenty of tools we can use to protect them.\n\nOne obvious step is to back them up onto an online cloud service like Apple's iCloud or Google Photos. Smartphones often do this automatically.\n\nBut there are issues like space and cost.\n\niCloud has a limit of 5GB - which covers photos as well as iPhone backups and other app data. After that, it charges UK users £0.99 per month for up to 50GB of space. Google Photos offers 15GB - shared with the user's Gmail and Google Drive content - before charging.\n\nWhile these services are very stable, they are not totally risk-free.\n\nEarlier this year, a woman in North Carolina told the WBTV news outlet that her iCloud account was hacked and her password was changed. She lost access to her photos and videos and said Apple  told her there was nothing they could do about it .\n\nYou don't have to be hacked though. If you're really unlucky you might forget your password and be unable to restore it - meaning you can't log back into your cloud service.\n\nIt's probably safer to keep your photos on a cloud service than on social media.\n\n\"A lot of people use social media almost like a diary. Social media platforms are set up to sort of serialise people's lives and [create] narratives,\" says Dr Esperanza Miyake of the University of Strathclyde, who researches how social media companies treat people's data.\n\nIn 2019, a server migration by MySpace - which was once the most popular social media platform in the world - resulted in the  loss of 12 years' worth of music uploads .\n\nThey were \"all gone\", says Dr Miyake.\n\nSome were songs people had written and recorded at home so their friends could listen to them. The company apologised for the data loss.\n\nThere can be a cost issue, too. Earlier this month  Snapchat announced it would start charging people for storing photos and videos on their messaging app , much to the annoyance of some users.\n\nIt said 5GB of storage would remain free but after that users would be charged $1.99 (£1.48) per month for up to 100GB of space.\n\nProf Winters suggests there will always be a problem with treating commercial platforms as archives. \"They don't have an archival function. They're commercial entities.\n\n\"The assumption that we will always be able to keep uploading every single photo we take and have it preserved in perpetuity by a commercial entity is one that's going to be tested at various points.\"\n\nThis is why downloading your photos and keeping them on an external device like a hard drive or memory card is a good idea.\n\nYou shouldn't have to worry about images becoming unreadable for a very long time - thanks to \"robust\" image file formats like jpeg, according to Prof Winters.\n\nMany hard drives work for up to 10 years - with some lasting for 20 - so it's important to move your pictures to new hard drives as the decades pass.\n\nIf you've got your three copies of your photos, you're in a good place. But what about printing them out?\n\nDespite the risks of fire, water damage, or simply being misplaced, it's still a genuinely durable way of passing down memories through the generations.\n\nDr Barnatt and Dr Miyake say people who grew up with social media and mobile phones should keep offline copies of their most beloved items.\n\n\"It's about valuing what's important to you before it's too late,\" says Prof Winters.\n\nIf you start thinking about printing out your digital archive too late in life, \"you may have lost the things you value already\".\n\nSouth African Thendo Muloiwa has decided to do just that, at the age of 28.\n\nHe loves the photo albums his parents made for him when he was a young child and wants to do the same with the digital pictures he has snapped using his phone. They show the places he has been and the friends he has made during his 20s.\n\nSome archivists and futurists see this return to print as a way to counter a \"digital dark age\" - the idea that photos, videos and text might become unreadable as technology changes.\n\nBut Prof Winters thinks those claims are overblown, pointing to major international efforts to preserve more and more digital and online internet.\n\nFor many people, printing photos is more than just about documenting history.\n\nThendo says there is a particular joy people share when looking through a photo album together and chatting.\n\n\"You can't really do that on your phone,\" he tells me. \"I mean, sure, you can open up your iCloud or whatever and scroll through all your photos, but you're going to find a lot of random pictures.\n\n\"As opposed to a photo album where you would have the perfect picture that you have picked and put in there - that's the difference.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c620z3gkrnvo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"23:10:53.930+00:00","title":"Britney Spears said she was used.

2025-10-24T23:10:53.930+00:00\n\nTitle: Britney Spears said she was used. Kevin Federline says she needs help\n\nBritney Spears stared at herself in a mirror, grinning as she grabbed an electric clipper.\n\nChunks of her long, iconic locks fell to the floor of the Southern California salon. Paparazzi cameras outside documented every second of the now-infamous night in 2007, later following her with her new buzzcut to get a tattoo.\n\nThe star said she did it because she felt cornered and humiliated by the paparazzi, who had chased her from the house of her estranged husband, Kevin Federline.\n\nIn the midst of an acrimonious and widely publicised custody battle for their two young boys, the Princess of Pop said she acted out in defiance and wanted to give the press \"some material\". She called it an impulsive decision - one that to her, served as a public rebuke to a world she felt held her to untenable standards.\n\nTo her, it was a \"desperate move by a desperate person\".\n\nBut to her estranged husband, it was a wake-up call to \"just how far things had spiralled out of control\".\n\nDecades later, those moments and the others that went on to define the pop star and her very public unravelling are back in the limelight - but what exactly happened and why depends on who is doing the retelling.\n\nAfter Spears shared her outlook in her 2023 memoir, The Woman In Me, Federline is now speaking out and sharing his take on their years together in a book released this week, titled You Thought You Knew.\n\nLike Spears, Federline's book details their intimate and chaotic relationship, the mental anguish they both suffered and provides an inside glimpse at the conservatorship battle that dictated much of Spears' life and career. It provides a side-by-side look, a he-said, she-said dissection of their lives.\n\nThe Grammy Award winner, 43, has already denounced her ex's memoir, writing on social media that Federline's revelations have been \"extremely hurtful and exhausting\".\n\nBut the dancer-turned-reality TV star says he's releasing You Thought You Knew after years of hesitation because he does not want his children growing up \"feeling like they have to explain who their father is\".\n\nFederline responds to the stories and accusations that Spears tells in her 2023 tome, in which she describes being financially and emotionally controlled by those closest to her. He contradicts her account at times, levying fresh accusations.\n\nDespite both memoirs offering vastly different accounts at times, both have a similar aim in reframing the public narrative thrust upon them by illuminating the episodes that led to Spears' conservatorship battle, as well as the nationwide movement that freed the pop star in 2021.\n\nIn her book, Spears condemned the court-ordered conservatorship, also known as a guardianship, which she was under from 2008-2021. During that time, her father, Jamie Spears, was in control of her finances, career and many aspects of her personal life.\n\nShe says that if she was just left to live her life, she would have worked it out.\n\n\"Thirteen years went by with me feeling like a shadow of myself. I think back now on my father and his associates having control over my body and my money for that long and it makes me feel sick,\" she wrote.\n\nBut, she added, she resolved to go along with the protracted arrangement \"for the sake of my sons,\" even though \"being in it was really hard\".\n\nAfter the conservatorship ended, her father Jamie Spears said it had been \"necessary\" to protect her, but it was time for her to have control back.\n\nIn his recounting, Federline has a different take.   Even when the marriage tanked, it wasn't easy for him to \"watch her spiral\", he writes.\n\nFederline supported the arrangement, arguing that it provided \"some semblance of normalcy\" for their two boys together. After her psychiatric hold, Federline says he immediately filed for sole custody, but that set into motion a slew of issues that exacerbated Spears' relationship with their children.\n\nHis ex, he writes \"saw the events in her life through a prism that painted her as the victim, the misunderstood one, the person wronged by everyone around her.\n\n\"But from where I stood, she needed help. Whether that was rehab or therapy, I couldn't say for sure,\" he writes, noting that she was in no state to manage her own affairs and needed some form of oversight or \"protective layer\".\n\nHe adds that he came to find out that there was a lot he didn't know about the conservatorship, and he did not push for answers because part of him \"doesn't want to know\".\n\nSpears has credited the viral Free Britney movement with helping her find the courage to challenge and eventually escape her conservatorship.\n\n\"The fact that my friends and my fans sensed what was happening and did all that for me, that's a debt I can never repay,\" she wrote, thanking them for standing up for her when she couldn't stand up for herself.\n\nBut Federline says the movement \"got it wrong\" and those who are part of it now need to put the same effort into a \"Save Britney movement\". He shares ominous concerns about how the pop star is currently \"racing toward something irreversible\" and \"getting close to the 11th hour\".\n\nThe pressure from the Free Britney movement, he alleges, led the judge on her conservatorship case \"to ignore the professional reports and cave to public opinion\".\n\n\"But none of that truly mattered in the end. If Britney believed she was being held against her will, and everything else she's shared since, then that trauma is real for her. And you can't ignore that,\" he says.\n\nSpears has continued to make headlines with strange and sometimes concerning posts on Instagram. Their boys are grown up but, according to Federline, they have haven't seen their mother much, and they don't really want to. Federline has four additional children, along with the two with Spears.\n\nFederline says he has lost faith that things will ever fully turn around for his ex-wife.\n\n\"I still hope that Britney can find peace. Whatever her future holds, I hope it's one where she can finally take control of her own life, on her own terms. This whole saga, twenty years of it, was built on denial. Britney never reached the first step of recovery: admitting there was a problem.\"\n\nSpears has laid blame on many people who were once close to her, including two of her exes, Federline and former NSYNC frontman Justin Timberlake.\n\nShe accuses both of ruining her ability to \"trust people again\".\n\nIn his own memoir, Federline says he was making a career for himself as a professional dancer who worked with Michael Jackson and NSYNC when he crossed paths with Spears.\n\nThe couple had met before, when Federline was dancing on a tour for Spears' opening act.\n\nFederline, for his part, is self-aware, writing that he knows people viewed the Fresno, California, native as \"this dude jumped out of his trailer and into Britney's mansion\".\n\nBut even the day before their wedding, there was a shadow over the relationship, he says.\n\nFederline contends in his book that when he and Spears got together in their early 20s, she had never really moved on from her ex-boyfriend Timberlake, detailing that they had a lot of \"unfinished business\" and that \"it lingered, like a ghost in the background of our relationship\".\n\nIn her memoir, Spears recounted the pitfalls of her relationship with Timberlake, including him asking her to have an abortion and the public embarrassment that befell her after he accused her of cheating - further heightened when he cast a Spears lookalike in his music video for Cry Me a River.\n\nTheir relationship, which lasted from 1999 to 2002, has also been dissected over the years and has come with a public apology from Timberlake, after several documentaries about Spears recast her as a victim in her conservatorship.\n\nFederline says that \"there was always something there with Justin that she couldn't let go of\". He says Spears even called Timberlake the night before their wedding to get closure.\n\n\"Now, looking back... I realise it was deeper than that. She never really got over him,\" he writes.\n\nFederline's memoir has raised the ire of Spears, and her vocal army of online supporters.\n\nJames Miller, an activist and Free Britney proponent, says the book will not help the singer.\n\n\"Britney does struggle with mental health problems, that's pretty obvious,\" he told the BBC. \"Exploiting her right now really isn't the best time. I don't think there's any alarm to sound.\"\n\nFrom breaking out on The Mickey Mouse Club as a child star to dancing with a snake around her shoulders at the MTV Music Video Awards, Spears has lived her whole adult life in the spotlight.\n\nS Mark Young, a professor at the University of Southern California and author of The Mirror Effect: How Celebrity Narcissism is Seducing America, says Federline's book is unlikely to change people's minds about her.\n\n\"I think after this coming week, the book will die. Most people who follow Britney will not be moved,\" he says.\n\nSome have wondered why Federline, 47, has chosen to speak out now.\n\n\"No one heals when a book like this is written,\" Mr Young says.\n\nMr Miller, and many online, have noted that now that their sons are both over 18, Federline would no longer be receiving a $40,000-per-month payment from the singer to support them.\n\nFederline denies having an ulterior motive beyond wanting to finally share his side of this infamous saga.\n\nIn the memoir, Federline says the book was his best chance at sharing his side of the story.\n\nFor decades, the media, Spears and her family have mostly told Federline's story, largely leaning into his \"bad boy\" persona and making him the butt of many late-night jokes.\n\n\"This is about finally telling my story,\" he writes in his book. \"My version. In my words. Because everybody else has done it for me. The media. The blogs. The exes. The strangers. The jokes. The headlines. They all had something to say about me. And I stayed quiet.\"\n\nHe denies that he ever \"was just coasting off her money\" and insists he has always been \"out there hustling, grinding, investing - working to build a solid foundation for myself and my kids\".\n\nThis opportunity was a way for him to finally share his side after decades of stories, gossip, rumours and accusations - which he says he avoided responding to in hopes of giving his family and children \"some kind of normal life\".\n\n\"But silence didn't bring peace,\" he writes. \"It left me choking on the words I never said.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz0xd4dvzlyo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"22:05:47.192+00:00","title":"Suspected Chinese drug kingpin captured after audacious escape","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Zhi Dong Zhang, a Chinese national known by aliases such as Brother Wang, Pancho, and HeHe, has been captured after an audacious escape from house arrest in Mexico City in October 2024.

They say he has laundered millions of dollars in drug money for both the Sinaloa Cartel and the New Generation Jalisco Cartel (CJNG) as part of a worldwide drug distribution network.\n\n\"Brother Wang can be seen as a key link between Mexican cartels and Chinese chemical companies in sourcing the pre-cursor chemicals for fentanyl\", explains former DEA agent, Mike Vigil, adding that he was also vital in converting drug funds into cryptocurrency.\n\nIf convicted, Zhi Dong Zhang can expect to share a similar fate as other drug kingpins like Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman and Ismael 'El Mayo' Zambada in a high-security facility in the United States.\n\nBut how 'Brother Wang' ended up in custody in Havana is an extraordinary tale involving fleeing house arrest in Mexico City, reportedly through a hole in a wall, taking a private jet to Cuba and an ultimately failed attempt to enter Russia.\n\nZhi Dong Zhang was arrested in Mexico City in a joint security operation in October 2024. He was initially held in a maximum-security prison but was later granted house arrest by a judge – a decision that President Claudia Sheinbaum called \"outrageous\".\n\nZhang's escape had all the hallmarks of another embarrassing episode for Mexico: a man considered a vital cog in the machinery of drug smuggling, able to disappear from under the noses of the Mexican authorities tasked with guarding him. El Chapo Guzman managed that feat twice, much to Washington's frustration, before he was finally put on a plane in handcuffs to the US.\n\nThat Mexican authorities were able to recover their prisoner and send him north came down to two things – an apparent stroke of luck in Russia and the strength of Mexico's security relationship with Havana.\n\nWhen Zhang reached Cuba in July 2025, he set about making his next steps towards reaching a country with no extradition treaty with the US, officials say.\n\nThere is a direct commercial flight to Moscow from Havana and Zhang, they allege, was able to secure a seat on it using fake papers. However, the papers didn't get him past the immigration authorities in Russia. It has been reported that the Russians didn't fully appreciate who they had in their custody and, after he was briefly detained, they turned Zhang around and sent him back to Cuba.\n\nOn arriving back in Havana a second time, the Cuban security services were now aware of his real identity.\n\nSecurity analysts believe the authorities in Cuba held onto him for several months to interrogate him at length before sending him back to Mexico and, inevitably, onwards to the US. Mexico's Public Security Secretary, Omar Harfuch, was quick to thank Cuba for their cooperation over 'Brother Wang' – ultimately, for sparing their blushes over another escaped high-profile prisoner.\n\nAs always following the arrest of an alleged kingpin, the question becomes how far their removal will affect the global drug trade.\n\nGiven Brother Wang has spent the past year either in prison, under house arrest or on the run, the question may be moot, Mr Vigil said, as his absence has already largely been felt in Mexico's criminal underworld:\n\n\"It's really not going to have an impact as the cartels already have individuals working for them who can start to replace to Brother Wang,\" said Mr Vigil. \"Even in the case of El Chapo Guzman who was a much bigger figure, it had no impact on the global drug trade\", he argues.\n\nOver his first year in office, US President Donald Trump has pressured his Mexican counterpart to do more on the issue of fentanyl trafficking and President Sheinbaum's administration has duly responded in kind.\n\nShe has significantly increased seizures of the drug compared to her predecessor and her administration has sent dozens of convicted drug cartel members to the US to serve sentences there. They included several high-level drug names like Rafael Caro Quintero, wanted for the murder of a DEA agent in 1985.\n\nHer co-operation on the fentanyl issue, as well as on undocumented immigration, is considered the reason Mr Trump has refrained from imposing the same level of trade tariffs on Mexico as he has on other commercial partners.\n\nBrother Wang's extradition will bring genuine satisfaction in Washington at having taken a key figure in Mexican cartels' financial operations out of circulation. That, in turn, will please the Sheinbaum administration in Mexico and strengthen their claim to be in lockstep with their US counterparts on security.\n\nHowever, slowing or reducing the movement of pre-cursor chemicals for fentanyl from China to the Americas in any lasting way will take more than the extradition of one man."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2n7dq24glo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"16:30:44.546+00:00","title":"Cameroon election results: Issa Tchiroma Bakary says he won't accept a stolen vote","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the aftermath of Cameroon’s 12 October 2025 presidential election, opposition leader Issa Tchiroma Bakary has declared himself the winner, asserting that the results are legitimate and not stolen, based on data from individual polling stations.

says he won't accept a stolen vote\n\nCameroon's opposition leader Issa Tchiroma Bakary, who has declared himself the winner of the 12 October elections, has told the BBC that he will not accept a stolen vote, with the results due to be announced on Monday.\n\nHe says his team has compiled the overall picture based on results from individual polling stations, so there is no doubt.\n\nTchiroma Bakary, 76, is a former government minister who broke ranks with President Paul Biya, 92, who is seeking another term after 43 years in power.\n\nThe ruling party has dismissed Tchiroma Bakary's victory claims and several officials have described it as illegal because only the Constitutional Council can proclaim official results.\n\nIn an interview at his home, in the northern city of Garoua, Tchiroma Bakary said he had urged his supporters to defend their votes.\n\n\"We will never accept their votes being stolen by anyone,\" he said, dressed in a long, flowing white and gold tunic.\n\nThe former minister said he was not concerned about being arrested or put in jail, \"but I know that I have already won the presidential election\".\n\n\"There is no doubt, no shadow of doubt whatsoever. My victory is undeniable,\" he said, appearing placid and resolute throughout the conversation.\n\nTchiroma Bakary   said the ruling CPDM party had \"their backs against the wall\" and could not accept the reality of the vote, and challenged them to show if what he was saying about the election was wrong.\n\nHe defended his decision to declare himself himself the winner, insisting that the law \"does not prevent us from so doing\".\n\nTchiroma Bakary has previously said he won the election with about 55% of the vote, based on returns representing 80% of the electorate.\n\nAsked whether he would accept defeat if someone else is declared the winner, he said he would agree \"provided the Constitutional Council announces the results that comes from the ballot box, not ballot stuffing\".\n\nTensions over the delayed announcement of the election results have been growing, sparking fears of post-electoral violence in a country already rocked by a separatist conflict in the Anglophone regions and Boko Haram insurgency in the Far North region.\n\nIn Garoua, a general feeling of uncertainty lingers following protests earlier this week. Security forces patrol the streets during the night, although their presence in the day time has decreased.\n\nThe highly respected and influential Catholic Church in Cameroon this week urged calm following fears that violence could erupt once official results are declared.\n\nCatholic bishops said they hoped the official result would reflect the will of the electorate, and \"nothing will be changed by any authority involved in this exercise\".\n\nBorn in Garoua, Tchiroma Bakary trained as an engineer in France before returning to Cameroon to work for the national railway company.\n\nIn 1984, he was thrown in jail, accused of being involved in an attempt to depose President Biya. Despite denying the allegation and never being convicted, Tchiroma Bakary spent six years in prison. There, he farmed the land with his fellow inmates and taught himself how to speak English.\n\nOn his release from prison, Tchiroma Bakary began his political career. He became an MP for the opposition UNDP in 1992, but entered an alliance of sorts with Biya and served as his minister of transport for four years.\n\nTchiroma Bakary also served as communications minister from 2009 to 2019.\n\nAs communications minister and the government's spokesperson, he resolutely defended Biya's government during crises such as the Boko Haram insurgency, when the army was accused of killing civilians.\n\nBut in June, just four months before the general elections, Tchiroma Bakary changed course dramatically, resigning from the government and announcing he would run against Biya for the presidency.\n\nHe accused the president of becoming increasingly out of touch, saying \"a country cannot exist in the service of one man\".\n\nDespite his recent role as the government's mouthpiece, Tchiroma Bakary drew huge crowds at his rallies, electrifying voters desperate for change.\n\nAfter four decades of Biya's rule, economic development has stagnated and challenges such as inflation, unemployment and insecurity abound.\n\nAdditionally, residents in the English-speaking western region of Cameroon have long complained of marginalisation, and so many there automatically backed Tchiroma Bakary against Biya, seen as representing the French-speaking majority.\n\nAt one rally in the economic capital of Douala, thousands of supporters waited for hours in the rain to hear Tchiroma Bakary speak. He knows how to command a crowd - a stark contrast to Biya, who spent most of the campaign period in Europe and only showed up for one rally.\n\nSome are not so taken with the former spokesperson, however. In his home city of Garoua, a couple of residents told the BBC that Tchiroma Bakary was not their ideal candidate, but at least he offered a change from Biya's lengthy rule.\n\n\"We can't continue with the level of underdevelopment that is crippling Cameroon,\" said farmer Benjamin Temunga.\n\nTchiroma Bakary has also sought to distance himself from the government, apologising for his role as its spokesperson.\n\nFor instance, he defended the military despite knowing they were committing atrocities in amid the Anglophone crisis - a conflict that has seen separatist fighters battling the authorities for more than six years.\n\n\"I 100% agree that the military committed atrocities,\" he said. \"But as Minister of Communication, my duty was to defend our armed forces. Today, I speak as a free man.\"\n\nCalm and plain-speaking, Tchiroma Bakary is resolute in his stance that the people have put their trust in him. He is the rightful president, he tells the BBC.\n\n\"The nation knows it, the world knows it.\"\n\nAdditional reporting by Basillioh Rukanga\n\nGo to  BBCAfrica.com  for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter  @BBCAfrica , on Facebook at  BBC Africa  or on Instagram at  bbcafrica"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gp2lxz75eo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"19:59:04.708+00:00","title":"Drug crackdown or regime change - what is Trump's goal in Venezuela?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The US has launched a major military and intelligence build-up in the Caribbean, including deploying B-52 bombers, F-35 fighter jets, drones, and the world’s largest aircraft carrier, in what experts and analysts believe is not a genuine war on drugs but a strategic campaign to intimidate and potentially remove President Nicolás Maduro from power.

Venezuela?\n\nFor two months, the US military has been building up a force of warships, fighter jets, bombers, marines, drones and spy planes in the Caribbean Sea. It is the largest deployment there for decades.\n\nLong-range bomber planes, B-52s, have carried out \"bomber attack demonstrations\" off the coast of Venezuela. Trump has authorised the deployment of the CIA to Venezuela and the world's largest aircraft carrier is being sent to the region.\n\nThe US says it has killed dozens of people in strikes on small vessels from Venezuela which it alleges carry \"narcotics\" and \"narco-terrorists\", without providing evidence or details about those on board.\n\nThe strikes have drawn condemnation in the region and experts have questioned their legality. They are being sold by the US as a war on drug trafficking but all the signs suggest this is really an intimidation campaign that seeks to remove Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro from power.\n\n\"This is about regime change. They're probably not going to invade, the hope is this is about signalling,\" says Dr Christopher Sabatini, a senior fellow for Latin America at the Chatham House think tank.\n\nHe argues the military build-up is a show of strength intended to \"strike fear\" in the hearts of the Venezuelan military and Maduro's inner circle so that they move against him.\n\nBBC Verify has been monitoring publicly available tracking information from US ships and planes in the region - along with satellite imagery and images on social media - to try to build a picture of where Trump's forces are located.\n\nThe deployment has been changing, so we have been monitoring the region regularly for updates.\n\nAs of 23 October, we identified 10 US military ships in the region, including guided missile destroyers, amphibious assault ships and oil tankers for refuelling vessels at sea.\n\nIt is no secret that the US administration, particularly Secretary of State Marco Rubio, would like to see Maduro toppled.\n\nEarlier this year, he told Fox News Maduro was a \"horrible dictator\" and when asked whether he was demanding that Maduro leave, added: \"We're going to work on that policy.\"\n\nBut, even for overt critics of Maduro like Rubio, it is difficult to explicitly call for military-backed regime change - something members of Venezuela's opposition have longed called for.\n\nDonald Trump campaigned against regime change in 2016, pledging to \"stop racing to topple foreign regimes\", and more recently has condemned engaging in \"forever wars.\"\n\nThe US does not recognise Maduro as the president of Venezuela, after the last election in 2024 was widely dismissed internationally, and by the opposition in Venezuela, as neither free nor fair. The US embassy in Caracas was closed during Trump's first presidency in 2019.\n\nThe US has upped its bounty for information leading to Maduro's arrest to $50m, an incentive for those within his loyal, inner circle to hand him in. But it has yielded no defections.\n\nVenezuelan law professor and senior associate at the CSIS national security think tank, Jose Ignacio Hernández, says $50m is \"nothing\" for Venezuela's elites.\n\nThere is a lot of money to be made through corruption within an oil-rich state like Venezuela. The former head of Treasury Alejandro Andrade, made $1bn in bribes before he was convicted.\n\nMany analysts agree the Venezuelan military would be key to any regime change, but for them to turn on Maduro and oust him, they would also likely want promises of immunity from prosecution.\n\nMr Hernández adds: \"They will think, in some way or another I am involved in criminal activities too.\"\n\nMichael Albertus, a political science professor at the University of Chicago who publishes extensively on Latin America, is not convinced that even a bounty of $500m would persuade Maduro's inner circle to turn him in.\n\n\"Authoritarian leaders are always suspicious of even their inner circle, and because of that, they create mechanisms for monitoring them and ensuring loyalty,\" he said.\n\nEconomic sanctions on Venezuela have exacerbated the already severe economic crisis, but have not succeeded in persuading senior figures to turn against their president.\n\nDonald Trump has declared this is a war on narcotics traffickers and said one vessel the US struck, on 16 October, was \"loaded up with mostly fentanyl.\"\n\nBut fentanyl is primarily produced in Mexico - not South America - and comes into the US over the southern border.\n\n\"It isn't about drugs,\" says Dr Sabatini. \"But he's co-opted the Venezuelan opposition's language of how this is not just a dictatorship - it's a criminal regime.\"\n\nSince 2020, the US Justice Department has accused President Maduro of leading a drug trafficking and narco-terrorism organisation, which he denies. Trump has said he has authorised the CIA to carry out covert operations in Venezuela in part because of \"drugs coming in\" from Venezuela.\n\nVenezuela does not produce large quantities of cocaine - that's mainly Colombia, Peru and Bolivia. There is some cocaine trafficked through Venezuela, which its own government claims it is cracking down on.\n\nA US Drug Enforcement Administration report from 2025 says 84% of the cocaine seized in the US comes from Colombia and mentioned other countries but not Venezuela in its cocaine section.\n\nThe first seven strikes were carried out in the Caribbean, which is not a major sea route for drug-trafficking compared with the Pacific Ocean, where the subsequent strikes were carried out.\n\nThe US has not detailed its evidence of Maduro leading a drug trafficking organisation. Maduro has repeatedly denied the accusations, and for his part accuses the US of imperialism and worsening the country's economic crisis through sanctions.\n\nThere are known cases of those close to him being indicted.\n\nIn 2016, a New York federal court convicted the two nephews of his wife for conspiring to import cocaine to the US. The case said they planned to use some of the money to fund his wife's political campaign. They were later freed in a prisoner exchange agreement with the US.\n\nThe Pentagon has ordered the deployment of a carrier strike group to the region.\n\nIt includes the USS Gerald R Ford, the world's largest aircraft carrier.\n\nAs well as the US ships we tracked around Puerto Rico - where the US has a military base - satellite imagery also showed two vessels about 75 miles (123km) east of Trinidad and Tobago.\n\nOne was a guided missile cruiser, the USS Lake Erie.\n\nThe other appeared to be the MV Ocean Trader according to Bradley Martin, a former US Navy captain, now a senior policy researcher at RAND Corp.\n\nThis is a converted cargo ship designed to support special forces missions while blending in with commercial traffic. It can house drones, helicopters, and small boats.\n\nThere are a wide variety of missions it could conceivably support, including reconnaissance to prepare for strikes. But Mr Martin stresses that its presence \"doesn't necessarily mean that those kinds of activities are being carried out or are planned\".\n\nMilitary analysts have pointed out that intercepting drugs at sea does not require a force as big as the current US one.\n\nThe US has also bolstered its air presence in the region - BBC Verify has identified a number of US military aircraft across Puerto Rico.\n\nStu Ray, a senior analyst at McKenzie Intelligence Services, says a satellite image taken on 17 October shows F-35 fighter jets on the tarmac, possibly F-35Bs.\n\nThese are highly advanced stealth jets prized for their short take-off and vertical landing capability.\n\nOn social media, a private jet pilot shared a video of a MQ-9 Reaper drone, filmed at Rafael Hernández Airport on Puerto Rico.\n\nThese have been used by the US to carry out attacks and surveillance in Afghanistan, Syria, Libya and Mali.\n\nEarlier in October, BBC Verify tracked three B-52 bombers which flew across the Caribbean and close to Venezuela's coast.\n\nThe US air force later confirmed that the planes had taken part in a \"bomber attack demonstration\".\n\nFlights of B1 bombers and P-8 Poseidon spy planes have also been visible on plane tracking platforms.\n\nImages on social media have also shown military helicopters operating off the coast of Trinidad and Tobago.\n\nSome of these are Boeing MH-6M Little Birds - nicknamed \"Killer Eggs\" - used by US special forces.\n\nWhen asked if the CIA had been given the authority to take out Maduro, Donald Trump dodged the question and said it would be \"ridiculous\" to answer.\n\nHe has also said that the US is \"looking at land now\", referring to possible military operations on Venezuelan soil.\n\nThe CIA is viewed with a lot of suspicion by many in Latin America because of a long history of covert interventions, attempts at regime-change, and support for past right-wing military dictatorships, notably in Chile and Brazil.\n\nNed Price, deputy to the US representative to the United Nations and formerly a CIA senior analyst and State Department senior adviser, said CIA covert action can take \"many forms.\"\n\n\"It can be information operations. It can be sabotage operations. It can be funding opposition parties. It can go as far as the overthrow of a regime. There are a lot of options between the low-end and high-end option.\"\n\nThis could include agents being used to target trafficking suspects inside Venezuela. By the US's own definition, this could include Maduro himself.\n\nDr Sabatini says given Venezuela isn't a major production point for drugs, there are no cocaine or fentanyl labs to \"take out\" but there are airstrips or ports which the US could target.\n\n\"If he wants to be aggressive, he could send a missile to a military barrack. There is pretty good intelligence certain sectors of the military are involved in cocaine trafficking.\"\n\nOr it could be a \"smash and grab situation\", he notes, where they attempt to seize Maduro or some of his lieutenants and bring them to justice in the US.\n\nThe big question, he argues, is how long Trump is willing to keep so many US assets parked in the Caribbean.\n\nIf the prime purpose of this military build-up is to threaten Maduro, it is unclear whether it is enough to prompt defections.\n\nWhether that goes as far as an actual attempt to dislodge the Maduro regime through force, ponders Professor Albertus, it is hard to know."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr7m2pd3810o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"02:16:06.580+00:00","title":"US beef prices are soaring.

soaring. Will Trump's plans lower them?\n\nBeef prices have gotten so high in the US that it has become a political problem.\n\nEven Donald Trump, who long ago declared inflation \"dead\", is talking about it, as the issue threatens to undercut his promises to bring down grocery prices for Americans.\n\nThis week, he took to social media, urging ranchers to lower prices for their cattle.\n\nBut his demand - and other proposals his administration has floated to address the issue - has sparked a backlash among ranchers, who worry some of his solutions will make it harder for them to make a living, while making little dent at the grocery store.\n\nThe number of beef cattle farmers and ranchers in the US has dwindled steadily since 1980, reducing domestic supplies and driving up prices, as demand remains high.\n\nThe country's cattle inventory has fallen to its lowest level in nearly 75 years, while the US has lost more than 150,000 cattle ranches just since 2017 - a 17% drop, according to the Agriculture Department.\n\nRanchers say they are under pressure from four decades of consolidation among the meat processors that buy their livestock, while high costs for key inputs like fertiliser and equipment have intensified the strain.\n\nThe contraction in the industry has worsened, as several years of drought have forced ranchers to slash their herds.\n\nChristian Lovell, a cattle rancher in Illinois, said parts of his farm that were lush and grassy when he was a child have now dried up, limiting where his cows can graze.\n\n\"You put all these together and you have a recipe for a really broken market,\" said Mr Lovell, who works with advocacy group Farm Action.\n\nRetail prices for ground beef rose 12.9% over the 12 months to September, and beef steaks were up 16.6%, according to US inflation data published Friday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nA pound of ground chuck now costs an average of $6.33 (£4.75), compared with $5.58 a year ago.\n\nThe increases have significantly outpaced general food inflation, which stood at 3.1%.\n\n\"The cattle herd has been getting smaller for the last several years, yet people are still wanting that American beef - hence the high prices,\" said Brenda Boetel, a professor of agricultural economics at the University of Wisconsin, River Falls.\n\nDerrell Peel, a professor of agricultural economics at Oklahoma State University said he expected prices to remain elevated until at least the end of the decade, noting that it takes years to replenish herds.\n\nThe Trump administration's \"hands are tied\" when it comes to interventions that will help lower prices, Mr Peel added.\n\nThe Agriculture Department this week unveiled what it called a \"big package\" aimed at ramping up domestic beef production, by opening more land for cattle grazing and supporting small meat processors.\n\nThat proposal came after Trump drew the ire of ranchers when he proposed to import more beef from Argentina, potentially quadrupling the purchases.\n\nEight House Republicans responded with a letter to the White House expressing concern about Trump's import plans.\n\nEven the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, which has voiced support for Trump's policies in the past, said the import plan \"only creates chaos at a critical time of the year for American cattle producers, while doing nothing to lower grocery store prices\".\n\nTrump responded by assuring farmers that he was helping them in other ways, noting tariffs that are limiting imports from Brazil.\n\n\"It would be nice if they would understand that, but they also have to get their prices down, because the consumer is a very big factor in my thinking, also,\" Trump wrote.\n\nBut that has failed to quell the furore.\n\nJustin Tupper, president of the US Cattlemen's Association, said he thought that only the big four meat packers would benefit from Trump's import plan.\n\n\"I don't see that lowering prices here at all,\" Mr Tupper said.\n\nSome say the government could make an impact if it focused on the way a handful of companies dominate the market for meat processing.\n\nToday, just four companies control more than 80% of the beef slaughtering and packing market.\n\n\"These are consolidated markets gouging ranchers and gouging consumers at the store,\" said Austin Frerick, an agricultural and antitrust policy expert and a fellow at Yale University.\n\nThe meat processing firms - Tyson, JBS, Cargill and National Beef - have faced several lawsuits, including one filed by McDonald's alleging they colluded to inflate the price of beef.\n\nThough Trump revoked a Biden-era order earlier this year that directed agencies to tackle corporate consolidation across the food system, his administration has taken other steps to investigate competition issues in the agricultural industry.\n\nMike Callicrate runs a cattle ranch in St Francis, Kansas. He said the only way he has managed to stay in the industry was by cutting out the middleman and setting up his own stores to reach consumers directly.\n\nBut Mr Callicrate acknowledged that most ranchers do not have the money to make that shift. Many have left the industry - and see no incentive to jump back in.\n\n\"We're not going to rebuild this cow herd - not until we address market concentration,\" Mr Callicrate said.\n\nHe said he supported the Agriculture Department's plans to open up more cattle grazing land to boost production and bring down retail prices.\n\n\"But unless we have a market,\" he added, you're a \"fool to get into the cattle business\"\n\nBill Bullard found himself in the first wave of ranchers pushed out as the meat processing industry started to consolidate in the early 1980s.\n\nHe closed down his 300-cow operation in South Dakota in 1985.\n\nMr Bullard, who is now the chief executive of R-CALF USA, a cattle producer trade association, said it was only in the last year or so that ranchers had received good prices for their livestock, as supply dropped to such a low level that the prices paid by meat processors \"simply had to increase\".\n\nStill, reliance on imports and meat packers' buying power persist, Mr Bullard said, meaning ranchers \"lack confidence in the integrity of the marketplace\" and remain reluctant to grow their herds.\n\nHe said he did not have confidence that the president's ideas would fix the issues.\n\n\"He's focused on the symptoms and not the problems,\" he said."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8ed1ednjdo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"20:27:13.987+00:00","title":"Thailand's former queen Sirikit dies aged 93","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Queen Sirikit, the beloved mother of Thailand's current king, Vajiralongkorn, has died at the age of 93.

single room, with no DNA testing facilities or cold storage units of its own, the forensics team at Gaza's Nasser hospital face the challenges brought by peace.\n\nOver the past eleven days, 195 bodies have been returned to Gaza by Israeli authorities, in exchange for the bodies of 13 Israeli hostages, under the terms of Donald Trump's ceasefire deal. Two other bodies – those of Nepalese and Thai hostages – have also been returned by Hamas.\n\nPhotographs released by Gaza's medical authorities show some of the bodies badly decomposed, and arriving in civilian clothes or naked except for underwear, some with multiple signs of injury. Many have their wrists tied behind their backs, and doctors say some bodies arrived blindfolded or with cloth roped around their necks.\n\nThe forensic team at Nasser hospital are working with almost no resources to answer vast questions about torture, mistreatment and identity.\n\nThe head of the unit, Dr Ahmed Dheir, said one of their biggest limitations is a lack of cold storage space. The bodies arrive in Gaza thoroughly frozen and can take several days to thaw out, ruling out even basic identification methods like dental history, let alone any deeper investigation or post-mortem (autopsy).\n\n\"The situation is extremely challenging,\" he said. \"If we wait for the bodies to thaw, rapid decomposition begins almost immediately, putting us in an impossible position [because] we lose the ability to examine the remains properly. So the most viable method is to take samples and document the state of the bodies as they are.\"\n\nThe BBC has viewed dozens of photographs of the bodies, many of them shared by Gaza's health authorities, others taken by colleagues on the ground.\n\nWe spoke to several of those involved in examining the bodies in Gaza, as well as families of the missing, human rights groups, and Israeli military and prison authorities.\n\nWe also spoke to three forensic experts outside the region, including one specialising in torture, to educate ourselves about the medical processes involved in this kind of investigation – all agreed that there were questions that were difficult to answer without post-mortems.\n\nDr Alaa al-Astal, one of the forensic team at Nasser hospital, said some of the bodies arriving there showed \"signs of torture\", such as bruises and marks from binding on the wrists and ankles.\n\n\"There were extremely horrific cases, where the restraint was so tight that blood circulation to the hands was cut off, leading to tissue damage and clear signs of pressure around the wrists and ankles,\" he said.\n\n\"Even around the eyes, when the blindfolds were removed, you could see deep grooves - imagine how much force that took. The pressure left actual marks where the blindfold had been tied.\"\n\nDr Astal also mentioned the loose cloths tied around the necks of some bodies as needing further investigation.\n\n\"In one case, there was a groove around the neck,\" he said. \"To determine whether the death was due to hanging or strangulation, we needed to perform a post-mortem, but because the body was frozen, it was not dissected.\"\n\nSameh Yassin Hamad, a member of the Hamas-run government committee responsible for receiving the bodies, said there were signs of bruising and blood infiltration indicating that the bodies had been severely beaten before death. He also said there were stab wounds on the chest or face of some of them.\n\nSome of the images we saw from the unit clearly show deep indentations or tightly-fastened cable-ties on the wrists and arms and ankles. One photograph appears to show the bruising and abrasion that would confirm that ties had been used while the person was still alive.\n\nOther bodies showed only deep indentation marks, meaning a post-mortem would be needed to determine whether the ties had been used before or after death. Cable-ties are sometimes used when transporting bodies in Israel.\n\nWhen we asked Israel's military about the evidence we gathered, it said it operates strictly in accordance with international law.\n\nWe showed the photographs we were given to the outside forensic experts. The images represent a fraction of the bodies transferred to Gaza by the Red Cross.\n\nAll three experts said that some of the markings raised questions about what had happened, but that it was difficult to reach concrete conclusions about abuse or torture without  post-mortems.\n\n\"What is happening in Gaza is an international forensic emergency,\" said Michael Pollanen, a forensic pathologist and professor at the University of Toronto. \"Based upon images like this, there is an imperative for complete medicolegal autopsies.  We need to know the truth behind how deaths occurred, and the only way to know the truth is to do autopsies.\"\n\nBut even with limited forensic data, doctors at Nasser hospital say the routine cuffing of wrists behind the body rather than in front, along with the marks observed on the limbs, points to torture.\n\n\"When a person is naked, with their hands tied behind their back, and visible restraint marks on their wrists and ankles, it indicates that they died in that position,\" Dr Dheir told us. \"This is a violation of international law.\"\n\nAnd there is strong evidence to suggest widespread abuse of detainees - including civilians - in Israeli custody in the months after the war began in October 2023, particularly in the military facility of Sde Teiman.\n\n\"At least in the first eight months of the war, the detainees from Gaza were cuffed behind their backs, and had their eyes covered, 24 hrs, 7 days a week, for months,\" said Naji Abbas, head of the Prisoners and Detainees Programme at the Israeli human rights organisation, Physicians for Human Rights (PHRI).\n\n\"We know that people developed serious infections on their skin, hands and legs because of the cuffs.\"\n\nWe have spoken to several people who worked at Sde Teiman over the past two years, who confirm that detainees were cuffed hand and foot – even while undergoing medical treatments, including surgery.\n\nOne medic who worked there said he had campaigned to loosen the cuffs, and that the treatment of detainees there was \"dehumanisation\".\n\nBut many of those detained during the Gaza war are held as unlawful combatants, without charge.\n\nOne complication for doctors at Nasser Hospital now is determining which of the returned bodies are Hamas fighters killed in combat, which are civilians and which are detainees who died in Israeli custody.\n\nSome of the bodies returned by Israel are still wearing Hamas headbands or military boots, but doctors say most are either naked or in civilian clothing, making it difficult to distinguish their role, interpret their injuries, and assess human rights violations.\n\nPhotographs seen by the BBC show mostly naked or decomposed bodies. One dressed in civilian clothing and trainers has what officials say are two small bullet wounds in his back.\n\nSameh Yassin Hamad, from Gaza's Forensics Committee, said that Israel had sent back identification with only six of the 195 bodies it had returned – and that five of those names turned out to be wrong.\n\n\"Since these bodies were held by the Israeli authorities, they will have full data about them,\" said Dr Dheir. \"But they haven't shared that information with us through the Red Cross. We were sent DNA profiles for around half the total number of dead, but have not received any details about the dates or circumstances of death, or the time or place of detention.\"\n\nWe asked Israel's army about the details in this report, including striking allegations by Gaza's forensic team that Israel had removed single fingers and toes from the bodies for DNA testing.\n\nIsrael's military said \"all bodies returned so far are combatants within the Gaza Strip.\"  It denied tying any bodies prior to their release.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Israeli Prime Minister's Office, Shosh Bedrosian, on Wednesday described the reports from Gaza as \"just more efforts to demonise Israel\" and suggested the media focus instead on the experience of Israeli hostages.\n\nAs families of those missing gather at the hospital gates, Dr Dheir and his staff are under intense pressure to identify the dead and provide answers about what happened to them.\n\nSo far, only some 50 bodies have been positively identified – mostly through basic details like height, age and obvious previous injuries.  Another 54 have been buried, unidentified and unclaimed, because of intense pressure on space at the unit.\n\nMany families of the missing attended the burial of the unnamed dead this week, just in case one of them was theirs.\n\n\"Honestly, it's hard to bury a body when you don't know whether it's the right one or not,\" said Rami al-Faraa, still searching for his cousin.\n\n\"If there was [DNA] testing, we'd know where he is – yes or no,\" said Houwaida Hamad, searching for her nephew.  \"My sister would know if the one we're burying is really her son or not.\"\n\nDonald Trump's ceasefire deal has brought some relief for Gaza, but little closure for the families of most of those missing, left burying a body in place of a brother, husband or son.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story said the bodies of 13 Israeli hostages had been returned by Hamas. This was briefly amended to refer to 11 bodies but has since reverted to the original figure. We separately reported that the bodies of two foreign nationals, one Tanzanian and one Thai, have also been returned. In fact the two bodies returned are one Nepalese and one Thai citizen."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czr18g3j4j7o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"22:18:55.741+00:00","title":"Ontario premier says he will pause anti-tariff ad that angered Trump","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ontario Premier Doug Ford has paused a provincial anti-tariff ad campaign that quoted former US President Ronald Reagan, following backlash from President Donald Trump who called it 'FAKE' and terminated trade talks.

Trump\n\nOntario Premier Doug Ford has said he will pause his province's anti-tariff advertisement campaign in the US, after it prompted President Donald Trump to terminate trade talks.\n\nFord said he made the decision after speaking to Prime Minister Mark Carney on Friday, adding that the TV spot will be paused on Monday \"so that trade talks can resume\".\n\nIt will still run over the weekend on US networks, he said, including during the Major League Baseball World Series games.\n\nCarney told reporters earlier on Friday that Canada is prepared to resume trade talks with the US \"when the Americans are ready\".\n\nTrump criticised the advert late on Thursday night in a Truth Social post, calling it \"FAKE\" and \"egregious\". He said trade talks were \"HEREBY TERMINATED\".\n\nThe advert, which was sponsored by the Ontario government, quotes former US President Ronald Reagan, a Republican and icon of US conservatism, saying tariffs \"hurt every American\".\n\nThe video takes excerpts from a 1987 national radio address by Reagan that focused on foreign trade.\n\nTrump's termination of trade talks came after the Ronald Reagan Foundation, which is charged with preserving Reagan's legacy, released a statement saying the advert had used \"selective\" audio and video of the former president's remarks.\n\nIt accused the advert of misrepresenting Reagan's address, and said the Ontario government had not sought permission to use it.\n\nOn Friday, Ford said the intention of the advert was \"to initiate a conversation about the kind of economy that Americans want to build\" and the impact of tariffs.\n\n\"We've achieved our goal, having reached US audiences at the highest levels,\" Ford said.\n\nTrump's reaction to the advert has ignited debate in Canada over whether Ford's combative approach to US trade talks is the right one, or whether the country would be better served by striking a friendlier chord with its neighbour and closest trade ally.\n\nCanada is still the only G7 country that has not reached a trade deal with Trump since he began introducing sweeping tariffs.\n\nThe US has imposed a 35% levy on all Canadian goods - though most are exempt under an existing free trade agreement. It has also slapped sector-specific levies on Canadian goods, including a 50% levy on metals and 25% on automobiles.\n\nThose sector tariffs have especially hurt Ontario, where the bulk of Canada's automanufacturing industry is based.\n\nPrime Minister Carney has attempted for months to negotiate a deal that would ease the tariffs. Three-quarters of Canadian exports are sold to the US, making its economy particularly vulnerable.\n\nIn doing so, he has opted for friendly face-to-face meetings and text messages with the US president.\n\nFord, on the other hand, has taken a more defiant stance. He pulled US liquor off Ontario shelves and briefly threatened withholding energy exports.\n\nLast week, he told reporters he was \"sick and tired of sitting and rolling over\", after car manufacturer Stellantis announced it would move some production out of its Brampton, Ontario, plant into the United States.\n\n\"We need to fight back,\" Ford said at the time.\n\nThe next day, he launched the advertisement campaign that eventually drew the ire of the US president.\n\nTrump's abrupt termination of trade talks is unsurprising to most Canadians, said Mahmood Nanji, a fellow at the Ivey Business School at Western University and former associate deputy finance minister in Ontario.\n\nThe US president had made a similar threat earlier this year after Ottawa announced it would impose a digital services tax on US technology firms.\n\n\"His posts tend to be full of theatrics and hyperbole,\" Mr Nanji said.\n\nAnd while some might appreciate Ford standing up for the Ontario industries hardest hit by tariffs, the timing and tone of Ford's advert campaign has not helped Canada's case, causing an \"unnecessary distraction,\" Mr Nanji added.\n\nIt is unclear if trade talks will indeed resume now that Ford has pulled the ad, and President Trump is yet to respond to the announcement it will stop running.\n\nThe White House on Friday signalled frustration with what it called \"Canada's longstanding, unfair trade barriers,\" and added that efforts to address these issues \"have not led to any constructive progress\".\n\nCarney has made some appeasements to keep talks going, including removing retaliatory tariffs and dropping Canada's digital services tax. But he has repeatedly said that he is searching for \"the best deal for Canada.\"\n\nBoth Trump and Carney are heading to Asia on Friday for the ASEAN Summit in Kuala Lumpur. The Canadian prime minister told reporters that the focus of his trip would be \"developing new partnerships and opportunities, including with the economic giants of Asia\".\n\nBut Carney also left the door open to continue trade talks with the US.\n\nMr Nanji said the advert saga is a reminder that the path to a deal for Canada will not be an easy one, regardless of negotiation methods.\n\nHe noted remarks by Carney earlier in the week, in which he stated that \"the US has fundamentally changed its approach to trade\" and that Canada's close tie to America has become a vulnerability.\n\n\"We have to take care of ourselves because we can't rely on one foreign partner,\" Carney said in a speech Wednesday to tease his government's first budget, which will be unveiled on 4 November.\n\nThe speech, Mr Nanji said, was also meant to \"caution Canadians that this is going to be a really rocky road with the Americans\"."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy5qrp2wne4o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"09:00:29.132+00:00","title":"Prince Andrew took money from firm linked to ripped-off pensioners","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Prince Andrew received £60,500 from British businessman Adrian Gleave in December 2019, through a company, Alphabet Capital Limited, which was linked to SVS Securities—a firm that collapsed in 2019 after being found to have mis-sold pension investments and charged excessive fees.

substantial payments to HRH Prince Andrew the Duke of York\".\n\nThe payments Prince Andrew received directly from Mr Gleave and his businesses, which were also sent via Alphabet Capital, came months after the businessman had stepped down as a director of SVS Securities - a company which had been ordered to stop trading by the financial regulator over pension mis-selling allegations.\n\nSVS Securities collapsed in August 2019, days after the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) had ordered it to stop regulated activities.\n\nClients' pension funds were found to have been invested in high-risk bonds against their interests in order to generate large commissions for SVS.\n\nSome investments made on the basis of the undisclosed commissions then defaulted, leaving customers with substantial losses. Investors were also charged large fees to withdraw funds in an effort to boost profits, the FCA found.\n\nMr Gleave, 55, was head of business development at SVS, which he had joined in 2013.\n\nHe remained a registered director on the FCA's register until late July 2019, less than two weeks before the regulator's intervention.\n\nHe had been a company director registered with Companies House until a couple of months earlier, although on LinkedIn he claims to have left the business in November 2018.\n\nThree SVS directors were later banned and fined by the FCA but Mr Gleave was not one of them. Two are appealing the decision.\n\nThe Financial Services Compensation Scheme has paid out more than £41m to former SVS customers.\n\nAt the time of his dealings with Prince Andrew, Mr Gleave also ran a number of caravan and mobile home parks in Northern Ireland and England.\n\nAt one point, he was reported to have worked out of one of the parks, a retirement village for over-55s on the east coast of Northern Ireland.\n\nTen of the parks have since gone into administration and Mr Gleave, who did not respond to a request for comment, now works for a renewable energy company with a focus on AI and crypto financing.\n\nNeither Prince Andrew nor Mr Gleave have ever explained the reason for the payments or the nature of any contractual relationship between the two men.\n\nBaroness Margaret Hodge, a former chair of the Commons public accounts committee, said Mr Gleave's business background raised questions for Prince Andrew about his judgement and financial dealings.\n\n\"This is yet another instance where a dose of transparency would help answer legitimate questions about the origins of the money and the purpose of the payment,\" she said.\n\n\"Without those answers any sceptical person would be worried that there might be some financial wrongdoing taking place and this would risk sullying the reputation of the Royal family,\" she added.\n\nAs well as the payments he made himself, Mr Gleave's company, Alphabet Capital, was also used to funnel significant sums which had originated from Ms Isbilen to Prince Andrew and his ex-wife Sarah, court documents show.\n\nMs Ferguson was paid £50,000 by Alphabet Capital in February 2020. It has previously been reported that she was paid £20,000 by Alphabet for a role advising the company and that she also received more than £200,000 to cover work she had done as a brand ambassador for a US solar energy company.\n\nPrince Andrew was separately given £750,000 directly by Ms Isbilen, money which he has repaid.\n\nAnother £10,000 was paid from Alphabet Capital to the couple's daughter, Eugenie. This, along with a £15,000 payment from Ms Isbilen's business adviser has previously been described by Eugenie as a gift from a \"long-standing family friend\" which she said was to pay for a surprise birthday party for her mother, Sarah.\n\nAlphabet Capital filed accounts claiming it was a dormant company at the time of the payments. These were later corrected but listed a turnover of just £80,000.\n\nPrince Andrew and Mr Gleave did not respond to requests for comment."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cze61zg7zzpo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"05:03:59.553+00:00","title":"Gaza children dying as they wait for Israel to enable evacuations","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the wake of a fragile ceasefire in Gaza, thousands of patients—particularly children—are still dying due to a lack of medical access.

lie two 10-year-old boys, one shot by Israeli fire and paralysed from the neck down, another with a brain tumour.\n\nNow that a fragile ceasefire is in place, they are among some 15,000 patients who the World Health Organization (WHO) says are in need of urgent medical evacuations.\n\nOla Abu Said sits gently stroking the hair of her son Amar.  His family says he was in their tent in southern Gaza when he was hit by a stray bullet fired by an Israeli drone.  It is lodged between two of his vertebrae, leaving him paralysed.\n\n\"He needs surgery urgently,\" Ola says, \"but it's complicated.  Doctors told us it could cause his death, a stroke or brain hemorrhage.  He needs surgery in a well-equipped place.\"\n\nRight now, Gaza is anything but that.  After two years of war, its hospitals have been left in a critical state.\n\nSitting by the bedside of her younger brother, Ahmed al-Jadd, his sister Shahd says her brother was a constant comfort to her through two years of war and displacement.\n\n\"He's only 10 and when our situation got so bad, he used to go out and sell water to help bring some money for us,\" she says.  A few months ago, he showed the first signs of ill health.\n\n\"Ahmad's mouth started drooping to one side,\" Shahd explains.  \"One time he kept telling me: \"Shahd my head hurts\" and we just gave him paracetamol, but later, his right hand stopped moving.\"\n\nThe one-time university student is desperate for her brother to travel abroad to have his tumour removed.\n\n\"We can't lose him.  We already lost our father, our home and our dreams,\" Shahd says. \"When the ceasefire happened it gave us a bit of a hope that maybe there was a 1% chance that Ahmed could travel and get treated.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the WHO coordinated the first medical convoy to exit Gaza since the fragile ceasefire began on 10 October.  It took 41 patients and 145 carers to hospitals abroad via Israel's Kerem Shalom crossing, with ambulances and buses taking the group on to Jordan.  Some have stayed for care there.\n\nThe UN agency has called for numbers of medical evacuations to be rapidly increased to deal with the thousands of cases of sick and wounded.  It wants to be able to bring out patients through Gaza's Rafah border crossing with Egypt as it has done previously.\n\nHowever, Israel has said it is keeping the crossing closed until Hamas \"fulfils\" its commitments under the terms of the Gaza ceasefire deal by returning the bodies of deceased hostages. Israel has kept the Gaza side of the Egyptian border closed since May 2024 when it took control during the war.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference on Thursday, the head of the WHO, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said \"the most impactful measure\" would be if Israel could allow Gazan patients to be treated in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, as happened before the war.\n\nTop EU officials and foreign ministers of more than 20 countries - including the UK - have previously called for this, offering \"financial contributions, provision of medical staff or equipment needed.\"\n\n\"Hundreds of patients could be treated easily and efficiently in a short time if this route reopened to the East Jerusalem Hospital Network and the hospitals in the West Bank,\" says Dr Fadi Atrash, CEO of the Augusta Victoria Hospital on the Mount of Olives.\n\n\"We can at least treat 50 patients per day for chemotherapy and radiation and even more than that.  Other hospitals can do a lot of surgeries,\" the doctor tells me.\n\n\"Referring them to East Jerusalem is the shortest distance, the most efficient way, because we have the mechanism.  We speak the same language, we're the same culture, in many cases we have medical files for Gazan patients.  They've been receiving treatment in East Jerusalem hospitals for more than a decade before the war.\"\n\nThe BBC asked Cogat, the Israeli defence body which controls Gaza's crossings, why the medical route was not being approved.  Cogat said it was a decision by the political echelon and referred queries to the Prime Minister's Office which did not offer further explanation.\n\nAfter the Hamas-led attacks of 7 October 2023, Israel cited security reasons for not allowing Gazan patients in other Palestinian territories.  It also pointed out that its main crossing point for people at Erez had been targeted by Hamas fighters during the assault.\n\nThe Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says that in the year to August 2025, at least 740 people, including nearly 140 children, died while on waiting lists.\n\nAt Nasser hospital, the director of paediatrics and maternity, Dr Ahmed al-Farra, expresses his frustration.\n\n\"It's the most difficult feeling for a doctor to be present, able to diagnose a condition but unable to carry out essential tests and lacking the necessary treatments,\" Dr al-Farra says. \"This has happened in so many cases, and unfortunately, there's daily loss of life due to our lack of capabilities.\"\n\nSince the ceasefire, hope has run out for more of his patients.\n\nIn the past week in the hospital grounds, a funeral took place for Saadi Abu Taha, aged eight, who died from intestinal cancer.\n\nA day later three-year old Zain Tafesh and Luay Dweik, aged eight, died from hepatitis.\n\nWithout action, there are many more Gazans who will not have a chance to live in peace."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwypnvpl444o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"23:13:13.399+00:00","title":"Bill Gates's cameo in iconic Indian TV drama with Smriti Irani","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Bill Gates made a surprise cameo in the long-running Indian TV show Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi, appearing in a four-minute segment with Smriti Irani to discuss maternal and child health.

TV drama with Smriti irani\n\nA crossover no-one saw coming.\n\nThat's how many in India are describing Microsoft founder and philanthropist Bill Gates' appearance in an iconic Hindi TV drama with actress and former federal minister Smriti Irani.\n\nMr Gates appeared on Thursday night's episode of Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi (Because the Mother-in-Law Was Also Once Daughter-in-Law) to talk about maternal and child health with Irani.\n\nThe Gates Foundation has been working on curbing infant and maternal mortality for years with governments in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar - the two northern Indian states with huge populations that are also among the most disadvantaged regions.\n\nGovernment  data  shows a significant improvement in maternal and child health indicators over the years, including in the two states. But in a country steeped in patriarchy, challenges remain.\n\nIn such a scenario, experts say messaging becomes extremely important to keep the drumbeat going to change norms and to make people more aware of the need to take care of their girls and mothers.\n\nAnd to do that, Mr Gates perhaps couldn't have chosen a better platform than Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi.\n\nFirst launched in July 2000, the  series  had a very successful long innings with several thousand episodes that were broadcast almost daily on Star Plus for eight- and-a-half years before it was discontinued, says Shailaja Bajpai, columnist and Readers' Editor for Print new site.\n\nIn July, 25 years after it first hit the screens, Kyunki... returned for its second innings.\n\nIndian audiences found the show, based on the complex domestic relationship between Irani's character Tulsi and her mother-in-law, riveting. The trials and tribulations of the dutiful new bride had families reorganise their daily routines to ensure they didn't miss out a single episode.\n\nIrani's character was - and is - at the centre of this story of the fictitious Virani family. In the first season, she played a young woman who fell in love with and married the scion of a wealthy family.\n\nA quarter of a century later, Tulsi is middle aged, her children are all grown up and she is about to become a ma-in-law herself.\n\nBut the battles she's fighting now are still with jealous and misguided family members and the drama - and the melodrama - of the original season remain in abundance, Ms Bajpai says.\n\n\"If you take away the gadgets, the mobile phones and the laptops, essentially remove all the window dressing, it's still the same story. It's just been updated.\"\n\nBut, she adds that one thing that's different now is that the social messaging has increased. \"I think that's because it fits her profile more. She served as the minister for women and child development so the show now talks about divorce, child and maternal health and other socially-relevant issues.\"\n\nThe four-minute-long segment with Mr Gates starts with the Microsoft founder greeting her in American-accented Hindi - \"Namaste Tulsi-ji,\" he says, asking her if he'd said it right?\n\n\"Yes, absolutely perfect,\" she beams.\n\nThe call comes after Tulsi is seen in a viral video at a godh-bharai (baby shower) dishing out health advice to an expectant mother.\n\nTulsi's son, who's posted the video, tells her that he had tagged Mr Gates, wondering if he'd be willing to talk to Tulsi on a video call. \"He's accepted,\" he squeals with delight.\n\nTulsi initially seems a bit nervous. \"What will I say to him? I only do video calls with you all or your father about grocery shopping,\" she says.\n\nBut once the laptop is fired up and Mr Gates comes in vision, Tulsi comes into her own, explaining the reason for the \"traditional\" ritual.\n\n\"We come together to bless a young expectant mother, we wish her lots of good health,\" she says.\n\n\"We tell women how essential it is to look after their health, their nutrition and diet. We tell them to follow the doctors' instructions and go to a hospital for their delivery.\"\n\nThe two agree that \"when mothers are healthy, children thrive and the world can make significant progress\".\n\nIn a statement to the BBC, makers of the show JioStar Entertainment said the show was using storytelling to spotlight critical issues around maternal and child health.\n\n\"We believe that storytelling can do more than entertain, it can inform, inspire and drive awareness on issues that matter,\" JioStar's Sumanta Bose said.\n\n\"By weaving topics of social significance into our narratives, we aim to create impact that reaches beyond the screen and brings about a meaningful difference in people's lives,\" he added.\n\nThe release says that Mr Gates will appear in three episodes of the show.\n\nIn its second innings, Ms Bajpai says, the show has had to compete with a multitude of other offerings on OTT platforms and hasn't found the same resonance with the audience.\n\nBut Mr Gates' unexpected cameo seems to have brought it back into the limelight - for now at least.\n\nA promo of the episode received more than six million views on Instagram alone in less than a day, with thousands of comments echoing a sense of surprise and amusement.\n\n\"What is this multiverse,\" said one comment which was liked by more than 17,000 people. Another said: \"It's so cringe but I also love it so much.\""},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/world/americas/us-sanctions-colombia-president-petro-drugs.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"21:27:23.227Z","title":"U.S. Sanctions Colombia’s Leader, One of President Trump’s Harshest Critics","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United States has imposed economic sanctions on Colombian President Gustavo Petro, his wife, one of his sons, and his political ally serving as Colombia’s interior minister, citing his alleged failure to curb drug production since 2022.

Critics\n\nPublished: 2025-10-24T21:27:23.227Z\n\nThe United States announced economic sanctions on Colombia’s president, Gustavo Petro, on Friday, following Mr. Petro’s criticism of the Trump administration’s military actions in the Caribbean.\n\nWashington also said it was sanctioning Mr. Petro’s wife, a son, and a longtime political ally who is now Colombia’s interior minister.\n\nSuch sanctions are often reserved for people accused of major drug crimes and human rights violations.\n\nThe United States Treasury Department, in a news release, said it was sanctioning Mr. Petro and his allies because the Colombian leader had allowed drug production to flourish since taking office in 2022.\n\nMr. Petro, a leftist, is one of few leaders in Latin America who have been vocal in their criticism of Mr. Trump’s decision to bomb boats carrying people his administration says are drug traffickers. The bombings have killed dozens of people, and Mr. Petro has said that Colombians have been among them and has accused the United States of committing murder.\n\nMr. Trump has responded by calling Mr. Petro “an illegal drug leader” and said that he would cut off aid to Colombia. About $377 million was designated to Colombia in the 2024 fiscal year, according to the Congressional Research Service. About a third of that money is meant for law enforcement and narcotics control.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

\"miracle mineral\" really help us sleep?\n\nIt's been described as the mineral of the moment.\n\nMillions of us are taking magnesium for a whole range of reasons. Can it help us sleep better? Sort our digestion problems? Give our busy brains a moment of peace?\n\nIn the fast-moving world of supplements, it's magnesium's time to shine.\n\nAnd the industry is booming. The global magnesium market is worth nearly £3bn and that's set to nearly double over the next decade.\n\nIn a small factory, nestled in the Yorkshire Dales, huge plastic barrels of white powder are stacked up next to giant whirring machines.\n\nWorkers in hazmat suits carefully weigh out magnesium citrate - a compound made by mixing the mineral with citric acid - into shiny, steel containers.\n\n\"We are sending our supplies all over the world,\" Andrew Goring, manager director of Lonsdale Health, explains. \"Around the UK, obviously, but also to Australia, parts of Asia, Kuwait, Iraq.\n\n\"It's one of our biggest sellers and the market just keeps growing.\"\n\nHe is shouting over the hum of the pill presser, a machine that resembles a Dalek, which pops out dozens of small white magnesium tablets a second.\n\n\"Do we actually need it?\" I bellow back. \"And why now, why has it become so popular?\"\n\n\"Influencers, social media - that's what's pushing it,\" Mr Goring explains. \"We've known about magnesium and its benefits for years and now, finally, it's mainstream.\"\n\nI can almost hear the eye roll when I contact Kirsten Jackson, a dietitian who specialises in gut health.\n\n\"Clever marketing schemes,\" Ms Jackson says, \"magnesium is involved in areas people are willing to invest in: their sleep, digestion, mental health.\"\n\nBut, she is keen to stress, this does not automatically mean we need supplements to improve those things.\n\nMagnesium is one of several minerals in our bodies.  The recommended daily amount  for women is 270mg and for men, it's 300mg. We store about 25g.\n\nIt might make up less than 1% of us but \"it is involved in over 300 different processes\", Ms Jackson explains.\n\nIt is \"especially important for our brain and mood,\" she says, because it helps nerves send messages properly and supports the building blocks of brain cell membranes.\n\nIt also helps balance blood sugar levels, regulate blood pressure, and is an essential player in moving calcium and potassium in and out of our cells, which maintains the rhythm of our heartbeat.\n\nSo, surely popping a pill full of the stuff should keep our bodies running smoothly?\n\nIt's more complex than that, says Ms Jackson. For a magnesium supplement to work, we need to be lacking the mineral in the first place - and it's difficult to test for any deficiency because the vast majority of our magnesium is stored in our bones and tissues.\n\nBut on an individual level, many say the supplement has made a difference.\n\nFor Katie Curran, a communications specialist who has worked with some of the biggest fashion brands, sleeping well was something she could only dream about.\n\n\"A year ago, I was struggling,\" she confides. \"It would take so long to get to sleep, my brain was racing, and then I would get off only to wake a couple of hours later.\"\n\nKatie decided to try magnesium glycinate - a combination of magnesium and glycine,  an amino acid with limited evidence  linking it to better sleep.\n\nAfter two weeks of taking 270mg a day, she says the noise in her head started to quieten. The racing thoughts slowed down, and she began to feel like she could function again.\n\n\"My sleep definitely improved, I had more energy. I became more active. Other things changed in my life, so I can't put it down to just one thing, but I think the magnesium supplements were an important part of the puzzle.\"\n\nWhile being deficient in magnesium can definitely affect sleep patterns, there isn't the evidence to say taking supplements will definitely improve your sleep.\n\nSocial media is awash with eager supplement-takers, many with posts stamped with \"commission paid\" in the corner - meaning they could earn money from their story or reel.\n\nAccording to these influencers, it feels as though there is little magnesium can't help with, as they recommend a variety of different products.\n\nMagnesium is often mixed with other compounds with the aim of helping support various parts of our bodies. For example, magnesium mixed with either L-threonate or glycinate is supposed to target brain health, which helps with sleep and stress relief.\n\nIf magnesium is combined with chloride, it is recommended for muscle tension and pre-menstrual cramps, while citrate and oxide blends are aimed at digestion and help with constipation.\n\nThe majority of us can probably relate to having at least one of those issues. But as nutritionist Kristen Stavridis stresses, the problem is there is not enough strong evidence to show the majority of these different magnesium supplements have a positive effect on the healthy population.\n\nAnd even if they did - we would need to be deficient in magnesium in the first place to see a benefit.\n\n\"We have supplement companies shouting out at us: 'We are all going to die',\" Ms Stavridis says, \"'Quick! Take my pill and - hey presto - there's your solution'.\n\n\"Many of us are not getting enough magnesium,\" she continues, \"around 10% of men and 20% of women are not getting the  recommended daily intake .\n\n\"But just taking a supplement is not the answer.\"\n\nTake sleep health, for example. Ms Stavridis says there are many conflicting studies on whether magnesium supplements really make a difference. Some trials say it can have some benefits, while some randomised controlled trials - the gold standard - are more sceptical.\n\nThere is also the added complication of supplements potentially working against each other because of the way they interact in the body.\n\nTaking zinc, for example - a supplement often recommended for peri-menopausal women - can also  affect the absorption rate of magnesium.\n\nBasically, Ms Stavridis says, it's a minefield, and not just a simple case of \"take this\" and you'll be fixed.\n\nShe recommends looking at diet first. But if you are thinking about taking magnesium supplements, Ms Stavridis advises taking half the amount recommended on the packet on a daily basis and seeing how you feel.\n\nIf healthy people take too much, their kidneys can get rid of it in \"expensive urine\", but there are still risks, like diarrhoea, vomiting and nausea.\n\nFor those with kidney disease, taking magnesium supplements can be dangerous and can cause hypermagnesemia - a potentially life-threatening condition that can leave someone with paralysis or in a coma.\n\nDietitian Kirsten Jackson also says most people should \"100% look at diet first\".\n\nFoods like seeds, nuts, whole-grain breads, greens and fruit are good sources of magnesium, she says.\n\nShe warns that if you don't regularly consume these types of foods, you're probably also short of other essential nutrients like vitamin C, vitamin K, fibre and prebiotics too.\n\n\"One magnesium supplement is not going to sort all that.\""},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/us/politics/caribbean-sea-boat-strike-us-venezuela.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"12:34:46-04:00","title":"U.S. Military Kills Six People in Latest Boat Strike in the Caribbean","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. military has killed six people in a boat strike in the Caribbean Sea, marking the 10th known attack under the Trump administration’s controversial campaign against suspected drug-smuggling boats.

Military Kills Six People in Latest Boat Strike in the Caribbean\n\nPublished: 2025-10-24T12:34:46-04:00\n\nThe U.S. military killed six people on a boat suspected of smuggling drugs from South America, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said on Friday, as the Trump administration’s lethal and legally disputed campaign continued to escalate.\n\nThe latest attack raises the death toll from the Trump administration’s campaign on suspected drug boats to 43 in 10 known strikes — eight in the Caribbean and two more this week in the eastern Pacific.\n\nMr. Hegseth said in post on social media that the strike had taken place overnight in international waters in the Caribbean Sea. He added that the vessel was “operated by” Tren de Aragua, one of several Latin American criminal groups that the administration has designated as a terrorist organization.\n\nThe defense secretary offered no evidence to support his claim but cited “our intelligence.” As with statements about previous strikes, his message contained a grainy, 20-second video clip of a boat bobbing in the water, then disappearing in an explosion.\n\n“If you are a narco-terrorist smuggling drugs in our hemisphere, we will treat you like we treat Al-Queda,” Mr. Hegseth wrote, misspelling Al Qaeda. “Day or NIGHT, we will map your networks, track your people, hunt you down, and kill you.”\n\nA broad range of outside legal specialists have said that President Trump and Mr. Hegseth have been giving illegal orders to the military because it is forbidden under domestic and international law to deliberately target civilians who are not directly participating in hostilities — even if they are suspected criminals.\n\nThe United States has traditionally addressed maritime drug smuggling by using the Coast Guard, sometimes assisted by the Navy, intercept boats. If suspicions proved accurate, it would arrest their crews. In the same way, the police arrest people who are suspected of being drug dealers; it would be a crime to instead summarily kill them in the street.\n\nThe penalty for being convicted of drug trafficking is prison time, not execution.\n\nThe Trump administration has asserted that the attacks are lawful — and are not murder — because Mr. Trump has “determined” that drug trafficking by cartels constitute an armed attack on the United States and that the country is engaged in a formal armed conflict with the cartels, so boat crews can be targeted as “combatants.”\n\nBut the administration has not provided a legal theory in public or to Congress to explain how it is legitimate for Mr. Trump to bridge the conceptual gulf between drug trafficking and the kind of armed attacks that can create a legal state of armed conflict. Nor has it explained how crewing a boat carrying an illicit consumer product can make someone a lawful target as a combatant.\n\nIn the absence of a legal argument, the administration has made a policy argument. It has said it is in favor of using military force against suspected drug runners because tens of thousands of American drug users die from overdoses each year. Mr. Trump has repeatedly said that each boat the U.S. military destroys saves 25,000 lives.\n\nAbout 80,000 American drug users died from overdoses last year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That number is down from 110,000 in 2023 but higher than it was a decade ago.\n\nThe rise in overdose deaths in recent years was caused by fentanyl, which comes from labs in Mexico. The boats that the U.S. military attacked were coming from South America, which produces cocaine.\n\nSince returning to office in January, Mr. Trump has designated a series of Latin American drug cartels and criminal gangs, including Tren de Aragua, as terrorist organizations. Mr. Hegseth has repeatedly compared them to Al Qaeda.\n\nCongress authorized an armed conflict with Al Qaeda after it attacked the United States on Sept. 11, 2001; lawmakers have not authorized a war on unrelated other terrorist groups. The designations are also disputed since by definition, terrorists are motivated by ideological or religious goals, while cartels seek illicit profits.\n\nThe law that empowers the executive branch to designate a group as a foreign terrorist organization permits freezing its assets and also makes it a crime to provide support to that group. What it does not do is authorize the summary killing of people suspected of being members of the group.\n\nMr. Hegseth’s description of the 10th attack as targeting a boat associated with Tren de Aragua refocused the operation on Venezuela. Mr. Trump described the first strike, on Sept. 2, as killing 11 people he accused of having been members of that gang. The second strike, on Sept. 15, killed three people he said were from Venezuela.\n\nBut President Gustavo Petro of Colombia said one of the people killed on Sept. 15 was a Colombian fisherman and accused the United States of murder. For subsequent strikes, the administration largely did not identify a nationality or membership of the targets in a particular organization.\n\nIn a fourth strike, on Oct. 3, the U.S. military killed four men who Mr. Petro later said were Colombian citizens. The sixth strike, on a semi-submersible vessel, killed two people but had two survivors, one of whom was repatriated to Colombia.\n\nThe seventh strike, on Oct. 17, killed three men the administration accused of smuggling drugs for the National Liberation Army, a Marxist rebel group in Colombia known as the E.L.N., which the State Department designated as terrorists in 1997. The eighth and ninth strikes were in the eastern Pacific, off the coast of Colombia.\n\nIn the buildup to the boat strikes operation as well as in its opening phase, the Trump administration largely focused on Venezuela and its authoritarian leader, President Nicolás Maduro, who has been indicted in the United States on drug trafficking charges. The administration has called him illegitimate and portrayed him as the head of a drug cartel.\n\nThe Trump administration is also considering options for land strikes in Venezuela and trying to use force to remove Mr. Maduro. Proponents of a regime-change operation include Secretary of State Marco Rubio and the C.I.A. director, John Ratcliffe.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/us/politics/president-trump-2028-steve-bannon.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"00:15:09.704Z","title":"Bannon Claims ‘There Is a Plan’ For Trump to Run for a Third Term","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Stephen K.

Bannon, the pro-Trump podcaster and convicted fraudster who briefly served as President Trump’s White House chief strategist in his first term, publicly threw his support behind the president’s talk of seeking a third term, in defiance of a constitutionally-mandated two-term limit.\n\nIn an interview with The Economist, Mr. Bannon vaguely asserted that there was “a plan” to circumvent the 22nd Amendment, which states that “no person shall be elected to the office of the president more than twice,” regardless of whether the terms are consecutive. He also suggested that he was part of a team developing that plan.\n\n“Trump is gonna be president in ’28, and people ought to just get accommodated with that,” he said.\n\n“At the appropriate time, we’ll lay out what the plan is,” said Mr. Bannon, without elaborating. “But there is a plan.” He added that Mr. Trump was an “instrument of divine will,” echoing, as Mr. Trump himself has, the language of the divine right of kings.\n\nMr. Bannon’s statement comes after months of Mr. Trump publicly toying with the idea of running for a third term. Even as the president insists he is serious, some Republican leaders have dismissed the idea as a joke, noting that the Constitution does not permit it. White House aides have mocked reporters for taking the president at his word.\n\nMr. Trump has for years publicly and privately joked about being “president for life.” In 2019, Mr. Trump began posting a video on social media of an edited version of a Time magazine cover with imaginary campaign signs for 2024, 2028, 2032 and far beyond. On Sunday, Mr. Trump posted that video again, alongside fake videos depicting him as a king and dumping brown liquid on “No Kings” protesters.\n\nHe has also at times said he would not run again. When asked by a New York Times reporter on Election Day last year whether the 2024 campaign was his last, he said, “I would think so.” His musings about a third term could be a way to avoid being seen as a lame-duck president, analysts say.\n\nIt is unclear if Mr. Bannon has been in touch with Mr. Trump or his aides about the idea. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMr. Bannon has not worked in the Trump White House since 2017 and is known for being a provocateur. In February, he was convicted of defrauding donors who had sought to help build a wall at the southern border.\n\nAnd he is not always in lock-step with the president and his administration, questioning the military campaign against suspected drug traffickers and the end of the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nStill, the podcaster has considerable influence among the far right. He was one of the most powerful voices amplifying Mr. Trump’s lie that the 2020 election was stolen from him, culminating in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.\n\nAnd Mr. Trump has previously adopted fringe ideas developed by right-wing allies after initially distancing himself from them.\n\nMr. Trump had, for example, repeatedly insisted before the 2024 election that he had “nothing to do with Project 2025,” an unpopular right-wing policy plan written by Republican allies that was widely viewed as extreme. He then adopted many of those policies, and hired Russell T. Vought, a Project 2025 architect, to lead his White House budget office. Mr. Trump bragged about Mr. Vought’s connection to those policies earlier this month, describing him as being “of PROJECT 2025 Fame.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/25/world/asia/trump-japan-korea-china.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"00:01:23-04:00","title":"Where Trump Is Headed in Asia, and What Each Country Wants From Him","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Trump’s first Asian trip during his second term includes visits to Malaysia, Japan, and South Korea, culminating in a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

The vast majority of Republicans have enthusiastically rallied behind them, and this month, all but two of them voted to block a measure that would terminate the president’s campaign.\n\nBut for a G.O.P.-led Congress that has seldom questioned Mr. Trump on any matter, foreign or domestic, the skepticism reflects a rare and potentially significant bit of dissent over a widening war.\n\n“We have oversight responsibilities, and we expect to get our questions answered,” Senator Mike Rounds, Republican of South Dakota and a member of the Armed Services Committee, said in an interview on Wednesday.\n\nIt comes as the Senate is set to vote again next week on whether to rein in Mr. Trump’s military campaign, with consideration of a bipartisan resolution that would prohibit U.S. attacks “within or against” Venezuela without explicit authorization from Congress.\n\nSo far, the measure, which the president would all but certainly veto, does not appear to have sufficient Republican backing to move forward. It would need the support of at least four G.O.P. senators. Yet it is shaping up to be an important test vote as Mr. Trump declares that he neither needs nor plans to seek any authorization for his drug war, and as some in the G.O.P. are arguing that Congress must weigh in.\n\nSenator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine and a member of the Intelligence Committee, said she would like to see the Senate “pass a resolution that either authorizes his force or prevents its use,” referring in an interview on Wednesday to Mr. Trump.\n\nSince early September, the U.S. has launched 10 known lethal strikes on vessels the Trump administration says are trafficking drugs, and deployed more than 10,000 troops and aircraft across the region. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, carrying out orders from Mr. Trump, has framed the mission as a fight against “narcoterrorists.”\n\nBut the absence of a formal congressional authorization to use military force and questions about the intelligence underpinning the strikes have prompted calls for oversight.\n\n“This is a legitimate discussion between the two branches of government that we should always be having,” Senator Thom Tillis, Republican of North Carolina and a member of the Armed Services panel, said, urging talks on authorizing the use of force. “I think we’ve got to be very careful when you’re talking about ordering a kinetic strike.”\n\nLike Mr. Rounds and Ms. Collins, Mr. Tillis voted with his party against the recent measure calling for a halt to the boat strikes, which was sponsored by Senators Adam B. Schiff of California and Tim Kaine of Virginia, both Democrats.\n\nBut several Republicans said they wanted to be read in on the legal justification for the attacks. Senator John Curtis, Republican of Utah, said that “we’re always hungry for more” information from the White House. Senator Jon Husted, Republican of Ohio, said he was confident in the rationale the administration had offered so far, but that “as new facts develop, I may or may not have more questions.”\n\nAfter voting against the resolution to end the boat strikes, Senator Todd Young, Republican of Indiana, issued a lengthy statement on social media in which he called the measure overly broad, but said he remained “highly concerned” about the legality of the strikes and the “trajectory of military operations without congressional approval.”\n\n“While the Constitution grants Article II authorities to the executive branch to defend against imminent threats, Congress alone is entrusted with decisions of war and peace,” he added.\n\nIn the interview this week, Ms. Collins suggested that she did not support the continued use of lethal military force to target narcotics traffickers, a function she said was best left to federal law enforcement.\n\n“Historically, the interception of drug-running boats has been the job of the Coast Guard,” Ms. Collins said. “And I’ve seen the Coast Guard’s fast boats. They know how to do this, they’re well trained and they’re acting in a law enforcement capacity. And to me, that’s what we should be using.”\n\nMr. Trump has made it clear that he plans to expand the military campaign to airstrikes on countries that harbor cartel operations, including Venezuela. And despite repeatedly calling the operation a war, he said he would not seek congressional approval.\n\n“Well, I don’t think we’re going to necessarily ask for a declaration of war,” the president told reporters at the White House on Thursday. “I think we’re just going to kill people that are bringing drugs into our country, OK? We’re going to kill them, you know? They are going to be, like, dead.”\n\nHe also suggested that lawmakers would not dare to challenge him on the topic, saying: “What are they going to do — say, ‘Gee, we don’t want to stop drugs pouring in’?”\n\nSo far, only two Republicans have directly opposed the military offensive. Senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Rand Paul of Kentucky broke with their party this month to support the unsuccessful measure to curb the attacks at sea.\n\nMr. Paul has partnered with Mr. Kaine and Mr. Schiff on the measure that would limit the president’s power to strike Venezuelan territory, which is on track for a vote next week. A libertarian who opposes American involvement in foreign conflicts, the Kentucky Republican has warned in recent days about the prospect that the United States could be headed into a ground war to depose Venezuela’s authoritarian president, Nicolás Maduro.\n\n“I’ve got no love lost, obviously, for Maduro and the government, but I think an offensive war for regime change — it would be a mistake,” Mr. Paul said.\n\nFor now, senators are getting by with what some Republicans privately complain is limited and sporadic information from the Trump administration about the offensive, with many learning of the strikes at the same time as the public does, through social media posts from Mr. Trump or Mr. Hegseth.\n\nSenators have received limited classified briefings on the attacks, some restricted to leaders and relevant committees and others expanded to broader groups.\n\nA month after the first strike, Republicans and Democrats on the Armed Services Committee pressed the Pentagon’s top lawyer, Earl Matthews, in a closed-door meeting to explain the legal basis for the military’s attacks.\n\nMr. Matthews repeatedly referred to the president’s designation of certain Latin American drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, which he said granted the Pentagon unilateral authority to use military force against them, said officials familiar with the confidential session, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss it.\n\nSenators from both parties who attended expressed frustration and concern about that rationale, and urged the administration to articulate a stronger legal case. But Mr. Matthews refused to provide a written justification for the strikes, the officials said.\n\nMost Republicans have expressed full-throated support for the administration’s strategy.\n\nRepresentative Brian Mast, Republican of Florida and chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said the strikes were based on “credible intelligence provided by numerous agencies.”\n\n“The cartels are terrorists who produce and distribute a worldwide supply of illicit drugs, murder countless people and traffic even more,” he added.\n\nSenator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, said that Secretary of State Marco Rubio had assured G.O.P. senators in a briefing that the “administration is on solid legal ground.” Mr. Kennedy recalled Mr. Rubio characterizing the intelligence supporting the operation as “exquisite.”\n\nStill, Mr. Kennedy conceded that further scrutiny was warranted, particularly after a survivor of a strike carried out on Oct. 16 was repatriated and eventually released. “At some point, we will have oversight hearings,” he said.\n\nBut Senator Jim Risch, Republican of Idaho and the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, has shown little interest in scheduling one.\n\n“The president of the United States saved lives, lots of lives,” he said in a recent interview. “We should be commending him, not trying to undercut him.”\n\nThe Constitution gives Congress the authority to declare war, but formal declarations are rare and have not been issued since World War II. Lawmakers have more often passed authorizations for the use of military force against specific targets, but presidents of both parties have asserted broad power to determine how and when to do so.\n\nMany Republicans have argued that Mr. Trump is well within his rights to unilaterally carry out his campaign against drug trafficking into the United States.\n\n“He’s the commander in chief, and he’s got to make the decisions that are in the best interest of the United States to protect the people of the United States,” Mr. Risch said. “He should be commended for what he’s doing against those drug traffickers. He’s saving thousands of kids’ lives.”\n\nOthers called the operation an antiterror campaign that clearly warrants the use of deadly force.\n\n“If the boat had a bunch of terrorists on it — Al Qaeda or ISIS types — we’d blow them up,” Senator Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican and vocal defense hawk, said in September.\n\nThe White House echoed that argument in a notice to Congress last month that stated that the U.S. was engaged in a formal “armed conflict” with members of the criminal organizations labeled by the administration as “unlawful combatants.”\n\nMr. Trump on Thursday called the Latin American drug cartels “the ISIS of the Western Hemisphere.”\n\nEric Schmitt and Julian Barnes contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/25/world/asia/trump-china-trade-deal-xi.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"00:01:15-04:00","title":"Asia, Caught in the Middle, Faces Trump and Xi’s Tug of War","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the escalating geopolitical rivalry between the United States and China, exemplified by President Trump’s visit to Malaysia, where he will meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

Governments across Asia are increasingly being pressured to pick sides. Countries caught in the middle, like Thailand, Singapore and Indonesia, must weigh how to benefit from the competition without being held hostage to it.\n\n“Countries in the region don’t want to be seen as just pawns that the U.S. and P.R.C. can pass over as the two cut deals above their heads,” said Ja Ian Chong, a professor of political science at the National University of Singapore, using the abbreviation for the People’s Republic of China.\n\n“They want agency and would much rather have Washington and Beijing woo them so that they can play both powers off one another,” he added.\n\nThat might have been easier in the past when the United States was more engaged with Asia.

moment of turmoil at home: He has deployed an aircraft carrier to Latin America, cut off trade talks with Canada, razed the East Wing of the White House, cheered on the closure of the federal government and sent the National Guard to several American cities.\n\nBut for the next six days, Mr. Trump is putting down his sledgehammer and embarking on a diplomatic tour, testing his role as a statesman and negotiator as he pursues a trade deal with China to end a dispute that has harmed both economies.\n\nMr. Trump is scheduled to travel through Malaysia, Japan and South Korea before holding a bilateral meeting with Xi Jinping, the president of China, on Thursday just before heading home and greeting trick-or-treaters at the White House. It is unusual for a president to leave the country on a multination tour of the world during a government shutdown.\n\nThe trip is heavy with ceremonial appearances but also negotiations that will have consequences for the global economy. It comes as Asian allies of the United States are reeling from Mr. Trump’s tariff policies and Beijing, Washington’s biggest global economic competitor, has shown no sign of giving up its side of an escalatory trade war.\n\nPreviewing the trip on Friday, senior White House officials said Mr. Trump was expected to strike “tough trade deals” and critical mineral agreements and address actions that China has taken that affect the global economy.\n\nThat Mr. Trump is starting his trip meeting with allies first is symbolic, experts say, but how he emerges from the meeting with Mr. Xi will be consequential.\n\n“These kinds of meetings become metaphors for the U.S.-China trajectory, and the imagery around them and the deals that are done at them become leading indicators of where the world order is going,” said Rush Doshi, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and a professor at Georgetown University.\n\nSince Mr. Trump began his second term, he has added a 55 percent tariff on imports from China, with duties on some goods much higher. Mr. Xi has not been cowed by Mr. Trump’s aggression. The Chinese government has responded with tariffs on American products, including soybeans, resulting in a significant loss of business for American farmers.\n\nChina has also placed new restrictions on exports of rare earth minerals, which angered Mr. Trump to the point that he threatened to not meet with Mr. Xi. The president this week signed a strategic agreement with Australia to invest billions of dollars to develop mineral supplies in hopes of breaking Beijing’s grip on the mining sector.\n\nThis week, the Trump administration offered another telling clue about how it wants to position the president as he heads into that meeting: Officials plan to investigate whether Beijing held up its end of a trade deal signed during Mr. Trump’s first term.\n\nMr. Trump noted this week that the tariff against China was set to rise to 157 percent on Nov. 1, just days after he and Mr. Xi are scheduled to meet. “We don’t want that,” he said, “because it’s not sustainable for them.”\n\nIf Mr. Trump plays the role of an enforcer, using the investigation as leverage, the result could be more tariffs against Chinese goods if he does not get what he wants.\n\n“President Trump has been more restrained on China than many observers expected from him, but if the China meeting does not go well, that could change quickly,” said Justin Logan, the director of defense and foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute. “And he prefers acting on his own instinct in unpredictable ways, so the prospect of something dramatic happening seems higher than normal.”\n\nThe sit-down will be the first face-to-face meeting between the two leaders during Mr. Trump’s second term and the first time they have seen each other since 2019. In recent months, Mr. Trump has lashed out at Mr. Xi over everything from “hostile” trade policies to the Chinese president’s decision to play host to other authoritarians during a lavish military parade.\n\nThe parade last month was attended by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, and it got Mr. Trump’s attention.\n\n“May President Xi and the wonderful people of China have a great and lasting day of celebration,” Mr. Trump wrote on social media. “Please give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un, as you conspire against The United States of America.”\n\nThroughout the week, Mr. Trump appeared to be cycling through a range of emotions before his meeting with Mr. Xi.\n\n“I want to be good to China,” he said on Monday. “I love my relationship with President Xi. We have a great relationship.”\n\nBy Tuesday, Mr. Trump tried to temper expectations about the outcome of the meeting, saying that he thought they would have a “very successful meeting” and that “certainly, there are a lot of people that are waiting for it.”\n\nHe added: “Maybe it won’t happen. Things can happen where, for instance, maybe somebody will say, ‘I don’t want to meet, it’s too nasty.’ But it’s really not nasty, it’s just business.”\n\nOn Thursday, he was back to being sanguine: “I think we’re going to come out very well, and everyone’s going to be very happy.”\n\nMr. Trump said this week that trade would not be the only topic of discussion. He accused China of smuggling fentanyl through Venezuela, whose drug trade Mr. Trump has targeted with a series of legally dubious strikes on vessels in the Caribbean Sea.\n\n“The first question I’m going to be asking him is on fentanyl,” Mr. Trump said.\n\nMatt Duss, the executive vice president at the Center for International Policy, said that should Mr. Trump come away from the meeting with an agreement on curbing fentanyl, a key concern for Americans, it would be a clear win. But he said that other parts of Mr. Trump’s domestic agenda, which are creating a series of conflicts at home, could hurt him.\n\n“The credibility of any U.S. foreign policy initiative, by Trump or any president, is seriously undermined by the U.S.’s own internal political crisis, which the whole world can see,” Mr. Duss said. “By actively deepening that crisis with his blatantly authoritarian moves, Trump is eroding a key source of American strength. He’s essentially throwing away some very important cards.”\n\nAs Mr. Trump travels through Asia, other leaders will be seeking assurances from him that the United States will remain a reliable security partner that can help keep China’s aggression at bay and protect against other looming threats, like an agitated North Korea. (The North Koreans test-fired ballistic missiles a few days before Mr. Trump’s arrival.)\n\n“The region wants to see if the president is committed to a long-term U.S. role — militarily, economically, diplomatically and otherwise — in the region, or if his policy is essentially about commercial deals that benefit the United States,” said Richard Fontaine, the chief executive at the Center for a New American Security, who co-wrote a book about the rise of Chinese power. “As China grows in assertiveness, this is moving from a question to a concern.”\n\nIn Malaysia, Mr. Trump is scheduled to meet with the country’s prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, who has sought a trade deal with Mr. Trump over tariffs. He is also scheduled to preside over a “significant peace agreement,” officials said.\n\nMr. Trump will travel from Kuala Lumpur to Tokyo on Monday and is expected to meet with Sanae Takaichi, who won an election on Tuesday to become Japan’s prime minister. Ms. Takaichi, the first woman to be elected to the role, is a protégée of Shinzo Abe, Japan’s longest-serving prime minister, who was assassinated in 2022.\n\nLike her mentor, Ms. Takaichi has a political outlook that is similar to Mr. Trump’s. She has been hawkish about countering China’s aggression in the region, and has promised to tamp down on immigration and tourism.\n\nWhile Mr. Trump is chasing a deal with China, Ms. Takaichi will be seeking her own assurances from Mr. Trump. His tariff policies have sent shock waves through the Japanese economy and raised concerns about the reliability of American security guarantees in the region. The president will no doubt seek a firm Japanese commitment on an earlier agreement to invest $550 billion into the United States.\n\nR. Nicholas Burns, the top U.S. diplomat in Beijing under President Joseph R. Biden Jr., said that Mr. Trump was right to oppose unfair trade practices by the Chinese against American firms. But he called Mr. Trump’s tariffs on allies — including Japan and South Korea — a “major miscalculation.”\n\n“U.S. tariffs against our allies have made them less inclined to work with us as a united front to push back against the Chinese,” Mr. Burns said.\n\nUnlike during his first term, Mr. Trump has not laid out a clear strategy for dealing with China other than whiplash trade policies.\n\nBut on other matters of importance to U.S. allies in the region, the president has been elusive. For example, Mr. Trump said this week that he did not believe China wanted to invade Taiwan. But senior White House officials did not have a response to how Mr. Trump may respond should Mr. Xi raise the issue of Taiwan’s independence. Officials previewing the trip on Friday stressed that Mr. Trump wanted to keep the discussions focused on trade.\n\n“What’s at stake is nothing less than the Asian economic and security order, both of which President Trump has destabilized with his randomly destructive tariff impositions and calling into question American reliability as a security partner to its allies,” said Kori Schake, a former defense official in the George W. Bush administration who directs foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute.\n\n“Allies are genuinely and rightly concerned Trump is so thirsty for a U.S.-China deal that he’ll trade the security and prosperity of our allies and even our own country to get it.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/us/politics/doj-election-monitors-california-new-jersey.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"00:34:18.007Z","title":"Justice Department Will Monitor Elections in California and New Jersey","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Justice Department has announced it will monitor polling sites in California and New Jersey ahead of the Nov. 4 election, in response to complaints from Republican Party officials about ballot inaccuracies and access to voting infrastructure.

Elections in California and New Jersey\n\nPublished: 2025-10-25T00:34:18.007Z\n\nThe Trump administration said on Friday that the Justice Department will monitor polling sites in California and New Jersey ahead of the Nov. 4 election, amid requests by Republican Party officials in those states.\n\nAlthough election monitoring by the Justice Department is not uncommon, it will likely heighten tensions as voters weigh in on some of the nation’s most closely watched races. President Trump has pushed the Justice Department to pursue parts of his agenda, including going after his political enemies, which has eroded its traditional independence. Mr. Trump also blamed his 2020 election loss on rigged voting, although there was no evidence of widespread voter fraud.\n\nVoter fraud is exceedingly rare, but Mr. Trump and other Republicans have since claimed it is rampant, particularly voting by mail, which is how most Californians vote. Democrats have called the argument a ruse for voter suppression.\n\n“This administration has made no secret of its goal to undermine free and fair elections,” Brandon Richards, a spokesman for Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, said in a statement. “Deploying these federal forces appears to be an intimidation tactic meant for one thing: suppress the vote.”\n\nBoth California and New Jersey are led by Democrats and have key races or issues on the ballot that could affect the balance of power between the parties.\n\nIn New Jersey, Representative Mikie Sherrill, a Democrat, and Jack Ciattarelli, a Republican, are running in a close race to succeed Gov. Phil Murphy.\n\nIn California, Democrats are looking to a ballot measure, Proposition 50, to improve their chances of regaining control of the House in next year’s midterm elections. The measure asks voters to revise California’s congressional districts to favor Democrats in response to recent redistricting measures by Republican-led states such as Texas to favor their party.\n\nThe Justice Department’s announcement followed complaints last weekend by the New Jersey Republican Party that Democratic members of the Board of Elections in Passaic County had blocked the use of security cameras in ballot storage areas and refused to require a sign-in log for workers with access to mail-in ballots.\n\nThen on Monday, the chairwoman of the California Republican Party, Corrin Rankin, wrote to the Justice Department, complaining that the party had received “reports of irregularities” in some counties that they feared “will undermine either the willingness of voters to participate in the election or their confidence in the announced results of the election.”\n\nThe letter asked for monitors to be sent to five counties where, the party asserted, some voters had received incorrect ballots in past elections and where Republicans had raised concerns about the maintenance and accuracy of voter lists.\n\nThe Justice Department said in a news release that personnel from the agency’s Civil Rights Division would be stationed at polling places and offices of registrars of voters “to ensure transparency, ballot security, and compliance with federal law.”\n\nThe department said those workers would coordinate with the local U.S. attorney’s offices, but it did not specify how many observers would be deployed or the types of irregularities they would seek.\n\n“This Department of Justice is committed to upholding the highest standards of election integrity,” Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement. “We will commit the resources necessary to ensure the American people get the fair, free, and transparent elections they deserve.”\n\nCalifornia mails ballots to all registered voters, and most votes are cast by mail, with polling locations where voters can drop their ballots off in person if they prefer not to send them. In last November’s election, 81 percent of voters in California voted by mail, according to the Secretary of State’s office.\n\nDemocrats greeted the announcement with skepticism, saying the move was a politically motivated effort to disrupt consequential votes in November.\n\nShirley Weber, California’s secretary of state, said that the Justice Department provided no justification for deploying monitors “in what is a nonfederal special election.”\n\n“We will not permit tactics masquerading as oversight to erode voter confidence or intimidate Californians,” she said. “Our voters have earned the right to cast their ballots free from surveillance or interference — from anyone.”\n\nThe Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department enforces a range of statutes that protect the right to vote, and election officials say such monitoring has been conducted in the past under both Republican and Democratic administrations.\n\nIn 2022, under the Biden administration, the department monitored compliance with federal voting rights laws in 64 jurisdictions in 24 states for that year’s general election. In 2024, it sent monitors to elections in 86 jurisdictions, including all of the major swing states.\n\nSince 2020, when President Trump falsely claimed that he had lost because Democrats had stolen the election, MAGA Republicans have maintained a relentless focus on voter fraud and have trained election observers to aggressively search for possible irregularities at polling places.\n\nScores of recounts, audits and studies, some conducted by Republicans, in the wake of Mr. Trump’s loss in 2020 turned up no evidence of widespread problems with the vote, nor has any evidence materialized in more recent elections.\n\nNonetheless, in recent months, the Justice Department has sued at least a half-dozen states, including California, demanding detailed voter data, ostensibly to ensure that ineligible voters were being removed from official rosters.\n\nIn California, federal officials said monitors would be stationed in Los Angeles, Orange and Riverside Counties — three of the most heavily populated areas of Southern California — and across Fresno and Kern counties in the Central Valley. The targeted counties represent a population of some 17 million people and include some of the most heavily Latino areas of the state.\n\nDean Logan, the registrar-recorder for Los Angeles County, said in a statement that federal monitors, “like all election observers,” were welcome to observe election activities at designated locations. He added that “the presence of election observers is not unusual and is a standard practice across the country.”\n\nIn New Jersey, Justice Department officials said they would monitor polling in populous and immigrant-heavy Passaic County.\n\n“If there’s nothing to hide or wrong, why the concern in having the DOJ observe the elections departments?” the California Republican Party asked in a social media post on Friday that tagged Mr. Newsom’s office. “Isn’t transparency a good thing that only strengthens trust in our process, system, and government?”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/us/politics/trump-tariffs-canada-reagan-tv-ad-video.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"14:00:16.080Z","title":"Trump Called a Canadian Ad Fake.

It Faithfully Reproduces Reagan’s Words.\n\nPublished: 2025-10-24T14:00:16.080Z\n\nIn calling a halt to trade talks with Canada, President Trump pointed to an ad paid for by the province of Ontario that used a speech made decades ago by President Ronald Reagan. In it, Reagan speaks against tariffs, a tool Mr. Trump has widely deployed, including against Canada, and warns against protectionism.\n\nMr. Trump claimed the ad was fake and that it had been aired “to interfere with the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court,” which is considering a legal challenge to many of his tariffs.\n\nThe advertisement, which the government of Ontario Province purchased to air in the United States, uses several sound bites from a weekly radio address Reagan made in April 1987, though not in the order he said them. Reagan warned Congress not to take broader protectionist action against Japan as he prepared to meet with Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone.\n\nReagan, a Republican, sought to explain why his administration had imposed high tariffs on Japanese semiconductors over what he called unfair trade practices by Tokyo. But he warned against the dangers of broader protectionism. The speech ended with the warning, “Remember, America’s jobs and growth are at stake” — and the ad ends the same way.\n\nSeated at a desk at Camp David, Reagan said: “Now, imposing such tariffs or trade barriers and restrictions of any kind are steps that I am loath to take.” The tariffs his government had imposed on Japan were an example of “certain select cases,” Reagan said, adding that the United States “maintained our basic, long-term commitment to free trade and economic growth.”\n\nReagan, a champion of global free trade throughout his presidency, used much of the five-minute address to warn about the pitfalls of protectionism in general terms. Protectionism, he warned, might have some initial success but would eventually slow domestic innovation and spur retaliation from international trading partners, he said.\n\n“Then the worst happens: Markets shrink and collapse; businesses and industries shut down; and millions of people lose their jobs,” he said.\n\nInvoking the Great Depression, Reagan recalled legislation passed in 1930, known as the Smoot-Hawley tariff, that deepened the economic crisis and slowed recovery.\n\nReagan also used the address to criticize members of Congress calling for protectionist trade legislation that would have required tougher retaliation against countries like Japan. At the time, the U.S. trade deficit with Japan was ballooning, and unions were calling for action against foreign trade violators.\n\nReagan vetoed that trade bill the following year, but was overridden by Congress. He ultimately negotiated and signed into law a less stringent version.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/us/politics/east-wing-trump-power.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"14:02:56-04:00","title":"Amid the Rubble of the East Wing, Lessons in How Trump Exercises Power","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article details the controversial demolition of the East Wing of the White House during President Donald Trump’s second term, portraying it as a symbolic and institutional act of expanding executive power at the expense of historical integrity, transparency, and democratic oversight. The project, which began without formal consultation or legal approval, reflects Trump’s broader philosophy of 'ends justify the means,' where unilateral action, bypassing Congress and institutional review bodies like the National Capital Planning Commission, is prioritized over legal procedures and historical preservation.

The Rose Garden lawn can be replanted, reversing the experiment of turning it into a Mar-a-Lago-style patio.\n\nBut the destruction of the East Wing is different, for two reasons that may explain why the images of giant metal claws ripping down a symbol of American power have struck such a chord in Washington and beyond.\n\nFirst is the permanence of the act — once torn down, it is hard to imagine that the East Wing will ever be recreated. For President Trump, of course, that was the point. He learned that lesson in his New York real estate days, when he was known to bring out the wrecking balls to turn a vision into a fait accompli. Once his $300 million ballroom rises in its place, he may be betting that how it got there will be all but forgotten.\n\nBut perhaps more important, and more telling, is how Mr. Trump went about it: the initial claim that his new ballroom would not be “touching” the White House, and the absence of notice when that changed. Then, the elaborate descriptions by White House officials of the legal loopholes that made it perfectly fine to destroy a wing of the people’s house without consultation about whether Mr. Trump’s 90,000-square-foot ballroom was worth the historical or architectural trade-offs.\n\nFrom the first day of his second term, Mr. Trump has taken an ends-justify-the-means attitude toward his presidency. Consultation and legal approvals are for losers. Winning the election, he has argued, is a license to kill — or to bulldoze. In recent weeks, though, that approach has become more brazen, proving the Washington adage that the most outrageous things that happen in the city take place in plain sight.\n\nIn that regard, the tear-down of what was once the gracious entrance for visitors and attendees of state dinners seemed an all-too-perfect metaphor for Mr. Trump’s approach to expanding presidential power.\n\nIt was striking that, with the machinery still ripping away the last of the structure that two Roosevelts built, Mr. Trump was on the other side of the White House complex declaring that he had little intention of going to Congress to seek authorization for the lethal strikes, of questionable legality, that he has been conducting in waters off Venezuela and Colombia.\n\nOther presidents have sought approval to use military force in ongoing conflicts, a legal nicety that brings Congress into the decision making, as the founders intended, even if the final result is short of a formal declaration of war. Mr. Trump said he saw no need. “I think we are going to kill people that are bringing drugs into our country, OK? We are going to kill them, you know? They are going to be, like, dead.”\n\nIf cutting the size of government is the goal, don’t spend much time worrying about seeking congressional assent to eliminate multibillion-dollar programs Congress created to feed and provide medical care to the world’s poor. Before he dismantled the East Wing, the president did the same to the Education Department and the Voice of America. Americans elected him to get things done, he explained with a shrug, making clear that the lesson from his first term was that bureaucrats, judges and review panels would only frustrate his plans.\n\nHe did the same with the procurement of a new Air Force One, taking a “free” gift from the government of Qatar and then diverting nearly $1 billion in funds for updating the nuclear arsenal, apparently to make the plane airworthy for a president. The new ballroom is free as well — until donors with business before the government seek some consideration.\n\nIt didn’t have to play out this way.\n\nIn the case of the East Wing, Mr. Trump could have followed the example of Harry Truman, who oversaw the complete gutting of the White House in 1948 — driven by the fear that the existing structure might fall down. “The floors pop and the drapes move back and forth,” Mr. Truman wrote to his wife, Bess, in June 1945, adding that he expected to hear the ghosts of Andrew Jackson and Theodore and Franklin Roosevelt arguing. A few years later he discovered that the beams were sagging and the place needed to be torn down or gutted.\n\nBut Truman kept the outer structure, historians note, so that the nation did not have to see the complete dismantlement of the symbol of the state. And he created a commission, made up largely of senators and congressmen, to oversee the process. Taxpayer dollars covered the renovation, which meant it could all be openly debated in Congress. As with most renovations of the seat of power, there was predictable political uproar over the cost and objections, now largely forgotten, to the addition of the Truman Balcony overlooking the South Lawn.\n\nMr. Trump’s early comments suggested that, like Truman, he was sensitive to keeping the White House intact. Whenever he decided that was not possible — the White House has not said when he came to that conclusion — he could have made a persuasive case to the public that the historic value of the East Wing was limited, especially when weighed against the benefits of holding thousand-person celebrations.\n\nAfter all, Lincoln never walked the halls of the East Wing. In his day, that side of the White House was used to pipe fresh spring water into what was then known as the Executive Mansion.\n\nThe original East Wing, built by Theodore Roosevelt as a modest entryway for visitors, was replaced eight decades ago by a utilitarian building that mostly provided cover for Franklin D. Roosevelt’s bomb shelter.\n\n(Today that shelter is the newly expanded, attack-resistant “Presidential Emergency Operations Center,” directly under the East Wing. White House officials, citing security needs, won’t discuss how the construction of the giant ballroom might affect the emergency facility, whose last intense use came after the first attack on Sept. 11, 2001, when Vice President Dick Cheney was hustled into the center.)\n\nBut Mr. Trump didn’t even try to explain the trade-offs, likely because the very discussion might have delayed his goal: to build a ballroom that he could inaugurate, and preside over, before leaving office. He likely anticipated objections from groups like the National Trust for Historic Preservation, whose president and chief executive, Carol Quillen, issued a statement warning that the sheer size of the ballroom violated the concept of the White House grounds from when the building was first envisioned in 1792. It “may also permanently disrupt the carefully balanced classical design of the White House with its two smaller, and lower, East and West Wings,” she wrote.\n\nBut by the time Ms. Quillen issued her objections, the tear-down was well underway, one of the few active federal projects during a government shutdown now stretching into its fourth week.\n\nMr. Trump has heard such objections before, back to the days when he promised to donate friezes on the Bonwit Teller department store to a museum, to clear the way for what became Trump Tower. (The friezes were destroyed as the building came down.)\n\nSo early in his second term he appointed a loyalist, Will Scharf, as chairman of the National Capital Planning Commission, created more than 70 years ago to approve federal construction in the District of Columbia. Mr. Scharf, who also holds a post at the White House, declared at a public hearing on Sept. 4 that the commission only has control over what he called “vertical build,” and not on the demolition that precedes it.\n\n“It is, in fact, the case that this commission does not have jurisdiction and it has long denied that it has jurisdiction over demolition and site preparation work on federal buildings and federal property,” Mr. Scharf said. “What we deal with is essentially construction.”\n\nThe White House has not yet submitted its plans for the ballroom to the commission, which has other Trump appointees who may speed it through. But Mr. Trump has already won his victory. The commission won’t be weighing the ballroom plan against the value of the existing structure; it will be measuring it against a jumbled pile of stone and reinforcement bars.\n\nBy the time Mr. Trump leaves office, the White House will look different. So will the country. He understands, in ways he did not in the first term, that some things in government can be reversed. But some cannot: What the Department of Government Efficiency closed will likely never be reopened, and the ballroom, for better or worse depending on your politics, seems here to stay.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/world/canada/doug-ford-trump-reagan-ad.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"12:05:24-04:00","title":"New Trump-Canada Spat Spotlights ‘Captain Canada,’ the Ontario Premier","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ontario Premier Doug Ford ignited a major political and economic standoff with U.S. President Donald Trump by launching a campaign that used an authentic 1987 audio clip of former President Ronald Reagan criticizing tariffs.

Trump-Canada Spat Spotlights ‘Captain Canada,’ the Ontario Premier\n\nPublished: 2025-10-24T12:05:24-04:00\n\nCaptain Canada is back.\n\nPremier Doug Ford of Ontario, a populist conservative  who has earned the moniker for headline-grabbing moves that get under President Trump’s skin, pulled off another dramatic moment with an anti-tariff ad that used 1987 audio of Ronald Reagan decrying tariffs as destructive.\n\nMr. Trump, in a late-night social media post Thursday, claimed the ad, which was paid for by the province of Ontario and has been broadcast since last week in the United States, was “fraudulent” and announced he was “terminating” trade talks with Canada.\n\nThe audio used in the ad was authentic and minor edits to the five-minute original Reagan radio address to fit the one-minute Ontario commercial did not alter the substance: Mr. Reagan vehemently opposed tariffs. The ad faithfully reproduced quotes from the address, in which Mr. Reagan was highly critical of the economic effect of tariffs. It just placed them in a different order.\n\nIn the address, Mr. Reagan argues that tariffs “hurt every American worker and consumer” over the long run, make companies less competitive, and trigger trade wars that cost Americans jobs.\n\nOn Friday morning, undeterred by Mr. Trump’s wrath, Mr. Ford doubled down: he posted the entire Reagan address, seemingly to push back against any claims that the ad had been fraudulent.\n\nIn his post Mr. Ford said, “Canada and the United States are friends, neighbors and allies. President Ronald Reagan knew that we are stronger together.” His office did not respond to requests for further comment.\n\nPrime Minister Mark Carney of Canada, who is a button-downed former banker and the Liberal Party leader, enjoys a good relationship with the very different Mr. Ford, but has not commented directly about Mr. Trump’s eruption.\n\nMr. Carney on Friday said that American and Canadian officials had been in “detailed, constructive” talks over tariffs on steel, aluminum and energy.\n\n“We stand ready to pick up on those discussions when the Americans are ready,” he added, and repeated a line he uses often when U.S. talks hit a snag: “For months we have stressed the importance of distinguishing things we can control and things we can’t control. We can’t control the trade policy of the United States.”\n\nMr. Carney made the comments on the tarmac in Ottawa as he prepared to take off for Asia where he will attend the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit in Kuala Lumpur. Mr. Trump is also expected to attend.\n\nThe United States has a relatively low average rate of tariffs on Canadian goods, because the levies are not applied to goods covered by the U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement. But it has applied harsh tariffs on goods critical to the Canadian economy that are not covered by the trade agreement: autos, steel, aluminum and lumber.\n\nThe episode over an ad taken out to influence Americans against the U.S. tariffs on Canadian goods — using a former Republican president’s words — was vintage Mr. Ford.\n\nIn presenting the ad campaign at an event on Oct. 16, Mr. Ford said he’d heard the Reagan anti-tariff comments and thought: “Let’s take Ronald Reagan’s words and let’s blast it to the American people.”\n\nIt’s not the first time Mr. Ford has irritated Mr. Trump. In the past he piqued the president’s ire after suggesting that Ontario should cut its electricity exports to New England (which are significant) as a means of pressuring the administration to remove tariffs.\n\nHe ran another ad campaign this year in the United States, albeit a gentler one, using Fox as a platform to highlight to Republican voters just how deep the links between Ontario and the United States run.\n\nAnd when Mr. Trump started repeating that he wanted to annex Canada and make it the 51st state in late 2024 and early 2025, Mr. Ford was the first major figure in Canadian politics to sport a “Canada is not for sale” cap.\n\nOne of his first moves to retaliate against U.S. tariffs was to remove American liquor from the shelves of shops operated by the Liquor Control Board of Ontario, the government-controlled distribution monopoly, which is one of the biggest buyers of American alcohol in the world.\n\nMr. Ford, who in a hot-mic moment earlier this year admitted he had been a Trump supporter before the trade breakdown, has a lot at stake in the protracted  standoff between the United States and Canada.\n\nHis province, the country’s most populous and its economic powerhouse, is home to both the capital of Ottawa and the financial center of Toronto, and is deeply integrated into the U.S. economy. The tariffs are hitting several major economic sectors in Ontario and Mr. Trump’s tariff policies and pressure to move auto production to the United States have cost Ontarians thousands of jobs.\n\nOntario’s automobile industry has suffered two major blows this month linked to  Mr. Trump’s trade policies.\n\nStellantis, the giant automaker, announced that it would move production of a new Jeep model from an idle factory in the Toronto suburb of Brampton to a plant in Illinois. The company shut down the factory in 2023 and laid off its roughly 3,000 workers so that it could retool the facilities, but now the fate of those employees is unclear.\n\nAnd on Tuesday General Motors said it was ending production of its electric van in Ontario, a move that will mean the loss of about 1,200 jobs.\n\nIan Austen contributed reporting from Ottawa, and Ana Swanson from Washington.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/us/politics/trump-deportations-ice.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"21:46:35-04:00","title":"Trump Administration Plans a Shake-Up at ICE to Speed Deportations","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration is planning to replace several senior leaders at Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in an effort to accelerate deportations, driven by frustration over the agency’s failure to meet President Trump’s goal of deporting over one million individuals by the end of his first year.

Shake-Up at ICE to Speed Deportations\n\nPublished: 2025-10-24T21:46:35-04:00\n\nThe Trump administration is drawing up plans for a shake-up at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, with officials looking to replace several senior leaders in field offices across the country, according to three people familiar with the plans.\n\nThe proposal stems from frustration in the White House and the Department of Homeland Security over the pace of deportations, which are lagging behind President Trump’s goal of more than a million by the end of the first year of his second term.\n\nThe people cautioned that the plans, which involve reassigning about a half dozen field office leaders, had not been finalized. The people spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss ideas still under consideration.\n\nThe proposed shake-up illustrates how the administration is still scrambling to satisfy Mr. Trump’s demand to crack down on immigration, an issue at the heart of his political agenda,  even as the president and his top aides have promoted their efforts to secure the border and deport hundreds of thousands of people.\n\nAbigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, would not comment on the plans for a shake-up. But she said in a statement that “the president’s entire team is working in lock step to implement the president’s policy agenda, and the tremendous results from securing the border to deporting criminal illegal aliens speak for themselves.”\n\nThere are more than two dozen field office directors overseeing deportation efforts across the country. Each officer’s region can be expansive, encompassing multiple states or large territories such as Northern California.\n\nThe regional directors have been under pressure to help ICE boost arrests. The agency has already removed its acting director and top deportation officials — twice.\n\n“They are under constant threat; people are ground down; it’s a culture of fear,” said Claire Trickler-McNulty, a former senior ICE official in the Biden administration. “There has been so much shuffling of deck chairs — I can’t imagine anyone even having the ability to take on real challenges.”\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security says that it has deported more than 400,000 people since Mr. Trump took office, and that it expects to deport 600,000 in total by the end of Mr. Trump’s first year in office.\n\nStill, those numbers are slightly misleading. The Trump administration counts people who are turned back at the border and other ports of entry as “deportations,” even though they have never lived inside the United States.\n\nEarlier this year, Stephen Miller, Mr. Trump’s deputy chief of staff, met with senior ICE leaders in Washington and discussed ways to pick up the pace of enforcement. Soon after, he appeared on Fox News and said the agency would try to hit a goal of 3,000 arrests a day.\n\nThe number of arrests shot up after the comments, to more than 2,000 a day. But the arrest numbers have since declined, and ICE has not been able to hit the 3,000 daily arrest figure floated by Mr. Miller.\n\nSince the summer, the agency has typically arrested more than 1,000 people a day.\n\nImmigration arrests conducted by ICE are particularly time intensive. In the past, the agency has taken pride in conducting more targeted operations, going after specific people, rather than huge sweeps that cause panic inside communities and lead to bystanders being picked up, as well. As part of that effort, ICE officials spend extensive time and resources to surveil and arrest migrants, making it difficult to hit the sky-high numbers sought by the White House and Mr. Miller.\n\n“The Trump administration continues to be focused on delivering results and removing violent criminal illegal aliens from this country,” said Tricia McLaughlin, a Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman. “As for personnel, there have been no changes, and we have nothing to announce.”\n\nICE officials declined to comment.\n\nMore than 60,000 migrants are currently in ICE custody, according to agency data, a dramatic increase. ICE received extra funding to ramp up detention and hold more than 100,000 migrants. The annual budget of the agency jumped to $28 billion as part of the domestic policy bill Mr. Trump signed into law earlier this year.\n\nAs ICE arrest numbers have lagged, Border Patrol officials have taken on a larger role in immigration enforcement, in sweeps at big-box stores and in a sprawling operation at an apartment complex in Chicago. ICE efforts, by contrast, typically focus on a single subject at a time.\n\nAlbert Sun contributed reporting from New York.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/polls/nyc-mayoral-election-polls-2025.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"17:38:26.110Z","title":"New York City Mayoral Election 2025: Latest Polls","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the New York City mayoral election approaches, Zohran Mamdani is emerging as the frontrunner, maintaining a double-digit lead in recent polls after Eric Adams announced he would not seek re-election.

member of his administration asked the star of the Netflix reality show “Selling the City,” Eleonora Srugo, to consider sitting on New York City’s Rent Guidelines Board, Ms. Srugo said on Friday.\n\nMs. Srugo, a close friend of Mr. Adams, said she plans on declining the request because she wants to prioritize her television career; she added that the offer had not come directly from the mayor.\n\nBut the move reflects how Mr. Adams could complicate the key pledge of the front-runner to succeed him, Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani, to freeze the rent for stabilized apartments if he becomes mayor.\n\nThe nine-member Rent Guidelines Board votes every year on whether and how much rents can change for nearly one million rent-stabilized units. All of the members are appointed by the mayor, and have terms of between two and four years. They can stay on the board beyond the end of their term, until the mayor appoints a replacement.\n\nSix members of the board are currently serving out terms that expired between 2020 and 2024.\n\nMr. Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for mayor, has said he would “freeze the rent” by appointing members who would not allow increases.\n\nMr. Adams, however, has said that freezing the rent would hurt landlords who need money to keep their buildings in good shape. The mayor, who had been seeking re-election, withdrew from the race last month.\n\nIf Mr. Adams appoints people who, like him, oppose a freeze, Mr. Mamdani would have limited options to reshape the board if he takes office in January.\n\nHe could easily replace the chair, who serves at the pleasure of the mayor. But by law, to remove any other board member, Mr. Mamdani would have to provide a specific cause, and give the member an opportunity to state a rebuttal at a hearing.\n\nIt was not clear on Friday if Ms. Srugo was the only person that had been asked to consider serving on the board.\n\nA spokeswoman for Mr. Adams, Kayla Mamelak Altus, did not say whether the administration had offered Ms. Srugo a seat on the board. But she defended Mr. Adams’s right to do so.\n\n“Just as he inherited appointees from the Rent Guidelines Board when he took office, Mayor Adams has the authority to appoint members to the board,” Ms. Mamelak Altus said on Friday. “The mayor cares deeply about ensuring that his efforts to support working-class New Yorkers and promote the creation of as much affordable housing as possible continue beyond this administration. As with any potential appointments, we would announce them if and when they are final.”\n\nThe possible appointment of Ms. Srugo was reported by The New York Post on Friday.\n\nNew York City’s system of rent stabilization has been a major focus in the mayor’s race, as it has become a significant source of lower-cost housing. The typical monthly cost of a rent-stabilized apartment is about $1,500, compared with around $2,000 for market-rate units, according to the most recent city data.\n\nDuring Mr. Adams’s tenure, the board has raised rents every year, citing the need to compensate landlords for rising costs. When Bill de Blasio was mayor, just before Mr. Adams, the board froze rents on one-year leases three times and allowed only small increases otherwise.\n\nThat was, in part, because some of the board votes came during the coronavirus pandemic, when many renters had lost their jobs and were financially struggling.\n\nMs. Srugo, who was born in Israel and raised by a single mother in New York City, is now one of the top-earning real estate agents in the city. She has spoken openly of how she and her mother had to leave their SoHo loft after a rent increase when she was 20.\n\nThe first season of the show “Selling the City,” which is part of the “Selling Sunset” franchise, aired earlier this year on Netflix, and it hasn’t been renewed for a second season.\n\nMs. Srugo wants to continue working in reality television, she told The New York Times in an interview on Friday, and said that taking on a political role could be seen as “polarizing and uncomfortable” within the entertainment industry.\n\n“I do have a unique perspective and experience, and I would love to consider something like this,” she said of the potential role on the board. “I really love doing my show and I’ve had so much fun with it and I wouldn’t want anything to cause any agita for a board that’s meant to serve the people of New York.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/briefing/us-aircraft-carrier-world-series.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"17:44:35-04:00","title":"The U.S. Is Deploying an Aircraft Carrier to Latin America","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. military is deploying the Gerald R.

To the extent it has any shared self-identity at all, it is that. But the Democratic Party is no longer the party of the working class.\n\nIt doesn’t matter if you define the working class by income, by education or both — Democrats have been losing ground among these voters for years now. In 2024, Donald Trump won both voters making less than $50,000 a year and voters without a college degree. And the way Trump won these voters wasn’t just to rack up a giant majority among the white working class.\n\nFirst in 2020, and then even more so in 2024, Trump made huge gains among working-class Hispanic voters, significant gains among Black voters. Republicans are building the multiracial working-class coalition the Democrats imagined themselves speaking for.\n\nThere are two theories of how Democrats lost the working class and what it might take to win them back. One theory says that Democrats were once economic populists, and they just need to be that again. The other theory says that the working class knows perfectly well that Republicans cut taxes for the rich and Democrats expand health care for the poor. But the working class feels unrepresented by Democrats in a broader way — left behind and looked down upon by a party that moves sharply left on culture, on climate, on guns, on immigration. A party that doesn’t talk like them — and doesn’t like the way they talk.\n\nJared Abbott is the director of the Center for Working-Class Politics. His group has done a huge amount of polling and research on what working-class voters believe and what they want to see in their politicians. Among their findings is what they call the Democratic penalty, which is a force that should scare the hell out of Democrats.\n\nSo I asked him on the show to describe what he’s found and what it would take for Democrats to once again be the party of the working class.\n\nEzra Klein: Jared Abbott, welcome to the show.\n\nJared Abbott: Thanks. Appreciate the invitation.\n\nSo I want to begin with a recent study you all did where you found something you called the Democratic penalty. What was the Democratic penalty, and how did you find it?\n\nWe were interested in this idea that Sherrod Brown couldn’t win in Ohio. It’s like: Oh, my God — if we’re economic populists, and the greatest economic populist holding on in a red state couldn’t continue holding on. What’s going on there?\n\nWe thought — and we had good reason to think — that it was probably a brand identity problem, and we just wanted to look at that in a more scientific way.\n\nSo we had these hypothetical candidates who we gave to Rust Belt voters in this survey. We had some of the candidates say they were Democratic candidates and some say that they were independents. They were all economic populists.\n\nAnd the exact same candidates that had an I versus a D did 10 points better in Michigan, did 15 points better in Ohio. Interestingly, in Pennsylvania, we didn’t see much of a Democratic penalty — that’s something that we’re trying to think more about. But in the other three states — Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin — we see these massive penalties just because of the D next to their name.\n\nSo we were just trying to quantify: How bad, actually, is it just to have the albatross of the D around your neck? And it’s pretty bad, especially in those working-class–heavy Rust Belt states.\n\nWas your study able to figure out what it is about the Democratic Party label that is dragging these candidates so far down?\n\nWell, we did an open-ended blue-sky question about what’s the first thing that comes to mind when you think about the Democratic Party. Maybe you could work somebody up enough to get them to really freak out about the culture war stuff, but is that really top of mind?\n\nAnd so we had these open-ended questions that we asked all the 3,000 people in the survey, and we found that there was a lot of that, of course — some people felt that Democrats were out of touch and focused on the wrong priorities and were woke idiots and all that stuff. There was a good amount of that. But it was completely dominated by concerns about the performance of the Democratic Party — having ideas that they don’t follow through on and not being a party that actually is the party of the working class.\n\nThat tells me, while there’s a huge mix of things going on, and while we can’t ignore the cultural resonance or lack thereof, the Democratic Party, in all kinds of different ways — not just in policies but in affectation and in style — a big part of the story here is also that people just don’t believe that the Democrats are going to deliver on the things that they talk about. And that’s a huge problem.\n\nI was looking into Sherrod Brown’s campaign for a bunch of reasons, and I was looking into the attack ads that his opponent, Bernie Moreno, ran against him.\n\nArchived clip of political ad: Brown backed Biden, voting to let transgender biological men participate in women’s sports, and supported allowing puberty blockers and sex-change surgeries for minor children.\n\nThat attack ad was pure culture war.\n\nBut it seemed to move voters enough that Brown had to put a counter-ad on the air.\n\nArchived clip of political ad: What if I told you all of this was a lie, a complete lie — and Bernie Moreno knows it?\n\nWe can verify the claim that Brown voted to let transgender biological men participate in women’s sports is false.\n\nI’m Sherrod Brown, and I approve this message.\n\nHow do you think about how, on the one hand, what you find in the study is a more diffuse sense that the Democratic Party is ineffective, it’s out of touch, it’s corrupt. But then, when you look at how Moreno — a car dealer owner who had to settle a bunch of wage-theft lawsuits — is actually running against Brown, it’s on the culture side.\n\nYes. I mean, I always go back to Tim Ryan in 2022. He was one of the strongest —\n\nAlso in Ohio, running against JD Vance.\n\nAnd he didn’t just run like a kind of counter, like Sherrod Brown did — he went full bore. There was this one funny ad he had where he was throwing, I don’t know if it was basketballs or baseballs at these little TV screens, and one said: Defund the Police. And he’s like: I’m not doing that!\n\nThe point being that even when Democrats go against the culture war stuff, it doesn’t necessarily help them that much because the Democratic brand is so shot.\n\nIs it an issue that Republicans are weaponizing the culture war against Democrats, and we need to allow our candidates in difficult contexts to understand their voters and what they need to do in order to relate to their own specific electorate? And if that means they need to take positions that progressives would get upset about? Then, yes, so be it. Because we need to win way more seats in order to stop the Republicans.\n\nThis is not a time for our side to mess around. We need to not just win a majority, but if we want to actually do anything that’s going to turn things around for working-class people, we need to have a supermajority, which is unimaginable right now.\n\nThe reality is that, yes: Are these candidates in swing districts going to have to work hard to push back against these caricatures, which are often based on actual things that Democrats — maybe not them, but other Democrats — have done? Yes, many of them are going to have to do that. And we need to give them the room to do that so that we can experiment with all kinds of different populisms out there and figure out which ones work and in which context, and it’s always going to be a case-by-case basis.\n\nI do think it’s worth saying that both Ryan in 2022, and then definitely Brown, overperformed. If every Democrat in the country had run as far ahead of Kamala Harris as Sherrod Brown ran ahead of Kamala Harris, the election would have looked very differently, at least congressionally.\n\nThe connection he had with Ohio, the campaign he ran — it was a strong campaign.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nIt just wasn’t enough to get out of the gravitational pull of the Democratic Party.\n\nEven Dan Osborn — the independent who overperformed even more than Sherrod Brown did — had to make a lot of the same decisions. He’s had platforms around immigration that would be completely anathema to progressives. He said: I’m with Trump on building the wall — he literally said that in his campaign ads.\n\nIn fact, why don’t we play that ad?\n\nArchived clip of political ad: Across Nebraska, people are tired of a corrupt Washington controlled by corporations and billionaires.\n\nDeb Fischer — they love her. Heck, they own her. And that’s exactly why they’re spending millions lying about me.\n\nSocial Security to illegals? Who would be for that? I’m where President Trump is on corruption, China, the border. If Trump needs help building the wall, well, I’m pretty handy.\n\nSo Osborn — arguably the most overperforming candidate in that whole election — runs with neither party and is very economically populist and also runs pretty far right on some other issues.\n\nWhat did you make of that campaign? What are the lessons of it? What should people take from it?\n\nI think it was extremely impressive and encouraging. And it shows that, to the extent possible, the folks who are opposed to Trump and the Republicans, be they Democrats or independents, need to be much more experimental in the way that they handle elections. Maybe not so much in swing states, where it’s going to be a hard sell to get Democrats to not run a candidate in Pennsylvania or something. But in Nebraska, they were able to get the Democrats to just sit it out and allow Osborn to be a real challenger against Fischer.\n\nIf we can find more deep red states like that, we can take on Republicans on their own turf. And I think that’s going to be a huge part of the path forward. Although it’s extremely hard to find candidates like Dan Osborn, who has a very specific profile.\n\nDo you want to describe his profile and where he came from?\n\nHe was a guy who had never really been a Democrat or a Republican. He was sort of a mechanic, and he had been a union leader and had taken out his fellow Kellogg workers on strike a few years before he ran for office. And he’s just this very humble, plain-spoken guy who’s just really compelling as a tribune of the sort of — he embodies all of the economic populists and working-class ideas that he’s putting forth. That’s not an easy combination of features, but I think it’s not unreasonable.\n\nAnd we’re seeing a new crop, Democrats mainly, like Nathan Sage in Iowa, and Graham Platner in Maine, who are all in a similar kind of space of strong economic populists who are completely focused on the cost of living and on the need to center working-class issues and call out economic elites for screwing us over for decades.\n\nThey’re also taking pragmatic positions, to greater or lesser degrees, on issues where their particular electorates are not with progressives. We need to allow them to do that experimentation or we’re not going to be competitive at all nationally. That’s obviously not just a problem for Democrats, but that’s a problem for the future of our democracy.\n\nSo when you look at that Osborn ad, he doesn’t just move right on policies — he actually aligns himself with Trump.\n\n[Chuckles.] Yes.\n\nAnd one reality in a lot of the places that Democrats want to win is that Trump is popular in those places.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nPolitically, if you were just being strategic, does it change how you should talk about Donald Trump? Do they need to be in a different place than most Democrats are on him?\n\nIf I were on that campaign, I would have probably thought that was a smart thing to do. It’s part of the Democratic penalty issue: To the extent that you’re really just vilifying Trump all the time, then you’re kind of signaling you’re a Democrat. [Chuckles.] So they were trying to inoculate Osborn against those attacks because Trump is overwhelmingly popular among the people they’re trying to get to vote for Osborn.\n\nIs that going to change now that Trump is in office, and all the stuff he’s done is pushing our democracy to the brink, and it’s historically a frightening period that we’re now living in?\n\nIs he going to be able to do the same thing? I don’t know. Maybe it has changed now that Trump has had almost a year in office and done some of the damage that he’s done. But at least in 2024, yes, that was definitely rational.\n\nSo one lesson you could take from Osborn is that in states where the Democratic Party is 25 points underwater: Stop running Democrats. Try this independent play.\n\nI guess my question about that — because it definitely makes sense — is whether or not that would work for any length of time. Because if it began to work, but then they’re voting in a more Democratically aligned way once they’re in office, does it just begin to be seen as a scam? It’s maybe something you can do in one or two places, but ultimately you need to figure out a way to rehabilitate the Democratic Party’s brand.\n\nYes. And either you’re successful in doing that, and then the Democratic Party brand somehow incorporates the things that made those independents distinctive, and then we’re in good shape — we’re now the party of the working-class again — or the independent candidates need to continue using that tension to differentiate themselves from the party going forward.\n\nIf I had to guess, I would say that the second outcome is probably more likely. But you’re absolutely right that after a certain amount of time, people are going to notice that, wait a minute, these guys are just Democrats — unless they legitimately break with Democrats —\n\nYes, unless they’re actually not.\n\nYes. And to some degree, they absolutely are going to have to do that. The strategy for doing that, that we as economic populists in my camp would want to see, is breaking with Democrats when it comes to not standing up for workers. But that’s not the only way in which they’re going to do it, obviously.\n\nIs there a case for a worker-oriented third party? People always want to do a third party presidentially, which is very, very hard to do. But you could absolutely imagine some kind of third party that is just running candidates in a couple of congressional districts or Senate races, and if they get in, they begin to be a little voting bloc together.\n\nYes. Well, I’m a little bit traumatized from arcane debates on the left about this question that I’ve had for a long time. But nonetheless, I think that’s a very good possibility. Like, why can’t the Teamsters and the Steelworkers get together and have their own sort of mini-party structure that’s just about union stuff?\n\nYou already have the union caucus in the House, where, though they’re not superimportant in the politics of the chamber, they have a lot of ideological diversity on many different things, but they can come together around core worker issues. And if you had an organization like that being supported by some of the bigger industrial unions, which have a lot of Republican voters in them, then yes, I think that would be valid.\n\nBut I think we need some test cases first. You need to show that an Osborn can actually win, and you need to show that you can do something like this in more places. Once you do, I think it would make a lot of sense for those folks to try to do something like that, to not just have independent candidates but build an independent organization.\n\nI just think it’s something that should emerge organically. I don’t see what benefit we get from just saying: We’re doing this now. Let’s hope people flock to our banner. I think it goes in the other direction.\n\nI want to get at the broader question behind this conversation.\n\nDemocrats have been losing working-class voters steadily for some number of years now. It’s been a decline, decline, decline, and now you see Republicans winning among both noncollege and lower-income voters.\n\nIt didn’t use to be like that. This is a change. This gets called class dealignment — not my favorite term.\n\nVery catchy. [Chuckles.]\n\n[Chuckles.] Yes, very catchy. But talk me through class dealignment. What is it? What’s the story behind it?\n\nThe basic story is that in the ’60s, ’70s and ’80s, the vast majority of working-class people and Americans in general said what they think of the Democratic Party: That’s the party of working people.\n\nMy version of the story, anyway, is that Democrats started to move away from their focus on working-class issues in the 1970s and ’80s with the onset of deregulation.\n\nThen eventually leading into the Clinton years, when he signs NAFTA, which has devastating effects on communities — in different parts of the country — leading to not just job loss but community devastation.\n\nAnd the Democrats — there’s a great paper called “Compensate the Losers” that gets into this. Basically, what they said is: You guys got screwed? OK. But we’re going to do different kinds of redistribution that’s going to make you whole again. We’re not going to necessarily get you good jobs again, we’re not going to necessarily give you the social status that you used to have when you had high paying jobs that you felt good about and that were meaningful in your community, but we’re going to make sure that you have something like a decent education, we’re going to get you some kind of better health care — whatever.\n\nAnd that wasn’t enough. It was not nearly enough to send the tide of stagnating wages and stagnating quality of life.\n\nSo working-class people generally — many of them started to feel betrayed by the Democratic Party. And it was in fits and starts, but then in 2016 the floodgates opened.\n\nObviously that was related to Trump. He was cribbing speeches from Richard Trumka, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. in 2016. If you listen to those speeches, then of course you’re going to hear all the crazy stuff — the xenophobic stuff and all the hate. But you’re also going to hear a lot of stuff that any union organizer would probably find to be right on in terms of the way that both parties have just completely ignored working people.\n\nThat really touched a chord. And it set off dealignment to a much greater extent in 2016, starting with primarily white working-class folks. But then it moved toward Latinos and some Black men in 2020, and then to a much greater extent — roughly half of Latinos voted for Trump in 2024 and a quarter of African American men.\n\nSo now this is a multiracial movement away from the Democratic —\n\nMultiracial working-class coalition — the thing Democrats wanted to build.\n\n[Laughs.] Exactly. The hugely ironic aspect of this is that the Republicans now have that multiracial working-class coalition that the Democrats promised was their permanent majority.\n\nI want to push on a couple of pieces of this story that I always think are complicated.\n\nSo politics is always a choice. Democrats didn’t just lose working-class voters — they went somewhere, right?\n\nThey went to Republicans.\n\nDuring this whole period, Democrats are still the party that wants to raise taxes on rich people. Republicans are still the party that wants to cut them. Democrats are still the party trying to create universal health care — and under Obama, get a hell of a lot closer than we’ve ever been before. Republicans are still the party trying to repeal that, trying to cut Medicaid, which they just did in the Big Beautiful Bill.\n\nRepublicans are voting for these trade bills. George W. Bush is very pro-free trade. Republicans have proposed a lot of these bills. Republicans vote for NAFTA in the House and Senate in very, very high numbers.\n\nThere is this story that I hear — that the Democrats abandoned all of these economic policies. Biden is, I think, probably the most left president on economics of my lifetime. More aggressive on antitrust than any other president since I was born — on labor issues, on everything.\n\nIt is hard for me to tell the story where working-class voters are deciding on economic issues. They want a more populist pro-worker party and the party supporting unions, trying to tax rich people, trying to expand health care benefits, trying to protect Social Security, trying to protect Medicare — all the things we know that are hemorrhaging them year after year to the party doing the reverse on all those things.\n\nHow do you make that add up?\n\nThere are a couple of things. One is the nature of our two-party system. If you’re really pissed off with the party you’ve been voting for for a long time, I guess you could vote for Jill Stein or whatever — the Libertarians. But the vast majority of people are just going to go to the other side. And if they were in a parliamentary system or a multiparty system, maybe they would go somewhere else. But in this case a protest vote against the Democrats is a vote for Republicans. I think that’s a part of the story.\n\nBut I think the much more important part of the story is that economic grievances get picked up on by conservatives. And the way that these economic grievances get transformed into politics is often through culture.\n\nLike, it was: economic elites versus the working class. But then they’re able to transform it into: It’s the liberals. And: It’s the cultural elites against the working class.\n\nIt’s basically the same kind of grievance, and it’s touching on the same underlying issues, but it gets transmuted into cultural grievances. And that was very much facilitated by the Democratic Party by not doing very much to try to actually relate to and be culturally competent in the way that they talk and think about working-class people. They are increasingly a party, during this period, of higher-income people, of well-educated people.\n\nI’m sure you’ve probably played the Schumer clip about western Pennsylvania —\n\nI just talked about it in the episode before this with Suzanne Mettler.\n\nArchival clip of Chuck Schumer: For every blue collar Democrat we will lose in western Pennsylvania, we will pick up two, three moderate Republicans in the suburbs of Philadelphia. And you can repeat that in Ohio and Illinois and Wisconsin.\n\nThat kind of stuff adds up. And Hillary Clinton’s saying “the basket of deplorables” —\n\nArchived clip of Hillary Clinton: You could put half of Trump’s supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables. The racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic, you name it.\n\nOf course, the context was more complicated, whatever — but that was the sound bite, and she said it.\n\nAll the major media institutions and academic institutions of the country used to be kind of nonpartisan. There’s a great book “Polarized by Degrees” by Matt Grossmann and David A. Hopkins about the diploma divide and showing the ways in which media and culture came to be completely dominated by progressives. And a lot of working-class people have just felt really alienated by that.\n\nAll of these things are part of the same bundle. It gets wrapped up in animosity toward elites. And you can’t, it’s very difficult — academics have tried to do this in different kinds of ways — to separate the cultural and economic aspects of it. But I think the reality is that they’re all tied up together to create this toxic Democratic brand.\n\nAnd then Trump comes along, and his affect is something that’s refreshing to a lot of people. He’s not [expletive] people. He’s using ordinary language. He’s cursing. He’s just sort of bombastic. And people are like: Well, at least that seems more authentic to me. On top of that, he’s saying he’s going to bring back manufacturing jobs, and he’s saying he feels our pain.\n\nSo it doesn’t seem to me like as much of a mystery.\n\nYou’ve done a lot of work over the years on how different issue attitudes, different ideas, have changed for the working class and for other social classes in the country. Give me the high level of that. What’s happened over the past 20 years in people’s views?\n\nWell, I think there’s a perception, among at least a lot of progressives, that the working class has gotten so conservative on cultural issues and so on — but that’s not true. Working-class people have gotten more progressive on virtually everything over the last 20 or 30 years. There are some exceptions to that starting to show, especially among Republican men, who are kind of moving away from some progressive positions around gender rights and family issues and L.G.B.T.Q. issues. But generally, yes, you’re seeing clear progressive movement among working-class people.\n\nThe issue is that middle-class people and professionals have just gone way farther in a progressive direction on social and cultural issues over the last few decades than working-class people have. So that’s creating this representation gap where Democrats feel they need to really cater to the more progressive positions of the middle class and of the upper middle class. And that creates this perception that somehow the working class is reactionary. But no, they’ve actually been moving in the same direction — just not to the same degree.\n\nWhen it comes to economic issues, here’s actually a coalitional story that’s really positive potentially for Democrats. Which is that working-class people are quite progressive on many, many, many economic issues, particularly, like I said, the so-called predistributive issues around things like union rights —\n\nCan you describe this predistributive–redistributive divide here for a minute?\n\nAbsolutely. So predistribution is things that affect your bargaining power or your place in the labor market. That’s things like your wage structure, things like your capacity to get benefits or better working conditions, things like pensions, and it’s things that provide jobs for people of different kinds.\n\nAnd then, redistribution is like: OK, well, after the labor market process has occurred, we’re going to take some money from those who are doing really well and we’re going to give it to other people in the form of health care benefits, education, welfare or social insurance.\n\nSo a $15 minimum wage is predistributive.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nAn earned-income tax credit is redistributive.\n\nExactly. And working-class people tend to like those predistributive policies a lot because they tap into values of respect and dignity and status.\n\nIt’s like: I actually care about having a job. You can say that if I lose my job to A.I. or to automation or whatever, then I’m going to get a universal basic income, even a high one. And then many people would say: That’s OK, but like, what am I going to do? I’ve lost my status in society. I don’t have a job. That’s where I found my respect, and that’s where I found my sense of meaning — or at least an important part of meaning in my life.\n\nPredistribution taps into that: maintaining your social status, maintaining your means of providing for your family. Whereas redistribution is often perceived as something that is like a handout. It’s putting people in a vulnerable position in which they feel like they’re the victim of something rather than the agent of their own futures.\n\nSo what would a more full-throated economic platform oriented toward what you found among around working-class attitudes look like? Versus a full-throated, leftward economic platform that is more the college-educated, elite version of that?\n\nI think the full-throated working-class-oriented platform would be something along the lines of strong support for enhanced worker protections and getting stronger union rights. It would be for increasing the minimum wage.\n\nMaybe working-class people wouldn’t be as jazzed about, say, a $20 minimum wage as middle-class people might be, so maybe it’s also a matter of —\n\nBecause working-class people might be more likely to lose jobs?\n\nYes. And they might be more concerned about inflation.\n\nIt would be for potentially even programs that would guarantee a job for people who need one from the government. Although the way that you present that has huge impacts on the way in which people perceive it.\n\nThe way you do it would also have pretty big impacts on that.\n\nAbsolutely. Hugely. In addition to that, things that go beyond where Democrats have been in terms of exerting control. You know, nobody wants to attack small businesses, nobody wants to attack people who are creating good jobs in communities.\n\nBut there are big corporations that are really out of control. And instituting policies, or at least attempting to, that are going to try to reign in some of these excesses in terms of, say, involuntary layoffs of workers — to say: We are going to not give federal contracts to companies that don’t make a commitment to some kind of voluntary package if they’re going to lay off workers — like they do in, say, Germany. That would be really, really important and valuable for working people.\n\nAnd it wouldn’t be something that necessarily cost the government a ton of money. It wouldn’t be something that would be perceived as, like: Oh, my God, we’re going to have this terrible problem with debt if this comes in, like maybe something like Medicare for all would. Which, by the way, is also pretty popular, but it’s also highly polarized.\n\nI’ve done a huge amount of work on health care over the years, and which part of Medicare for all you’re describing matters. Like, if you start talking about abolishing private health insurance and start talking about raising middle class taxes — they couldn’t get single-payer done in Vermont.\n\nExactly. And then of course, there’s a whole bunch of more specific things related to the constituencies within districts. If you’re more of a rural district, then you’re going to be thinking about subsidies of different kinds to help smaller farmers succeed and have more leverage over the big agribusiness firms. You’re going to want to see different sorts of ways of incentivizing job creation of different kinds and job training programs, etc.\n\nAnd then also you’re going to want to defend and expand the most popular and most organically American social insurance programs, like Social Security and Medicare, which are wildly popular among working-class people and everybody else. We can build on those, and we can use those as a foundation for a really robust progressive economic populism.\n\nOn the other hand, a more redistributive populism would be one that’s focused on universal basic income. Or some version of a Green New Deal, which is much more focused around spending lots of money on programs that working-class people may be skeptical are actually going to come back and benefit them in any way. Or on certain types of means-tested social insurance or things like that, which are much easier to vilify and to demonize by Republicans.\n\nLet me get at something else you just touched on quickly. You said: Look, maybe if this were a different kind of system, like parliamentary, multiparty — well, those systems exist.\n\nAnd in every other rich Western country I know of, they have different political parties, different political systems, their leaders made different decisions — Germany was better at protecting manufacturing jobs than we were by a lot — and they have all seen the same class dealignment. They have all seen that class dealignment go forward with the working class moving to the right. It’s not like the German Greens are on top.\n\nAnd so in all these other systems where you had different political leaders, different political parties, different political systems, functionally the same thing happened. Why?\n\nI mean, I think for a lot of the same reasons. There’s this great paper by Peter Hall and Georgina Evans called “Representation Gaps,” where they look at how, just like the Democrats, the center-left parties all throughout Europe moved away from a focus on working-class issues. And it leaves this gap of voters in all of these countries, including in the United States, who don’t really feel like they have a home on either side.\n\nThat opens up the space for populists on the left or the right — but unfortunately for progressives, it’s almost always been much more successful on the right — to come in and take advantage of that feeling of alienation and political homelessness.\n\nThat implies to me something structural is going on that is upstream of the individual political choices that the parties are making. You can think of every country as a kind of political market. And it would make sense that in some political markets — particularly in a two-party political market — one of the parties would make some bad decisions about how to do market fit.\n\nThis is a very neoliberal way to make this argument.\n\n[Klein and Abbott chuckle.]\n\nIt doesn’t make a ton of sense that, in all of these countries simultaneously, none of the parties — no party from center left to left — would realize: Oh, if we just stop being a party of professional, managerial class, cultural elites and start talking about pocketbook issues again, we’ll pick up all these voters and become popular in the way we were in much of the 20th century.\n\nSomebody would have done it, and then the others would have followed along. Either something was pushing them all in this direction or they were all recomposing themselves in the same way.\n\nI think when you see that much similarity across a strategy that is not working out very well, you have to assume there is some reason they’re all ending up in some version of the same strategy.\n\nI think it’s because it was rational to do so, right? I mean, they were winning elections for a long time. Some of the center-left parties in Europe, just like the Democrats — even the Social Democratic Party of Germany — held on longer than I would have expected.\n\nIt’s not like the Democrats are this completely weak party. They almost won the last election. They did win 2020. They’re still a highly competitive party, and they’ve been doing that on this strategy of appealing more to higher educated and higher income voters, and those voters are a larger and larger segment of the population. They’re still a minority and a very significant minority — a smaller minority in a lot of the key swing states. But they thought they could appeal to this coalition, and they were winning elections on the basis of that.\n\nIt wasn’t crazy to think that you could just give all the working class — what they viewed as the working-class — reactionaries over to the right. And then you wouldn’t have to make all these dirty compromises that they felt like Democrats had been making before.\n\nAnd I don’t think that’s crazy logic, because it brought them victory time after time.\n\nIs it a logic or is it a sociology or a political economy or a culture?\n\nIt’s both.\n\nYou mentioned offhandedly, the Grossman and Hopkins book about the diploma divide — “Polarized by Degrees” — which is great.\n\nOne of the parts of it that you were referencing there is: You have this change happening in all these countries. The party on the left is becoming the more highly educated party. At the same time, highly educated people are in control of the media organizations. They’re running banks. They’re running nonprofits. And so you have a more unified elite culture.\n\nThere’s a party that becomes a party of the institutions, and the kinds of people who run institutions set the tone of that party. And slowly the right-wing parties — and particularly the populist-right parties, which are in most cases now eating the right-wing parties — become the anti-institutional party.\n\nOh, absolutely. And these are compounding factors. There’s a shockingly small percentage of Congresspeople who have a working-class background, and a shockingly small percentage of candidates have a working-class background of any kind.\n\nAnd those things reinforce each other. The perception of the party as being elite and out of touch is reinforced by both of those things simultaneously compounding upon each other.\n\nThere’s also this question of affect. One thing human beings are very good at sussing out almost instantly is whether this person is like me in some fuzzy way. It’s how we dress, it’s how we talk and how we look — our haircut, who else we’re around.\n\nYou mentioned that the floodgates on this open up with Trump, who, despite being a billionaire who fires people on television, has a very different affect than Mitt Romney or George W. Bush.\n\nAnd there is something here that I think is actually pretty tricky for Democrats. You talked about how few now have working-class backgrounds. And I find that people are much more comfortable talking about the issue positions — like: If we just need to talk more about capping prescription drug prices, we’re happy to do that — than this other piece, which is, I think, better understood as, fundamentally, representation: Do I see myself in you?\n\nHow do you think about that? What have your studies and surveys shown on that?\n\nYes. I think it’s hugely important. If people are able to be relatable in meaningful ways and talk in terms that working-class people understand and don’t find off-putting — talking about hard work, talking about family, talking about tradition, talking about patriotism. All these are things that Democrats just don’t like to talk about but are things that most Americans find central to their identity.\n\nTo the extent that Democrats are able to talk in those terms and are able to talk like a normal person in their district, it’s hugely important. And we do have some great examples of people who talk like that who are Democrats in the House right now, like Marie Gluesenkamp Perez or Gabe Vasquez or Jared Golden.\n\nThe policy stuff is a separate question, but their affect is one of using more profanity, using more self-deprecation, talking in a way that’s just straightforward. And if they went to a P.T.A. meeting at their school, they wouldn’t be viewed as a snooty middle-class parent. I think that’s hugely important.\n\nThen you have somebody like an Elizabeth Warren, who has all this great stuff but doesn’t have that kind of affect.\n\nI think it’s worth zooming in on Warren for a minute. As a college-educated liberal, I’m a big Elizabeth Warren fan and have been for a long time. And in the way we think about American politics, we group Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders together. They are the left wing of the Senate Democratic Party.\n\nAnd if you look over the years at how they performed in their respective states: Bernie Sanders for a very long time has overperformed the Democratic Party, and Warren underperformed the Democratic Party. She was very, very strong among college-educated liberals and weaker among working-class voters.\n\nAnd I think this shows up a lot: You can have a form of left candidate who is very populist across a lot of measures but doesn’t read as working-class to these voters.\n\nI think if you polled the Harvard faculty on their preferred economic policies, they are extremely far left — in fact, I suspect they’re to the left of the median working-class voter. But they would not do very well in elections in Ohio. There’s something to that.\n\nYes, I think you put your finger on it, in terms of this affectation.\n\nThere’s also a policy aspect to this, which is that it’s really important to remember that working-class people are in favor of a lot of progressive economic policies by overwhelming majorities, but they also care about things that Democrats — progressives, anyway — are more squishy on, like not having a giant deficit or debt. They care a lot about inflation — because working-class people got hit a lot harder by inflation than middle class people did. And they care about economic opportunity and about small businesses thriving.\n\nJust putting out this giant platter of progressive economic policies that are going to signal to voters that you want to dramatically increase government spending in ways that many of them who are extremely skeptical about government in general and haven’t felt much positive coming out of government programs in their lives beyond maybe Social Security or Medicare — they are going to be skeptical of a lot of those programs.\n\nYou also need to think about the types of progressive economic policies that really tap into a working-class voter’s sense of: We need good, stable jobs. We need to have a chance in a middle class lifestyle that our parents had and that we feel slipping away from us. And what are the ways in which government can help to provide opportunities that enable middle-class and working-class families to really thrive?\n\nAs opposed to framing it as: We need to have equality for all different people, and we need to spend all kinds of different money to address different sorts of inequities in society. Those are valid goals and very important from a progressive standpoint, but they don’t connect as well with working-class people. So I think it is partly affect, but it’s also partly the suite of policies you’re giving to working-class voters.\n\nYou’ll notice that a guy like Dan Osborn or Graham Platner — they’re not going out there and promoting the suite of trillions and trillions of dollars of the progressive wish list. They’re doing some of that —\n\nThey’re not Green New Deal candidates.\n\nAbsolutely not.\n\nWhich is to say nothing against the Green New Deal. But that gets to something else interesting that I’ve been thinking about a bit. It’s pretty clear that in 2028, if A.O.C. runs, which I think she’s certainly considering, she’s very likely to inherit the Bernie Sanders lane.\n\nAnd if you look at Sanders and A.O.C. polling, they look actually quite different. Sanders’s last poll I saw was something like +11 in his net favorabilities, and A.O.C. was –4 or –5. So they have a 15-point-ish gap between them. And their policies are not very different at this point. They’re very unified. They’re doing the anti-oligarchy tour together.\n\nBut what they have come to represent in American politics — Bernie Sanders with his mittens, A.O.C. at the Met Gala — reads very differently, completely separate from how unified they are on issues.\n\nWithout a doubt. Although she does have a majority — I don’t know exactly — but she has a huge amount of working-class people in her own district, so we shouldn’t understate —\n\nI think these things overlap with an urban-rural divide that I think is really important.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nSanders comes from a state that is heavily rural, and he codes around that. And he is, like, an old cranky white guy. These things all overlap with each other in weird ways.\n\nBut I think it’s also kind of interesting that Bernie has this positive perception among a lot of working-class people — which again, we shouldn’t overstate — because he’s taken a lot of positions that are very unpopular among a lot of people who are Republicans or independents.\n\nThat said, I think it’s always interesting that he has this popularity despite the fact that he’s such a wonk. He’s always talking about specific numbers and about facts and figures and stuff. And he doesn’t do any of the stuff that I would say would make a lot of sense — talking about anecdotes and just really trying to relate to people on an emotional level. He’s very much like a machine.\n\nAnd yet he’s very popular just because he’s very authentic. And I think that’s something that’s really hard to capture.\n\nI think there’s also a dimension with Bernie that is somewhat unique to him, which is that he’s an antiparty politician.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nHe has traditionally not been a member of the Democratic Party. He caucuses with them but has made a point of running as an independent. And the narrative people have of him — I have always thought this is very overblown, but nevertheless — is that the Democratic Party organized to screw him.\n\nSo going back to the conversation we were having about the Democratic penalty and Dan Osborn running as an independent: There is a way in which Bernie Sanders was functionally doing that in a much more left-wing guise before it was cool.\n\nAnd he maintains, I think, some separation from the broader parties. He is continuously seen as an insurgent challenging and trying to change the Democratic Party — as opposed to a part of it.\n\nAbsolutely. And we need a lot more people who are doing that. Joe Manchin was doing that, right? [Chuckles.]\n\nThere’s no reason you couldn’t have a progressive version of that within the Democratic Party. You don’t have to be a Blue Dog and also say: I’m running as a Democrat, and also, I’m very upset with what the Democratic Party has become and what they’ve represented.\n\nWe need more people like that who are out there tapping into this populist anger — not just economic but also anger at both parties. And I think you can do that as a Democrat to some degree. Because we have all these examples of people doing it and connecting effectively with people in their districts. And I think we need to see a lot more of that if we’re going to do anything to address the Democratic penalty in a lot of these competitive districts.\n\nThere are a lot of ways of running against the Democratic Party. I think people only imagine that the choices are traveling along a line from democratic socialists to Joe Manchin, or farther than Joe Manchin. There’s only moderating, moving left or moving right.\n\nSo first, there’s no one line. There’s a left–right line on economics, on cultural issues, on the system itself.\n\nBernie Sanders is an anti-system figure in a way that other people who share his belief in Medicare for All and share his beliefs on taxation are often not anti-system figures. Bernie Sanders radiates a dislike, a contempt for capitalism and the way it functions and the American government and the way it functions. He really believes it’s corrupt — while some people just don’t.\n\nYou see, in Iowa, Rob Sand is running for governor, and he’s running as a Democrat who just doesn’t like parties — doesn’t really think we should have parties. He’s a moderate, and he’s running against the Democratic brand in a very different way than Bernie Sanders does. You mentioned Jared Golden in Maine, who is pro-tariffs.\n\nYou can run against the Democratic Party from the left. You can run against it from the right. You can run against it as corrupt. You can run against parties as out of touch. There are a million ways to do it.\n\nBut Joe Biden, who had moved quite to the left, was a fundamentally pro-system politician. And Kamala Harris, coming after him, was also a very pro-system politician, even as her voting record was very, very liberal.\n\nI think people mix all this up as one thing, but there are many things, and you can choose to be pointing in different directions on them at the same time.\n\nWithout a doubt. And this idea of being an authentic working-class person who reads as working class also doesn’t necessarily tap into this sort of genuinely populist anti-system mentality.\n\nTim Walz is an interesting example of that. He’s this guy who seems created in a lab to be the liberals’ version of a working-class dude. And he kind of is. He’s got the plaid shirts like me, and he was a coach, and he’s plain-spoken. And he’s a great politician and everything, but listening to his speeches, he doesn’t have that fire — that sort of anger, that Bernie-level: This system is just out of control. It’s corrupt. It needs a fundamental reckoning.\n\nAnd until we have more Democrats who have that kind of feeling about the system, then I don’t think many people are going to take seriously that they really care about making fundamental or really significant changes to the status quo.\n\nKamala Harris talked about there being a couple of corporations that generally play by the rules, but some are doing price gouging — like pharmaceutical companies — and we need to cut down on that. That’s what we call populist lite.\n\nThe strong populism, which we try to test, is: Corporations have been screwing over workers for decades. American workers are the backbone of this society, and we need to do everything we can to focus like a laser on making their quality of life better and for giving them the American dream that they deserve. We need to stop these rapacious corporations from running roughshod over our politics and our economics.\n\nThat kind of messaging that taps into that sense of complete disillusionment with political and economic elites in this country really resonates with working-class people, and I think more Democrats should be doing it.\n\nWe’re talking in New York City right now. What have you thought of Zohran Mamdani?\n\nWell, I think he’s an exciting candidate for New York City. I’ve been on the left for a long time, and I think he represents a maturation of the U.S. left — or at least the New York City left — in that just a couple of years ago, you wouldn’t really imagine a democratic socialist candidate like him being so focused on bread-and-butter economic issues. He might have gotten critiqued for not focusing enough on all the other issues that people in his base would have cared about.\n\nTo that extent, I think it’s positive growth and it shows at least the charisma that he has and the ability to be super-relatable. Those aspects of his campaign are things that Democrats can learn from.\n\nOf course, there are other areas in terms of the context-specific nature of his own political views and the types of economic policies he’s focusing on that you wouldn’t want to generalize beyond places where it would be appropriate to do so.\n\nAnd the extent that people say: Oh, well, Mamdani won in New York, and so that shows that you can go to whichever other place in the country and have whatever views you have, however progressive they may be, on social and cultural issues, and whatever positions you’ve ever taken is not going to be an issue — of course, that’s not true.\n\nI’ve been thinking a lot about how generalizable his media campaign is. Because the thing about New York City is it is soaked in media. It is very digital. It is very easy for candidates to go viral here because they also get attention from outside.\n\nSo the signal that the algorithms are getting is that everybody is interested in Zohran Mamdani. I mean, the number of people who are watching Zohran Mamdani videos is often, if you add a couple of them up, just significantly more than the number of people who are in New York City.\n\nSo there is a dimension where New York City has a tendency to have very media-savvy mayors. Eric Adams — say what you will about him — the guy is a showman. [Laughs.] And I think it was a little bit less true for Bill de Blasio, but it was true for Rudy Giuliani. Donald Trump, who comes out of New York City, is a showman.\n\nAnd so if you look at the people New York City produces, they are great at attention. And it’s not possible to get that much attention in the same way in rural districts in Ohio or in Oklahoma. So you have to do other things, and you have to rely more on paid media.\n\nIt’s not to say that these things have no relevancy — they actually have a lot of relevancy for a national campaign. Presidential candidates are working in that attentional space, too.\n\nYes, without a doubt. But of course he’s going to get vilified like crazy in every swing district, and so his face and everything he said is going to be on TV as the face of everything that’s wrong with the Democratic Party. So we’re going to have to deal with that, as well.\n\nWell, I think that’s a place where the Democratic Party is going to have to get better at being a big tent and knowing how to describe itself as a party that has many different types of candidates and people in it, in a way it has a lot of trouble doing right now.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nAnd that goes in both directions. It goes for Zohran Mamdani on the left, and then it goes for allowing candidates to moderate in places like Nebraska or Kansas or Ohio in a different direction.\n\nThe parties did not use to be nearly as nationally unified as they are now. This is a historical aberration from where we’ve been, and I think this is going to become more important: Can you actually treat that as a strength — not something you’re always explaining away?\n\nAbsolutely. Just like you said, that’s going to have to go in both directions.\n\nThe degree to which progressives in the coalition are willing to say: OK, we have folks here who we don’t agree with on everything, but we recognize that they’re helping to build our bench. And many of them are also great economic populists, so we have things that are commonalities with them. Some of them are not, and that’s OK, too. We need to have the broadest bench we can possibly have.\n\nThen on the other hand, the more Blue Dog or centrist Democrats of different kinds need to be amenable to the fact that the Democratic Party, especially in urban areas, is just very different than it is in the rest of the country. So, yes. Absolutely.\n\nDo you think the problem of the Democratic Party’s bench is that it feeds on itself? The weaker the Democratic Party gets among working-class voters, the weaker it gets in rural areas, the weaker it gets among voters without a college education — it just becomes harder for the Democratic Party to find candidates in those groups. Because there are just fewer of them. And they’re more unusual when you do find them.\n\nIt has often felt to me that the Democratic Party should spend a lot more money on recruitment and talent discovery than it seems to.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nBut I also know that one of the ways that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which runs House recruitment, and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee — they look a lot for which candidates can fund their campaigns.\n\nYes. That’s why you don’t have so many working-class candidates. [Chuckles.]\n\nWhen you begin with a question of where you are going to get the money for the candidacy, then that’s obviously going to point you toward more moneyed candidates.\n\nBut this is a deeper problem than just candidate recruitment — which by the way, I completely agree. There are some states where, say, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. or sometimes even Democrats have candidate training programs directly targeted toward working-class candidates.\n\nNew Jersey is a great example of that. The unions there have a huge amount of working-class and union candidates — like hundreds of them, all around the state — because they’ve had this super-concentrated effort to get union and working-class people into office and running for office. There’s no reason you can’t have programs like that in other states. And having working-class candidates is not the be-all and end-all. But it’s an important part of the story.\n\nI think the deeper issue is just the presence of organization in rural and small town areas. There’s just nothing there. My dad’s family comes from a small town in rural Indiana, and there’s literally no infrastructure of any kind for progressive candidates to emerge, because there are no unions anymore. There are no organizations like civic associations that people can join.\n\nAnd so I actually think that’s a big part of the story: Let’s take some of these billions of dollars that the Democrats spend on paid media every time, and let’s put 10 percent of it into building year-round grass roots organizations in red and purple states — not even the Democratic Party itself, but just civic associations that are doing good work to try to solve community problems. And that’s where some of these candidates can bubble up.\n\nThat’s not a short-term project, obviously. But the hollowing out of civic institutions and of the presence of any kind of associational mechanism that could identify and shepherd those sorts of people toward running for office is, I think, a gigantic problem.\n\nWe just need to invest — well, we’re hardly investing anything in that — and the Democratic Party needs to do that. Unions need to do that. It’s a longer-term project. Otherwise, we’re ceding the vast geographic majority of the country to conservatives and their associations. We don’t need to do that. That’s not inevitable.\n\nThat problem, and the problem of authentic and strong candidate recruitment, I think, go hand in hand.\n\nAs American politics has nationalized, individual candidates are held much more to account for their entire party than used to be the case. So if you were running as a Democrat or as a Republican in 1994, it was easier to run as a very different kind of Democrat or a very different kind of Republican than now, where people say: Yeah, I know you, Sherrod Brown — I’ve known you forever. But I know what the Democratic Party is, too. And you vote for Chuck Schumer as majority leader.\n\nOr the flip: You might run a moderate Larry Hogan, who was governor of Maryland and a popular politician there. But he loses because people know that if he goes to the Senate as a Republican, he will vote for John Thune, and that will empower the Republican Party.\n\nPeople are making a very, very rational calculation there, that the D or R next to someone’s name, particularly if we’re talking about the House or Senate, is more important than their name — by a lot.\n\nBut getting the parties to a point where people feel represented by them, lowering for the Democrats that Democratic penalty in Rust Belt states, is really, really, really important. Because people are weighing the party so heavily in their voting decisions now, the party itself is a brand they kind of like in the places where you actually need to win.\n\nOne question — I think it’s an open one that I don’t really have a great answer to — is: What is the most effective means of changing that brand? Because it’s certainly not going to come from the party leaders saying different stuff. Nobody really listens to them anyway.\n\nI think it’s going to come through these politicians on the ground trying, district by district, to tell a different story about the Democratic Party until we can find a point at which more working-class people in a more diverse array of contexts are willing to take Democrats seriously.\n\nThat means that Democrats need to start winning seats in some of these much more difficult contexts, and they need to start learning how to be more effective at messaging. Is it moderating? Well, sometimes. But it’s also sometimes just taking a progressive position — but talking about it in a way that’s resonant with people.\n\nSo it’s like: OK, well, we want to have a reasonable position on immigration. It doesn’t mean we need to go to Trumpland on this and be dehumanizing and treat immigrants with disdain and all the things that they’re doing.\n\nBut it means we need to say: People who are playing by the rules — who have been here in the United States and contributing to our economy, and they’re a meaningful part of our society — if they’re not criminals, they should have a pathway to citizenship.\n\nThat’s a viewpoint that the vast majority of Americans agree with. And it’s not a conservative position — it’s a progressive position. And so, is that moderation? Well, maybe compared to open borders or something, but it’s still a robustly progressive position. And I think there are a lot of things like that Democrats could do that would both be amenable to people in their coalition who they need to keep on board. And also enable them to message more effectively among people who are very skeptical of Democrats currently.\n\nI think people have gotten way too pessimistic about changing party reputations. We have watched it happen over and over and over again in the past couple of decades.\n\nBill Clinton substantially changed the reputation — whether you think that was for better or for worse — of the Democratic Party. Donald Trump substantially changed the reputation of the Republican Party — changed who votes for it. Barack Obama changed the Democratic Party, in his era at least.\n\nBut what’s the common denominator in all those cases?\n\nParty leadership.\n\nRight. But it’s not going to come from the current party leadership. [Chuckles.]\n\nSo that’s what I was about to say. A thing that is a bit distinctive about the Democratic Party in the past couple of years is: I think, in a strange way, it’s been leaderless.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nBiden ran as a consensus candidate in a very strange year — the pandemic year — and it was just sort of that everybody could agree on him in the Democratic Party. He built this big coalition with the Bernie side of the party, and he was a very coalitional candidate in a way that really decided not to try to reshape what the Democratic Party was. He was trying to bring all the factions in and keep them on board. And by then, he was already very weakened as a communicator and party leader.\n\nAnd then, 2024 is such a strange year, with his dropping out and then the nomination being passed to Kamala Harris, with no primary at all. There’s no time for a party leader to exert control over what the story of the Democratic Party is — where it is going left, where it’s going right, where it’s just changing its position.\n\nSo you’ve had the Democratic Party, I would say, even as it has been very ambitious on policy, it has been in a state of communicative drift at the national level since 2016.\n\nSo then, what the next party leader does in 2028 is going to really matter. And what kind of leader the Democrats pick — is it somebody who is understood as trying to change the party? Somebody understood as representing its current mainstream? — that will really decide what the future of that looks like, at least in the immediate term.\n\nYes. But that’s probably going to depend to some degree on the test cases from 2026. It’s partly why it’s really important to get a lot of these folks out there who are, I think, the more promising candidates to provide these models that we could try to push for in 2028.\n\nI don’t want to speculate about 2028 — I have no idea. But somebody like these candidates who we’re talking about — who are from a Rust Belt state or from a more of a red state and who have this very, very relatable attitude and who are really driving home economic populism and have attitudes that are out of step with the way Democrats would traditionally talk — that’s the kind of candidate that we need. Whether or not we’ll get one, who knows?\n\nI think that’s a good place to end. Always our final question: What are three books you would recommend to the audience?\n\nTo be nerdy, I’ll say a couple that are along the lines of what we’re talking about today.\n\nOne is very similar to the point I was just making, this book by Theda Skocpol and Lainey Newman called “Rust Belt Union Blues,” which talks about the hollowing out of associational life in the Rust Belt and the ways that has affected the move to the right in those areas.\n\nAnother one is this beautiful book that’s a few years old now called “We’re Still Here” by Jennifer Silva, which looks at working-class life in northeast Pennsylvania and shows the utter disillusionment that working-class people have with all institutions and the depth of the problem that we have in trying to rebuild trust in institutions.\n\nAnd then, I guess for something different: I just read a fantastic, tour-de-force history of 500 years of Latin American and U.S. political and economic development by the historian Greg Grandin. It’s called “America, América.” Highly recommend it if you want to get a sense of the ways in which Latin America actually shaped the United States in surprising respects.\n\nJared Abbott, thank you very much.\n\nThank you, Ezra.

Bill Clinton called it “the best perk” of the presidency, surpassing Air Force One and Camp David.\n\nRichard Nixon watched “Patton” in the theater on the eve of the Cambodia invasion. John F. Kennedy, a devoted James Bond fan, went for a second viewing of “From Russia With Love” the day before he was assassinated in Dallas. Francis Ford Coppola stopped by to screen “Apocalypse Now” for Jimmy Carter before the movie’s official premiere at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nNow it is gone, demolished this week along with the rest of the East Wing as part of President Trump’s efforts to construct a $300 million ballroom that could host state dinners and other large events.\n\nA White House spokesperson said on Friday that the movie theater would be modernized and renovated with the rest of the East Wing.\n\nIn remarks to reporters on Wednesday defending the demolition, Mr. Trump was generally dismissive of the East Wing, which was also home to the White House visitor’s office and the office of the first lady.\n\n“It was never thought of as being much,” Mr. Trump said of the East Wing. “It was a very small building.”\n\nConverted from a cloakroom by Franklin Roosevelt in 1942, the White House Family Theater served as a place for the presidential family to view movies, television and sporting events. It was modernized with a new screen and Dolby sound system during the Reagan administration. A remodeling in 2004 overseen by Laura Bush introduced vintage-style red plush chairs, red carpet and gold trim.\n\nIn a system set up by the Kennedy administration, the Motion Picture Association delivered prints of first-run films to both the White House and Camp David at the president’s request. Paul Fischer, the official White House projectionist from 1953 to 1986, kept handwritten notes on the screenings, which later became the basis of the 2003 documentary “All the President’s Movies.”\n\nMr. Clinton saw “The Patriot” twice at the White House. Five years after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, George W. Bush watched “United 93.” Barack Obama hosted cast-and-crew screenings of “Lincoln” and “Selma,” and Mr. Trump watched one of his favorite movies, “Sunset Blvd.,” in the theater.\n\nThe biggest movie buff of them all, however, was Mr. Carter. According to Mr. Fischer, he packed 465 screenings into his single term.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/us/politics/trump-drones-pentagon.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"17:07:59-04:00","title":"Trump’s Son Is Poised to Profit From Pentagon Drone Proposal","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A defense proposal involving autonomous drone ships from Puerto Rico-based Red Cat, using parts from Florida-based Unusual Machines, is gaining traction with the Pentagon.

A team of defense industry start-ups envisions a new fleet of miniaturized, unmanned aircraft carriers stuffed with autonomous killer drones, antiaircraft missiles and torpedoes that will take on just about any enemy at sea.\n\nAnd this group pitching the Pentagon comes with an unusual sweetener: close financial ties to President Trump’s oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., who is positioned to profit considerably if this ambitious but unproven venture succeeds.\n\nThe proposal by the two companies — Puerto Rico-based Red Cat, with drone parts supplied by Unusual Machines, based in Orlando, Fla. — reflects the unprecedented role the president’s sons are playing, not only as supporters of their father’s policies but also as investors in ventures selling to agencies their father controls.\n\nUnusual Machines gave Donald Trump Jr. 200,000 shares of its stock late last year in return for his help as an adviser. The shares are now worth about $2.6 million. Though officials at the company and the Pentagon say Mr. Trump’s son has not reached out to the Defense Department on their behalf, he has relationships with some high-level figures there.\n\nDonald Trump Jr. helped screen candidates for top jobs at the Pentagon on behalf of his father after the election. He is also an important and unusually vocal ally of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, appearing at events with him at least twice this year.\n\nDon Jr., as he is broadly known, through these two defense contractors and others he is investing in, has become part of the famed Beltway military-industrial complex, even as his father is setting policy priorities that are likely to benefit the companies he has invested in.\n\nIn a recent podcast, Donald Trump Jr. acknowledged that as he helped screen potential candidates for Pentagon positions, he pushed to find someone open to investing more money in drones.\n\n“Everyone was like an old F-15 pilot, and that’s incredible,” he said last month on “Triggered With Don Jr.,” his podcast, referring to candidates for top Air Force jobs and the Boeing-made fighter jets he claimed many of them once flew. “But they sort of want to go with what they know, which is, ‘We’re fighter pilots.’ But they are better served with a drone that costs a tiny fraction of that of a plane.”\n\nThe push for a different approach reflects the nature of how warfare is changing, as both sides in the Russia-Ukraine war have relied heavily on drones. Industry analysts have projected that overall spending on commercial drone systems in North America could reach $21 billion in the next five years, up from $11 billion last year.\n\nThe Defense Department, under orders from President Trump, is working to buy drones manufactured with domestic-made parts out of fear that Chinese-made ones might create a national security risk.\n\nDonald Trump Jr., through a spokesman, rejected any suggestion that he had inappropriately used his status as a member of the first family, adding that he had not reached out to any government officials on behalf of companies he has ties to.\n\n“Don is a lifelong businessman and does not interface with the federal government as part of his role with Unusual Machines or any of the other companies he advises or invests in,” said Andy Surabian, the spokesman.\n\nMegan Gorman, who wrote a book examining presidential families and sources of wealth, said work by the adult children of presidents had caused complications before.\n\nTwo of George H.W. Bush’s sons — George W. Bush and Neil M. Bush — were in the oil business when their father was vice president, and Hunter Biden was paid as a consultant when his father was in the vice president’s office. And the son of President Franklin D. Roosevelt had a financial interest in a Boston insurance firm that secured contracts from companies with ties to the government, while working as a White House aide.\n\nBut serving as a paid adviser to a military contractor is a new twist in modern times, said Ms. Gorman, a tax lawyer.\n\n“Don Jr. has pushed the envelope on how presidential children can behave,” she said. “But there are no explicit rules of what they can do, although maybe there should be.”\n\nPresident Trump picked as Army secretary a former venture capitalist named Daniel P. Driscoll, who recently promised to revamp contracting efforts to speed up purchases of drones and other high-tech gear.\n\nDuring a speech this month near the Pentagon before hundreds of Army leaders and industry executives, Mr. Driscoll showed off a drone that the Army had built using motors and four other parts provided by Unusual Machines.\n\n“Across the Army, we will equip soldiers with these kinds of expendable drones that deliver devastating effects at a massive discount,” Mr. Driscoll said. “We are leading the entire United States government to tackle this challenge.”\n\nThat day, the Army’s 101st Airborne Division announced it intended to buy 3,500 drone engines from Unusual Machines — its first major direct order from the Pentagon. The Army indicated it could order another 20,000 parts next year, even though the company started manufacturing its own drone motors in the United States only in recent weeks, an extraordinarily fast turn for a Pentagon start-up.\n\nSome of those drone parts were shown off in February at Mar-a-Lago, the Trump family’s resort in Palm Beach, Fla., during a demonstration for Donald Trump Jr. after he had started work as a company adviser. (The drone flight was cut short by security personnel, because the president was also at the family club at the time.)\n\n“A lot of good feedback on the investor base,” Allan Evans, the chief executive of Unusual Machines, said in an interview, recalling the Mar-a-Lago meeting with Donald Trump Jr.\n\nDonald Trump Jr.’s stock holdings in Unusual Machines are just one example on a growing list of financial ties that Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, the president’s second son, have to companies that are selling products to the federal government or rely on it for regulatory approvals needed to increase their sales.\n\nDonald Trump Jr. is an executive at 1789 Capital, a venture capital firm that has made investments in Firehawk Aerospace, SpaceX and Anduril, each of which have secured Pentagon contracts awarded this year, even as he continues to champion Mr. Hegseth. His nomination to serve as defense secretary was imperiled by a troubled personal life, including paying a woman who accused him of raping her in 2017, though he claimed the encounter was consensual.\n\n“Hegseth was ‘incredibly talented, battle-proven leader,’” Mr. Trump posted on his social media account in January, as questions swirled about Mr. Hegseth’s nomination. He added in a follow-up post, “Confirm @PeteHegseth and Make Our Military Great Again!”\n\nMr. Surabian, the spokesman, said it was ridiculous to suggest Donald Trump Jr.’s support for Mr. Hegseth had anything to do with his work with Unusual Machines.\n\n“It’s bizarre that anyone would even posit that Don’s support for Secretary Hegseth is about anything other than his strong support for his father’s political and policy agenda,” he said.\n\nUnusual Machines and Red Cat are run by Mr. Evans and Jeff Thompson, respectively, two Puerto Rico-based entrepreneurs who have a long history of backing technology-related start-ups.\n\nMr. Thompson, whose previous endeavors included helping run a wireless internet company, is the one proposing a fleet of autonomous ocean vessels that would carry armed drones, missiles and other weapons. The mini drone ships would sell for up to $2 million apiece.\n\n“Basically pure kamikaze,” Mr. Thompson said of the plan for a 16-foot-long version of the craft.\n\nThe weapons would be loaded with explosives like C-4 that blow up as they attack enemy targets. “When you have 800 pounds of C-4 on it,” he said, “you can take out a large ship.”\n\nThe plan is for Unusual Machines to build drone parts in the United States for Red Cat vessels and other more advanced drones that Red Cat plans to sell to the Pentagon.\n\nNone of Red Cat’s marine vessels has been sold to the Pentagon yet, and it is unclear if they will work as promised. But Mr. Thompson already presented his plan to Navy officials at a drone demonstration exercise in Portugal last month, although he would not name the officials with whom he engaged.\n\n“I don’t want to cut off our conversations as a blabbermouth,” Mr. Thompson said. He had similar engagements with the Army, he said. “We talk to people all over the Army, from head to toe,” trying to sell the company’s gear, he said.\n\nUnusual Machines is also pitching its drone parts products despite some questions about its ability to deliver the goods. Until recently, it imported most of its parts from China before it started to put its brand name on devices made by a manufacturer in Ashland, Ohio.\n\nAs of this month, Unusual Machines has only about 50 employees, with about a quarter of them involved in manufacturing at a small warehouse assembly line it has set up in Orlando. The company’s customers, on a website that sells parts under the brand name Rotor Riot, have complained about the quality of some of its devices, an issue Mr. Evans said he was working on.\n\n“Anytime you launch a new part, reliability is lower,” he said.\n\nSeveral of the Unusual Machine parts are certified by the Pentagon as approved for use in military drones, a process called Blue UAS.\n\nMr. Evans said the Army had decided on its own to buy the company’s motors for its new drones, which are intentionally designed to be easy to assemble and cost less than $750 apiece. The Unusual Machines motors, for example, are being sold to the Army for only about $50 each, meaning the entire initial order was worth only about $225,000, the company said — a tiny amount for the Pentagon.\n\nMaj. Jonathon Bless, a public affairs officer in the 101st Airborne based at Fort Campbell, Ky., said in a statement to The New York Times that he could not address why Unusual Machines parts were picked, other than that they met the Army’s requirements.\n\nA spokesman for Secretary Driscoll said the office had no record of him meeting with representatives from Unusual Machines or Red Cat since he was confirmed.\n\nUnusual Machines has close ties to a New York-based investment bank, Dominari Securities, which has headquarters in Trump Tower and recently hired Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump as paid advisers.\n\nDominari was the lead adviser for Unusual Machines during its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange in February 2024, and then with a series of follow-up fund-raising efforts as well as the transfer of brands owned by Red Cat to Unusual Machines.\n\nAs of this spring, Mr. Trump’s two older sons cumulatively owned more than three million shares in Dominari, now worth more than $17 million, and also serve on the company’s advisory board.\n\nDominari, which has grown rapidly since it announced ties to the Trump family, boasted this month that it had raised more than $1.4 billion in capital this year “to support American companies” in sectors such as defense technology.\n\nThat is how Donald Trump Jr. became involved in Unusual Machines, Mr. Evans said.\n\nMr. Trump’s son has not served in the military, but he has said publicly that he is a licensed pilot and has a longtime interest in aviation. The chief executive at Dominari told him about Unusual Machines and then connected him to the company, Mr. Evans said.\n\n“Him joining the advisory board was like Oprah joining Weight Watchers,” Mr. Evans said, referring to the attention Oprah Winfrey gave the weight-loss company a decade ago, when she joined its board. “There’s also a huge awareness and just general association that positions us perhaps to fund managers that are curious because of that and have reached out.”\n\nDonald Trump Jr. made an initial investment in Unusual Machines, and then was given an additional 200,000 shares for his work as an adviser. The day his appointment was announced, the company’s stock nearly doubled, earning Mr. Trump millions of dollars in paper profits.\n\n“The need for drones is obvious,” Mr. Trump said in a statement on the day his appointment was announced. “It is also obvious that we must stop buying Chinese drones and Chinese drone parts.”\n\nMr. Evans said that he had not asked Donald Trump Jr. to help with parts sales to the federal government, and that his role was to provide financial and business advice. Most of Unusual Machines’ sales, he said, would be to other drone makers. That includes Red Cat, which ordered $800,000 worth of parts this month for a new drone it called FANG and hoped to sell to the Pentagon and other government agencies.\n\nThe questions about Donald Trump Jr. and any special favors were a distraction, Mr. Evans said, and missed the value that the company brought, which was onshore drone production.\n\n“People are looking for things that don’t exist,” Mr. Evans said.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/nyregion/mamdani-cuomo-muslim-mayor.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"20:14:51-04:00","title":"Mamdani Says Rivals Are Pushing Hate as Mayor’s Race Enters Last Stretch","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the final stretch of the New York City mayoral race approaches, Zohran Mamdani, the leading Democratic candidate and a Muslim man, is facing a wave of Islamophobic attacks from opponents, including former Governor Andrew Cuomo and Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa.

Enters Last Stretch\n\nPublished: 2025-10-24T20:14:51-04:00\n\nIn the waning days of the New York City mayor’s race, Zohran Mamdani, the front-runner, has faced attacks that he and other Democrats characterize as an Islamophobic-driven effort to paint him as a foreigner and threat to New Yorkers.\n\nMr. Mamdani, in an emotional 10-minute address on Friday, condemned the attacks, emphasizing his Muslim faith and demanding an end to the divisiveness.\n\n“For as long as we have lived, we have known that no matter what anyone says, there are still certain forms of hate that are acceptable in the city,” he said while standing outside a mosque in the Bronx. “Islamophobia is not seen as inexcusable.”\n\nMr. Mamdani said the onslaught of faith- or ethnicity- based attacks from his opponents had intensified, especially from his closest rival, former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who is running as an independent.\n\nDuring an interview with the conservative radio host Sid Rosenberg on Thursday, Mr. Cuomo chuckled when Mr. Rosenberg said Mr. Mamdani would “be cheering” if there were another Sept. 11-style terrorist attack on New York City.\n\n“That’s another problem,” Mr. Cuomo replied.\n\nThe interview came a day after Mr. Cuomo’s campaign released and then quickly deleted an A.I.-generated video that depicted Mr. Mamdani eating rice with his hands, a common practice in the South Asian community that is often used as an insult by the right.\n\nThe video also depicted a Black man putting on a kaffiyeh, a patterned scarf that has become a symbol of the Palestinian resistance movement, before grabbing and stealing items from a store.\n\nSurrounded by members of the Islamic Cultural Center of the Bronx as he spoke on Friday, Mr. Mamdani had tears welling in his eyes as he directly addressed the “Muslims of New York City” and recalled people in his life who had been profoundly affected by anti-Muslim sentiment.\n\nHe cited an aunt who stopped taking the subway after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks because she was too afraid to wear her hijab on the train; a friend who Mr. Mamdani said was pressured to be an informant; and an older male Muslim friend — an “uncle,” as Mr. Mamdani called him — who suggested that he conceal his faith when he first ran for the State Assembly.\n\n“I had not learned the lesson that he had been taught time and again,” Mr. Mamdani said. “It is the lesson that safety could only be found in the shadows of our city. It is in those shadows alone where Muslims could embrace their full identities, and that if we were to emerge from those shadows, that it is in those shadows that we must leave our faith.”\n\nFor his part, Mr. Cuomo spent most of Friday meeting with Orthodox Jewish leaders, as well as officials from two law enforcement unions.\n\nAfter Mr. Mamdani made his comments in the Bronx, Mr. Cuomo hastily arranged his own news conference outside a mosque in Jackson Heights, Queens, Masjid Darul Hidayah. He appeared there with Imam Qazi Qayyoom, founder of the Muhammadi Community & Interfaith Center and a Cuomo supporter.\n\nIn his remarks, Mr. Cuomo accused Mr. Mamdani of being divisive. He argued that Mr. Mamdani’s recollection of his aunt being afraid after Sept. 11 improperly cast all New Yorkers as Islamophobic, and he accused Mr. Mamdani of fostering a climate of antisemitism that made Jews fearful of wearing yarmulkes and the Star of David.\n\n“New Yorkers are not Islamophobic,” the former governor said.\n\nOf his appearance on Mr. Rosenberg’s show, Mr. Cuomo said he did not take the host’s comments seriously.\n\n“I had nothing to do with it,” Mr. Cuomo said, adding: “I could see where, if you took it seriously, it was offensive. I didn’t take it seriously at the time.”\n\nMr. Cuomo is not the only person whose comments about Mr. Mamdani have been criticized as Islamophobic. Representative Elise Stefanik, a Republican and staunch ally of President Trump, called Mr. Mamdani a “jihadist.”\n\nOn Thursday, while endorsing Mr. Cuomo, Mayor Eric Adams said: “New York can’t be Europe, folks,” adding: “You see what’s playing out in other countries because of Islamic extremism.”\n\nAnd at the debate on Wednesday, the last of the campaign, the Republican candidate, Curtis Sliwa, accused Mr. Mamdani of supporting “global jihad,” an accusation Mr. Mamdani firmly rejected.\n\nMr. Sliwa has not retracted the comment, but a spokesman for his campaign seemed to suggest that the remark was not Islamophobic.\n\n“To weaponize accusations of Islamophobia for political gain is wrong and desperate,” said the spokesman, Daniel Kurzyna, “and New Yorkers deserve a campaign based on facts and solutions, not smears.”\n\nImam Khalid Latif, a former Police Department chaplain who is now the executive director of the Islamic Center of New York City, called the attacks by Mr. Cuomo and others, “acts of desperation” with early voting set to start on Saturday. (Election Day is Nov. 4.)\n\n“It’s embarrassing that in a city that has close to one million Muslims, Andrew Cuomo is choosing to yield to tropes,” Imam Latif said in an interview. “It doesn't give any sense that he is qualified to be the mayor of one of the largest and most diverse cities in the world.”\n\nMembers of the Democratic establishment, even some who have not endorsed Mr. Mamdani, on Thursday denounced Mr. Cuomo’s remarks and actions on Mr. Rosenberg’s show. The criticism continued on Friday, as J Street, a liberal, pro-Israel advocacy group, said that the anti-Muslim attitude displayed by those who oppose Mr. Mamdani “endangers us all.”\n\n“While we may disagree with Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani and other candidates on issues related to Israel and Palestine, there is one point on which we are united: Laughing along as a Muslim candidate is smeared as a potential terrorist sympathizer fuels fear, division and Islamophobia,” according to a statement from the group’s president, Jeremy Ben-Ami. “Jewish leaders and public figures should be condemning such bigotry, not amplifying it.”\n\nThe blowback came at a critical time for Mr. Cuomo, who is trying to find a way to close what polls suggest is a large gap between him and Mr. Mamdani.\n\nThe former governor had received good reviews for his performance at the debate on Wednesday, and had hoped that Mr. Adams’s endorsement would provide a boost in the campaign’s final stretch.\n\nBut by Friday, Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Mamdani were going back-and-forth on the former governor’s choice of campaign rhetoric.\n\n“There are 12 days remaining until Election Day,” Mr. Mamdani said in the Bronx. “I will be a Muslim man in New York City each of those 12 days, and every day that follows after that. I will not change who I am, how I eat or the faith that I am proud to call my own.”\n\nHe then turned and, without taking questions from reporters, walked into the mosque to speak to those who had gathered for Friday prayers.\n\nMichael Gold contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/nyregion/nba-mafia-rigged-poker-games.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"14:50:17-04:00","title":"Texas Cheat ’Em?

U.S. Details How Mob Lured High Rollers Into Poker Trap\n\nPublished: 2025-10-24T14:50:17-04:00\n\nThe squat, brick building on Lexington Avenue in Manhattan looked like any other on the block, with no hint of the elaborate trap within.\n\nIn the summer of 2023, a man — we’ll call him, as prosecutors do, John Doe #1 — walked into the building and sat down at an invitation-only, backroom poker table.\n\nThe game was Texas hold ’em. The stakes were high. Standing by was a security guard known as Albanian Bruce or, alternately and more tellingly, Big Bruce.\n\nOther players joined. John Doe #1 believed he had as good a chance as any of them.\n\nThe others, as described by federal prosecutors in Brooklyn in a case unsealed on Thursday, knew better. They were not just card players. Sometimes, retired N.B.A. players were at the table — “face cards” there to attract high rollers. Others included members and associates of the Gambino and Lucchese organized crime families, old-school crews sitting down to a cutting-edge hustle.\n\nWhen the dealer ran decks of cards through a shuffling machine, the trap was set.\n\nThis was no ordinary shuffling machine, according to the indictment. It contained hidden technology that read the cards in the deck and instantly predicted which player would be dealt the best hand, prosecutors said.\n\nThat information was transmitted outside the building to someone known as the operator. The operator, in turn, alerted a player at the table who was in on the scheme — “the quarterback” or “the driver.” Finally, that player told his comrades what was about to happen, prosecutors said, through a system of secret signals. The signals included touching certain poker chips to communicate different outcomes while appearing to be harmlessly fidgeting.\n\nThe players at the table could essentially see the future and know who would win a poker game before a hand had even been dealt.\n\nJohn Doe #1 had no way of knowing that he was doomed by split-second bursts of electronic data, enmeshed in a cross-country criminal enterprise. No way of knowing how many John Does would line up behind him.\n\nThe rigged poker games were played from Miami to East Hampton, N.Y., to Las Vegas, prosecutors said. The Manhattan games took place in the anonymity of the Lexington Avenue building and, further downtown, in a stately, 19th-century Greenwich Village townhouse on Washington Place once owned by the American composer John Philip Sousa.\n\nTwo basketball players — face cards — named in the indictment are Chauncey Billups, now the Portland Trail Blazers’ head coach, and Damon Jones, who played in the N.B.A. from 1998 to 2009 and was later an assistant coach.\n\nHigh rollers and retired athletes weren’t the only ones at the New York games. To provide protection and ensure that debts were paid, the indictment says, gangsters stepped up with threats and extortion. Members of the five longstanding organized crime families kept an eye on Lexington Avenue (Bonanno) and Washington Place (Gambino) for a price.\n\nJohn Doe #1 played cards. John Doe #1 kept losing. The shuffling machine did its work.\n\nThere were other gadgets.\n\nA tray for poker chips was equipped with secret cameras for reading cards. Prosecutors described “an X-ray table” that could read cards that were face down. And some players involved in the scheme wore special sunglasses or contact lenses that revealed otherwise invisible markings on the backs of cards.\n\nThe gadgets were brought from out of state, prosecutors said. Men from Georgia, Pennsylvania, Texas and Kentucky were named in the indictment and accused of providing the cheating technology. The nerdy side of the operation could also get rough: One shuffling machine was stolen at gunpoint, prosecutors said. The victim was John Doe #7.\n\nAll of this planning, technology and manpower led to the end game, in these quiet rooms in Manhattan. Those passing by would never suspect anything so interesting.\n\n“You don’t really hear a lot of big news coming out of this area,” said Larry Waterhouse, 26, who works in the financial industry, who passed by the Lexington Avenue building on Thursday.\n\nTo some in the Village, where the Washington Place townhouse stands beside anything-goes Washington Square Park, a multimillion-dollar, rigged poker game was just another thing to shrug about.\n\n“There’s some guy who just spilled four bottles of beer on the street just now,” said Travis Hawkins, a 42-year-old personal trainer. “Last week, there was an Amazon guy here, and I had to scare off some other guy who was trying to steal the Amazon boxes out of his cart.”\n\nAt the center of many of the charges in the indictment is a New Yorker, a Brooklyn man named Ammar Awawdeh, 34, known to others, without explanation, as Flapper Poker and Flappy.\n\nThis is not Mr. Awawdeh’s first arrest. In 2018, he was charged with stealing over $1 million from a homeless woman.\n\nThe woman, Michelle Carter, had been gravely injured when she was run over by an F train, losing both her legs. She sued the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and settled the lawsuit for $4 million, which was to be delivered in installments.\n\nAt the time, Mr. Awawdeh worked at a bodega on Roosevelt Island alongside his father. Ms. Carter had no bank account, so she gave Mr. Awawdeh, a friend, a $799,036.95 check from the authority to use as credit so she could buy cartons of cigarettes from the bodega and resell them.\n\nMr. Awawdeh stole the money to pay for a bachelor party in Las Vegas, his wedding and a honeymoon in the Turks and Caicos Islands, prosecutors said. He pleaded guilty to a money-laundering charge and was sentenced to probation.\n\nBefore he got married, he lived with his family in the upstairs apartment of a brick house in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn, far from the games he is accused of organizing in Manhattan. The house was quiet on Friday.\n\nThe criminal enterprise that included mobsters, basketball players and a former bodega worker took in some $7 million from a deep bench of John Does, prosecutors said.\n\nIn June and July 2023, John Doe #1 played hand after hand in that Lexington Avenue building with the shuffling machine, and he lost and lost — in the end, $1.8 million.\n\nMatthew Haag, Kaja Andric, Callum Foote and Olivia Bensimon contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/25/health/insecticide-treated-baby-wraps-carriers-malaria.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"00:01:05-04:00","title":"In Fight Against Malaria, an Unexpected — and Snuggly — Shield","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A new study led by Dr. Ross Boyce and Dr. Edgar Mulogo in Kasese, Uganda, found that treating baby wraps with permethrin reduced malaria infections in young children by 66%, with only 16% of children in the treated group developing malaria over six months compared to 34% in the control group.

American medical resident in a global health program in Uganda 12 years ago, Dr. Ross Boyce saw the devastating toll of malaria firsthand. About half of the patients he saw in a rural clinic had the disease. Most were very young children; many recovered with treatment, but some did not survive.\n\nDr. Boyce noticed something else: All of the Ugandan mothers carried their babies tied on their backs with a wide piece of cotton. And this made him think about the clothing he wore long before medical school, when he was deployed to Iraq as an infantry officer: the U.S. military treated his uniforms with permethrin, a long-acting insecticide, to protect against mosquito-borne illnesses.\n\nDr. Boyce floated an idea among his Ugandan colleagues: Could they treat baby wraps in insecticides too? Might that keep mosquitoes away from babies?\n\nOne colleague thought it was worth a try. They needed new solutions, said Dr. Edgar Mulogo, a professor of public health at Mbarara University of Science and Technology, because progress against malaria had stalled.\n\nThe remarkable results of that brainstorming session were published recently in one of the world’s top medical journals.\n\nDr. Boyce, today an expert on the epidemiology of malaria, Dr. Mulogo and their colleagues carried out a large, randomized clinical trial in Kasese, Uganda, where Dr. Boyce helped treat so many malaria patients back in 2013. Two hundred women were given fabric treated with permethrin in which to carry their babies, and 200 women in a control group were given wraps without the repellent.\n\nThe treated baby wraps dramatically reduced malaria infections in the young children carried in them. There were 66 percent fewer cases among those children compared with babies in the untreated wraps. By the end of the six-month study, only 16 percent of children in the treated wrap group had been sick with malaria, compared with 34 percent in the untreated wrap group, many of whom had multiple malaria episodes.\n\nAfter declining to a record global low in 2015, malaria cases and deaths — most of them in children under 5 — have been rising. The disease killed more than 600,000 people last year.\n\nA big part of the drop in cases had been achieved through the widespread distribution of insecticide-treated bed nets across sub-Saharan Africa, and spraying houses with insecticides.\n\nBut those chemicals no longer kill mosquitoes, which have evolved to survive them. .\n\nThe baby wraps were treated with permethrin, a repellent used for decades; globally, 90 percent of mosquitoes are resistant to its killing effect. “But that wasn’t the goal, to kill every mosquito — the goal was to keep the mosquitoes away from that immediate area around the child,” Dr. Boyce said.\n\nHe was not sure if the repellent on the wrap would simply encourage the mosquitoes to fly up to bite a baby’s head, which pokes out at the top of the wrap. Instead, it prevented most biting.\n\nThe treated baby wraps addressed another new challenge in the fight against malaria: Today, more mosquitoes are biting people outside and during the day — times when a bed net offers no protection.\n\nThe danger of daytime biting was clear in the baby wraps study because all families in both groups also received new insecticide-treated bed nets. They reported using them more than 99 percent of nights. But, Dr. Mulogo said, they were still getting malaria.\n\nVaccines against malaria are slowly being rolled out to communities across Africa. But the first dose of the vaccine isn’t given until children are 5 months old, and they must get three more over the next 18 months to have full protection. By that point, most children in Kasese have had a couple of malaria infections. The disease is most often lethal in children between 6 and 18 months of age.\n\nThe baby wraps, on the other hand, are used from the time a child is born. “Think about this as like a bridge: you’re protecting the kid while they’re getting to that optimal vaccine-reduced protection,” said Dr. Boyce, who is an associate professor at the Institute for Global Health and Infectious Diseases at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\nThe baby wrap method has been tested in only this one trial, but it cut malaria cases by a greater margin that the vaccines have in some studies.\n\n“I love this: The result is better than the vaccine, for a fraction of the cost, and you don’t have issues of cold chain and manufacturing, and it’s so much easier to implement,” said Dr. Marta Maia, a medical entomologist and associate professor at the KEMRI Wellcome Trust in Kenya, who was not involved in the research.\n\n“And you don’t have to convince people they need it,” she added. “It takes into account the local practices, that people are already wearing their babies and laying them to sleep in the same cloth.”\n\nDr. Mulogo believes that the most valuable thing about the intervention may be its simplicity. Malaria prevention research often focuses on technological interventions — multiple projects across Africa are trying to genetically modify mosquitoes, for example — but affordable, highly effective solutions may lie closer to home, he said.\n\nStill, there are two major concerns about the insecticide-treated baby wrap idea. The first is the long-term exposure of babies and mothers to the chemicals in the insecticide. In the study, some mothers who received treated wraps reported rashes on their babies’ skin — but not significantly more than rashes reported in the placebo group. Permethrin is poorly absorbed through intact skin.\n\nThe second challenge is how to keep the baby wrap dosed with sufficient insecticide when women wash it regularly. In the study, the mothers brought the fabric back to the clinic each month to have it retreated (those in the control group were treated with plain water). The question is how to maintain that level of coverage for a product that may be sold in markets and used outside a research context.\n\nIn commercial production, the chemicals could be bonded to the textiles in a manufacturing process similar to that for bed nets, producing a wrap where repellent lasts a year or more.\n\nThe researchers now hope to test the idea on school uniforms. It’s common for children in a place such as Kasese to have just one or two sets of school clothing, and to wear those clothes all day long. So treating them might protect older children from malaria, too.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/world/asia/queen-sirikit-thailand-dead.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"19:08:50-04:00","title":"Sirikit, Thailand’s Former Queen, Is Dead at 93","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Queen Sirikit Kitiyakara, Thailand’s longest-serving queen consort and widow of King Bhumibol Adulyadej, died at 93 in Bangkok, reportedly due to complications from blood sepsis.

Bhumibol Adulyadej, whose portraits appeared together for decades in houses and shops around the country, died on Friday night in a hospital in Bangkok, according to a statement from the royal palace. She was 93.\n\nThe palace statement gave the cause of death as complications from blood sepsis. The former queen had rarely appeared in public since she had a debilitating stroke in 2012.\n\nKing Bhumibol, the world’s longest-serving head of state, died in 2016, and was succeeded by the couple’s son, King Maha Vajiralongkorn.\n\nIn Thailand, Sirikit was known as Queen Mother. Born into royalty as the daughter of a prince, she met the young King Bhumibol as a teenager when she was living in France, where her father was the Thai ambassador. They married on April 28, 1950, when she was 18, a week before his coronation on May 5.\n\nHe was crowned as Rama IX of the Chakri Dynasty, and she received the royal title Somdet Phra Nang Chao Sirikit Phra Borommarachininat; she was widely believed to be the world’s longest-serving queen consort. Queen Sirikit had three daughters in addition to their son.\n\nA glamorous young couple, the king and queen traveled often in the 1960s to the United States and dozens of countries in Europe and Asia, where she charmed both government leaders and the public with her elegance, vivaciousness and winning smile. In both Western dress and Thai silks, she topped the International Best-Dressed List — a prestigious annual ranking of the world’s most stylish figures — four times in the 1960s.\n\nQueen Sirikit often accompanied her husband as he traveled around Thailand, too, visiting hundreds of development projects that he fostered. She made other trips on her own, promoting Thai handicrafts and establishing the Support Foundation to help rural women produce and market products like woven goods.\n\nShe also worked to support Buddhist groups and organizations in southern Thailand during a long-running Muslim separatist insurgency.\n\nIn the 1980s, Queen Sirikit was often ill, apparently from depression or a nervous disorder, and at one point she disappeared from public view for several months. Her daughter Princess Chulabhorn said in 1986 that her mother was an insomniac and suffered from exhaustion.\n\nThe queen offered her view of the role of Thai monarchy in a rare interview with the BBC in 1980.\n\n“Kings and queens of Thailand have always been in close contact with the people,” she said, “and they usually regard the king as the father of the nation. That is why we do not have much private life, because we are considered father and mother of the nation.”\n\nShe said that she and the king reciprocated this adoration with their own devotion to duty.\n\n“To give, not to take, only to give; to love, so that is the reason my husband and I can work, year after year, day after day,” she said in the BBC interview. “We have been ill. But we know that when it is time to die nobody can escape.”\n\nAlthough Thailand’s constitutional monarchy has no direct political power, it wields enormous influence. As the years passed, Queen Sirikit became more politically active and acquired her own power base. Members of the Queen’s guard hold powerful positions in the armed forces.\n\nAs the nation entered a period of violent divisions between the elite establishment and a largely rural underclass in the early 2000s, she expressed sympathy for royalist demonstrators by offering financial assistance to those injured in clashes with the police. In a highly symbolic gesture in 2008, she attended the funeral of someone killed in the protests.\n\nSirikit Kitiyakara was born on Aug. 12, 1932, the second child of Prince Nakkhatra Mangkala Kitiyakara and Mom Luang Bua Snidvongs, an actress and royal courtier.\n\nShe spent her teenage years in Britain and France, and met the young King Bhumibol while he was studying in Switzerland, just before he was returning to Thailand for his formal coronation.\n\nHe had become king in 1946 after the death of his older brother, Ananda Mahidol, but coronation ceremonies were postponed until 1950 so that he could complete his education.\n\nIn her interview with the BBC, Queen Sirikit seemed ebullient in describing their meeting.\n\n“It was hate at first sight,” she said, “because he said he would arrive at four o’clock in the afternoon. He arrived at seven o’clock, kept me standing there, practicing curtsy and curtsy.”\n\nThe next time they met it was love. “I didn’t know that he loved me,” she said, “because at the time I was only 15 years old, and planned to be a concert pianist.”\n\nShe added: “I thought of being with the man I love only. Not of the duty, and the burden of queen.”\n\nThe catalyst for their romance was an auto accident in October 1948, when the king crashed his sports car into the back of a truck on a road outside Lausanne, Switzerland, leaving him with cuts on his face and losing most of his sight in one eye.\n\nSirikit visited him frequently at the hospital, then enrolled in a local academy to be near him.\n\nThey were secretly engaged in July 1949, followed by a formal announcement at her 17th birthday party the next month in London. After the wedding and coronation in Bangkok the next year, the couple traveled back to Switzerland to continue their studies, then returned to Bangkok in 1951 to take up their royal duties.\n\nIn addition to her son, Sirikit is survived by her three daughters and a sister, Busba Kitiyakara Sathanapong.\n\nThe eldest of her children is Princess Ubol Ratana, who graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, married an American, Peter Ladd Jensen, and spent many years with him, mostly in California. The couple separated and she resumed her royal duties in 2006.\n\nThe second daughter is Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn, who never married and devoted herself to studying the arts and helping her father with his many projects.\n\nThe youngest, Princess Chulabhorn, has a degree in organic chemistry and is married to a Thai commoner.\n\nSirikit’s birthday is celebrated as Mother’s Day in Thailand, a national holiday.\n\nMuktita Suhartono and Sui-Lee Wee contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/world/europe/spain-picasso-missing.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"16:00:38-04:00","title":"A Missing Picasso Is Found, and a Small Spanish Town Loses Its Air of Mystery","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A missing Picasso artwork, 'Still Life With Guitar,' from 1919, was thought to have gone missing during a delivery to a museum in Granada, Spain.

It’s the Last One Entirely in Human Hands.\n\nPublished: 2025-10-24T05:02:44-04:00\n\nOn Friday, when the home plate umpire calls the first pitch of the 2025 World Series, savor it. This will be the last championship to be fully adjudicated by human beings.\n\nThe Automated Ball-Strike (A.B.S.) challenge system, known informally as the robot ump, is coming to your local major league ballpark on Opening Day in 2026. While human umpires will still call balls and strikes, the A.B.S. will allow teams to dispute calls, with the final judgment going to the computerized system.\n\nProgress compels us to embrace technological accuracy and precision, promising a perfected version of what is to my mind the perfect sport. But baseball is a game of bad calls, bad luck, bad bounces, meteorological whim and unforeseen happenstance — all part of what makes it so perfect.\n\nIn a game where the best hitters fail two-thirds of the time, why should we expect umpires or outcomes to be perfect? The robot ump is the game’s attempt to limit deviations in strike zone calls — to always get things right. But baseball nurtures the expectation of the extraordinary, the deviations from the mean, and specializes in the delivery of it. What we remember, what we love, is Willie Mays, back turned to the infield, catching up to a ball hit over his head to the deepest recesses of the Polo Grounds. It’s Derek Jeter, bolting across the infield grass in Oakland to intercept a throw from the right-fielder and flipping the ball backhanded to his catcher in time to get the runner at the plate.\n\nIt’s not just the artistic anomalies that entrance us. Baseball is enlivened by its mistakes, its miscues, its mental lapses. Three days after Mookie Betts, the Dodgers shortstop, brilliantly thwarted a bunt by setting a defensive wheel play in motion with perfect timing, the Phillies relief pitcher Orion Kerkering fielded a comebacker and his synapses snapped. In the game’s final play, he hurled the ball high and wide over his catcher’s head rather than taking an easy inning-ending out at first base. Agony is also memorable.\n\nWhen I asked Morgan Sword, M.L.B.’s executive vice president of baseball operations, about the possible implementation of fully automated balls and strikes, he told me many league executives were surprised by a loud negative response from the players. I wasn’t. In dugouts and front offices, I’ve heard the same lament, as players speak up for the human element of the game.\n\n“We live in the era of the glorification of, ‘We can explain everything,’” Mr. Sword said wistfully. But baseball is inherently, mercifully, unsuited to that level of explication. Remember the midges that attacked Cleveland in 2007? Or the pebble in the infield dirt at Griffith Stadium that diverted two ground balls and made the Washington Senators 1924 world champions? Ballplayers know that control is an illusion.\n\n“Our game is unpredictable in a good way,” the former Yankee manager Joe Torre told me. “The unexpected happens.”\n\nA.B.S. has been tested since 2019, and the decision to implement it in the majors was inevitable. Technology creates its own imperative. If you build it, they will use it. Personally, I don’t mind the challenge system that will be introduced next year, which gives each team two chances per nine innings to ask for an automated second guess. But I fear a future in which baseball goes full robot-ump and the human element is further degraded. It will certainly be tricky for umpires to align the new computer-generated strike zone with their own judgment-based strike zone. Traditionally, the by-the-book definition of a strike zone is from the midpoint between a player’s shoulders and the top of his uniform pants to just beneath his kneecap — a decidedly unscientific designation, given to flexible interpretation.\n\nThe A.B.S. strike zone will be defined by a player’s official major league height as measured in spring training. The top of the zone will be set at 53.5 percent of a batter’s height and the bottom at 27 percent of his height. Players of equal height will have the essentially the same strike zone, no matter how they stand in the batter’s box or alter their stance from pitch to pitch. Let’s see: what is 53.5 percent of Giancarlo Stanton?\n\nMy personal data diva, Anette Hosoi, co-founder of the M.I.T. Sports Lab and professor of engineering and mathematics, had this to say: “The ability to adjust to nonuniformity is what great players do. The robo-umps are not more perfect. They are more accurate. The human judgment of umpires is not something that you should discard lightly. If we’re perfect all the time, the game becomes boring.” I asked her: “You mean the less perfect result makes for a better game?” And she said, “Yes.”\n\nFormer umpire Jim Joyce knows about this: He was the first-base umpire who botched the call on the last out of Armando Galarraga’s otherwise perfect game for the Detroit Tigers in 2010. The Tigers later sent the bag and the spikes Galarraga was wearing when he beat the runner to that bag to the Hall of Fame as a reminder of the human element of the game.\n\nGalarraga knows he threw a perfect game. Joyce knew it too, mournfully and irrefutably. Galarraga lost his place on the official list of perfect game winners — but he earned an enduring reputation for uncommon grace when, in an act of consolation, he delivered the lineup card to Joyce at home plate the next day. A glorious brotherhood bloomed. The two men co-authored a book about the incident. They titled it “Nobody’s Perfect.”\n\nJane Leavy is the author of “Make Me Commissioner: I Know What’s Wrong with Baseball and How to Fix It,” along with biographies of Babe Ruth, Sandy Koufax and Mickey Mantle.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

It’s Game Time.\n\nPublished: 2025-10-23T05:03:44-04:00\n\nFor the past quarter century, the soul and R&B singer Erykah Badu has spent about eight months each year on the road performing.\n\n“It’s what I do, completely,” Badu, 54, told Popcast, The New York Times’ music show, in an interview last month. “And it completes me.”\n\n“I’m from the theater, so I feel very at home — it’s my therapy,” she added. “I’m not wrong in that place, in front of that mic. I am accepted and applauded.”\n\nYet for an artist of Badu’s range and influence, she has released comparatively little music. Since her three-times platinum debut, “Baduizm,” in 1997, and its beloved 2000 follow-up, “Mama’s Gun,” which helped to define the vaunted neo-soul movement, Badu has released just three more albums over the next 25 years, plus a 2015 phone-themed mixtape and a sprinkling of singles.\n\nInstead, in addition to her near-constant touring, the singer has raised three children, experimented with acting and become a dedicated doula for both birth and death. “But when I have something to say,” Badu said, “I write an album.”\n\nHer latest, “Abi & Alan,” a full-length collaboration with the Alchemist, the hip-hop producer known for his omnivorous sampling, has been teased for months, though the pair has not announced a release date. Fittingly, they have debuted the music primarily onstage as Badu geared up for the “Mama’s Gun” 25th anniversary tour that will take her through the end of the year.\n\n“To me, it’s a sport, the recording business,” Badu said. “I do know when I have something to say, because it means I want to get in the game.”\n\nIn a wide-ranging conversation on Popcast, she discussed why her trailblazing career took the shape that it did; her influence on many generations of rappers, including the famous fathers of her children; and her kinship with D’Angelo, who died soon after this interview, at 51.\n\nBelow are edited excerpts from the conversation, which can be watched or listened to in full here.\n\nJOE COSCARELLI You were quite early, I think, in being a soul and R&B singer who fully embraced hip-hop.\n\nERYKAH BADU I really hate that I get categorized, because I don’t think I do one thing. I certainly don’t think there’s one song that I’ve made that sounds like the other. I’m always in the specific moment of that music, and the drums come first. I love the idea of live instrumentation because I am a jazz artist. I love improvisation. I love to make a song, but I like to see how far we can take it live.\n\nJON CARAMANICA In an old Vibe magazine interview, you were talking about your process of vocalizing and said, “I used to pretend that I was a horn.”\n\nBADU I played the clarinet in elementary school, and it has this really nasally kind of thing. And so does my voice. So I would just always imagine myself as a clarinet. I first was introduced to clarinet from “Popeye,” the sailor cartoons. It had a real Benny Goodman kind of a thing going on there with the score. [Vocalizing] Skibble up de be bop, bop bop and then the horns.\n\nCARAMANICA On “Baduizm” and your early work, you really hear the touch of the hand on the instrument, which was very striking in the mid-90s. When you were looking around at that time, did you even think about commercial ambitions or the broader question of where your album sat amid the glitz and glamour?\n\nBADU Of course I thought about those things. And at the same time, I knew I had something that was not like anything else. I think I didn’t know how quickly it would be understood and picked up. It was just a homemade thing.\n\nCOSCARELLI Then all of a sudden it’s reaching millions and not only that, but you immediately find a community of like-minded musicians. D’Angelo was also dealing with the weight of comparison and the weight of history, especially because what you guys were doing at that time was seen as a corrective or a response to the sound and materialism of rap.\n\nBADU I first met D’Angelo’s music. I was working in a coffee shop in Dallas, Texas, called Grinders, and somebody was playing D’Angelo’s new album, “Brown Sugar.” I heard it, and it was just so refreshing to me because I was also working on music and really wanted to meet him.\n\nThe next month, I went to South by Southwest. I was passing out my demo and I guess I gave one of them to the right person, who was managing Mobb Deep. And she goes, “I have a friend that I’m gonna hand this to,” and the friend was Kedar [Massenburg, a music executive and producer].\n\nKedar and I started to talk and then he goes, “Well, I manage D’Angelo.” At that time, I really thought I was on the right path. I didn’t have anyone to kill the dream. I just believed the things I believed and kept them to myself and they just began to happen, one thing after the other.\n\nCARAMANICA Kismet.\n\nBADU I opened for D’Angelo through Kedar in Dallas. We’ve been really good friends since then. In fact, when we first met Questlove, we met him the same day. It was 1996 or 1997 at the BET Awards in L.A. The Roots had a show, House of Blues, during that week. Goodie Mob opened for them, maybe the Fugees were the headliner. And D’Angelo and I went together and we both saw Ahmir [Questlove] at the same time and got the same thought: He was a human drum machine. He just kind of had quanticism in his chest. And I was looking over at D’ hoping that he didn’t think the same thing, because we both wanted it for ourselves.\n\nCOSCARELLI They had a little bromance and cut you out?\n\nBADU They had a little bromance. It’s fine. But we all kind of got together as a crew when we started working at Electric Lady here in New York, ’99.\n\nWe all admired Ahmir so much that he was kind of like the godfather. We each worked on our albums separately. We each executive produced our own albums, but Ahmir’s presence was very important to us — his opinions, his advice. We all worked together and became a little family.\n\nCOSCARELLI You were working on “Mama’s Gun,” and D’Angelo was making “Voodoo.” You were on these parallel paths of making follow-ups to huge debuts —\n\nBADU It was the dawning of the digital age, where we were now using laptops and … AOL? Is that right? We were sending music to each other through text message, through AOL.\n\nCOSCARELLI Like AOL Instant Messenger? The idea of you and D’Angelo IM-ing each other is a magical image.\n\nBADU Yeah, everybody was in on it, you know? I had said, I’m never getting on this, because I don’t want the government in my business. We were doing that and we just kind of talked about who we were and what we loved and who hurt our feelings.\n\nCOSCARELLI You have children with three rappers: the D.O.C., André 3000 and Jay Electronica. You’ve been an artist and had agency in your own work for so long, but do you ever think of your role as muse? So much great hip-hop has been made about you, including Outkast’s “Ms. Jackson.”\n\nBADU I don’t think “Ms. Jackson” was actually about me. I don’t think so, but people say it.\n\nCOSCARELLI About your mother, then, more specifically.\n\nBADU Well, she thinks it was about her. She’s got the bumper sticker and the airbrush T-shirt.\n\nCOSCARELLI What does the bumper sticker say?\n\nBADU Ms. Jackson! The T-shirt says “Sorry Ms. Jackson.”\n\nCOSCARELLI But I can imagine how it might turn your mind upside down to think of yourself not as the artist, but the inspiration.\n\nBADU I think I inspire many things, just the same way I was inspired when I was young. I think the reason I inspire things is because I am just either oblivious to rules or they don’t really sway me. I’m not afraid of it, you know? I can be completely myself.\n\nCOSCARELLI And you allowed those men that freedom in their connections with you?\n\nBADU I think what we have in common is that we were all on that path. Any person that I’ve come in contact with — specifically the fathers of my amazing children — I think that they were on that already. That’s why we sympathetically vibrated together.\n\nCARAMANICA What self-doubt did you have on the way to stardom?\n\nBADU I didn’t hear anything on the way to stardom. I started having self-doubt after I was more popular — way after “Baduizm,” way after “Mama’s Gun” — because people have opinions and those opinions, you know, they’re a force.\n\nCOSCARELLI You didn’t begin to feel self-doubt until more than a decade into your career?\n\nBADU We didn’t have social media. You don’t get to hear all of those things, you don’t even get to look back at yourself doing stuff. I’m a sensitive being. So I absorb so much. It’s hard not to look at it and read it and think, am I?\n\nCOSCARELLI And yet other than your constant touring, one thing that’s kept you fresh for many new generations is your online presence. Do you see social media as a marketing tactic or as a playground for your acting and comedic side?\n\nBADU It’s a playground that happens to also be a marketing tactic. I get on there and have fun. And it just so happens that it keeps me present in the business, as well.\n\nCOSCARELLI Does it ever get you in trouble?\n\nBADU Not recently. I’ve learned who the audience is. But yes, it does give me trouble. There’s an Erykah Badu problem.\n\nCOSCARELLI How would you describe the Erykah Badu problem?\n\nBADU It’s gonna be weird, but all I talk about is peace and love and forgiveness and kindness and somehow that makes me the center of hate. Because I didn’t know what to say and when, maybe, at a certain point.\n\nCOSCARELLI You had a period where you were very interested in having public conversations about radical empathy for people who had been considered cultural villains: Bill Cosby, R. Kelly, Louis Farrakhan. And you were speaking openly, and seemingly from the heart, about this idea that hurt people hurt people.\n\nBADU But I quickly learned that people don’t like their hate interrupted. And I knew that wasn’t the right audience for that type of conversation. Unless you want to debate. Or to be hated.\n\nCOSCARELLI How has your thinking on that subject changed or evolved now that a cultural and political shift has happened against the idea of “woke,” which you had a role in popularizing as a concept?\n\nBADU People have become more and more and more angry and opinionated and offended. My friend James calls them the offendocracy. People who are waiting to jump out the bushes: Ha! Caught you saying this or that.\n\nCARAMANICA On all sides?\n\nBADU On all sides. I don’t feel strongly about anything that would lead me to damaging the gift that I’ve been given.\n\nCOSCARELLI Your career?\n\nBADU Yeah. Not on social media — that’s not the place. But there are places that I can make a difference, and I do.\n\nCARAMANICA Do you think, in the abstract, we as a society are not empathetic enough?\n\nBADU I think everybody is as empathetic as they should be. It’s not a race. Everybody doesn’t have to have the same amount of empathy at the same time. And if it’s true empathy, that means you’ve learned something. So I don’t think everyone should have to be measured by the same rule. I know my audience: trees, birds, wind, rain.

2025-10-24T12:33:33-04:00\n\nNapoleon’s army was starving and freezing as it withdrew from the failed invasion of Russia in 1812. It was also stalked by additional killers: bacterial infections.\n\nWhen a group of French researchers set out to answer which infectious diseases helped fell the troops, they did not have much to go on: only 13 teeth from men buried in a mass grave in Vilnius, Lithuania. They were among the doomed soldiers of an army dispatched by the French emperor that initially numbered around a half million.\n\nBut each tooth had a dollop of tissue and blood inside that contained tiny fragments of microbial DNA. Using state-of-the-art methods, the researchers found evidence of two kinds of bacteria that had not previously been suspected of circulating among these troops.\n\nOne is relapsing fever, an infection carried by lice that resembles typhus. Like that disease, it causes high fevers, joint pain, severe headaches, nausea and vomiting, and extreme fatigue.\n\nThe other is paratyphoid fever, transmitted through contaminated food or water. Its symptoms include a high fever, headache, weakness and abdominal pain.\n\nTheir paper was published on Friday in Current Biology.\n\nWhile other infectious disease is also suspected in playing a role based on historical accounts, this study adds two more killers to the record.\n\n“This is really good work,” said Kyle Harper, a historian at the University of Oklahoma who was not involved in the study.\n\nAnd, he said, “it’s an interesting historical case study,” of what he called, “an extraordinary episode of human suffering.”\n\nBut Mary Fissell, a medical historian at Johns Hopkins University also not involved in the research, cautioned against drawing sweeping conclusions from a study of just 13 teeth.\n\nThe researchers who led the study agreed with her.\n\nNicolas Rascovan, an expert in ancient DNA at the Institut Pasteur in Paris and lead author of the new paper, said he by no means thought the two pathogens identified by his group were the sole cause of the demise of the troops.\n\nMuch more important, he said, was that the men were starving, dehydrated and freezing.\n\nThe men, he said, were tottering on the edge of life and death.\n\n“In those conditions,” he added, “any infectious disease can kill people.”\n\nThe story of that ill-fated assault on Russia inspired Tolstoy’s “War and Peace,” and has fascinated historians, who cite it with a sense of horror.\n\nFrom the moment Napoleon’s army arrived in Moscow, things went horribly wrong. The troops found a city destroyed, on purpose. Muscovites had burned it down. There was no food, no other provisions. The French soldiers soon were “begging for a piece of bread, for linen or sheepskin, and, above all, for shoes,” according to one account.\n\nIn October, Napoleon ordered a retreat. But the worst was yet to come for the already weakened men — a frigid winter and little food. The conditions were so harsh and so debilitating that diseases that might ordinarily sicken but not kill could prove fatal. Ill soldiers died, collapsing along the frozen landscape.\n\nA French physician who was present during the campaign, Dr. J.R.L. de Kirckhoff, described the scene:\n\nSoldiers unable to go further fell and resigned themselves to death, in that frightful state of despair which is caused by the total loss of moral and physical force, which was aggravated to the utmost by the sight of their comrades stretched lifeless on the snow. During a retreat so precipitate and fatal, in a country deprived of its resources, amid disorder and confusion, the sad physician was forced to remain an astonished spectator of evils he could not arrest, to which he could apply no remedy.\n\nAs for the diseases that afflicted the men, Dr. de Kirckhoff listed typhus, diarrhea, dysentery, fevers, pneumonia and jaundice.\n\nIn 2006, in an initial attempt to understand the nature of the men’s illnesses, a different group of researchers reported finding segments of body lice in the soil of the mass grave in Vilnius. Three of the lice carried bacteria for trench fever, they wrote. They also reported finding typhus bacteria in the teeth of three men and trench fever in the teeth of seven. But the study was done when the technology for studying ancient DNA fragments was not well developed, making their findings less than definitive.\n\nIn the end, historians say, Dr. de Kirckhoff’s writings and today’s science point to the same conclusion: It was not wounds of battle that killed most of these men. It was starvation and frigid temperatures that set the stage for deaths from infectious diseases.\n\n“The attrition of the army is extraordinary,” Dr. Harper said, “and underscores how much prior to the 20th century what we think of as wars are primarily medical events.”\n\nThe infections, he added, “are diseases that exploit human suffering.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/arts/halo-playstation-microsoft-xbox.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"16:25:43-04:00","title":"Xbox’s Prized Sci-Fi Franchise Is Heading to PlayStation","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Microsoft is releasing a modernized remake of Halo: Combat Evolved, titled Halo: Campaign Evolved, on PlayStation 5, marking the first time the sci-fi franchise is available on Sony’s platform.

Heading to PlayStation\n\nPublished: 2025-10-24T16:25:43-04:00\n\nRemaking a classic video game with modern technology to reach both nostalgic and new audiences has become commonplace in an industry facing financial challenges.\n\nSo it was not a huge surprise when Microsoft announced on Friday that it would release an updated version of Halo: Combat Evolved next year, the influential game’s 25th anniversary.\n\nOne detail, though, was astounding.\n\nThe sci-fi franchise that has helped the company sell four generations of Xbox consoles and generate billions of dollars is coming to the Sony PlayStation, Microsoft’s direct competitor, for the first time. It is the equivalent of Disney letting Mickey Mouse roam Universal Studios.\n\n“We are all seeking to meet people where they are,” Matt Booty, the president of Xbox game content and studios, said in an interview about Microsoft’s strategic shift.\n\nThe supersoldier Master Chief, who must protect humanity from alien threats in the first-person shooter Halo, is joining other Microsoft properties that are exclusive no longer. The third-person shooter Gears of War and the Forza racing series made their Sony debuts this year, and Microsoft Flight Simulator will do so in December.\n\nVideo game companies have long enticed players to buy consoles with games featuring their mascots. Nintendo developed a family-friendly lineup of characters in the 1980s, and Donkey Kong, Mario and Zelda remain moneymakers. Sony’s exclusive franchises include the cinematic adventures Uncharted, God of War and The Last of Us.\n\nMicrosoft has decided to move in another direction.\n\nIt is an effort to reach more gamers and to maximize revenue after the company opened its wallet to acquire major studios. Microsoft spent $69 billion on Activision Blizzard, which makes Call of Duty and Candy Crush, and $7.5 billion on ZeniMax Media, whose portfolio includes The Elder Scrolls and Fallout.\n\nJoost van Dreunen, a market analyst and professor at New York University, said Microsoft’s newest console, the Xbox Series X|S, had been a commercial disappointment since releasing in 2020. Analysts estimate that it has sold at least 32 million units compared to about 80 million units of the PlayStation 5.\n\n“When it comes to consoles, Xbox has always been the bridesmaid and never the bride,” van Dreunen said. “They just haven’t been able to outmaneuver PlayStation and Nintendo.”\n\nNext year’s remake, titled Halo: Campaign Evolved, will be released for the Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5 and PC. It will not include the original game’s competitive multiplayer modes. But for the first time, four players can cooperatively play the campaign online.\n\nMicrosoft leaders hope that bringing its premier franchises to new audiences will ultimately attract more customers into the Xbox ecosystem. Booty said consumers no longer have a strong attachment to the actual devices they use to play games.\n\n“Our biggest competition isn’t another console,” he said, adding, “We are competing more and more with everything from TikTok to movies.”\n\nThere are signs the strategy is working.\n\nBetween April and July, six of the top 10 best-selling games on Sony’s consoles were Microsoft properties. Near the top was Forza Horizon 5, four years after it was initially released for Xbox consoles.\n\nMicrosoft declined to provide PlayStation 5 sales figures for Forza Horizon 5 and Gears of War: Reloaded, a remake that was released in August. Sony did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nBy releasing the first Halo and Gears of War titles on the PlayStation 5 decades later, Microsoft is introducing lucrative franchises to loyal Sony gamers. (Games in both franchises, including a 2011 remake of Halo: Combat Evolved, have been playable on computers.) That exposure may pay dividends if Microsoft brings Gears of War: E-Day, which has a 2026 release date, and Halo Infinite’s eventual follow-up to the PlayStation 5.\n\nAny full-price sales on Sony’s console would be particularly important for Microsoft.\n\nTens of millions of Xbox owners subscribe to Game Pass, a subscription service whose highest tier provides immediate access to all Microsoft-published games. The company significantly raised that tier’s prices this month amid reports that its decision to include Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 as part of the subscription cost the company $300 million in sales. A Microsoft official confirmed that the company was also conducting internal tests for free ad-supported cloud access to some games through a program separate from Game Pass.\n\nThe shifting economics of the video game industry have left some analysts wondering if Microsoft plans to leave the console market altogether. Over the summer, the company laid off almost 9,000 employees, many from game studios attached to Xbox. An anticipated reboot of Perfect Dark was canceled altogether.\n\n“Layoffs are difficult,” Booty said. “They are a part of managing our business.”\n\nWhen the original Xbox was released in November 2001, Microsoft spent about $500 million on marketing to convince players it would become a fixture in the video game business.\n\nMuch of the attention went to Halo: Combat Evolved, which impressed players and critics with its robust weapon arsenal, smooth control scheme and addictive multiplayer battles. Console players who wanted to follow the interstellar saga over its six sequels (and one prequel) were required to buy the Xbox 360, the Xbox One and the Xbox Series X|S.\n\nIn 2021, shortly before the release of Halo Infinite, Microsoft said it had sold 81 million Halo games; it declined to provide updated figures.\n\nThe series was highly influential in the 2000s: Halo 2 set the industry standard for online matchmaking, and Halo 3 generated long lines outside of Best Buys and GameStops. But the franchise’s cultural cachet has diminished since then.\n\nDevelopers behind Halo: Campaign Evolved described it as a relaunch for the series with new content and modernized gameplay. In this version, Master Chief can sprint across battlefields and wield an energy sword. The environments were rebuilt in Unreal Engine 5, the first time the franchise will run on outside software.\n\n“We are evolving the experience,” said Pierre Hintze, the head of Halo Studios. “There is a level of detail with which we now can express the original artistic vision and goals.”\n\nHintze said the franchise’s story of repelling an alien conquest was refreshing in an era when many games featured reluctant heroes and unclear objectives.\n\n“When you pick up Halo, you know that you are quintessentially good,” he said. “Your job is to save humanity.”\n\nElizabeth Van Wyck, the chief operating officer and general manager of the Halo franchise, said it was Microsoft’s goal to reach as many players as possible.\n\n“We talk about this as another era for Halo,” she said.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/us/trump-immigration-crackdown-chicago-lakeview.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"20:44:58-04:00","title":"Immigration Crackdown Spreads Through Chicago, Including Wealthy Neighborhoods","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Federal immigration agents have expanded their operations into affluent neighborhoods of Chicago, including Lakeview, a wealthy area near Wrigley Field, where they conducted a confrontation with residents that escalated to the use of tear gas without warning.

Through Chicago, Including Wealthy Neighborhoods\n\nPublished: 2025-10-24T20:44:58-04:00\n\nJust before noon on Friday, Abbey Nystedt was busy on a Zoom call at her Lakeview home when she heard the shriek of whistles, now an understood warning in Chicago that immigration agents were nearby.\n\nFederal agents had just pulled up on a quiet block of multimillion-dollar houses a short walk from Wrigley Field, sending a four-man construction crew working in the front yard of one home scrambling to escape.\n\nDozens of neighbors poured outside of their homes, shocked and confronting the agents. After a chaotic back-and-forth, neighbors said the agents released tear gas without warning, sending people choking for air and rinsing their eyes out with water from garden hoses.\n\n“People were coming out of their homes to record, to yell, to tell ICE to leave our neighborhood — it was a whole bunch of people with their freaking goldendoodles,” said Ms. Nystedt, who works in the hospitality industry, referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. “What am I going to do, go back to my Zoom call when people across the street are being denied their constitutional rights?”\n\nFederal immigration operations are now penetrating nearly every corner of Chicago, and many residents are responding with anger.\n\nThis week, agents have released tear gas, made arrests and interrogated people on the streets of Little Village and the Southwest Side, areas that are heavily populated with Latino families and some undocumented immigrants. But the federal crackdown on illegal immigration that began more than six weeks ago has also started to play out in some of Chicago’s quiet suburbs and most expensive neighborhoods.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
