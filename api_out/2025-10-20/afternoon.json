Secret Service finds ‘suspicious’ hunting stand near Air Force One landing zone in Florida \n       \n  By Lauren Chadwick, Holmes Lybrand, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:57 AM EDT, Mon October 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US Secret Service found a “suspicious” hunting stand within sight of the Air Force One landing zone ahead of the president’s arrival in Florida over the weekend, FBI Director Kash Patel said, adding no one was at the stand.\n \n\n   \n  “Prior to the President’s return to West Palm Beach, USSS discovered what appeared to be an elevated hunting stand within sight line of the Air Force One landing zone,” the FBI director  told Fox News Digital , later confirming on social media that  “the FBI is investigating”  what Patel called a “suspicious stand” near the zone.\n \n\n   \n  One senior law enforcement official told CNN the hunting stand was found across from the airport. Based on the condition of the stand, the source said, it had been there for some time.\n \n\n   \n  Hunters regularly set up and leave stands like the one found by law enforcement to use again. These stands are often used by bow hunters – especially in dense, wooded areas – and can be used by individuals hunting with firearms as well.\n \n\n   \n  There is nothing to currently indicate the stand was built to target the president, the source said.\n \n\n   \n  The US Secret Service confirmed that teams identified “items of interest” near Palm Beach International Airport during advance security preparations ahead of President Donald Trump’s arrival.\n \n\n   \n  “During advance security preparations prior to the Palm Beach arrival, which included the use of technology and comprehensive physical sweeps, our teams identified items of interest near Palm Beach International Airport,” Anthony Guglielmi, the Secret Service’s chief of communications, said in the statement.\n \n\n   \n  “There was no impact to any movements and no individuals were present or involved at the location. While we are not able to provide details about the specific items or their intent, this incident underscores the importance of our layered security measures. The FBI is leading the investigation and we would refer any additional comment to them.”\n \n\n   \n  The FBI and Secret Service provided no additional details related to the incident.\n \n\n   \n  The announcement from Patel and the Secret Service comes after Trump was targeted by two assassination attempts during his second campaign for president.\n \n\n   \n  Just last month,  Ryan Routh  – who was accused of attempting to kill Trump as he played a round of golf on his Florida course last year – was found guilty on all charges against him.\n \n\n   \n  The president was also  injured during an assassination attempt  in July 2024 at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n \n\n   \n  The Secret Service later said the attempt on Trump’s life represented an “operational failure” with multiple reports finding “breakdowns in communication, technological issues, and human failure, among other contributing factors.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/us/sonya-massey-deputy-murder-trial-what-we-know","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"06:15:00-04:00","title":"What to know about the murder trial of an Illinois sheriff deputy who killed Sonya Massey","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The murder trial of Sean Grayson, a Sangamon County sheriff’s deputy, is set to begin in Peoria, Illinois, following his 2024 shooting of Sonya Massey, a Black woman who had a history of mental health struggles.

murder trial of an Illinois sheriff deputy who killed Sonya Massey \n       \n  By Associated Press, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:15 AM EDT, Mon October 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The murder trial of an Illinois sheriff’s deputy charged with killing  Sonya Massey , a Black woman shot in her home last year after calling police for help, is set to begin Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Sean Grayson, 31, responding to a call about a suspected prowler, fired on the 36-year-old Massey in her Springfield home early on July 6, 2024, after confronting her about how she was handling a pan of hot water Grayson had ordered removed from her stove.\n \n\n   \n  Jurors will report Monday, and the trial could continue into next week.\n \n\n   \n  Massey’s killing raised new questions about US law enforcement shootings of  Black people in their homes  and prompted a change in  Illinois law requiring fuller transparency  on the background of candidates for law enforcement jobs.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what to know about the charges:\n \n\n   \n    Trial relocated due to national attention\n \n\n   \n  In addition to first-degree murder, Grayson is charged with aggravated battery with a firearm and official misconduct. He has pleaded not guilty.\n \n\n   \n  Widespread attention to Grayson’s shooting of Massey prompted Sangamon County Circuit Judge Ryan Cadagin to move the trial from Springfield, 200 miles southwest of Chicago. Jurors will instead come from Peoria and surrounding areas, an hour’s drive north, and will hear the case in their local courthouse.\n \n\n   \n  Grayson, who is white, faces a sentence of 45 years to life in prison if convicted of first-degree murder.\n \n\n   \n    Body camera footage shows shooting\n \n\n   \n  After Grayson and another deputy checked the area around Massey’s house, Grayson knocked on her door to report they had found nothing suspicious, body camera video shows. He entered the house to obtain details for a report, noticed a pan on the stove and ordered its removal. Massey picked it up.\n \n\n   \n  She laughingly asked Grayson why he was backing away; he said he was trying to avoid the “hot, steaming water.” Massey responded, “I rebuke you in the name of Jesus.” Grayson wrote in an incident report, “I interpreted this to mean  she was going to kill me .”\n \n\n   \n  According to body camera video, Grayson pulled his 9 mm pistol and yelled at Massey to drop the pot. She apologized then put the pan down and ducked behind a counter, but in the confusion, as Grayson yelled, it appears she picked it up again.\n \n\n   \n  Grayson fired three times, hitting  Massey once just below the left eye .\n \n\n   \n    Massey’s family had sought mental health care\n \n\n   \n  Massey, a single mother of two teenagers who had a strong religious faith, was beset by mental health problems. When she answered Grayson’s knock minutes before the shooting, she said, “Don’t hurt me,” and then, as she was questioned and Grayson asked her if she was all right, she repeatedly said, “Please God.”\n \n\n   \n  Earlier that same week, Sonya Massey had admitted herself to a  30-day inpatient mental health program  in St. Louis but returned two days later without explanation.\n \n\n   \n  In the days leading up to the shooting,  three 911 calls were made  by Massey or on her behalf, county records indicate. In one, her mother, Donna Massey, told authorities her daughter was suffering a “mental breakdown.” Donna Massey also told the dispatcher, “I don’t want you guys to hurt her.”\n \n\n   \n  Grayson was not aware of the calls or Massey’s background. County officials have since said there’s no practical way to determine and communicate such information for police responding to emergency calls.\n \n\n   \n    Deputy’s history prompted state reform\n \n\n   \n  Grayson was  arrested 11 days after killing Massey and fired  from the sheriff’s department.\n \n\n   \n  As his background was scrutinized, Massey’s family and others questioned why Grayson, who had been a Sangamon County deputy sheriff for 14 months,  had been hired at all .\n \n\n   \n  In his early 20s, he was ejected from the Army for a drunken-driving arrest in which he had a weapon in his car. He was convicted of a DUI again within the year.\n \n\n   \n  Before joining the Sangamon County Sheriff’s Department, Grayson had four policing jobs in six years – the first three of which were part-time.\n \n\n   \n  There was no indication Grayson had been fired from any job, but evaluations from past employers documented concerns about him. One department reported that while Grayson worked hard and had a good attitude, he struggled with report writing, was “not great with evidence – left items laying around office” and was “a bragger.”\n \n\n   \n  Jack Campbell, the Sangamon County sheriff,  was forced to retire  six weeks after the shooting. He insisted none of Grayson’s issues disqualified him from working as a deputy.\n \n\n   \n  State law enforcement authorities had certified Grayson to serve in each of his previous jobs, but Campbell  required him to attend the 16-week police academy  training course nonetheless.\n \n\n   \n  In August, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker  signed a law requiring  that prospective police officers permit the release of all personal and employment background records to any law enforcement agency considering hiring them. Legislative sponsors of the measure acknowledged it doesn’t prevent candidates with checkered paths from being hired but provides greater transparency.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/sport/soccer-tel-aviv-derby-police-riots-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"06:37:00-04:00","title":"Tel Aviv Soccer Derby Canceled by Police Due to 'Violent Riots'","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Tel Aviv soccer derby between Hapoel and Maccabi was canceled on October 20, 2025, after violent riots and public disorder at Bloomfield Stadium, with fans throwing pyrotechnics and smoke grenades.

reunion \n       \n  By Lisa Respers France, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:30 AM EDT, Mon October 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   Lance Bass  knows that fans want to know if  N’Sync  will be getting back together for a tour, but at the moment he’s got nothing.\n \n\n   \n  “I wish I had some breaking news for you, but no, no news right now,” he recently told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  And that’s OK. What Bass can do at the moment is talk more freely talk about  living with diabetes .\n \n\n   \n  He has type 1.5 diabetes, which is also known as latent autoimmune diabetes or LAD.\n \n\n   \n  The star uses Dexcom continuous glucose monitoring to stay on top of his numbers, and has created an  online persona known as “Blood Sugar Lance”  to educate people about his condition with humor.\n \n\n   \n  The character developed “by accident,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “We like to have fun on my  Instagram  and make people laugh,” Bass said. “That’s what my channel is for, to just give some people entertainment and give a little laugh throughout the day ‘cause we’re living in a crazy, crazy time.”\n \n\n   \n  Prior to being able to constantly monitor his blood sugar, Bass said it was difficult to keep up.\n \n\n   \n  “Back in the day, five years ago when I was having to bring all my needles and all that to test my glucose, I would always leave it at home,” he recalled. “Always. I would always leave something.”\n \n\n   \n  Now he doesn’t have to worry, and he can better tell what spikes his blood sugar after he eats, and what doesn’t.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s definitely certain foods that my body does not take well to that I guess some other diabetics can easily digest. For me it is the white foods,” Bass said. “White rice, white bread, those are the culprits for me.”\n \n\n   \n  “And it doesn’t matter how much insulin I give myself, that thing is gonna break through,” he added. “Even if I have just one little spoonful of white rice, it is going to spike to 400. So that is a no go.”\n \n\n   \n  His uncle had type 1 diabetes, and growing up Bass remembers being aware that his relative had to eat sugar-free. These days he said he’s grateful for the advancements that make life easier for those who are diabetic.\n \n\n   \n  “It makes it so much easier to deal with,” he said of the new monitoring technology. “That and meeting this (diabetic) community, it’s been incredible because with the support that you give each other.”\n \n\n   \n  Stress also affects his blood sugar, and that can be hard not to have given his busy career balanced with raising his four-year-old twins Violet and Alexander with husband Michael Turchin.\n \n\n   \n  But might Bass be even busier with something like, say, a reunion tour with one of the most beloved boy bands of all time?\n \n\n   \n  All he will say is don’t believe everything you read.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve been seeing some recent articles, and I can just say they don’t really know what they’re talking about,” Bass said, laughing.\n \n\n   \n  You’re tearing up our hearts Lance Bass!\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/europe/louvre-heist-jewels-recovery-scli-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"06:14:00-04:00","title":"Looted Louvre Treasures May Never Be Found, Experts Say, as Museum Remains Closed","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Louvre museum in Paris was the target of a brazen heist on Sunday, in which thieves used a truck-mounted ladder to break into the Apollo Gallery via an unsecured window and stole eight out of nine historic pieces from the French crown jewels, including items worn by Queen Marie-Amélie and Queen Hortense.

Jack Guy, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:14 AM EDT, Mon October 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The  Louvre  museum in Paris announced it would remain closed Monday as investigations continue into Sunday’s extraordinary  theft of historic jewelry  – and experts say the prospects of recovering the treasures are slim.\n \n\n   \n  In a  post  on X, the museum said it regretted Monday’s closure, as France begins to digest the implications of the brazen heist in which robbers made off with artefacts from the French crown jewels, dating from the Napoleonic era.\n \n\n   \n  The thieves used a truck-mounted ladder to gain access to the Apollo Gallery, one of the most ornate rooms in the Louvre, through a window. Armed with tools including an angle grinder and a blowtorch, they targeted two high-security display cases. The entire operation lasted just seven minutes, authorities said.\n \n\n   \n   Eight of the nine items taken remain unaccounted for, including a tiara and necklace worn by Queen Marie-Amélie and Queen Hortense.\n \n\n   \n  French Justice Minister Gerald Darmanin admitted that the Louvre heist exposed security failings at the museum.\n \n\n   \n  “One can wonder about the fact that, for example, the windows hadn’t been secured, about the fact that a basket lift was on a public road,” he said on France Inter radio. “What is certain is that we have failed.”\n \n\n   \n  “The French people all feel like they’ve been robbed,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Natalie Goulet, a Centrist member of the French senate, was asked on BBC radio about the prospects of recovering the jewelry, replying: “None.”\n \n\n   \n  “The jewelry will be cut up and sold and used as a money-laundering system,” she said. “It’s the easiest way to clean dirty money.”\n \n\n   \n  The robbery was probably linked to organized crime, Goulet said.\n \n\n   \n  “They have absolutely no morals,” she said. “They don’t appreciate the jewelry as a piece of history but the way to clean their dirty money.”\n \n\n   \n  Goulet added that she was “very, very pessimistic” about the prospects of recovering the jewelry.\n \n\n   \n  Elaine Sciolino, author of “Adventures in the Louvre: How to Fall in Love with the World’s Greatest Museum,” was similarly downbeat.\n \n\n   \n  “They can be dissembled, they can be cut, they can be sold on the black market,” she told BBC Radio. “It is unlikely that all of them are going to be recuperated in the shape that they are now.”\n \n\n   \n  Sciolino emphasized the significance of a robbery at the Louvre, which was originally built as a fortress before becoming a palace for the French royal family.\n \n\n   \n  “This attack really is a dagger into the heart of France and French history,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Chris Marinello, CEO of Art Recovery International, a company that tracks down stolen artworks, believes that French police have a limited window in which they could recover the jewelry.\n \n\n   \n  “There is a race going on right now,” he told BBC World Service’s Newshour radio show on Sunday, adding that law enforcement will “know that in the next 24 or 48 hours, if these thieves are not caught, those pieces are probably long gone.”\n \n\n   \n  The robbers “are not going to keep them intact, they are going to break them up, melt down the valuable metal, recut any valuable stones and hide evidence of their crime,” said Marinello.\n \n\n   \n  There is “virtually no way” of tracing the jewels in that instance, he added.\n \n\n   \n  “They may catch the criminals but they won’t recover the jewels,” said Marinello.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/us/chicago-ice-trump-federal-officials-hearing","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"07:52:00-04:00","title":"Federal Officials Called to Testify Over Chicago Immigration Crackdown Actions","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In October 2025, US District Judge Sara Ellis is overseeing a legal dispute over federal immigration enforcement tactics in Chicago, specifically regarding the Trump administration’s 'Operation Midway Blitz,' which led to over 1,000 arrests in Illinois between September 8 and October 3.

During  last week’s hearing , she said she had concerns about her order being followed.\n \n\n   \n  Ellis –  an Obama appointee  – indicated recent news reports had led her to believe the Trump administration may not have been following her instructions.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not happy,” Ellis said in a stern tone. “I’m really not happy.”\n \n\n   \n  “At least from what I’m seeing, I’m having serious concerns that my order’s being followed,” she said from the bench.\n \n\n   \n  Ellis eventually expanded her restraining order, requiring all federal agents involved in the immigration crackdown in Chicago who have body cameras and are trained in using them to have them on when encountering protesters.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s the nice thing about body cameras is that they pick up events before the triggering event happens,” Ellis said.\n \n\n   \n   The judge originally required all agents to wear cameras. But her order doesn’t require them if they’re undercover, not in uniform or exempt by Customs and Border Protection, ICE or DHS policy.\n \n\n   \n  Previously, Ellis demanded that ICE Field Director Russell Hott appear in court on Monday, “to explain to me why I am seeing images of tear gas being deployed and reading reports that there were no warnings given before it was deployed out in the field.”\n \n\n   \n  But Hott has since planned his return to the Washington, DC, area to continue his permanent post as field operations director in the nation’s capital, said Tricia McLaughlin, DHS assistant secretary for public affairs.\n \n\n   \n  “He served in Chicago as interim FOD and this is (a) planned return to his permanent office in DC,” McLaughlin said in a statement to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  In a filing Friday, the Department of Justice offered to have CBP Deputy Incident Commander Kyle C. Harvick and ICE Deputy Field Office Director Shawn Byers testify instead.\n \n\n   \n  Federal officials claimed Harvick would be a more appropriate person to testify after DHS determined it was “mostly, if not entirely” Border Patrol personnel who were involved in recent tear gas incidents, CNN affiliate  WTTW reported .\n \n\n   \n  During a telephone hearing that day, the judge said she had no desire to “micromanage” who the government presents at Monday’s hearing but that she’s been “very clear” she wants to hear from someone who can fill her in on “what’s been going on over the last week,” the station reported.\n \n\n   \n  “Whoever comes has to be able to answer these questions,” Ellis said, according to WTTW. “And if the government chooses … to bring someone in and that person’s answers to me are ‘I don’t know’ and ‘It’s not my responsibility’ … then we’ll come in Tuesday with a different person until I get the answers I want.”\n \n\n   \n  The two were ordered to appear in person to provide testimony at 10:30 a.m. local time Monday.\n \n\n   \n    Protests continue at Broadview\n \n\n   \n  This weekend  marked  the first since a fence was ordered removed at the Broadview ICE facility, the center of anti-ICE protests in the Chicago area.\n \n\n   \n  The ICE building outside Chicago has been the site of confrontations as protesters have come out to decry immigration arrests.\n \n\n   \n  Over 100 protesters gathered outside the facility Friday morning, with Broadview police officers, Cook County sheriff’s deputies and Illinois State Police gathered to keep demonstrators in the area designated for them. The protest, though loud, has remained calm. As of 5 p.m. CT, 15 arrests had been made, the Cook County Sheriff’s Office said.\n \n\n   \n  At least 15 people were arrested on Saturday in connection with another demonstration at the facility, the agency said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/middleeast/hamas-gaza-israeli-hostage-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"07:19:00-04:00","title":"Twelfth Deceased Hostage Identified After Two Returned to Israel Overnight, Kibbutz Says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The body of Thai national Sonthaya Oakkharasri has been identified as the twelfth deceased hostage returned from Gaza by Hamas, with the body of Ronen Engel also confirmed.

Ibrahim Dahman, Mitchell McCluskey, Lauren Izso, Jennifer Hansler, Kareem El Damanhoury, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:19 AM EDT, Mon October 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The body of a twelfth hostage returned to Israel from Gaza has been identified Sunday as Thai national Sonthaya Oakkharasri, as the ceasefire that brought a pause to two years of destruction in the Palestinian enclave comes under strain.\n \n\n   \n  A statement from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office on Sunday said Oakkharasri’s remains had been identified and that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) had informed his family. His was one of two bodies returned by Hamas on Saturday to Israel.\n \n\n   \n  The other body was earlier identified as that of hostage Ronen Engel, according to his kibbutz, and photographs provided to CNN by his family.\n \n\n   \n  Palestinian militant group Hamas handed over the bodies of Engel and Oakkharasri to the Red Cross on Saturday, after which they were transferred to Israel for formal identification.\n \n\n   \n  “Kibbutz Nir Oz announces the return for burial of our beloved Ronen Engel,” a spokesperson for the kibbutz said in a statement. “We will always remember Ronen as a devoted family man, incurably optimistic, with a sense of humor, a joy for life, and a constant smile.”\n \n\n   \n  Oakkharasri was a Thai citizen who was taken hostage during the Hamas-led attack on Israel of October 7, 2023. The Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in May 2024 that Oakkharasri was presumed dead.\n \n\n   \n  Engel was 54 when he was killed, and his wife Karina kidnapped along with their daughters Mika and Yuval. His wife and children were released the following month, but Engel’s body was not.\n \n\n   \n  The truce in Gaza appears to be largely holding as it enters its second week, but has come under pressure from the delayed return of the remaining hostage bodies from Gaza, the initially slow entry of aid into the enclave, and Israel’s continued deadly strikes.\n \n\n   \n  The US State Department said Saturday that “credible reports” indicate Hamas is planning an “imminent ceasefire violation” against Palestinians in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  “This planned attack against Palestinian civilians would constitute a direct and grave violation of the ceasefire agreement and undermine the significant progress achieved through mediation efforts,” the media note said. “The guarantors demand Hamas uphold its obligations under the ceasefire terms.”\n \n\n   \n  “Should Hamas proceed with this attack, measures will be taken to protect the people of Gaza and preserve the integrity of the ceasefire,” it said.\n \n\n   \n  In response, Hamas said in a statement Sunday that it “reaffirms its commitment to the ceasefire agreement” and “stresses that (Israel) continues to breach the agreement and fabricate flimsy pretexts to justify its crimes.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the White House for comment on the State Department’s memo.\n \n\n   \n  With the handover late on Saturday, Hamas has returned 12 of the 28 bodies of deceased hostages outlined in the ceasefire agreement with Israel, which went into effect last week. All 12 have now been formally identified.\n \n\n   \n  “We will not rest and we will not be silent until the last of the hostages is returned,” the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  Protests have ignited in Israel as frustration  intensifies  over the delay in returning the bodies of the remaining hostages. In Tel Aviv’s Hostages Square, large crowds of demonstrators gathered on Saturday, urging the government to pressure Hamas to release the bodies.\n \n\n   \n  Hamas has  said  that it handed over all of the hostage remains that it could access and that “extensive efforts and special equipment” would be needed to retrieve more. Israeli intelligence has  assessed  that Hamas may not be able to find and return all the remaining dead hostages in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  But Israel believes  that Hamas  does know the locations of some of the deceased hostages it claims are missing, according to two Israeli sources familiar with the matter. Israel’s foreign minister has accused Hamas of trying to use the hostages’ bodies as leverage.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking to Channel 14 on Saturday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the war would end once all of the hostage bodies have been returned and Hamas is demilitarized.\n \n\n   \n  “The war in Gaza will finally end when the terms of the agreement that was supposedly accepted are implemented, and this includes, first of all, Phase A - the return of all our hostages,” Netanyahu said. “Phase B also includes the disarmament of Hamas, or rather the disarmament of the Strip, and before that the disarmament of Hamas.”\n \n\n   \n    Rafah crossing and crucial aid\n \n\n   \n  As the dispute continues, the Rafah crossing will remain closed until further notice, Netanyahu’s office said on Saturday. The crossing is a  crucial link  between Egypt and Gaza, serving as the enclave’s lifeline for humanitarian aid.\n \n\n   \n  Netanyahu’s office said that its opening would be dependent on how “Hamas fulfills its part in returning the hostages and implementing the agreed-upon outline.”\n \n\n   \n  Hamas criticized the delayed reopening of the crossing as “a blatant violation of the terms of the ceasefire agreement.” The group also condemned Israel’s strikes on Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the ceasefire, the Israeli military targeted a vehicle carrying 11 civilians, including several women and children, on Friday after it crossed a line that marks Israel’s control under the ceasefire agreement, Gaza’s Civil Defense spokesperson, Mahmoud Basal, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  After coordinating with the United Nations, the Civil Defense recovered on Saturday nine bodies, including those of four children and three women. The bodies of two other children are missing, the Civil Defense said.\n \n\n   \n  The Israeli military told CNN its troops “fired warning shots” after a “suspicious vehicle was identified crossing the yellow line” – a reference to the initial Israeli withdrawal line. The military said the “vehicle continued to approach the troops in a way that caused an imminent threat to them.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/19/world/israel-hamas-gaza-ceasefire-test-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"06:50:00-04:00","title":"US-brokered ceasefire appears to survive first major test as Israel and Hamas affirm commitment to deal","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A US-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Hamas appears to have withstood its first major test after two Israeli soldiers were killed in Gaza, prompting airstrikes and accusations of ceasefire violations from both sides.

Israel and Hamas affirm commitment to deal \n       \n  By Tal Shalev, Mostafa Salem, Oren Liebermann, Mitchell McCluskey, and Ibrahim Dahman\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:50 AM EDT, Mon October 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A US-brokered  ceasefire  in Gaza appears to have survived its first major test as Israel and Hamas affirmed their commitment to the deal after two Israeli soldiers were killed in the enclave on Sunday, prompting waves of airstrikes.\n \n\n   \n  The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement that it would begin a “renewed enforcement” of the ceasefire at the direction of the political echelon.\n \n\n   \n  Hamas and its military wing, the Al-Qassam Brigades (AQB), said on Sunday morning that they remain committed to the ceasefire and rejected involvement in the attack on Israeli forces.\n \n\n   \n  The stated commitment to the ceasefire comes as the deal’s  key architects , Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, are set to arrive in the region, according to sources familiar with the planning, as the Trump administration moves to implement the next phase of the agreement.\n \n\n   \n  Vice President JD Vance is also expected to lead a US delegation to Israel this week, sources familiar with the plans told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “The administration remains focused on implementing the peace agreement and we are working vigorously with our partners to do so. We’re not going to detail ongoing private diplomatic conversations,” a US official told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier on Sunday, Israel carried out a series of strikes across Gaza after it accused Hamas of carrying out an attack that killed two IDF soldiers – Major Yaniv Kula, 26, and Staff Sergeant Itay Yavetz – marking the first time Israeli troops have been killed in Gaza since the ceasefire.\n \n\n   \n  The Israeli strikes killed at least 44 people in several parts of Gaza on Sunday, according to data from Gaza’s hospitals.\n \n\n   \n  Both Hamas and the IDF blamed the other for violating the ceasefire.\n \n\n   \n  Scenes of panic emerged in Gaza during the strikes, where crowds were seen gathered at al-Aqsa hospital as casualties were rushed into the facility.\n \n\n   \n  “We were sitting in a cafeteria, drinking tea and coffee, and suddenly we heard the news — they were hit and bombed, and everyone was killed. That’s all that happened,” Sallih Salman, the brother of one of the deceased Palestinians, told Reuters.\n \n\n   \n  Amid the renewed strikes, the AQB said it found the body of another Israeli hostage during ongoing search operations, “and will hand it over today if field conditions permit.”\n \n\n   \n  The AQB warned that any escalation by the Israeli military would “hinder search, excavation, and the recovery of bodies.”\n \n\n   \n    Aid deliveries continue\n \n\n   \n  Deliveries of aid into Gaza will continue on Monday after Israel announced they would be halted on Sunday, a senior Israeli official told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The quick announcement of the continuation of aid – only hours after the declared pause – means the deliveries of humanitarian aid may not have been affected.\n \n\n   \n  Israel’s continuation of aid is an indication of the goal of maintaining key components of the US-brokered ceasefire agreement with Hamas. But the Rafah Crossing will remain closed, the official said, as Israel awaits the return of the remaining hostage bodies.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, a UN-backed initiative said parts of Gaza  were facing famine  and the truce raised hopes of a surge in humanitarian aid to the territory.\n \n\n   \n  But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces pressure to respond to any violations from far-right parties supporting his coalition.\n \n\n   \n  Israel’s National Security Minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, described the resumption of aid as a “shameful backdown.”\n \n\n   \n  “All this on a day when Hamas murdered two IDF soldiers, and continues to violate the agreement and refuses to hand over all the bodies of our fallen,” he  wrote  on X, “Enough of the backdowns.”\n \n\n   \n    Clashes in Rafah\n \n\n   \n  Israel had carried out strikes in Gaza on Sunday after an Israeli military official said Hamas attacked Israeli forces in Rafah in southern Gaza with rocket-propelled grenades and sniper fire.\n \n\n   \n  Hamas fired towards Israeli forces beyond the Yellow Line – the line behind which Israeli troops have withdrawn according to the ceasefire deal – in three separate incidents on Sunday, according to another military official.\n \n\n   \n  The AQB denied knowledge of “any events or clashes” in Rafah and said they are committed to the truce “throughout all areas of the Gaza Strip.”\n \n\n   \n  While much is unknown about the incident Rafah, it occurred on Sunday morning as Hamas said its internal Rada’a security force was targeting a “hideout” of an Israel-backed militia led by  Yasser Abu Shabab . In June, Israel confirmed it was arming several such militias in an attempt to counter Hamas.\n \n\n   \n  Muhammad Shehada, a Gaza expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said these militias now operate from within Israeli-occupied areas in Gaza from which they “descend on the other half of Gaza, carry out attacks, then go run back to those protected areas.”\n \n\n   \n  Since the ceasefire began last week, Hamas has carried out what it has called a “security campaign” aimed at “collaborators, mercenaries, thieves, bandits, and those cooperating with the Zionist enemy throughout the Gaza Strip.”\n \n\n   \n  The internal clashes have created a volatile security situation in the battered enclave with violence erupting between Hamas and rival groups in several areas across Gaza, including an incident that culminated in an apparent public execution of eight people in a square in Gaza City while large crowds were watching.\n \n\n   \n  Sunday’s incident brought further strain to the ceasefire, with the next steps still unresolved.\n \n\n   \n  Israel has shot and killed Palestinians it accused of approaching the Yellow Line, in what Hamas has called a “flagrant violation” of the ceasefire commitments. Israel has also accused Hamas of delaying the return of all of the deceased hostages held in Gaza as required by the deal, and has closed a key border crossing until further notice.\n \n\n   \n  Hamas has returned 12 of the 28 bodies of deceased hostages in line with the ceasefire agreement with Israel. All 12 have now been formally identified.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information and context. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Dana Karni, Alayna Treene, Sophie Tanno, and Abeer Salman contributed to this story. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/sport/baseball-mlb-alcs-blue-jays-mariners-game-6","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"07:22:00-04:00","title":"Vladimir Guerrero Jr. hits sixth homer of postseason as Blue Jays dominate Mariners to force ALCS Game 7","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Vladimir Guerrero Jr. hit his sixth home run of the 2025 postseason, helping the Toronto Blue Jays defeat the Seattle Mariners 6-2 and force a decisive Game 7 in the American League Championship Series.

the Toronto Blue Jays dominated the  Seattle Mariners  6-2 on Sunday to force Game 7 in the American League Championship Series (ALCS).\n \n\n   \n  The only major league team without a pennant, Seattle will play a Game 7 for the first time in its history Monday in Toronto. It will be the second Game 7 the Blue Jays have ever played and their first since 1985.\n \n\n   \n  The winner faces the National League champion  Los Angeles Dodgers  in the World Series with Game 1 taking place on Friday.\n \n\n   \n  Although Toronto staved off elimination admirably, the Blue Jays were given a helping hand by Seattle’s season-high three errors – two of which came moments apart in the second inning.\n \n\n   \n  First, Julio Rodríguez had a fielding error on a single from Daulton Varsho to left center-field, allowing Varsho to take second base.\n \n\n   \n  The next batter, Ernie Clement, hit a groundball to Mariners third baseman Eugenio Suárez, who ended up losing the ball on the transfer to throw.\n \n\n   \n  Addison Barger and Isiah Kiner-Falefa immediately took advantage with back-to-back RBI singles to open an early 2-0 advantage for Toronto.\n \n\n   \n  “Balls just kind of in and out of the glove there that put a couple extra guys on base,” Mariners manager Dan Wilson said, according to  NBC Sports . “Unfortunately, it led to a couple runs.”\n \n\n   \n  Barger doubled the advantage an inning later when he smacked a two-run homer to right center field.\n \n\n   \n  With a 4-0 lead by the bottom of the fifth, up stepped Guerrero Jr.\n \n\n   \n  The slugger’s solo shot to left field was his sixth homer of the playoffs and extended the Blue Jays’ lead to 5-0.\n \n\n   \n  The Mariners eventually got on the board in the sixth after Josh Naylor homered to right field. Randy Arozerana followed with a single that knocked Trey Yesavage out of the game after 87 pitches.

If the answer is yes, newly released recommendations may help relieve your symptoms.\n \n\n   \n  Kiwifruit, rye bread and high mineral-content water can help alleviate chronic constipation, according to  new dietary guidelines  copublished October 13 by the Journal of Human Nutrition and Dietetics and Neurogastroenterology & Motility.\n \n\n   \n  About  1 out of every 6 to 7 people  are affected by chronic constipation worldwide. In the United States,  9% to 20% of adults  have some form of chronic idiopathic constipation,   in which the cause of the condition   is unknown.\n \n\n   \n  Some  symptoms of chronic constipation  include having a bowel movement fewer than three times a week, hard or lumpy stool, or straining or experiencing pain when pooping.\n \n\n   \n  The guidelines “introduce foods and drinks (e.g., kiwifruit, prunes, rye bread, high mineral content water) and specific supplement interventions into clinical guidance, filling a long-standing gap between research and routine clinical advice,” lead study author Dr. Eirini Dimidi said in an email. “That will help clinicians give clearer, more targeted, and evidence-informed dietary advice, and will allow people to self-manage their symptoms more effectively.”\n \n\n   \n  The guidance applies to healthy adults with  chronic idiopathic constipation  and “did not focus on constipation secondary to other conditions (e.g., neurological disease, pregnancy), so while some recommendations may be applicable, they should be used with caution in these groups, as well as in children,” said Dimidi, an associate professor in nutritional sciences at King’s College London.\n \n\n   \n  The guidelines did not include a general recommendation for increased fiber intake in a patient’s diet. Rather, they focused on specific foods that could be beneficial, Dimidi added.\n \n\n   \n    How kiwis can keep constipation away\n \n\n   \n  Certain  lifestyle choices or situations , such as low fiber intake, dehydration, lack of exercise, or stress, can cause constipation. As a result, clinicians focus most treatment on dietary changes.\n \n\n   \n  Previous dietary advice was broad, such as telling patients to eat more fiber. But these new guidelines, Dimidi said, suggest “incorporating evidence-based foods and drinks in your diet, such as consuming 2-3 kiwifruits a day.”\n \n\n   \n  Unlike other recommended food such as prunes, kiwifruit is simple to incorporate into your diet.\n \n\n   \n  “With kiwifruit, because it’s so well-tolerated, you usually can just step right into that dose, as opposed to prunes, for example, where you want to more gradually work up to that dose of six to eight prunes per day,” said Dr. William Chey, professor and chief of gastroenterology and hepatology at the University of Michigan. He was not involved in the new research.\n \n\n   \n   Kiwis can increase stool bulk  and water content, enhance protein digestion, and smoothen the movement of food, fluids and waste in the digestive tract. The small fruits also improve the amount of time it takes for waste to pass through your intestine and have natural prebiotic effects, such as improved digestion and reduced gut inflammation.\n \n\n   \n  Kiwis are also palatable and soft, which makes them easy to eat, said Dr. Cuckoo Choudhary, the Dorrance H. Hamilton Professor of Medicine at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia. She was not involved in the study.\n \n\n   \n  You can also eat a kiwi’s skin or peel, which has extra fiber. But avoid heating a kiwi, since high temperatures destroy the enzyme that smoothens gut movement, Choudhary added.\n \n\n   \n    Don’t like kiwis? Here are some alternatives\n \n\n   \n  Foods such as prunes, rye bread, flaxseeds, oranges, yogurt, beans and oatmeal  can also help  with chronic constipation.\n \n\n   \n  For those who like dairy, you could “take a cup of yogurt, make it 8 ounces, any yogurt of your choice because all yogurts have probiotics, and take a heaped tablespoon full of crushed flaxseeds,” said Choudhary, an expert with the American Gastroenterological Association.\n \n\n   \n  Other alternatives include dietary supplements, such as  psyllium , which helps your intestine move stool along and reduces your body’s cholesterol absorption from food.\n \n\n   \n  “That dosage is at least 10 grams of fiber per day. And again, the general rule is, start low and go slow. So start with 3 grams and gradually work your way up to 10 plus grams per day of psyllium to achieve the benefits,” said Chey, incoming president of the American College of Gastroenterology.\n \n\n   \n   Physical activity  is also an important lifestyle change that patients with chronic constipation can incorporate.\n \n\n   \n  Even something as simple as walking   increases the effectiveness of the digestive tract ,  Choudhary said.\n \n\n   \n  The new recommendations were based on findings of four systematic reviews and meta-analyses that looked at over 75 randomized controlled trials of dietary interventions for chronic constipation.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/politics/tourism-shutdown-national-park-smithsonians","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-04:00","title":"Advocates and Businesses Warn of Long-Term Impact of Government Shutdown on National Parks and Tourism","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During an ongoing government shutdown, national parks including the Grand Canyon, Yosemite, and those in West Virginia remain open despite staff shortages, with no rangers, entrance fees, or emergency services.

continue to visit national parks and DC, advocates and local businesses warn about long-term impact of shutdown \n       \n  By Piper Hudspeth Blackburn, Kaanita Iyer, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EDT, Mon October 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The government shutdown didn’t deter 26-year-old Nudrat Mahajabin from visiting Grand Canyon National Park earlier this month, even though the signs were clear: No entrance fees would be collected, the visitors’ center was closed and no park rangers were nearby.\n \n\n   \n  “We had planned this trip a while back. So, there was really no going back,” she said. “I feel like a shutdown might not close the gates, but it does affect and impact the caretakers. And I guess that’s what worries me the most.”\n \n\n   \n  While many tourists like Mahajabin are yet to be discouraged by the government shutdown, national park advocates and businesses are worried about the safety of national parks and tourism’s impact on the local economies that surround them if the congressional stalemate continues.\n \n\n   \n  The shutdown, which congressional leaders do not appear close to resolving, has meant tourist destinations like the Smithsonian museums in DC are closed and 9,000 National Park Service employees are furloughed, impacting the operations of the parks. The Department of Interior is keeping many national parks partially open amid the shutdown, and some sites have gotten a boost from state funds.\n \n\n   \n  In West Virginia, where tourists typically flock for hiking, white water rafting and spotting fall foliage, New River Gorge National Park and Harpers Ferry National Historical Park are staying open using state funds because of an agreement made with the Department of Interior.\n \n\n   \n  The state’s Republican governor, Patrick Morrisey, said last week that West Virginia would keep the parks fully running through October 18 for Bridge Day, a festival where onlookers gather to see jumpers parachute off the New River Gorge Bridge.\n \n\n   \n  “We know that tourism is huge for West Virginia, bringing in billions and billions of dollars every year,” he said. “So, this was not the time to be shut down.”\n \n\n   \n  Some business owners near national parks say they have yet to take a hit, while others say they’re bracing for bigger impacts down the road if the shutdown drags on.\n \n\n   \n  Rob Dobson, the owner of West Virginia Adventures near the New River Gorge National Park, told CNN he’s not expecting a drop in reservations for white water rafting trips or cabin stays this fall.\n \n\n   \n  “This shutdown has had zero effect on us. We are open for business,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Elisabeth Barton, general manager of Echo Adventure Cooperative, a guide service in Groveland, California, told CNN that with no one collecting fees at the entrances to Yosemite, the business is “having a much busier October than we would normally have.”\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, in Washington, DC, where business leaders are worried the shutdown may deter tourists from traveling to the nation’s capital, the shutdown has been a boon for some private museums, which have seen a rise in visitors since the Smithsonian Institute was forced to  close its museums  and the National Zoo on October 12.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for Mount Vernon, the nearby home of George Washington, said the estate has seen 50% more visitors than during the first two weeks of October last year and has been averaging 100 phone calls per day. The National Law Enforcement Museum and the International Spy Museum, both private museums, also told CNN they are already seeing an uptick in visitors.\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear whether tourism overall in DC has taken a hit, nearly three weeks into the government shutdown. In the first nine days of the shutdown, total ridership on DC’s trains and buses was higher than the same period last year, according to a CNN review of  Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority’s data  on daily train station entries and bus boardings.\n \n\n   \n    Concerns about long-term impact of the shutdown\n \n\n   \n  Ferguson also warned of the shutdown’s economic impact on the nation’s capital, which  lost about $47.4 million  in revenue during the 35-day shutdown in 2018-2019.\n \n\n   \n  “Everything from the small mom-and-pop sandwich shops to the larger entities are impacted by the shutdown,” Ferguson told CNN. “We are in the prime months and weeks for convention business and tourism. So, the impact is significant.”\n \n\n   \n  And at the national parks, which have limited staffing, advocates are warning about the consequences of staying open – there are no rangers at the park entrances to collect entrance fees, and there may be delays in law enforcement and emergency responses.\n \n\n   \n  With the absence of park rangers and other Park Service employees in Yosemite, Barton, the business owner, said the park is getting a “weird contingent of folks who have a need for unfettered access, who think ‘I can do anything I want.’”\n \n\n   \n  She said there have been instances of “people being frustrated, easily tuned-up.” Her guides have witnessed people flying drones, which are generally banned in national parks. When her guides approached the operators and told them it was prohibited, she said many became hostile. She said that people are also base jumping — leaping from structures and using a parachute to descend to the ground — which is illegal.\n \n\n   \n  With these concerns in mind, the National Parks Conservation Association is asking national parks to close.\n \n\n   \n  Visitors “might be able to access beautiful places, but they’re not going to have the full experience that they’re used to at national parks. And that also means that people are not going to be getting some of the fundamental guidance,” David Lamfrom, the vice president of regional programs for the National Parks Conservation Association, told CNN, adding that staff reductions could impact safety and search-and-rescue operations.\n \n\n   \n  Emily Thompson, the executive director of the Coalition to Protect America’s National Parks, is concerned about the safety of the parks with limited staff.\n \n\n   \n  “Park rangers and Park Service employees do so much at parks regarding safety and preventative messaging,” she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Thompson’s group has already received reports of trash piling up in some national parks, an issue that arose in previous shutdowns, notably in 2018. One park ranger told CNN that as the shutdown goes on, they are increasingly worried about vandalism and trash buildup, which could create a backlog of work when the shutdown ends.\n \n\n   \n  In Colorado’s Rocky Mountain National Park, staff and volunteers from the YMCA of the Rockies are gathering to clean up trash left behind on hikes.\n \n\n   \n  “My hope in all this is that people are leaning in,” said Jason Nelson, the group’s communication’s director. “We don’t know how long this government shutdown is going to be.”\n \n\n   \n  The Interior Department told CNN earlier this month that “critical functions that protect life, property, and public health will remain in place, including visitor access in many locations, law enforcement, and emergency response.”\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, some local businesses near national parks say they are doing OK but are watching closely for impacts to their business and their communities if the shutdown drags on.\n \n\n   \n  Eddie Love, who runs Mountain Mama vacation cabins with his wife in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, told CNN bookings are down 30%, and that anecdotally, at least one person canceled because they had been furloughed due to the shutdown. While his business will be OK, fewer visitors could harm the shops in the downtown area, he noted.\n \n\n   \n  “October is usually a pretty strong month for us,” he said. “We’ll be OK even if the shutdown continues, but I know there are lots of other businesses that are a little more on the margin and might have a harder time making ends meet if it dragged on.”\n \n\n   \n  Similarly, William Torres, the owner of DC Trails — a tour bus company — told CNN the government shutdown is not a big concern “at the moment.”\n \n\n   \n  “If it keeps going and it goes on, you know, past November and into the Thanksgiving season, then it could probably affect me some,” he said.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Marshall Cohen, Brian Todd and Austin Culpepper contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/asia/japan-bear-attack-survivor-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"04:28:00-04:30","title":"Runner wrestles bear in the Japanese woods: ‘In one bite my arm was done’","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 32-year-old runner from Auckland, New Zealand, Billy Halloran, was attacked by two Asiatic black bears during a routine run in the woods near Myoko, Japan.

2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Billy Halloran knows the woods well in Myoko,  Japan ; he goes there for regular walks, runs, and even raced an ultramarathon through its rugged wilderness. But two weeks ago, he was running for his life in the same woods – after being attacked by a bear.\n \n\n   \n  Halloran was on one of his routine runs in early October when he saw something he’d never encountered before: two Asiatic black bears.\n \n\n   \n  He   immediately knew he was in trouble. Bear attacks have been  rising across Japan,  with more than 100 people injured so far this year and at least seven killed, the highest since records began in 2006. One recent deadly attack took place just a few miles from where he lives.\n \n\n   \n  Now, he was alone on the trail, kilometers away from where he’d parked his car, contemplating how to escape the two bears staring at him from bushes less than 30 meters away.\n \n\n   \n  When he tried backing away slowly, one bear began moving toward him, said the 32-year-old originally from Auckland, New Zealand. “It was around my size, it was an adult, it was at least 60 or 70 kilos (about 132 to 154 pounds),” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Halloran decided not to run, afraid it would chase and jump onto him from behind. So instead, he tried to scare it off by shouting. “I could see it was going to lunge at me – and it did.”\n \n\n   \n  He held up his arm in front of his face, “and it grabbed my arm, and I got pushed to the ground,” Halloran said.\n \n\n   \n  “Then in one bite, my arm was done.”\n \n\n   \n  The bear then attacked his leg, leaving claw punctures and scratches, before it backed off. Running on adrenaline, Halloran managed to get up, then engaged in a brief “standoff” with the bear – before it disappeared back into the bush.\n \n\n   \n  Terrified it might come back, Halloran called his wife to come and pick him up. With a broken arm and badly injured leg, he managed to run a kilometer to meet her and wait for an ambulance.\n \n\n   \n  He spoke to CNN from the hospital where he’s been recovering for the past two weeks, having had three surgeries – including a hip graft to cover a chunk of bone that had been bitten off, and the insertion of metal plates into his arm.\n \n\n   \n  A long road of recovery still awaits, including physical rehabilitation. After his last ultramarathon, he’d been hoping to train for more races – and still plans to – but knows it won’t be the same as before.\n \n\n   \n  A bigger challenge might be facing the lingering trauma of the attack, which he compared to “how someone getting attacked by a shark might feel like trying to go back surfing.”\n \n\n   \n  But he’s determined to get back to running in the woods, crediting the local community of runners that have supported him throughout his recovery. And he feels fortunate, he said, because “there’s been a lot of attacks, and some people haven’t been so lucky.”\n \n\n   \n  In recent months, other bear incidents have included bears rampaging through a supermarket, loitering outside a nursery, and severely mutilating a man while he was cleaning an outdoor bath.\n \n\n   \n   Experts say bears  are increasingly venturing out of their traditional habitats and into urban areas in search of food because climate change is interfering with the flowering and pollination of some of the animals’ traditional sources of food.\n \n\n   \n  In response to this deadly surge, the Japanese government announced on Friday that it will take tougher measures to control the bear population.\n \n\n   \n  Many residents take precautions like carrying bells or blasting music out loud to scare away bears. Next time, Halloran said he might consider carrying bear spray.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m just a bit more cautious about what I’m going to be doing,” he said. But, he quipped, winter is arriving soon – and once he heals, he’s looking forward to “some snowboarding and (getting) the mental state back a little bit more, and (getting back) into nature.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/health/vaccines-city-health-officials","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"City health officials urge vaccination, criticize federal government messaging","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"City health officials, through the Big Cities Health Coalition, are urging widespread vaccination to counter misinformation and declining trust in federal public health guidance.

vaccination, criticize federal government messaging \n       \n  By Deidre McPhillips, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EDT, Mon October 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Big Cities Health Coalition is the latest group to take a strong public stand in support of vaccination as a direct response to concerns that the federal government is limiting access and raising doubts.\n \n\n   \n  “We are united behind a simple message: get vaccinated,” the group wrote in a  statement  that was published Monday. It was signed by two dozen public health leaders from some of the nation’s largest cities, in both Democrat- and Republican-led states.\n \n\n   \n  Vaccination has saved millions of lives, they wrote, but falling vaccination rates across the country have led to more frequent outbreaks of devastating diseases such as measles and polio. They also referenced the “rapidly approaching” respiratory virus season, which brings a heavy wave of Covid-19 and flu infections.\n \n\n   \n  “We are deeply troubled by the repeated false claims about vaccines from too many federal officials, which have contributed directly to these trends,” the public health leaders wrote. “We are equally concerned about recent changes to the recommended childhood and adult immunization schedules that unnecessarily limit access to vaccines.”\n \n\n   \n  Vaccine advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  voted  last month to recommend against the combined measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (MMRV) vaccine for children younger than 4, and a new working group will convene to more broadly assess the safety, effectiveness and timing of the shots children and adolescents get, as well as whether  the schedule should be changed .\n \n\n   \n  And at a recent Cabinet meeting, President Donald Trump made  numerous false claims  about vaccines given to children, including about the size of vaccine doses and that babies get 82 vaccines in a single shot.\n \n\n   \n  As vaccination becomes increasingly politicized, city health officials say, they felt a need to speak up to protect their communities.\n \n\n   \n  “We have to make our public health decisions based on data and not on political ideology,” said Dr. Phil Huang, director of the Dallas County Health and Human Services Department. “We have to be the voices for that science and reason.”\n \n\n   \n  Multiple major medical organizations – including the  American Academy of Pediatrics  and the  American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists  – have broken from the CDC on vaccine guidance. And new  public health organizations have formed  in recent months with an aim to safeguard public health amid turmoil at the federal level.\n \n\n   \n  The Big Cities Health Coalition, with members representing about a fifth of the US population, has been working together to exchange ideas and address public health threats for more than two decades.\n \n\n   \n  But the “threats are growing and becoming more complicated,” said Dr. Raynard Washington, director of public health for Mecklenburg County, North Carolina – including from the federal government.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s a lot of conversation happening about how, in the absence of a strong federal public health system, we are able to navigate and ensure that we continue to protect public safety,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Consistency is important in public health, and the federal structure helped facilitate that, he said. But in the absence of that, coordination becomes key.\n \n\n   \n  A measles outbreak is growing quickly in the upstate region of South Carolina, just about 100 miles from Charlotte.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t have any walls to put up to keep folks from Mecklenburg going into South Carolina, or people from South Carolina going into Mecklenburg County,” Washington said. “So as a country, our local public health system is only as strong as the weakest county or jurisdiction. There is an importance of ensuring that we work collaboratively, because the boundaries that we actually exist in are only administrative.”\n \n\n   \n  More than 100 unvaccinated students in South Carolina are in quarantine because of a  measles  exposure in school – one of the many reasons why Big Cities Health Coalition emphasizes the importance of vaccination.\n \n\n   \n  Vaccines “keep classrooms safe and schools open. They allow children to spend time with friends and enjoy their favorite activities. They help parents and caregivers work to support their families,” the organizations wrote in the new letter.\n \n\n   \n  Trust also plays a key role in public health, experts say, and city health leaders want to provide reassurance to their communities.\n \n\n   \n  “CDC has been the pinnacle of our public health science up until now. Now it seems more driven by political ideology than actual data and science, so it undermines the trust,” Huang said. “We’re all having to band together and provide that credible data- and science-driven messaging.”\n \n\n   \n  A recent  KFF poll  found that public trust in the CDC is the lowest it’s been since the Covid-19 pandemic began. Only half of adults in the US say they trust the agency to provide reliable vaccine information, down from 57% in July and 63% in September 2024.\n \n\n   \n  “Despite all the chaos and mixed messages, we remain steadfast in our commitment to the health of our communities and making sure the message is clear on the importance of vaccination,” Huang said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/sport/football-nfl-week-7-sunday-review-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"05:59:00-04:00","title":"Historic and dramatic comebacks, second-year QB breaks Tom Brady record and high-profile benchings: NFL Week 7 Sunday review","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Week 7 of the 2025 NFL season was defined by dramatic comebacks, record-breaking performances, and major quarterback changes.

  \n  Here’s everything you need to know from Sunday’s action in  Week 7  of the 2025 NFL season.\n \n\n   \n    Down, but not out\n \n\n   \n  Like other weeks, Sunday was punctuated with comebacks from the most unlikely of positions.\n \n\n   \n  The most dramatic of those came in Denver where the Broncos overturned a 19-point deficit in the fourth quarter to stun the New York Giants 33-32.\n \n\n   \n  The Broncos offense had been largely lifeless through the first three quarters at Empower Field, even leading to some boos from the home crowd. The Giants, meanwhile, had rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart moving the ball and putting points on the board, throwing two touchdown passes and running back Tyrone Tracy rushing in another.\n \n\n   \n  That’s when everything went out the window.\n \n\n   \n  Second-year passer Bo Nix exploded from his slumber, throwing 16-of-25 for 174 yards and two touchdowns while also running for two scores in the fourth quarter.\n \n\n   \n  Having scored four TDs in the final quarter, the Broncos still trailed by two points following a one-yard Dart touchdown run with just 37 seconds remaining.\n \n\n   \n  But Nix connected with Marvin Mims and Courtland Sutton on deep passes to set up a Wil Lutz field goal as time expired to hand Denver a remarkable victory.\n \n\n   \n   According to the NFL , teams were 161-0 since 2007 when shutting out their opponent and leading by 18 points or more after first three quarters before Sunday. The Broncos are now the first team to overcome that deficit in NFL history.\n \n\n   \n  After the game, Nix reflected on the dramatic comeback.\n \n\n   \n  “I was thinking about how I was going to answer questions if we got shut out. It’s not where you want to be,” he told reporters. “At some point, I knew we’ve done it before in the fourth quarter.\n \n\n   \n  “We know at some point we are going to go ahead and score. It may be too late and we may not score enough, but at some point, we are going to do it. We did. We had a good drive there at the end of the third and scored quickly in the fourth. It’s almost like once we scored and got the two-point conversion we knew how to play all of a sudden. I don’t have many answers but we just kept fighting.”\n \n\n   \n  It wasn’t the only late comeback on Sunday though.\n \n\n   \n  The Green Bay Packers also scored two touchdowns in the final quarter, including one with just under two minutes left, and forced a late turnover on downs deep in their own territory to beat the Arizona Cardinals 27-23.\n \n\n   \n  The Cardinals, led by backup quarterback Jacoby Brissett, needed a touchdown on their final drive of the game to secure an unlikely victory.\n \n\n   \n  But, as had been the case throughout the game, Brissett was disrupted by a swarming Packers defense led by Micah Parsons, who was a terror all game.\n \n\n   \n  Parsons, who was traded to Green Bay from the Dallas Cowboys in a blockbuster trade ahead of the season, had his third sack of the game on Arizona’s last drive and was disruptive throughout as the Packers improved to 4-1-1 on the season and first in the NFC North division.\n \n\n   \n    Patriots QB breaks Tom Brady record\n \n\n   \n  Following Tom Brady’s departure from New England and the end of his Super Bowl-laden spell with the Patriots, the franchise has been searching for its next cornerstone quarterback.\n \n\n   \n  And if this season’s displays are anything to go by, they might’ve just found him in the form of Drake Maye.\n \n\n   \n  Maye, the No. 3 overall pick in the 2024 NFL draft, had arguably his best performance yet in a Patriots jersey on Sunday, going almost perfect in the team’s 31-13 victory over the Tennessee Titans.\n \n\n   \n  The 23-year-old threw 21-of-23 for 222 yards and two touchdowns, while also running for 62 yards on eight carries. He was poised in the pocket and made vital throws at key moments, while he was helped out by a solid running game.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps even more impressively, Maye fell to the ground and took a hard hit to the head in the second quarter, leaving the game and returning a few moments later to throw a touchdown pass to Austin Hooper.\n \n\n   \n  In his excellent performance, Maye hit two historic milestones.\n \n\n   \n  He became first player in the Super Bowl era to complete 90% of his passes, throw for over 200 yards and rush for over 50 yards in a single game.\n \n\n   \n  More notably for the Patriots, his 91.3 completion percentage broke Brady’s  franchise record of 88.5% , which he set against the Jacksonville Jaguars in 2009.\n \n\n   \n  Maye said after the game that it comes as a result of the whole team improving together.\n \n\n   \n  “I think we’ve just grown as an organization. I think with (head) coach (Mike) Vrabel and his staff I think we’re just buying into each other and build an identity,” Maye told reporters. “And I think that’s what’s kind of the biggest thing for me is trying to be the same player every week.”\n \n\n   \n  Sunday’s performance continues Maye’s breakout season with the Patriots and gave head coach Mike Vrabel a victory in his first game against the franchise who fired him in January 2024.\n \n\n   \n  Some Titans fans could be heard chanting Vrabel’s name as the game went on, with some even holding up signs apologizing to him for how his time in Tennessee ended.\n \n\n   \n  “I didn’t get that many tickets, I don’t know …,” Vrabel said of the chants. “I’m happy for our players. I think these guys they’re figuring out how to win, they’re figuring out how to practice. I guess it’s humbling to have these people whoever that is cheer for us whether that’s the Patriots or Drake Maye or me or anybody else.”\n \n\n   \n    Benchings\n \n\n   \n  While some teams are on the up, for others, the season might already be over.\n \n\n   \n  Take the Miami Dolphins and New York Jets for instance. The two AFC East rivals are a combined 1-13 after each suffered a humbling loss Sunday to the Cleveland Browns and Carolina Panthers, respectively.\n \n\n   \n  For Miami, it was a disaster from start to finish, with quarterback Tua Tagovailoa throwing three interceptions for the second straight week, including one which was returned for a touchdown.\n \n\n   \n  Tagovailoa’s performance was so catastrophic that he was benched in the fourth quarter for seventh-round rookie Quinn Ewers.\n \n\n   \n  There were very few positives to take from the 31-6 defeat to the Browns for head coach Mike McDaniel – the team suffered errors on defense, turnovers on offense and key penalties throughout – with pressure ramping up on his position.\n \n\n   \n  The vibes are arguably worse with the Jets who remained the only winless team at 0-7 in the NFL after their 13-6 home loss to the Panthers.\n \n\n   \n  Once again, the Jets defense showed up, but the offense failed to pick up its end of the bargain. It got so bad that New York quarterback Justin Fields was benched at halftime after struggling in the first half.\n \n\n   \n  Over the first two quarters against Carolina, Fields went 6-of-12 on his pass attempts for 46 yards and added 22 rushing yards on four carries, leading an offense which totaled 97 yards during his time on the field.\n \n\n   \n  Fields was replaced by Tyrod Taylor who was able to move the ball more effectively but threw two costly interceptions.\n \n\n   \n  When asked about the quarterback change after the game, head coach Aaron Glenn said his team “needed a spark.”\n \n\n   \n  “I felt that it was the right time to do it,” Glenn explained. “It’s a tough situation for both of those guys, but it was my call. It was my call and I felt it was the right time to do it.”\n \n\n   \n  The loss was even more damning for first-year head coach Glenn given the fact that Carolina lost starting QB Bryce Young to an ankle injury midway through the second half and was still able to hold out for a first win on the road this season.\n \n\n   \n  Fields signed a two-year, $40 million contract with the Jets in the offseason but Glenn was noncommittal about who the team’s starting quarterback going forward will be.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ll make the call,” Glenn said, “but there’s a lot of conversation I got to have with myself to see what can I do to make sure that we give us a chance to win.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ll make the right decision. Whatever the decision is, I’m going to go with it and we’re going to move forward.”\n \n\n   \n    Full Week 7 Sunday scores\n \n\n   \n   Home vs. away (winners in bold) \n \n\n   \n  Jacksonville Jaguars 7-35  Los Angeles Rams  (in London, UK)\n \n\n   \n   Chicago Bears  26-14 New Orleans Saints\n \n\n   \n   Cleveland Browns  31-6 Miami Dolphins\n \n\n   \n   Kansas City Chiefs  31-0 Las Vegas Raiders\n \n\n   \n  Minnesota Vikings 22-28  Philadelphia Eagles  \n \n\n   \n  New York Jets 6-13  Carolina Panthers \n \n\n   \n  Tennessee Titans 13-31  New England Patriots \n \n\n   \n   Denver Broncos  33-32 New York Giants\n \n\n   \n  Los Angeles Chargers 24-38  Indianapolis Colts \n \n\n   \n  Arizona Cardinals 23-27  Green Bay Packers \n \n\n   \n   Dallas Cowboys  44-22 Washington Commanders\n \n\n   \n   San Francisco 49ers  20-10 Atlanta Falcons\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/style/ddlj-bollywood-30-years-anniversary-intl-hnk-dst","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"02:05:00-04:00","title":"Why a Bollywood classic about forbidden love still captivates Indian movie-goers 30 years on","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the enduring cultural significance of the 1995 Bollywood film 'Diwale Dulhania Le Jayenge' (DDLJ), which has been screened daily at the Maratha Mandir theater in Mumbai for nearly 30 years.

still captivates Indian movie-goers 30 years on \n       \n  By Rhea Mogul and Ayushi Shah, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:05 AM EDT, Mon October 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Inside the Maratha Mandir movie theater, audience members jump to their feet as the first notes of an iconic mandolin riff play, their bodies casting silhouettes against the opening credits of a film screened here   nearly every day for 30 years.\n \n\n   \n  A joyous, collective roar erupts from the rows as the lead actors share their first fated glance. Near the front, a young couple mirrors that gaze, their wedding photographer capturing a timeless moment against the iconic backdrop.\n \n\n   \n  Governments have fallen, and a new millennium has dawned, yet people still come to this Mumbai cinema to immerse themselves in the comfort of a love story known by heart, for less than $1 a ticket.\n \n\n   \n  Released in 1995, “Diwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,” commonly referred to as “DDLJ,” tells the story of two young Indians, Raj Malhotra and Simran Singh, raised in London, who fall for each other during a freewheeling trip across Europe, only to face the ultimate test – earning her father’s approval. It became a cultural touchstone and the second-highest-grossing film of its decade.\n \n\n   \n  Since then, the cinema’s daily showing has drawn young Indians dreaming of their own epic romance, those seeking a brief escape from the pressures of city life in Mumbai, and curious tourists who want to see the fandom up close.\n \n\n   \n  “I watch it almost every day,” said Suneel Shedge, a 50-year-old diamond worker from a nearby neighborhood who speaks with leading man charisma, and is prone to bursting into songs from the movie. As the film hits its three-decade anniversary this month, he has come to pay homage to what he considers Bollywood’s greatest love story.\n \n\n   \n  “Sometimes I cry, sometimes there’s pain. There’s happiness, there’s sadness,” he said. “A movie like this will never be made ever again.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s the “most beautiful love story,” said 23-year-old Vaishnavi Deshmukh, who has lost count of how many times she has seen the film.\n \n\n   \n  “I can’t explain how I feel,” her boyfriend, Tejas Raout, 23, said. “It’s nostalgia.”\n \n\n   \n  In many ways, “DDLJ’s” narrative mirrors India’s own pivotal journey in the early 1990s — a nation shaking off its socialist slumber, opening its arms to the world, and finding a confident new voice that was both global in its outlook and Indian at its core.\n \n\n   \n  This cultural resonance also had a seismic effect on its cast. The film catapulted Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol, who played lovers in the film, from rising stars into cinema royalty, cementing them as the definitive on-screen couple for years to come.\n \n\n   \n  Yet, pinning down the exact formula which created this cultural phenomenon is impossible, said prominent Indian film critic and writer, Anupama Chopra.\n \n\n   \n  You can’t attribute its success to “just one single thing,” the author of “Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge: A Modern Classic,” which analyzes the film’s commercial triumph, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “When the cinema gods deem that you create a classic, the stars align. Everybody’s stars align. And you get a film like this, which I think becomes a romantic blueprint for many generations.”\n \n\n   \n    Capturing the national zeitgeist\n \n\n   \n  In 1995, India was a nation beaming with endless possibility.\n \n\n   \n  Four years after the floodgates of economic liberalization had been thrown open, the country was in the midst of a cultural awakening. The state-run Doordarshan, which aired a mix of entertainment and news, was now competing with the vibrant pulse of MTV and Star TV, while the Indian-manufactured Ambassador car vied for space on the road with models made by Japan’s Maruti and South Korea’s Daewoo. On giant billboards towering over cities, Coca-Cola returned to wage war against Pepsi, and the American daytime soap opera “The Bold and the Beautiful” had become a household name.\n \n\n   \n  This influx of choice created a thrilling but anxious juxtaposition: Indians were captivated by globalization but also fearful of losing their own identity.\n \n\n   \n  Into this cultural moment, stepped filmmaker Aditya Chopra (no relation to film critic Anupama Chopra), the son of the late Yash Chopra — Bollywood’s legendary “King of Romance.”\n \n\n   \n  “In the ’90s, the mood was about aspiration. The mood was about looking westward,” he said in the 2023 Netflix docuseries, “The Romantics,” which chronicles his family’s contribution to Indian cinema.\n \n\n   \n  In his early twenties, Aditya Chopra had an idea for his directorial debut: a script he wrote that would capture the energy of his own generation.\n \n\n   \n  In “DDLJ,” Simran, the devoted daughter of Baldev Singh, a hardworking owner of a corner shop, is initially not attracted to Raj, the low-achieving but fun-loving son of a wealthy immigrant. As they dance and sing their way through Switzerland, however, they eventually fall in love. But Simran’s stern, conservative father, has already arranged her marriage to another man.\n \n\n   \n  “Love was always rebellious, against the parents,” Aditya Chopra said of other films at the time. “That always bothered me.”\n \n\n   \n  So, instead of eloping in defiance of tradition, the charming Raj embarks on a mission to win Simran’s father’s approval in elaborate, often comedic ways. Simran, on the other hand, struggles between her duty as a daughter and her desire to marry the man she loves.\n \n\n   \n  In the film’s climax, Baldev looks at his daughter and grants her his blessing. “Go, Simran, go. Live your life,” he says. What follows is an iconic sequence, captured in slow-motion: Simran’s desperate sprint down a train platform after ditching the planned wedding, her traditional bridal attire and thick, black hair billowing in the wind, Raj’s hand outstretched from the carriage door, his face bloodied after a fight with Simran’s doomed fiancé, and the triumphant embrace as he pulls her up to safety.\n \n\n   \n  The first half of the film unfolds in the cosmopolitan landscapes of London and continental Europe, while the second half transports the audience to the agrarian fields of India’s Punjab state.\n \n\n   \n  The characters take elements of Western culture to India, including the clothes they wear and their attitude towards love in a society where, in the mid-nineties, many parents claimed the right to choose — and veto — potential spouses.\n \n\n   \n  The central conflict captivated the nation back then and continues to resonate with many young Indians today. For viewers like Deshmukh, who was at the Maratha Mandir screening, the takeaway is clear: “Parents matter the most,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The score, composed by the duo Jatin-Lalit, created an enduring legacy, producing an all-hit album whose songs became timeless anthems for romance and celebration. All these years later, people “watch it for the music,” said Lalit Pandit.\n \n\n   \n  “I could feel right away this wasn’t just another film,” Manish Malhotra, the designer behind the movie’s costumes, told CNN. “(Aditya Chopra) was a first-time director, yes, but the way he spoke about Raj and Simran was so vivid, emotional, and precise that you almost saw the film come alive in that very moment.”\n \n\n   \n  Malhotra, who went on to become one of India’s leading fashion designers, was particularly inspired by the duality at the heart of the film’s message, which he channeled directly into Simran’s wardrobe. He looked at her “not just as a heroine, but as a young woman caught between London and Punjab, her wardrobe needing to echo both her Western upbringing and her Indian soul.”\n \n\n   \n  Simran wore short skirts and halter dresses, reflecting what young Indian women were wearing in the West. Meanwhile, “every pastel salwar, every floral skirt, every dupatta drape was about telling her story with authenticity,” he said, referring to some of her traditional Indian outfits.\n \n\n   \n  On the film’s impact, Malhotra admits he couldn’t have predicted its eventual scale. “But I did know it was special,” he said. “Because when you connect to a story that deeply, when the characters feel that real, the work flows with sincerity. And that sincerity has a way of staying with people long after the film is over.”\n \n\n   \n    Impact on future romance films\n \n\n   \n  “DDLJ” was the first mainstream Bollywood film not just to represent Indians living overseas but place their unique cultural conflict at the very core of its narrative.\n \n\n   \n  Prior to the film’s release, Indians abroad were rarely heroes in Bollywood movies. They were confined to negative archetypes: the villain who had lost his Indian values, or the seductress whose drinking and smoking habits signaled moral corruption.\n \n\n   \n  “One of the reasons that ‘DDLJ’ is so amazing is that there’s a piece of everybody there in it,” said Snighda Sur, founder & CEO of The Juggernaut, a media platform that writes stories about South Asia and the South Asian diaspora.\n \n\n   \n  “If you’re very Indian, and if you’re very nationalist… this film is about returning home to India… and getting permission the right way. If you’re a diaspora kid, you’re saying ‘we haven’t forgotten our traditions,’” she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “You see two people who really want to be together, fighting for something they believe in. For Indians, and specifically from my experience… that’s the story of my life,” said Indian Canadian YouTuber Lilly Singh in the “The Romantics.” “I know, deep down, I really seek my parents’ approval. And that’s why the ending of ‘DDLJ’ meant so much to me.”\n \n\n   \n  The wider Indian diaspora’s connection to the movie was immediately tangible and reflected in the box office numbers at the time. Made on a budget of less than half a million dollars, “DDLJ” earned nearly $2 million overseas,  according to  movie analyst Taran Adarsh. Back home, it became a blockbuster hit and the highest grossing film of 1995.\n \n\n   \n  But beyond numbers, it created the blueprint for the modern Indian film that would dominate Bollywood for the next decade; “a watershed moment,” according to the author Anupama Chopra.\n \n\n   \n  The cinematic landscape prior to “DDLJ” was defined by two prevalent narratives. There was the “angry young man”— a working-class protagonist, typically a victim of a corrupt system, whose story was driven by a quest for vengeance or social justice. Then there were the family melodramas centered on romances thwarted by stark class divides. Crucially, both worlds were almost exclusively rooted in India.\n \n\n   \n  Aspects of “DDLJ’s” s storyline influenced a string of future blockbusters, from “Pardes” (1997), which explored the search for a traditional bride for a Westernized son; the grand family saga “Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham” (2001), centered on a wealthy patriarch’s disapproval of his son’s marriage to a commoner and set between London and New Delhi; and “Kal Ho Naa Ho” (2003), which tells the story of love and sacrifice within New York’s vibrant Indian community.\n \n\n   \n  “DDLJ” also launched the legendary on-screen pairing of Khan and Kajol, who have starred in seven major films together, setting the gold standard for Bollywood romance for decades to come.\n \n\n   \n  “When you keep repeating (their pairing) and it keeps attracting an audience, it cements their position,” Anupama Chopra said. “And off the top of my head, I can’t think of any pairing that had that sort of longevity.”\n \n\n   \n    A step back in time\n \n\n   \n  Back at the Maratha Mandir, walking into the screening of “DDLJ” feels like stepping into a time capsule.\n \n\n   \n  A living museum of a bygone era, the building is an unassuming structure, its age showing in dilapidated sections and torn posters clinging to its gates. Inside, faded red leather seats evoke a classic, old-world ambiance. Popcorn and chips are still sold in simple, vacuum-sealed plastic bags.\n \n\n   \n  “People from all around the world come here,” said its manager Manoj Pandey, who has been working at the institution for 15 years. “When the movie came out in 1995, no one thought we’d be here watching it 30 years later… But it was definitely right after the opening that it was going to become a blockbuster and have a long life.”\n \n\n   \n  They still sell about 100 tickets a day, he said.\n \n\n   \n  The theater’s owner briefly flirted with the idea of stopping the show in 2015. But the announcement was met with outcry from the public. “We received hundreds of letters in protest,” said Pandey.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, Khan and Kajol reunited on stage for the Filmfare Awards, one of India’s most notable annual events that honors excellence in Hindi cinema, where they danced to one of movie’s most beloved songs, “Tujhe Dekha Toh,” which translates to “When I See You.”\n \n\n   \n  Yet, for all the love and adoration, there are moments from the film that haven’t aged so well, according to some fans.\n \n\n   \n  Viewed through a contemporary lens, the film’s gender politics feel dated, said “The Juggernaut’s” Sur, particularly in a scene where Raj gaslights a panicked Simran into believing they slept together after a night of drinking.

\nUpdated: \n        5:10 AM EDT, Mon October 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump on Sunday threatened to send the National Guard to San Francisco as his administration continues an effort to crackdown on a growing list of cities it claims to be ridden with crime.\n \n\n   \n  “San Francisco was truly one of the great cities of the world, and then 15 years ago it went wrong, it went woke,” Trump said during an interview with Fox News anchor Maria Bartiromo Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to San Francisco and we’re going to make it great.”\n \n\n   \n  “Nobody wants you here,” California Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a  social media post  in response to Trump’s comments. “You will ruin one of America’s greatest cities.”\n \n\n   \n  The president told Bartiromo the cities he feels are in need of troop deployment are almost exclusively “Democrat-run,” describing them as “unsafe” and “a disaster.” Trump also claimed he could, at any moment, invoke the  Insurrection Act  – a seldom-used law that allows the president to deploy military forces in the US in certain limited situations.\n \n\n   \n  The mobilization of National Guard troops to cities like Chicago, Memphis, Tennessee, and Portland, Oregon, has been met with fierce backlash from residents as well as local and state leaders – including some who have gone so far as to sue the administration.\n \n\n   \n  Federal deployments have also sparked pop-up protests in these cities and helped fuel a second  “No Kings” rally  over the weekend, where millions took part in more than 2,700 events across the country to protest the Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s the latest on Trump’s efforts to federalize troops in several US cities:\n \n\n   \n    San Francisco\n \n\n   \n  Trump toyed with the idea of deploying federal troops to the Bay Area last week when he told FBI Director Kash Patel that San Francisco was among the “great cities that can be fixed.”\n \n\n   \n  “San Francisco neither needs nor wants Trump’s personal army on our streets,” California state Senator Scott Wiener, whose district includes San Francisco,  said on X . “We don’t need Trump’s authoritarian crackdown in our city. Bottom line: Stay the hell out of San Francisco.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump initially received support from Bay area tech billionaire and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, who told the New York Times ahead of his “Dreamforce” AI conference last week, he backed Trump’s troop deployment to the city. But Benioff later backtracked,  saying on X  he does not believe the National Guard is needed to address safety in San Francisco and his comments were made out of “an abundance of caution around the event.”\n \n\n   \n  “I sincerely apologize for the concern it caused,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie has not directly commented on Trump’s comments, but said in a news conference last Friday crime in the city is  down 30%  – the lowest point in decades.\n \n\n   \n  The city has faced a shortage of police officers but recently reported its largest surge of recruits in years, according to the  San Francisco Police Department , with 3,375 entry-level applications so far this year, up more than 40% from last year.\n \n\n   \n  For his part, Newsom  sued the Trump administration  in June over the federalization of the California National Guard to quell protests in Los Angeles and joined a  lawsuit in Oregon  earlier this month over Trump’s attempt to send federalized troops in Los Angeles to Portland to respond to protests there.\n \n\n   \n    Memphis\n \n\n   \n  A group of seven elected officials in Tennessee filed a lawsuit against the state’s governor and attorney general last week, challenging the deployment of the Tennessee National Guard to Memphis at the direction of Trump.\n \n\n   \n  “Governor Lee’s deployment violates both the Tennessee Constitution and state statutes, which allow the Guard to be called up only in the event of a rebellion or invasion—and only when the General Assembly declares that public safety requires it,” the officials said in a  statement published  by the National Immigration Law Center.\n \n\n   \n  “No such conditions exist in Memphis today.”\n \n\n   \n  Federal troops were seen in Memphis for the first time on October 10,  the Associated Press reported , including soldiers accompanied by Memphis police officers patrolling at the Pyramid, an iconic landmark in the city.\n \n\n   \n  Memphis  Mayor Paul Young,  defended the city, noting crime has fallen by double-digit percentages since last year, but acknowledged the situation is different from efforts to fight the federalization of troops in Portland or Chicago,  CNN affiliate WMC  reported.\n \n\n   \n  “Memphis is different than L.A. and Chicago or Portland in that the governor of Tennessee and the president of the United States made the decision to bring the National Guard and the federal resources to the City of Memphis,”  Young said Wednesday .\n \n\n   \n  Memphis Police Chief Cerelyn “CJ” Davis said last week she hoped troops would help direct traffic and have a presence in public retail spaces, but not operate at checkpoints, the AP reported.\n \n\n   \n  “From a public safety standpoint, we’re trying to utilize Guard personnel in non-enforcement types of capacities, so it does not feel like there is this over-militarization in our communities, in our neighborhoods, and that’s not where we’re directing those resources, either,” she said.\n \n\n   \n    Chicago\n \n\n   \n  Trump last Friday urged the Supreme Court to allow him to  deploy the National Guard in Chicago , putting the legal fight over his ability to use those troops on American soil before the justices for the first time.\n \n\n   \n  The  emergency appeal  follows a series of decisions from lower federal courts which temporarily blocked the administration’s efforts to mobilize troops.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, the Chicago-based 7th US Circuit Court of Appeals let stand an order temporarily blocking that effort.\n \n\n   \n  In Trump’s appeal, the administration said the lower court order “improperly impinges on the president’s authority and needlessly endangers federal personnel and property.”\n \n\n   \n  The appeal describes the situation in Chicago as threatening, asserting that federal officials there have been “assaulted, attacked in a harrowing pre-planned ambush involving many assailants.”\n \n\n   \n  Clashes between protesters and law enforcement in Chicago became the focus of courtroom discussions last week with a judge  demanding answers  from federal authorities over violent encounters with protesters.\n \n\n   \n  US District Judge Sara Ellis said recent news reports were leading her to believe the Trump administration was not following her instructions to limit use of force and actions against journalists documenting Chicago protests.\n \n\n   \n  Ellis last week expanded her restraining order, requiring all federal agents with body cameras involved in quelling protests to have them on when encountering demonstrators.\n \n\n   \n  Her order, however, does not require agents to wear body cameras if they’re undercover, not in uniform or exempt from Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement or Department of Homeland Security policy.\n \n\n   \n    Portland\n \n\n   \n  A three-judge panel with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals is weighing whether the Trump administration should be blocked from deploying the Oregon National Guard to respond to ICE protests in Portland, after US District Judge Karin Immergut last week  ruled to extend  her temporary restraining order barring the deployment of federal troops to Portland.\n \n\n   \n  “Regardless of what happens next, Oregon (Department of Justice) will continue to fight to uphold Oregon’s laws and the Constitution,” Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield said in a  social media post  Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  The president has cited  protests outside  Portland’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility to justify the callups of troops in the deep blue city.\n \n\n   \n  Leaders in Oregon have  emphatically disputed  the president’s characterizations of the city as “war-ravaged” and uncontrollably violent, arguing in court the situation on the ground in Portland is nowhere as extreme as federal officials portray it to be.\n \n\n   \n  Protests in Oregon’s biggest city over White House immigration policies started in June, with a declared  riot  and  arson  arrests in mid-summer. The scene was  largely calm  until Trump  declared  in late September he was sending 200 Oregon National Guard troops to the city.\n \n\n   \n  In a  letter sent Friday  to the Defense Department Office of Inspector General, a group of senators, including those from Oregon, asked for an inquiry into recent deployments of National Guard troops across the country.\n \n\n   \n  The senators argued that deployments were “fundamentally un-Constitutional, dangerous for American civil rights” and risk “straining military readiness and resources,” according to the letter.\n \n\n   \n  “We urgently request that you initiate an inquiry into the cumulative effects of these domestic deployments of U.S. active-duty troops and the National Guard—over the objections of state and local officials—on military readiness, resources, personnel, and our military as an institution,” the senators requested.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/19/sport/nfl-buccaneers-doug-martin-dies","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"10:40:00.000-04:00","title":"Former Buccaneers All-Pro Running Back Doug Martin Dies at 36","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Doug Martin, a former All-Pro running back with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, died at the age of 36.

But Paz’s party does not hold a majority in the country’s legislature, which will force him to forge alliances to govern effectively.\n \n\n   \n  The new president takes office on November 8.\n \n\n   \n  The 58-year-old senator’s win marks a historic shift for the South American country, governed almost continuously since 2006 by Bolivia’s Movement to Socialism, or MAS, which once enjoyed overwhelming support from the country’s Indigenous majority.\n \n\n   \n  Paz’s moderate platform — pledging to maintain social programs while promoting private sector-led growth — appeared to resonate with left-leaning voters disillusioned by the ruling MAS, founded by former President Evo Morales, but wary of Quiroga’s proposed austerity measures.\n \n\n   \n  Support for MAS cratered in the August first round amid a  deepening economic crisis .\n \n\n   \n  “This election marks a political turning point,” said Glaeldys Gonzalez Calanche, analyst for the Southern Andes at International Crisis Group. “Bolivia is heading in a new direction,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Both runoff candidates pledged to strengthen diplomatic ties with Washington — strained since 2009 — and seek US-backed financial support to stabilize Bolivia’s fragile economy.\n \n\n   \n  In late September, Paz unveiled plans for a $1.5 billion economic cooperation deal with US officials to ensure fuel supplies.\n \n\n   \n  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said this week that both presidential candidates “want stronger, better relations with the United States,” after decades of anti-American leadership. “This election is a transformative opportunity,” he said on October 15.\n \n\n   \n  Outside a polling station in La Paz, Lourdes Mendoza said she had grown weary of the MAS era. “My children were born and raised with a single government,” she said. “I hope they can see other possibilities and alternatives.”\n \n\n   \n    Voters want economic change\n \n\n   \n  Bolivia’s fragile economy dominated the runoff campaign. Once plentiful natural gas exports have plummeted, inflation is at a 40-year high, and fuel is scarce.\n \n\n   \n  Both candidates campaigned to roll back elements of the MAS era, state-led model, but differed over how drastically. Paz favored gradual reform, including tax incentives for small businesses and regional fiscal autonomy, while Quiroga proposed sweeping cuts and an IMF bailout.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going for a new stage of Bolivian democracy in the 21st century,” Paz told Reuters two days before the election at his family’s ranch in the southern gas-producing region of Tarija.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to try to build an economy for the people,” he said, one where “the state is no longer going to be the central axis.”\n \n\n   \n  Some voters said they were not convinced that his victory represented a true break from MAS: “I think he’s a puppet of the outgoing government,” said 21-year-old Esther Miranda from La Paz, who works in a nail salon.\n \n\n   \n    Running mate’s populist appeal boosts Paz\n \n\n   \n  Paz’s campaign was boosted by his running mate Edman Lara, a former police officer known for viral TikTok videos exposing corruption. Lara’s populist appeal helped Paz connect with younger and working-class voters, analysts said.\n \n\n   \n  Economists warn the incoming administration faces immediate challenges, including securing fuel supplies and building coalitions in a fragmented legislature.\n \n\n   \n  Outgoing hydrocarbons minister Alejandro Gallardo said last week that the state energy company was struggling to obtain foreign currency for fuel imports.\n \n\n   \n  Paz told Reuters he was already addressing the issue through deferred payment agreements with fuel suppliers to ensure diesel and gasoline arrive within days of his inauguration.\n \n\n   \n  Paz said he would also begin phasing out universal fuel subsidies. Targeted support would go to vulnerable groups, while bigger industries such as agribusiness would pay market rates for fuel.\n \n\n   \n  “The market will have to adjust prices, but there are sectors that will have government support until the economy is reactivated,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Bolivia’s main labor union, the Central Obrera Boliviana (COB), has previously warned it would oppose any threats to the social and economic gains achieved so far, in a sign of the juggling act for Paz’s government to avoid street protests.\n \n\n   \n  Paz’s PDC won 49 of 130 seats in the lower house and 16 of 36 in the Senate, just ahead of Quiroga’s coalition, which secured 43 seats in the lower house and 12 in the Senate.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/19/china/plane-slides-off-runway-hong-kong-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"11:41:00-04:00","title":"Two Killed as Cargo Plane Skids Off Runway into the Sea in Hong Kong","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A cargo plane operated by Turkish cargo carrier ACT Airlines skidded off the runway at Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) during a landing from Dubai around 3:50 a.m. local time, breaking in two and colliding with an airport security patrol car.

treasures \n       \n  By Lex Harvey, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:22 AM EDT, Mon October 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Precious artifacts  snatched from Paris’s Louvre Museum  Sunday include an emerald necklace set among more than 1,000 diamonds gifted by Napoleon to his second wife and other treasures of “inestimable” value.\n \n\n   \n  The thieves targeted the Louvre’s Apollo Gallery on the upper floor, which houses the French Crown Jewels, breaking into two high-security display cases and stealing nine items, according to a press release from France’s culture ministry.\n \n\n   \n  One item, an ornate gold crown worn by Empress Eugénie, during her reign in the 1800s, was recovered near the scene, the ministry said.\n \n\n   \n  Art recovery expert Arthur Brand said the thieves stole important pieces of history in what was a “national disaster” for France.\n \n\n   \n  “These are the crown jewels from Napoleon, his wife and his successors. So these are the natural pride of France,” Brand told CNN. “It’s a great loss.” Because the pieces are so recognizable, he said the thieves will likely dismantle them, sell the jewels and melt down the gold and silver.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what was stolen:\n \n\n   \n    A sapphire diadem, necklace and single earring worn by several queens\n \n\n   \n  This diamond and sapphire jewelry set worn by Hortense de Beauharnais, Queen of Holland; Marie-Amélie, Queen of the French; and Isabelle d’Orléans, Duchess of Guise is among the items snatched by four thieves during the  7-minute heist. \n \n\n   \n  The diadem — a jeweled headpiece worn by royalty — features 24 Ceylon sapphires and 1,083 diamonds that can be detached and worn as brooches, according to the Louvre.\n \n\n   \n  The origins of the set are unknown, though some suggest it once belonged to Queen Marie Antoinette. While the jewelry bears no hallmarks of the most famous French jewelers of the era, it is indicative of the craftmanship of Parisian artisans of the early 19th century, the museum said. The set stayed with the Orléans family until 1985, when it was acquired by the Louvre.\n \n\n   \n    An emerald necklace and earrings gifted by Napoleon to Marie-Louise\n \n\n   \n  A wedding gift from Napoleon to his second wife, Marie-Louise of Austria, in March 1810, this ornate set was crafted by the jeweler François-Régnault Nitot includes 32 intricately cut emeralds and 1,138 diamonds.\n \n\n   \n  After Napoleon’s empire collapsed, Marie-Louise bequeathed the original set, which also included a tiara, to a relative, and it was passed through generations of her descendants.\n \n\n   \n  In 1953, the set was sold to jeweler Van Cleef & Arpels, after which the emeralds of the tiara were sold and later replaced with turquoise stones by an American collector. The altered tiara is now a part of the Smithsonian collection.\n \n\n   \n  The necklace and earrings, however, were preserved in their original form and sold to the Louvre in 2004 for a reported 3.7 million euros ($4.3 million).\n \n\n   \n    The reliquary brooch\n \n\n   \n  Empress Eugénie, wife of Napoleon III, was the original owner of this  diamond-encrusted brooch,  which was crafted by Paul-Alfred Bapst in 1855 specially for her, according to the Louvre’s website.\n \n\n   \n  A Spanish countess, Eugénie was Empress of the French from 1853-1870 and considered one of the most fashionable women of the time.\n \n\n   \n  A reliquary brooch is a brooch that holds a sacred relic, a symbol of Eugénie’s Catholic faith. Comprised of 94 diamonds, the brooch includes the 17th and 18th Mazarin diamonds, which were given to King Louis XIV by former chief minister Cardinal Mazarin in 1661, according to the museum.\n \n\n   \n  These large stones mirror each other at the center of the brooch. Beautiful engravings of foliage and leaves decorate the back of the golden brooch, which was acquired by the Louvre in 1887.\n \n\n   \n    A diamond bow brooch and diadem of Empress Eugénie\n \n\n   \n  The  silver, gold and diamond bow brooch  originally formed the buckle of a diamond belt of 4,000 stones which was exhibited at the Universal Exhibition of 1855, before it was worn by Empress Eugénie, according to the Louvre’s website.\n \n\n   \n  Eugénie is said to have worn the belt, crafted by François Kramer, during a visit by Queen Victoria to the Palace of Versailles in August 1855, and again in June 1856 for the baptism of the Prince Imperial. Eugénie later decided to transform the belt into a brooch and had one of her own jewelers fashion it into a more elaborate standalone piece, adding cascading diamond tassels.\n \n\n   \n  In 1887, the brooch was purchased by jeweler Emile Schlesinger for New York socialite Caroline Astor at auction for 42,200 French francs, according to auction house Christie’s.\n \n\n   \n  The brooch remained in the Astor family for more than a century until the Louvre bought it in 2008, returning the brooch to France. The museum paid 6.72 million euros (more than $10 million at the time) for the brooch,  according to the Fondation  Napoleon . \n \n\n   \n  The pearl diadem was made for Eugénie by jeweler Alexandre-Gabriel Lemonnier in 1853 and contains 212 pearls and 1,998 diamonds,  according to the Louvre. \n \n\n   \n    Stolen but recovered: Eugénie’s crown\n \n\n   \n  Thieves attempted to steal Empress Eugénie’s crown, but it was found outside the Louvre, according to France’s culture ministry,\n \n\n   \n  The ornate gold piece, which features 1,354 diamonds and 56 emeralds, was damaged in the heist, according to French TV station TF1 and newspaper Le Parisien.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/politics/abortion-politics-democrats-virginia-new-jersey","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Democrats Are Talking About Abortion on the Campaign Trail Again","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the 2025 U.S. off-year elections, Democrats are re-introducing abortion rights as a central campaign issue, despite emphasizing economic affordability, to counter Republican positions and maintain voter trust.

In Pennsylvania, where three state Supreme Court justices are facing  a retention vote , Democrats are pointing to abortion as one of the issues at stake. And in California, Planned Parenthood and Reproductive Freedom for All are part of the coalition backing a ballot initiative to enact a  Democratic gerrymander  in response to Republican mid-cycle redistricting.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s been a lot of armchair politics talk from so-called pundits about whether or not the party is talking too much about social issues, not about economic issues,” said Mini Timmaraju, the president of Reproductive Freedom for All, which is investing $5 million into 2025 races. “We’re not seeing it that way, and I don’t think any candidates who are actually running see it that way either.”\n \n\n   \n  If Virginia Democrats maintain control of the House of Delegates this year — the state Senate is not up for election — they will aim to create a ballot measure next year enshrining abortion rights into the state Constitution.\n \n\n   \n  The question is whether Republicans will be able to neutralize the issue to the extent Donald Trump did during his race against Kamala Harris. The president, who appointed three of the Supreme Court justices who struck Roe v. Wade, said during the 2024 campaign that he would leave abortion policy “to the states.”\n \n\n   \n  “If there were more single-issue, pro-choice voters, Kamala Harris would be president and the Democrats would control the Senate and the House,” said Mike DuHaime, a Republican strategist who previously worked with former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.\n \n\n   \n  Since taking office, Trump  stopped Medicaid funding  from going to Planned Parenthood and federal health regulators have opened a study into the safety of  the abortion drug mifepristone , raising concerns among abortion-rights advocates that the US might impose new limits on drugs used by women in states that ban or sharply restrict abortion.\n \n\n   \n  Those advocates say there’s still an opportunity to contrast the positions of the two parties.\n \n\n   \n  “It would be a mistake to learn the wrong lessons of 2024,” said Fatima Goss Graves, president of the National Women’s Law Center Action Fund.\n \n\n   \n    Democrats talk about abortion rights and affordability\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger has spent most of her campaign running on affordability, including her plans to reduce health care, housing and energy costs.\n \n\n   \n  But of the $11 million she’s spent on TV ads this year, $1.1 million has gone toward ads in the last 30 days on Earle-Sears’ abortion stance, according to data from media tracking firm AdImpact.\n \n\n   \n  In a new digital ad for Spanberger, former President Barack Obama ties the race to abortion, saying Republicans “will keep attacking abortion rights and the rights of women.”\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger’s campaign said in a statement that her “focus remains on addressing” voters’ concerns over high costs and the impact of funding cuts enacted by the Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n  “But as we approach the first Virginia gubernatorial election since the fall of Roe, it’s also important for Virginians to know that Winsome Earle-Sears has a long record of opposing reproductive rights for Virginia women,” the statement reads.\n \n\n   \n  A recent Christopher Newport University poll found that abortion was not a top issue for voters, whose top three priorities were threats to democracy, inflation and immigration. But voters said they trusted Spanberger on reproductive rights issues over Earle-Sears by a 20-point margin. Spanberger led Earle-Sears by 10 percentage points in the poll.\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger’s running mates have also leaned into abortion as a campaign issue against their opponents, who have backed restricting access.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not solely about abortion,” said Virginia Democratic Party Chair Lamont Bagby. “It’s about protecting Virginian rights.”\n \n\n   \n  Jay Jones, the Democratic attorney general candidate facing condemnation over texts in which he fantasized about the shooting of a legislative colleague, is running an ad featuring a woman who had an abortion. His ad aims to portray Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, who is seeking reelection, as an “anti-abortion extremist.”\n \n\n   \n  Ghazala Hashmi, the Democratic candidate for Virginia lieutenant governor, has spoken on the campaign trail about difficult pregnancies she experienced, including two that resulted in miscarriages.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s the right that we are trying to protect for all women, given the complexity and the very, very personal nature of medical care,”  Hashmi, a Virginia state senator, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    Republicans try to neutralize abortion access as an issue\n \n\n   \n  Both Earle-Sears and New Jersey’s Republican gubernatorial candidate, Jack Ciattarelli — who is running a competitive race against Democrat Mikie Sherrill — have tried to downplay abortion. A spokesperson for Earle-Sears’ campaign said her comments at the  gubernatorial debate  earlier this month reflect her view on the issue.\n \n\n   \n  “My position is that the commonwealth needs to come together and figure out where it wants to be,” Earle-Sears said this month. “It’s not going to be my view. It’s going to be a view of the majority.”\n \n\n   \n  Ciattarelli has said he supports a woman’s right to choose, though he has voted in the past to limit funding to Planned Parenthood.\n \n\n   \n  Virginia is the only Southern state  that has not restricted  abortion rights since Roe v. Wade was overturned. In 2023, Gov. Glenn Youngkin hoped to win complete Republican control of the state legislature by boosting candidates running on a 15-week abortion restriction, which he described as a compromise. Instead, Democrats maintained control of the state Senate and flipped the GOP-held House of Delegates.\n \n\n   \n  Miyares, Virginia’s attorney general, said he backs exceptions to abortion bans in the case of rape or incest or when the life of the mother is at risk.\n \n\n   \n  “Virginia voters will decide this issue directly next year, and Attorney General Miyares will enforce the law they impose, dispassionately and faithfully, as he always has,” a campaign spokesperson said in statement.\n \n\n   \n  John Reid, Hashmi’s opponent for Virginia lieutenant governor, suggested on a recent podcast appearance that the state was at risk of becoming a destination for “abortion tourism.”\n \n\n   \n  Reid said in a statement that he would want to debate Hashmi on abortion and other issues.\n \n\n   \n  “I would enjoy the opportunity to join Ghazala on the debate stage to discuss the troubling reality that Virginia’s laws have made it an outlier in the region,” he wrote, adding he wants to focus on expanding support for women’s health care and young families.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/19/china/china-fourth-plenum-ccp-meeting-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"11:28:00-04:00","title":"Roiled by purges and buffeted by US frictions, China’s leadership meets to chart country’s rise","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"China’s leadership, led by President Xi Jinping, is convening the fourth plenum to finalize its next five-year economic strategy (2026–2030), emphasizing technological innovation in AI, quantum computing, new energy, and biotechnology amid mounting tensions with the United States.

Gathering Communist Party elites will review China’s upcoming five-year plan, an economic blueprint whose direction is strictly dictated by top leadership in the authoritarian state. Meanwhile, the  US government shutdown  stretches toward its third week as democratically elected lawmakers remain locked in a standoff over spending in the year ahead.\n \n\n   \n  The plenum will be closely monitored by outsiders for clues about the inner workings of China’s opaque ruling Communist Party. Intrigue heightened on Friday, when state media announced the  ousting of China’s No. 2 general , the highest-ranking casualty yet of Xi’s ongoing anti-corruption purge of the armed forces.\n \n\n   \n  The conclave comes at a critical time for Beijing. China’s leadership sees itself as navigating an increasingly hostile global landscape – with US trade frictions and mounting restrictions on Chinese access to Western technology – while also grappling with deep-seated economic challenges at home.\n \n\n   \n  China’s economic growth slowed to its lowest point this year in the third quarter, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Monday, which reported 4.8% growth year-on-year – down from 5.2% the previous quarter – as those pressures weigh on the economy.\n \n\n   \n  More than 300 full and non-voting delegates of the powerful Central Committee will gather in Beijing for the closed-door plenum, one of seven meetings typically held within five years, between party congresses.\n \n\n   \n  The five-year plan in focus this week is expected to emphasize China’s economic security and technological innovation in sectors like artificial intelligence, quantum computing, new energy and biotechnology. It will run from 2026 through the end of the decade.\n \n\n   \n  But that won’t be the only item on the agenda, and the conclave may also include a personnel reshuffle if new officials are appointed to key roles vacated by those purged.\n \n\n   \n    The next five-year plan\n \n\n   \n  Full details of the upcoming five-year plan will not emerge until after it is approved by China’s rubber-stamp legislature in March next year. But Xi has already given strong hints about his priorities as he looks to adjust China’s economic strategy to ensure “high-quality development” for the rest of the decade.\n \n\n   \n  It’s a decade that Xi could well see out in power. The strongman leader broke precedent to remain head of the party and the state for a third term starting in 2022, and has so far avoided elevating an heir apparent.\n \n\n   \n  Xi earlier this year called on provincial leaders to spend the next five years focusing on the development of emerging and future industries and breakthroughs in core and cutting-edge technologies, while also coordinating “development and security” and considering “internal and external risks.”\n \n\n   \n  China has already made sweeping advances in high-tech industries, like electric vehicles, solar panels and batteries, and is fast catching up with the US in other advanced areas like semiconductors, AI and biotech – sectors included in the current five-year plan, which ends this year.\n \n\n   \n  But the country’s industrial innovation has also been marred by production overcapacity. A surge of production has fueled frictions with trade partners that accuse China of flooding global markets, while also contributing to persistent deflation and price wars between competing firms at home.\n \n\n   \n  China’s economy also needs rebalancing as it faces a prolonged property slump, persistent deflation, weak consumer demand and high youth employment, as well as longer-term concerns like its rapidly aging and shrinking population.\n \n\n   \n  China’s slowing growth in the third quarter relative to the rest of the year increases pressure on the Communist Party to accomplish its annual growth target of around 5%. Overall, the economy has grown 5.2% year-on-year in the first three quarters.\n \n\n   \n  Officials on Monday attributed the third quarter decline to a “complex and severe external environment,” including the impact of tariffs on the global economy, as well as China’s economic transition between “new and old” drivers of growth.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the economic headwinds, many observers expect Xi will largely look to stay the course he’s already charted for China, while making some targeted adjustments.\n \n\n   \n  “There are few reasons to expect that a new five-year plan would deviate, considering that Xi Jinping has been in control of the whole system now very definitively … and doesn’t need to have a big headline (initiative)” at this stage, said Jacob Gunter, who heads the economy and industry program at MERICS think tank in Berlin.\n \n\n   \n  Gunter said to expect “some signaling” in the coming plan around boosting consumption and addressing “involution” – or cutthroat domestic competition linked to overcapacity. But signs of a deeper shift, if it comes, would include meaningful efforts in the coming months and years to expand the social safety net and tackle issues around subsidies and over-investment, among others, he said.\n \n\n   \n    Potential personnel moves\n \n\n   \n  All eyes will also be on any personnel changes that could take place this week, including potential appointments to the powerful Central Military Commission, which oversees China’s 2 million-strong armed forces.\n \n\n   \n  The CMC has been rocked by Xi’s anti-corruption purge, with three of the body’s six uniformed members ousted since 2023, including He Weidong, the No. 2 general.\n \n\n   \n  The announcement of his removal Friday confirmed months of speculation about He’s fate after he  vanished from public view last March . He, who served as a CMC vice chairman, was also a member of the 24-member Politburo, the second-highest echelon of Communist Party leadership.\n \n\n   \n  His ousting from the party was announced alongside that of fellow CMC member Miao Hua, who was removed from his military position in June, as well as seven other officers. All “were suspected of severe duty-related crimes involving exceptionally large amounts of money,” according to state media.\n \n\n   \n  The shake-up leaves an unusual number of spots open on the party’s Central Committee, which began its term in 2022 with 205 members and 171 non-voting alternates. About a dozen seats are expected to be filled by alternate members at this plenum.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not clear whether Xi will choose to refill the ranks of the CMC, which he chairs – or whether he will prefer to keep his close hold on the smaller group.\n \n\n   \n  The existing vacancies on the Central Committee and the potential for other disciplinary moves this week could bring “the biggest personnel shake-up” at a plenum since at least 2017, according to Neil Thomas, a fellow on Chinese politics at the Asia Society Policy Institute.\n \n\n   \n  “Record purges strengthen, not weaken, Xi’s grip over the party and the (People’s Liberation Army). Every Central Committee member knows their future hinges on staying in Xi’s good graces,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/politics/trump-no-kings-protests-vance-cia-analysis","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"12:00:00-04:00","title":"Trump’s response to ‘No Kings’ marches only proved the protesters’ point","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In late 2025, a wave of 'No Kings' protests drew millions of Americans to peaceful demonstrations across 50 states, expressing concern over President Donald Trump’s increasingly autocratic behavior.

The  one Trump shared  was a mocked-up vision of the president flying a fighter jet emblazoned with “KING TRUMP” appearing to dump raw sewage on protesters. In Vance’s  troll on Bluesky , a site popular with liberals, prominent Democrats knelt as supplicants in a royal court before Trump, the divine and absolute ruler.\n \n\n   \n  It was a clever political trick. MAGA supporters can blast anyone who takes offense to the posts as lacking a sense of humor and being prim. The posts also trivialize protesters’ gravely serious claims that America is witnessing a wannabe autocrat. But they also subtly advance the thesis that Trump is all-powerful and immune from dissent, an attractive proposition to voters who like a strongman.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s post is not only juvenile but also betrays striking contempt for tens of millions of Americans he ostensibly leads and for the concept of democratic free speech. He’s far from the first major political figure to express disdain for voters they don’t agree with. Presidents  Barack Obama  and  Joe Biden , as well as 2016 Democratic nominee  Hillary Clinton , all had their moments. And a sense that liberal elites disrespected heartland Americans was fundamental to Trump’s rise to power.\n \n\n   \n  Moreover, Democrats seem to have done little self-reflection over whether their aggressive push to implement their progressive values alienated more conservative Americans and contributed to their own defeat in 2024.\n \n\n   \n  But the president’s social media baiting would be easier to laugh off if it weren’t for multiplying actions that reinforce his pretensions to absolute power and the obliteration of constitutional curbs meant to ensure kings don’t again rule America. He’s implying there’s no room for those who don’t support him and showing he’s willing to force them into line. \n \n\n   \n  Whether such leadership is forcing the country inexorably closer to a political and social fracture or a pride-induced fall by Trump and his gang will become clear in the months to come. The stakes are especially high amid a  government shutdown  the president appears to have no desire to end.\n \n\n   \n  But as Trump’s behavior becomes more imperious and as opposition gathers — from street protests to more  universities refusing to bend  to his ideological will, and judges temporarily halting his orders for troops to enter US cities — tensions and divisions are rising.\n \n\n   \n  The president shows no sign of changing course. He called Saturday’s mass protests a “joke” and described them as “very small, very ineffective.” The people who took part were “whacked out,” Trump said.\n \n\n   \n     “When you look at those people, those are not representative of the people of our country,” he told reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n    Trump’s latest monarchical moves\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s recent track record reinforces perceptions that his denial that he sees himself as a king is yet another of his uncountable untruths.\n \n\n   \n  His stunning commutation Friday night of the seven-year sentence of  former Rep. George Santos , who pleaded guilty to fraud charges, was the president’s latest parody of the legal system that he unapologetically wields as a tool to help his friends and hurt his foes. This  followed his demands  that ex-FBI chief James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James be charged with crimes, which were  followed by indictments  scant weeks later.\n \n\n   \n  Santos on Sunday related to CNN’s Dana Bash how he’d been alerted to his impending release by other prison inmates who heard about it on TV. On “State of the Union,”  Santos said , “I’m pretty confident that if President Trump had pardoned Jesus Christ off of the cross, he would have had critics. So that’s just the reality of our country.” But Rep. Nick LaLota, Santos’ former GOP colleague from New York,  said of Santos : “He stole millions, defrauded an election, and his crimes (for which he pled guilty) warrant more than a three-month sentence.”\n \n\n   \n  Pardoning and commutations are one of the few areas where the Constitution suggest presidents do have unaccountable power. But Trump’s treatment of Santos, which was far from his first highly political show of clemency, was an audacious statement that the US legal system’s reputation for blind justice now risks being tainted by made-to-order prosecutions and his regal whims. (Of course, Republicans will respond that Biden pardoned members of his own family, so all is fair game.)\n \n\n   \n  The president’s authoritarian writ is also being extended abroad.\n \n\n   \n  ► Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced Sunday that the US military conducted a  seventh strike against a boat in the Caribbean  that the administration claims was manned by narcotics traffickers. “These cartels are the Al Qaeda of the Western Hemisphere, using violence, murder and terrorism to impose their will, threaten our national security and poison our people,” Hegseth said.\n \n\n   \n  ► Trump’s promises to get tough with drugs traffickers who have caused great misery inside the US resonated with many voters last year. But the administration’s unilateral designation of traffickers as terrorists and assumption of authority to kill them without due process, while ignoring Congress’ authority over war powers, is arguably illegal and unconstitutional. It places the United States in a category of nations that mock the rule of law and opens the door for others to do the same. “All of these people have been blown up without us knowing their name, without any evidence of a crime,” Republican Sen. Rand Paul said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday. “If they want all-out war where we kill anybody and everybody that is in the country of Venezuela or coming out, that has to have a declaration of war,” the Kentucky Republican said. “It’s something that is not pretty, very expensive, and I’m not in favor of declaring war on Venezuela, but Congress should vote. The president shouldn’t do this by himself.”\n \n\n   \n  ► Trump last week detailed his decision  to authorize covert CIA operations in Venezuela , prompting debate over a possible regime-change strategy against the brutal rule of President Nicolás Maduro. On Sunday, Trump  stoked speculation  of further US military action in the Western Hemisphere, warning that if Colombian President Gustavo Petro didn’t “close up these killing fields” where drugs are produced, “the United States will close them up for him and it won’t be done nicely.”\n \n\n   \n  Curtailing drugs trafficking might be a laudable goal, but Trump’s methods threaten to bolster an imperial presidency and change America’s global reputation. His administration’s refusal to produce evidence of its claims or to try to build support for a potential military campaign is another example of contempt for the democratic process — one that is fueled by the genuflection of most Republicans in Congress.\n \n\n   \n  The saga is unfolding as Hegseth’s Defense Department has kicked out journalists who refused to sign the administration’s  draconian new press regulations . The civilian leadership of Pentagon looks scared of scrutiny — a position that risks eroding public support for the military. That possibility is only reinforced by the administration’s determination to  deploy troops  on  American soil .\n \n\n   \n    Protesters challenge the administration’s dismissal of demonstrations\n \n\n   \n  Trump aides tried to  diminish and defame  the “No Kings” protests that drew millions of people to more than 2,700 events in 50 states and were largely peaceful. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt claimed the Democratic Party’s constituency was made up of “Hamas terrorists, illegal aliens, and violent criminals.” House Speaker Mike Johnson branded them “hate America” rallies made up of the “pro-Hamas wing” and “the Antifa people.”\n \n\n   \n  There is a seam of the Democratic base nurtured by left-wing protest movements that many centrist Americans regard as extreme. But impressions gathered around the country by CNN reporters also indicated that many people with more moderate views also took part in protests that felt like block parties to register concerns about a president many of them see as un-American. Demonstrators dressed as frogs, chickens and Statues of Liberty mocked the unhinged rhetoric of the administration about the protests just as effectively as the president’s vulgar social media posts mocked them.\n \n\n   \n  “We have millions of people turning out today,” Colleen Connell, executive director of the Illinois chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, told CNN’s Fredricka Whitfield on Saturday. “There are clearly more of us than there are of those who want an autocracy or a dictatorship. And so the message is pretty clear that we, the people, you know, own this country and that we are going to respect the rule of law and we are going to stand up and we are going to protect our democracy with peaceful protest and peaceful dissent.”\n \n\n   \n  In time, Saturday’s protests may come to be seen not just as a reaction to Trump’s first nine months in power but as a harbinger of greater resistance to come.\n \n\n   \n  At the least, they show that while many of Trump’s supporters back tough-guy policies like expanding Immigrations and Custom Enforcement raids and extrajudicial executions of claimed drugs traffickers on the high seas, many other Americans don’t.\n \n\n   \n  And while warnings of encroaching authoritarianism may initially have seemed overblown, growing numbers of Americans seem to think that sitting on the sidelines is untenable. This follows a  warning by Obama on Marc Maron’s final  podcast that it wouldn’t be a huge sacrifice for more Americans to make their views known a year before midterm elections. “We’re not at the stage where you have to be like Nelson Mandela and be in a 10-by-12 jail cell for 27 years and break rocks,” the former president said.\n \n\n   \n  Organizers claimed 7 million protesters came out at the weekend. If that’s true, that means nearly 10% of the 75 million people who voted for Kamala Harris last November left their homes to join a protest.\n \n\n   \n  Retired government worker Peggy Cole of Flint, Michigan, told CNN’s Veronica Stracqualursi she traveled to Washington for a protest because it was a “scary time.”\n \n\n   \n  “It seems to me, (Trump is) taking our government, our democracy, and dismantling it piece by piece, slowly, but surely, if we sit by and don’t do anything about it,” Cole said.\n \n\n   \n  Asked for comment about the protests, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson wrote back: “Who cares?”\n \n\n   \n  That’s a response that breathes contempt for the values protesters claim to be protecting. But it also reveals a White House that believes its increasingly monarchical leader has no need to listen to the aspirations of those he regards as below him.\n \n\n   \n  In some ways, Trump is proving the protesters’ point.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/19/politics/national-nuclear-security-administration-furloughs-shutdown","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"20:51:00-04:00","title":"Federal agency overseeing US nuclear stockpile will furlough most of its workforce starting Monday","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), which oversees the U.S. nuclear stockpile, will furlough approximately 1,400 employees starting Monday, October 19, 2025, as a government shutdown drags on.

nuclear stockpile will furlough most of its workforce starting Monday \n       \n  By René Marsh, Ella Nilsen, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:51 PM EDT, Sun October 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The federal agency responsible for overseeing and modernizing the US nuclear stockpile will furlough the vast majority of its staff Monday as the  government shutdown  drags on, according to the Department of Energy.\n \n\n   \n  About 1,400 employees at the National Nuclear Security Administration, or NNSA, will receive furlough notices Monday, while fewer than 400 employees will remain on the job to safeguard the stockpile, Energy Department spokesperson Ben Dietderich told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Energy Secretary Chris Wright will speak about the shutdown’s impact on the US’ nuclear deterrent efforts Monday while visiting the Nevada National Security Site.\n \n\n   \n  The NNSA Office of Secure Transportation, which oversees the transportation of nuclear weapons around the country, will be funded through October 27.\n \n\n   \n  “Since its creation in 2000, NNSA has never before furloughed federal workers during funding lapses,” Dietderich said in a statement. “We are left with no choice this time. We’ve extended funding as long as we could.”\n \n\n   \n  The furloughs will first impact NNSA sites that assemble nuclear weapons, such as Pantex in Texas and Y-12 in Tennessee, a source familiar with the situation told CNN. Because those facilities require large teams to manufacture weapons, furloughs will force those sites into safe shutdown mode.\n \n\n   \n  “Contractors will continue doing very minimal work until they themselves run out of money,” another NNSA source said. “But the day-to-day rhythm of federal oversight, the approvals and monitoring of these contractors, keeping everything on track, will grind to a halt because the people responsible for oversight will be furloughed.”\n \n\n   \n  Monday’s furloughs mark the first wave of disruption for the agency.\n \n\n   \n  “Whatever minimal work contractors are able to continue to do as far as building weapons, enriching special nuclear material, stockpile surveillance, that will stop when the contractors run out of money,” the second source warned. “The earliest we could see that happen is around October 28.”\n \n\n   \n  At that point, the agency would no longer be able to deliver weapons to the Department of Defense. “Everything would be locked up,” the second source said.\n \n\n   \n  Shutting down mid-operation comes with its own complications.\n \n\n   \n  “To stop in the middle of disassembling or building a nuclear weapon, there are several steps you must take to ensure everything is safe enough to leave and lock up,” the second source explained. “And then when you come back, you have to do all of that in reverse to restart. It takes time, it’s not like flipping a light switch.”\n \n\n   \n  For now, both NNSA sources say, there is no immediate national security threat.\n \n\n   \n  “The nuclear stockpile today is reliable and can accomplish what it’s designed to do,” the second source said. “But if we can’t continue our modernization, refurbishing, doing surveillance, then it’s the reliability of the stockpile that’s affected, and it’s going to take some time to play catch up on all of that work.”\n \n\n   \n  Security staff guarding facilities with weapons and nuclear materials will remain on the job. However, ceasing operations at Pantex and Y-12 will stall modernization efforts for the US nuclear stockpile, the sources told CNN. The Department of Defense has been pushing the NNSA to produce new and modernized weapons on time, and a government shutdown could delay that schedule significantly — depending on how long it lasts.\n \n\n   \n  “While the Energy Department and NNSA remain committed to ensuring the safety and security of America’s nuclear deterrent, the longer the shutdown lasts, the more damaging and dire the consequences will be for workforce retention and weapons modernization efforts critical to national security,” Dietderich said in the statement.\n \n\n   \n  Inside the agency, frustration is high.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s a lot of frustration and disappointment that Congress can’t get this done,” one source said. “Especially considering what’s at stake.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/19/us/camp-pendleton-marines-demonstration-shell","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"10:23:00-04:00","title":"Shrapnel from Marines anniversary demonstration detonates over California interstate and hits squad car, highway patrol says","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During a Marine Corps 250-year anniversary demonstration at Camp Pendleton, a 155mm artillery shell prematurely detonated over Interstate 5 in California, striking a highway patrol vehicle.

back-and-forth with Colombia’s president, announcing end of US payments to country \n       \n  By Betsy Klein, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:00 PM EDT, Sun October 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump announced Sunday he would end all US payments and subsidies to Colombia, marking a dramatic escalation in his back-and-forth with the country’s president, Gustavo Petro.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said in a  post  to social media that Petro “does nothing to stop” the production of drugs in his country, “despite large scale payments and subsidies from the USA that are nothing more than a long term rip off of America.”\n \n\n   \n  “As of today, these payments, or any other form of payment, or subsidies, will no longer be made to Colombia,” the president said in all caps.\n \n\n   \n  The two leaders have clashed on the issues of migration and drug trafficking, especially as the US conducts  strikes on alleged drug boats  in the Caribbean, but Sunday’s announcement intensified the friction with new financial stakes.\n \n\n   \n  The US has provided about $210 million in assistance to Colombia this fiscal year, including about $31 million in agricultural support, according to  data  from the US Department of State. It was not immediately clear which payments Trump was referring to Sunday, but the US is by far the largest funder of Colombia’s security, providing billions of dollars every year. The Andean country had previously been Washington’s most reliable ally in South America on national security and defense.\n \n\n   \n  Trump warned Petro that he “better close up these killing fields,” referring to areas where drugs are produced, “or the United States will close them up for him, and it won’t be done nicely.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s comments come after his administration said  last month  that Colombia had “failed demonstrably” in its obligations to fight drug trafficking but that the US would continue to provide funding to the country. Colombia is the world’s leading producer of cocaine, accounting for almost two-thirds of total production, according to the United Nations Office for Drug and Crime.\n \n\n   \n  Trump and Petro have sparred for months, most recently as Petro accused the US of murdering an innocent Colombian national during one of the Trump administration’s strikes in the Caribbean. Last month, the US  revoked Petro’s visa  after he publicly called on American soldiers to disobey Trump during a visit to the United Nations General Assembly.\n \n\n   \n  The escalation also comes as the US has taken aim at what it says is illegal drug trafficking in the Caribbean with a series of military strikes on vessels.\n \n\n   \n  On Sunday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced the US conducted a strike Friday on a boat that American intelligence officials believed had “substantial amounts of narcotics” on board. Hegseth said the vessel was affiliated with a Colombian terrorist organization and that all three men aboard were killed.\n \n\n   \n  That marked the seventh known strike, and came days after another strike on an alleged drug boat that  CNN reported  appeared to be the first time an attack did not kill everyone on board. Trump announced Saturday that the two survivors of that strike would be  returned to their home countries  of Ecuador and Colombia.\n \n\n   \n  Trump on Sunday attacked Petro in personal terms, describing him as an “illegal drug leader” with “a fresh mouth.”\n \n\n   \n  Petro responded to Trump later Sunday, and while he did not address the financial implications of a freeze of US assistance, he criticized the US president, invoking his country’s heralded Nobel Prize-winning author, Gabriel García Márquez.\n \n\n   \n  “You are rude and ignorant toward Colombia. Read, as your chargé d’affaires in Colombia did, ‘One Hundred Years of Solitude,’ and I assure you, you will learn something about solitude,” Petro said in a post to social media.\n \n\n   \n  The 1967 novel chronicles the rise and fall of a fictional Colombian town.\n \n\n   \n  Petro continued, “I don’t do business like you do — I am a socialist. I believe in solidarity, the common good, and the shared resources of humanity, the greatest of all: life, now endangered by your oil. If I’m not a businessman, then I am even less a drug trafficker. There is no greed in my heart.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/19/middleeast/yemens-houthi-rebels-un-detain-20-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"14:24:00-04:00","title":"Yemen’s Houthi rebels detain 20 UN employees and confiscate equipment","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen detained 20 United Nations employees, including five Yemeni nationals and 15 international staff, at a facility in the Hada neighborhood of Sanaa.

  \n  By Caitlin Danaher and Camille Knight, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:16 PM EDT, Sun October 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Sunday’s audacious heist  saw thieves  break into the Louvre’s Apollo Gallery and make off with jewelry of “inestimable” value. The suspects carried out the burglary in just seven minutes, France’s interior minister Laurent Nuñez told radio station France Inter.\n \n\n   \n  French media reported that thieves had attempted to steal the crown of Empress Eugénie, wife of Napoleon III, but the crown was found outside the Louvre, according to French culture minister Rachida Dati. The ornate gold piece, which features 1,354 diamonds and 56 emeralds, was damaged in the heist, according to French TV station TF1 and newspaper Le Parisien.\n \n\n   \n  The robbery, which prompted the swift evacuation of visitors and the museum’s closure for the rest of the day, is only the latest in a series of troubles to befall the venerable institution.\n \n\n   \n  Built in the late 12th century, the Louvre Palace was the official residence of the kings of France for centuries. King Louis XIV’s decision to move his court to Versailles, on the outskirts of the French capital, allowed for the establishment of the Louvre Museum in 1793. Since then, it has become the most visited museum in the world and a cultural highlight of any stay in Paris.\n \n\n   \n  Last year, the Louvre welcomed 8.7 million visitors, with tourists from the United States making up 13% of all guests, second only to the French. But the large crowds entering through the museum’s doors each day have put a strain on the centuries-old building – and its staff.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, French newspaper  Le Parisien  reported on a confidential letter sent from the president of the Louvre, Laurence des Cars, to Culture Minister Rachida Dati warning of the dilapidated state of one of Europe’s top attractions.\n \n\n   \n  In the memo, dated January 23 and confirmed to CNN by the Louvre, des Cars requested urgent help to address a slew of issues affecting the museum. She warned of an increase in damage to the museum’s spaces, with some areas becoming “very deteriorated.”\n \n\n   \n  Problems included water leaks, overcrowding, and worrying temperature fluctuations which threatened to “endanger the conservation of works of art,” the memo detailed.\n \n\n   \n  The museum president cautioned that the Louvre was offering “insufficient” services to the public due to overcrowding, with food services and restrooms “well below international standards” in number.\n \n\n   \n  “Visiting the Louvre constitutes a physical ordeal; reaching the artworks takes time and is not always easy,” the memo said.\n \n\n   \n  Visitors often flock to the Salle des États to see one of the most famous artworks in the museum, if not the world, Leonardo da Vinci’s “Mona Lisa.” But the museum president called for the placement of the artwork to be reconsidered.\n \n\n   \n  French President Emmanuel Macron announced later that month that the “Mona Lisa” would get its own dedicated room inside the Louvre as part of major renovation plans. The expansion of the Parisian landmark is expected to take up to 10 years.\n \n\n   \n  Just six months later, in June, the museum closed its doors for a day as workers there went on strike, complaining of unmanageable crowds, understaffing and poor working conditions in a building unable to handle its current popularity.\n \n\n   \n  Sunday’s brazen daylight robbery was also not the first instance of theft to beset the Louvre.\n \n\n   \n  Most famously, the jewel in the Louvre’s crown, the “Mona Lisa,”  was stolen in 1911  by Italian handyman Vincenzo Peruggia. Having slipped the painting under his clothing, Peruggia escaped the building undetected and wasn’t caught for two years. The public became fascinated by the two-year manhunt, with the daring burglary catapulting the “Mona Lisa” from a relatively unknown work to a world-renowned icon.\n \n\n   \n  More recently, two pieces of  16th-century armor  were returned to the Louvre Museum almost 40 years after they were stolen. The Renaissance-era helmet and body armor were on display in the Louvre when they were stolen overnight from May 31 to June 1, 1983. It wasn’t until March 2021 that the stolen artefacts were returned to the museum.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/19/europe/robbery-louvre-paris-france-museum-closure-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"20:19:00Z","title":"Thieves steal ‘priceless’ jewelry from the Louvre in 7-minute raid","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a meticulously planned seven-minute heist that occurred at 9:30 a.m. on Sunday, October 19, 2025, thieves stole eight of nine high-value items from the Louvre’s French Crown Jewels, including pieces from Queens Marie-Amélie and Hortense and Empress Eugénie.

public prosecutor’s office.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Get out, evacuate’\n \n\n   \n  The robbery took only seven minutes, with the suspects fleeing on motorcycles, Nuñez told France Inter radio. “Clearly, a team had been scouting the location. It was obviously a very experienced team that acted very, very quickly,” he aid.\n \n\n   \n  “I am confident that we will very quickly find the perpetrators and, above all, recover the stolen goods,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  According to Le Parisien newspaper,  police found two angle grinders, a blowtorch, gasoline, gloves, a walkie-talkie, a blanket and a crown at the scene of the robbery. A yellow vest used by the perpetrators to disguise themselves as workmen was found a bit further away, lost during their escape, the newspaper said.\n \n\n   \n  Video from the scene showed French police examining an abandoned furniture elevator positioned next to a corner of the Louvre, with its ladder leading up to a broken window off a balcony.\n \n\n   \n  A tour guide told CNN how he had heard what sounded like “stomping” on the window as he led tourists through the Apollo Room, before hearing shouts from security guards to evacuate.\n \n\n   \n  “I was just trying to figure out what’s happening when I saw the museum staff going to that noise. Then they did a turn around, like real quick, and they started running and saying ‘get out, get out, get out, get out, evacuate!’” Ryan el Mandari said.\n \n\n   \n  He tried to keep his group of visitors calm as they left the building, he said, adding that they heard the sounds but “had no clue that it was a robbery.”\n \n\n   \n    Robbery planned ‘meticulously’\n \n\n   \n  The French interior ministry said the incident took place at 9:30 a.m. local time and that members of the public had been evacuated without incident.\n \n\n   \n  Minister of Culture Rachida Dati said the robbery had taken place as the museum opened. “No injuries were reported. I am on site alongside museum staff and the police. Investigations are ongoing,” Dati said in a post on X.\n \n\n   \n  Christopher Marinello, the founder of Art Recovery International, said that if the thieves are just looking to get cash out as quickly as possible, they might melt down the precious metals or recut the stones with no regard for the piece’s integrity.\n \n\n   \n  “We need to break up these gangs and find another approach, or we’re going to lose things that we are never going to see again,” Marinello told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The museum, which houses world-famous artworks including Leonardo da Vinci’s  Mona Lisa,  said it would remain closed on Sunday due to “exceptional reasons.”\n \n\n   \n  The interior ministry later said the closure was a security measure to preserve evidence for the investigation.\n \n\n   \n  The mayor of Paris Center, Ariel Weil, told reporters that the thieves had “planned this meticulously, obviously” and that he could not recall the Louvre being the target of a robbery in more than a century. “I’m thinking, of course, of the  Mona Lisa sting  in 1911, but I can’t think of any more recent robbery,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Last year, the Louvre welcomed 8.7 million visitors, with tourists from the United States making up 13% of all guests, second only to the French.\n \n\n   \n   This is a developing story and will be updated.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/19/politics/us-conducts-new-strike-on-ship-allegedly-involved-in-drug-trafficking-in-the-carribean","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"13:17:00-04:00","title":"US conducts seventh strike on boat allegedly involved in drug trafficking in the Caribbean","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United States conducted a seventh military strike on a boat in the Caribbean allegedly linked to a Colombian terrorist organization and carrying substantial narcotics, killing all three individuals on board.

\n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced Sunday that the US conducted a strike Friday on a boat that American intelligence officials believed was involved in illegal drug trafficking in the Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth wrote in a  post on X  that the vessel was affiliated with a Colombian terrorist organization and had “substantial amounts of narcotics” on board. He said the three men on the boat were all killed and no US forces were harmed.\n \n\n   \n  This is the seventh known strike in a series of recent attacks by the US military on vessels that the Trump administration says are involved in drug trafficking. It comes days after another strike on an alleged drug boat that CNN reported appeared to be the first time an attack did not kill everyone on board. President Donald Trump said Saturday the survivors of that strike were released to  their home countries  of Ecuador and Colombia.\n \n\n   \n  “These cartels are the Al Qaeda of the Western Hemisphere, using violence, murder and terrorism to impose their will, threaten our national security and poison our people,” Hegseth wrote Sunday. “The United States military will treat these organizations like the terrorists they are—they will be hunted, and killed, just like Al Qaeda.”\n \n\n   \n  The strikes are a part of the Trump administration’s hardening stance against South American countries allegedly involved in smuggling illicit drugs into the US. The president recently authorized the CIA to operate in Venezuela and has been weighing military action inside the country as part of a pressure campaign to oust President Nicolás Maduro.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has also clashed publicly with Colombian President Gustavo Petro, who accused the US last week of murdering an innocent Colombian national during one of its Caribbean strikes. Trump announced Sunday he would cancel all US payments and subsidies to the country.\n \n\n   \n  Petro  responded on X , calling Trump “ignorant” and denying his involvement in illegal drug trade.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has produced a  classified legal opinion  seeking to justify lethal strikes against a secret and expansive list of cartels and suspected drug traffickers, CNN has reported. The opinion is significant,  legal experts previously told CNN , because it appears to give grounds for the president designating drug traffickers as enemy combatants and having them summarily killed without legal review.\n \n\n   \n  Historically, people involved in drug trafficking have been considered criminals with due process rights, with the Coast Guard interdicting drug-trafficking vessels and arresting smugglers.\n \n\n   \n  The Senate blocked a push earlier this month to limit Trump’s ability to command the military to strike alleged drug boats without congressional authorization.\n \n\n   \n  Sens. Rand Paul and Lisa Murkowski were the only Republican lawmakers to cross party lines and support the resolution.\n \n\n   \n  “We basically are summarily executing people who are accused of something.

Tim Kaine to force a vote on reining in Trump’s war powers, told CNN on Thursday.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/19/politics/george-santos-interview-prison-commuted-pardon","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"11:24:00-04:00","title":"George Santos maintains his prosecution was political, says he’s had a ‘very large slice of humble pie’","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Former U.S. Representative George Santos, who was convicted of fraud and served a seven-year prison sentence, was released after President Donald Trump commuted his sentence.

Here’s why protesters say they attended \n       \n  By Dalia Faheid, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:43 PM EDT, Sun October 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  To celebrate her 70th birthday, retired government worker Peggy Cole says she and a friend drove nearly 10 hours from her hometown of Flint, Michigan, to join a protest in Washington, DC, on Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  Cole said she felt compelled to mark the milestone at the large demonstration because it’s a “scary time” for Americans and democracy is at stake.\n \n\n   \n  “It seems to me, (Trump is) taking our government, our democracy, and dismantling it piece by piece, slowly, but surely, if we sit by and don’t do anything about it,” Cole said.\n \n\n   \n  The event was one of more than  2,700 “No Kings” rallies  held across the country on Saturday, protesting what organizers describe as President Donald Trump’s “authoritarian” agenda. That’s hundreds more events than were planned for the first go-round in June, when about 5 million people across the country  took to the streets  to protest Trump’s administration as he held a  military parade  in Washington.\n \n\n   \n  Nearly 7 million people showed up for Saturday’s rallies – including more than 100,000 people in New York,  organizers  and officials said. Along with larger events in major cities,  small pockets  of “No Kings” protesters cropped up along busy thoroughfares, in small town squares and at municipal parks in red and blue states alike.\n \n\n   \n  The  largely peaceful protests  followed a tumultuous summer of mass immigration raids, demonstrations against federal immigration enforcement and the deployment of federal troops into Democratic-led cities.\n \n\n   \n  Police in  Portland  and  New York City  reported that the protests concluded with no arrests.\n \n\n   \n  Trouble came later in the day when some individuals targeted protesters: A woman in South Carolina was arrested for brandishing a firearm while driving near a demonstration and a man in Georgia was seen on video taking a protester’s flag and pushing another demonstrator to the ground.\n \n\n   \n  While the  Trump administration  and some GOP officials have painted anti-Trump protests as the work of “violent left-wing radicals,” the organization behind the “No Kings” events, the Indivisible Project, says it is  committed to “nonviolent action”  and had trained tens of thousands of people in safety and de-escalation. That became especially important amid  growing political violence  across the country, some organizers said.\n \n\n   \n  Some demonstrators wore yellow – a symbol of unity and a reference to other nonviolent resistance movements, according to organizers. “Yellow is a bright, unmistakable reminder that millions of us stand together in the belief that America belongs to its people, not to kings,” reads a flyer on  the “No Kings” website .\n \n\n   \n  Other protesters wore costumes, including inflatable chickens, frogs and dinosaurs, which some said emphasized the peaceful nature of the demonstrations. “It’s really hard to call something a war zone, when you look at something and it’s just a block party and people in Halloween costumes,” said a Los Angeles protester who wore a unicorn costume as he danced to music.\n \n\n   \n  Protesters could be heard loudly cheering and chanting slogans into megaphones, including, “This is what democracy looks like,” and “No hate, no fear, immigrants are welcome here.” They waved American flags along with signs opposing ICE, authoritarianism and billionaires.\n \n\n   \n  CNN field teams spoke with attendees at rallies across the country. Here’s what protesters had to say:\n \n\n   \n    ‘We can all save democracy’\n \n\n   \n  Many protesters emphasized the importance of democracy – an institution they fear is eroding with Trump’s attempts to expand executive power.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re a democracy. And that, in a democracy, people can stand up and voice their opinions. And that we are not going to be silenced,” Joan Press told CNN at a protest in Atlanta.\n \n\n   \n  A rally that kicked off the Atlanta protest featured high-profile speakers, including Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia.\n \n\n   \n  “In this moment, in which we are seeing a president and an administration arrogating to himself power that doesn’t belong to him, our message is very clear,” Warnock later told CNN. “This is not about the people in power, it’s about the power in the people.”\n \n\n   \n  Kimberly Diemert, an organizer and communications director for the Georgia chapter of 50501, a “decentralized” movement that has helped lead the wave of nationwide protests, reminded the crowd about the city’s civil rights legacy.\n \n\n   \n  “Atlanta is the cradle of the Civil Rights Movement as well as democracy … we don’t want to lose that,” Diemert said.\n \n\n   \n  In New York City, one demonstrator held a sign reading: “We protest because we love America, and we want it back.”\n \n\n   \n  The protester, who asked not to be named for privacy reasons, said she’s been protesting since the 1960s, but this time feels different.\n \n\n   \n  “In the 60s we wanted to expand rights – women’s rights, gay rights, minority rights, voting rights,” she said. “But all that’s being taken away now. Now our entire democracy is being threatened, the basic tenets, the press, the judiciary.”\n \n\n   \n  She described feeling “very sad, a sense of loss, fear” under the Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m hoping together, we can all save democracy,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Dressed in Revolutionary War-era clothing and wigs, members of the group All in for Democracy attended the “No Kings” protest in Washington, DC.\n \n\n   \n  “I just see all of our institutions changing, and I don’t want us to change as a country and as a people,” said DC resident Lee Ayres, sporting a coat, wig and hat. “I want all of America to realize the Declaration of Independence is about no kings.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Our free speech is frightening’\n \n\n   \n  Many demonstrators called out what they feel is a threat to freedom of expression in the US.\n \n\n   \n  “It doesn’t seem like we’re able to peacefully or safely (express ourselves) right now, without fear of repercussions” from the government, work or families, said Bobbie Castillo, who traveled hours from her hometown of Lincoln, Nebraska, to DC for her first protest ever.\n \n\n   \n  Bill Nye, “The Science Guy,” rallied the crowd at the DC protest, arguing that Trump and his associates “cannot tolerate dissent.”\n \n\n   \n  “To them, our free speech is frightening. They are arresting people and denying due process in courts. They tried to silence television hosts,” Nye, a former TV host, said.\n \n\n   \n  Participants in smaller cities and towns said they were struck by the size of the turnout Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  In Ashland, Oregon, Joel Lesko said the day was about “joyfully celebrating our love for America, for free speech, for the importance of community and using our voices for diversity and inclusion and democracy.”\n \n\n   \n  After attending a protest in ruby-red Hendersonville, North Carolina, author Lynn Ames told CNN, “If you love this country, saving democracy is a priority no matter where you live, including in small-town America. Maybe especially in small-town America.”\n \n\n   \n    Immigration raids and National Guard deployment\n \n\n   \n  Many protesters connected their attendance to the ongoing immigration crackdown and the federal government’s forceful response to anti-ICE protests that first erupted in Los Angeles following local raids. The demonstrations have since spread to numerous other cities, including Chicago, New York City, Dallas and Portland.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s attempts to deploy the National Guard to Democratic-controlled cities – which he argues is necessary to quell violence and support his deportation initiatives – have drawn legal challenges by state and local officials.\n \n\n   \n  Demonstrators in Los Angeles – where federal immigration raids triggered  massive protests  in June and led to Trump sending in the National Guard against Gov. Gavin Newsom’s wishes – emphasized rights for immigrants and called for a stop to the Trump administration’s deportation campaign.\n \n\n   \n  Sitting in front of LA’s City Hall, Gilberto Beas told CNN the protest is “a message for ICE to stop doing what they’re doing.”\n \n\n   \n  Maria Rivera Cummings, who was born in Los Angeles and is of Mexican descent, said: “We’re all immigrants and everyone has rights here.”\n \n\n   \n  At a demonstration in DC, Michael Langfeldt said he was protesting what he sees as “hatred” toward immigrants and the deployment of the military to US cities.\n \n\n   \n  “I feel like there’s a lot of overreach in the federal government, specifically in like the executive branch,” he told CNN. “Congress doesn’t do anything about it.”\n \n\n   \n  Hailey, a 24-year-old demonstrator in an inflatable frog suit, told CNN that she was inspired by demonstrators in Portland, who have faced off against federal law enforcement for weeks. Protesters there have donned  inflatable costumes  at rallies outside an ICE facility — in part to dispute Trump’s characterization of the city as “war-ravaged.”\n \n\n   \n  “I think it’s hard to see a country that you love descend into fascism,” Hailey told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  In Chicago, which has been an  epicenter  for the resistance to Trump’s sweeping immigration crackdown, many carried Mexican flags and signs like “Hands off our Democracy” and “ICE OUT!”\n \n\n   \n  Actor John Cusack, a Chicago resident known for being outspoken about Hollywood and the US government, said the city’s message to the Trump administration is: “Go to hell!”\n \n\n   \n  “No, you can’t put troops on our streets. You can’t create enough chaos to invoke the Insurrection Act so you can stay in power,” the actor said, addressing the president.\n \n\n   \n  Dakota Englert, from Coal City, Illinois, said she came to stand up for basic humanity.\n \n\n   \n  “We all bleed the same color … I feel for the people that are being separated from their families, the people that are being hurt, killed,” Englert said.\n \n\n   \n    Cuts to federal programs\n \n\n   \n  Other protesters expressed concerns about cuts to federal programs — particularly health care.    The protests come as the federal government is shut down, with GOP lawmakers and the White House  locked in a standoff  with Democrats over a funding bill.\n \n\n   \n  Danielle Guinto, a mother of two, said she worries about the major federal changes to Medicaid and other health-related policies that could impact her children’s health, as well as the rising cost of living.\n \n\n   \n  “I just don’t understand how you can rip food out of people’s mouths, how you can separate, rip people out of their homes,” she told CNN at the Chicago demonstration. “How can you look at a family with fear in their eyes and you’re just going to go take them away?”\n \n\n   \n  Anthony Lee, who works at the Food and Drug Administration and was one of many federal workers who were furloughed following the shutdown, said he came to the demonstration to protect public services. Lee, president of the National Treasury Employees Union chapter in DC, attended the event with a group of unionized federal workers.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve been a public servant for over 20 years, and to see the destruction, really, of our government, our public services, over the last several months has been really scary,” Lee said.\n \n\n   \n  Another federal government employee who was furloughed said she joined the DC protest because the Trump administration has affected her livelihood and “demonized” federal workers.\n \n\n   \n  “The elimination of all these jobs are creating mass threats (for people to be able) to keep their home, to keep a roof over their head, send their kids to college and the hope of the American dream,” said Monica, who declined to share her last name out of fear of retaliation.\n \n\n   \n  Elizabeth Nee, a 25-year-old social worker from Maryland, told CNN she’s seeing an impact at the psychiatric hospital she works at in Baltimore.\n \n\n   \n  “We have a lot of people who are coming in and they’re unhoused, a lot of people on Medicaid. Everything’s at risk right now,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking at the DC protest, Sen. Bernie Sanders called out Trump and his billionaire allies, like Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg.\n \n\n   \n  “This moment is not just about one man’s greed, one man’s corruption or one man’s contempt for the Constitution,” Sanders said. “This is about a handful of the wealthiest people on Earth who, in their insatiable greed, have hijacked our economy and our political system in order to enrich themselves at the expense of working families throughout this country.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/16/us/kada-scott-missing-suspect-charged-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"12:10:00-04:00","title":"Police Investigate Disappearance of Philadelphia Woman After Finding Human Remains in Shallow Grave","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 23-year-old Philadelphia woman, Kada Scott, went missing on October 4, 2025, after being last seen at her workplace.

investigating the disappearance of a Philadelphia woman say a tip led them to shallow grave \n       \n  By Dalia Faheid, Alaa Elassar, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:10 PM EDT, Sun October 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Two weeks after a 23-year-old Philadelphia woman went missing, human remains belonging to an unidentified female have been found in a shallow grave in a heavily wooded area behind an abandoned school, police say.\n \n\n   \n  The remains are now in the care of the medical examiner’s office, which is responsible for determining whether they belong to Kada Scott, Philadelphia Police First Deputy Commissioner John Stanford said at a news conference Saturday,  CNN affiliate WPVI reported. \n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday night, a man was arrested and charged with Scott’s kidnapping – as well as the kidnapping of another woman earlier this year in what police call part of a “pattern.”\n \n\n   \n  Suspect Keon King, 21, also faces a charge of recklessly endangering another person and use of a communication facility, meaning his phone, in the disappearance of Scott, who was last seen at her workplace on the night of October 4, prosecutors said.\n \n\n   \n  Tracking phone communications led police to King, Assistant District Attorney Ashley Toczylowski said at a news conference Wednesday morning.\n \n\n   \n  “Mr. King is the last person, we believe, to be in contact with her and that he was in contact with her when she went offline,” Toczylowski said.\n \n\n   \n  The remains were found after a “very specific” anonymous tip was received overnight and were removed from the scene by late afternoon, Stanford said. The remains indicate the person has been deceased “for some time,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Police had previously searched the area around the abandoned school after receiving an earlier tip and found at least two of Scott’s belongings, but her body was not discovered at that time, according to  CNN affiliate KYW. \n \n\n   \n  “When you know that you’re looking for something but don’t know where someone hid it, it’s not that easy,” Stanford said.\n \n\n   \n  “I know sometimes it seems like the information is not coming fast enough, but we have a job to Miss Scott, we have a job to her family, if this is confirmed that this is her, to ensure that we are doing everything in the proper way to make sure that the individuals are held accountable.”\n \n\n   \n  Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker said in a statement on Saturday the city is supporting Scott’s family in any way possible.\n \n\n   \n  “There are no words that I can employ to remove the unimaginable pain and turmoil that the family of Kada Scott is experiencing with the tragic loss of their beloved daughter, sister, and loved one,” Parker said. “I Pray that God will give the family a certain peace that passes all understanding to meet this moment.”\n \n\n   \n  Scott’s mother, Kim Matthews, had told  CNN affiliate WPVI  last week she just wanted her daughter to come home.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s been horrible,” Matthews said. “I just need her to come home and be safe. That’s what I fear – she’s not safe.”\n \n\n   \n    What police know about Scott’s suspected kidnapper\n \n\n   \n  When the district attorney’s office joined the investigation into Scott’s kidnapping, prosecutors learned King was charged earlier this year in a case involving accusations of strangulation and kidnapping, Toczylowski said.\n \n\n   \n  In that case, King allegedly kidnapped a woman in front of her house, threw her in a car, assaulted her and eventually let her out of the car, Toczylowski said. The case is “domestic in nature” as King and the victim knew each other, she added.\n \n\n   \n  Charges in that case were withdrawn by the Philadelphia District Attorney’s Office in May because a witness failed to appear in court, Toczylowski said. The office has refiled those charges and King is expected to face preliminary hearings in both kidnapping cases in the coming months, she said.\n \n\n   \n  Video evidence from the alleged incident earlier this year will be played at the preliminary hearing, according to Toczylowski.\n \n\n   \n  CNN is working to determine whether King has retained an attorney.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s being really charged with two cases today,” Philadelphia Police Deputy Commissioner Frank Vanore said Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  “This is a pattern of behavior,” Vanore added.\n \n\n   \n  The Philadelphia Police Department’s homicide division is leading the investigation into Scott’s disappearance with assistance from the FBI’s Violent Crime Task Force.\n \n\n   \n    Tips from the public lead investigators to key evidence\n \n\n   \n  Scott’s family has been desperately waiting for answers and urging anyone with information relating to the case to come forward.\n \n\n   \n  “You never know what little, small, minuscule information may apply to the big picture, the puzzle that might get Kada home,” her father, Kevin Scott, told  WPVI  last week.\n \n\n   \n  During Wednesday’s news conference, police asked for the public’s help in locating a gold 1999 Toyota Camry believed to be linked to King. The same afternoon, they received a tip that led them to the car in an apartment complex parking lot,  WPVI  reported.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities believe Scott may have been in the car at some point. The vehicle has been tracked in multiple locations across the city, officials said Wednesday. The car will be searched after authorities obtain a search warrant, WPVI reported.\n \n\n   \n  Before her disappearance, Scott was in contact with King, who met with her shortly after she left her workplace, police said, citing video and digital evidence. She left her car at work about 20 minutes after she first arrived there and disconnected thereafter, authorities said.\n \n\n   \n  “We need to find Ms. Scott, figure out where she is, what may have happened to her to cause her to completely disappear from all her items, her phone, her Instagram, social media sites and everywhere else,” Vanore said.\n \n\n   \n  What relationship King and Scott had and how long they knew each other is under investigation, Toczylowski said.\n \n\n   \n  “Obviously, they had a connection. They’re going back and forth and they’ve known each other for a short time but I don’t know how long,” Vanore said.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities have been tracking several phone numbers involved in Scott’s case and investigating whether any other individuals were involved with the kidnapping. “All roads at this point lead to” King and “that’s what we’re hoping leads us to” Scott, Toczylowski said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/19/uk/police-prince-andrew-giuffre-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"10:27:00-04:00","title":"Police Looking Into Whether Prince Andrew Enlisted Officer to Dig Up Dirt on Accuser Giuffre","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In October 2025, London police are investigating whether Prince Andrew, in 2011, asked a bodyguard to investigate Virginia Giuffre’s criminal record in an attempt to discredit her as a sexual assault accuser.

whether Prince Andrew enlisted officer to dig up dirt on accuser Giuffre \n       \n  Story by AP\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:27 AM EDT, Sun October 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  London police are probing whether  Prince Andrew  asked an officer assigned to him as a bodyguard to dig up dirt on sexual assault accuser Virginia Giuffre.\n \n\n   \n  The Metropolitan Police said it was “actively looking into” media reports that Andrew in 2011 sought information to smear  Giuffre  by asking an officer on the force to find out if she had a criminal record.\n \n\n   \n  The report by the Mail on Sunday followed Buckingham Palace’s announcement Friday that Andrew agreed to relinquish use of Duke of York and other remaining royal titles after emails emerged showing he had remained in contact with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein longer than he previously admitted.\n \n\n   \n  Giuffre’s family welcomed news of the duke giving up his titles but said King Charles III should go further and strip Andrew’s title as prince. Giuffre died by suicide in April at the age of 41.\n \n\n   \n  The emails were the last straw for the House of Windsor after years of tawdry headlines about Andrew’s dodgy friends and suspicious business deals.\n \n\n   \n  The move to insulate the monarchy from Andrew’s scandals has been ongoing since November 2019 when he gave up all of his public duties and charity roles after a disastrous interview when he sought to counter media reports about his friendship with Epstein and deny allegations that he had sex with a  17-year-old Giuffre , who was trafficked by Epstein in 2001.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew was widely criticized for failing to show empathy for Epstein’s victims and for offering unbelievable explanations for his friendship with the disgraced financier.\n \n\n   \n  The BBC interview, in which he said he cut off contact with Epstein in 2010, came back to haunt him and sowed the seeds for his dukedom demotion when emails emerged last week showing he emailed Epstein on Feb. 28, 2011. Andrew told Epstein in the note that they were “in this together” and would “have to rise above it.”\n \n\n   \n  The Mail reported that in 2011, as the newspaper was about to publish a now-infamous photo of the prince with his arm around the partly bare midriff of Giuffre, Andrew provided his bodyguard with Giuffre’s date of birth and confidential social security number to find out if she had a checkered past.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not clear if the officer complied with the request. Giuffre’s family said she didn’t have a criminal record.\n \n\n   \n  With that report and Giuffre’s posthumous memoir being published Tuesday, the scandal will not soon evaporate.\n \n\n   \n  British Energy Secretary Ed Miliband, who was serving as the government’s representative on the Sunday morning news programs, said a police officer should not be enlisted in a smear campaign.\n \n\n   \n  “These are deeply concerning allegations,” Miliband told the BBC. “I think people want to look at those allegations and what the substance is behind them. But if that is correct, that is absolutely not the way that close protection officers should be used.”\n \n\n   \n  Andrew in 2022 reached an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre after she filed a civil suit against him in New York. While he didn’t admit wrongdoing, Andrew did acknowledge Giuffre’s suffering as a victim of sex trafficking.\n \n\n   \n  In his statement Friday, Andrew said he continues to “vigorously deny” the accusations.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/19/politics/democratic-socialists-zohran-mamdani-movement","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"13:00:00Z","title":"Democratic socialists see their moment in Zohran Mamdani’s rise","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Zohran Mamdani’s unexpected victory in the 2025 New York Democratic primary marks the most significant electoral achievement for the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) to date, signaling a major shift in the Democratic Party’s ideological direction.

socialists see their moment in Zohran Mamdani’s rise \n       \n  By Edward-Isaac Dovere, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:00 PM EDT, Sun October 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Standing in the lobby of the art deco theater where Zohran Mamdani held a raucous rally last week, just hours after Israeli hostages were freed by Hamas in a ceasefire deal, the organizer was dressed the part: A black T-shirt with the phrase “Land Back” on the top of a circle, “Democratic Socialists of America” on the bottom, a Palestinian flag in the middle.\n \n\n   \n  The pitch was the same to each prospect he sidled up to: “You look like you might want to sign up with the DSA.”\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani’s emergence is the biggest electoral achievement the DSA has ever had, well beyond the scattered state legislature and city council seats flipped their way in recent years, or even Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez going from being a one-time bartender to a potential top presidential contender. Here in Mamdani was a candidate who’d been a regular of their conventions and organizing Zoom calls, toppling an opponent in Andrew Cuomo as proud of his standing with the establishment as his own famous last name.\n \n\n   \n  Amid a larger bipartisan pull toward populism and mounting anger toward corporations and billionaires, DSA members tell CNN their meetings around the country are attracting more people than ever. Socialist chapters in cities have turned mass Signal chats into de facto National Guard and ICE monitoring groups, and affiliated candidates build up volunteer lists and fundraising beyond anything they’ve seen to date.\n \n\n   \n  They insist that moderate Democrats panicking and Republicans salivating over pinning their ideas to progressives at large have it backward, even as the DSA calls for the overthrow of the capitalistic system in favor of more government ownership in addition to abolishing the police, emptying prisons, creating single-payer health insurance.\n \n\n   \n  “I certainly believe,” Rhode Island state Rep. David Morales, a 27-year-old DSA member who last month launched his own 2026 primary challenge to the incumbent mayor of Providence, told CNN, “that the future of the Democratic Party has to be a party that’s going to stand up for the working class and be unapologetic about it.”\n \n\n   \n  But there’s a huge catch: The DSA remains tiny and fractured internally.\n \n\n   \n  According to organizers, DSA’s New York City chapter membership has doubled since the end of June. The new number is about 11,000. DSA national leaders refer to their “Mamdani bump,” sizably bigger than 2018’s “AOC bump,” driving their national membership to a record-high 80,000, with 26,000 people joining since January.\n \n\n   \n  By comparison, 545,000 New Yorkers voted for Mamdani in June’s Democratic primary.\n \n\n   \n  That night in the Upper Manhattan theater, only a few in the excited crowd of 3,000 Mamdani supporters signed the organizer’s clipboard, even after Chi Ossé, a city councilman from Brooklyn who is also considering a challenge to House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, ended his speech from the stage by declaring, “If you want this movement to continue, you guys got to join New York City DSA!”\n \n\n   \n    Democrats increasingly seem open to socialist ideas\n \n\n   \n  What the crowd did do is sign up for many of Mamdani’s ideas, chanting back his slogans like classic song lyrics and grabbing from a table of buttons: “FREEZE THE RENT” in red, “CHILDCARE FOR ALL” in yellow and “FAST FREE BUSES” in blue. They bounced along with excitement as he declared that he had already won the battle for the soul of the Democratic Party, weeks before the general election.\n \n\n   \n  Those opposed to Mamdani’s politics are terrified of how he’s propelling democratic socialism. Other DSA members, though, see not just inspiration, but a model and a warning to the Democratic Party status quo, even as some fret quietly that if Mamdani wins and has problems governing, that could set them back not just in local races, but in trying to position Ocasio-Cortez for a potential 2028 presidential run.\n \n\n   \n   A Gallup poll  from September showed much more support among Democrats for socialist-aligned figures than the current non-socialist leadership, though Republicans viewed socialism much more negatively. But that poll also showed a record low, 54% overall, approval for capitalism, with only 42% of Democrats saying they viewed it positively, as compared to 66% of Democrats who say that they view socialism positively. (Just 14% Republicans and 38% of independents have a positive view of socialism.)\n \n\n   \n  Gustavo Gordillo moved to New York initially to be an artist but has since started working as a union electrician. He liked Bernie Sanders’s 2016 campaign, but it was only after Trump’s first election that he joined the DSA. Now the co-chair of the New York City chapter, he was involved early with Mamdani’s campaign, helped craft his platform, worked with most of his senior staff, and is now helping organize members to get him over the finish line.\n \n\n   \n  The DSA energy is “a response to a power vacuum in the Democratic Party establishment where very few people could tell you what the Democratic Party stands for,” Gordillo told CNN in a coffee shop on the edge of Chinatown hours before Mamdani’s big rally. “And we’ve seen multiple cycles of establishment Democrats failing to defeat fascists – that that has caused a huge number of working-class people to come to understand that we need a very different kind of political agenda.”\n \n\n   \n  As for helping other campaigns learn from Mamdani’s success, though, Gordillo admitted the group “could be more rigorous.”\n \n\n   \n  Ryan Clancy, a Wisconsin assemblyman and DSA member who started an interview by saying, “I love to talk about socialism,” and joked that he was offended when Republicans called Joe Biden a socialist because the former president wasn’t nearly left enough, encouraged mainstream Democrats to read those numbers as a reason to stop trying to recapture the middle, even in his ultra-swing state.\n \n\n   \n  Voters are “simply demanding more. They don’t want a Hakeem Jeffries, they don’t want a Chuck Schumer, they don’t want people to say they can’t do anything because they’re not in power. That’s bulls**t. They want folks who will fight for them and will use different strategies to do that,” Clancy told CNN. “That idea as a bigger tent expressed as just taking the tent and moving it to the right is really turning off a lot of real progressives and folks on the left who are never going to vote for a Trump but they’re not going to engage with the Democratic Party as it is.”\n \n\n   \n    Factionalism and purity tests\n \n\n   \n  Even as the DSA has moved more toward local races than federal ones, it still faces factionalism and other internal issues.\n \n\n   \n  DSA members across the country tell CNN that Donald Trump and Democrats’ failure to stop him have more to do with their rise than even Sanders, the Vermont senator who came in a close second in both the 2016 and 2020 Democratic primary races.\n \n\n   \n  Despite being the godfather of the democratic socialist revival in America, Sanders has never himself been a DSA member and has no plans to join. He likes being an independent and is also no fan of how purist DSA members de-endorse and boot officials they say have betrayed them.\n \n\n   \n  Ocasio-Cortez was one of those the party de-endorsed in 2024 over co-sponsoring an event on combating antisemitism. Then she was the subject of a censure resolution at this summer’s DSA convention for her “tacit support of Zionism in the face of liberal betrayal of international law, and her dogged support for the Democratic Party establishment to the detriment of DSA’s member-led organizing,” even as in the same packet of resolutions obtained by CNN, the organization lauded her “Fighting Oligarchy” tour with Sanders.\n \n\n   \n  The DSA’s embrace of the Palestinian cause, especially since Oct. 7, has become central to the organization’s identity, from the T-shirt of the organizer recruiting members at the Mamdani event to the group’s “Until Palestinian Liberation” statement on the ceasefire which makes no mention of the word “hostages” but is full of paragraphs decrying Israel.\n \n\n   \n  For some, that’s been an appeal. For others, it’s made the DSA toxic, even if they agree with many of the positions on issues like affordability and healthcare.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani’s comments on Israel have long been essentially in line with the DSA’s, though he has denounced Hamas and visited synagogues and Jewish groups to affirm that he would fight antisemitism and ensure police protection as needed. But that hasn’t stopped some members from already talking about how they expect to use his potential win as an opening for a wider DSA agenda and demand that he not waver from it at all.\n \n\n   \n    Following in Mamdani’s footsteps\n \n\n   \n  One campaign trying to tap into the same energy and tactics as Mamdani is the Minneapolis mayoral run of Omar Fateh, the state senator who won the Democratic-Farmer-Labor endorsement at its convention over the summer, only to have that support revoked on claimed technicalities shortly after.\n \n\n   \n  Fateh told CNN that the revoked endorsement “supercharged” his campaign, both because of the incident itself and what he said it represented about a party he contends is in sway to rich donors.\n \n\n   \n  “What we don’t want to see is continued tension that extends into the midterms and beyond,” Fateh said. “Democratic leadership has to listen to the folks in the party that are really energizing new voters, energizing young people, bringing on new people to come out, not only to vote, but to volunteer and to spend time and effort helping build out the broad coalition in the party. And because that’s what it’s going to take to win.”\n \n\n   \n  In Seattle, Katie Wilson is waging a strong challenge to the incumbent mayor in November. She’s still waiting on an upcoming meeting of the local DSA to see if she’ll get their endorsement.\n \n\n   \n  Wilson isn’t a DSA member herself. She came up as a founder of the local Transit Riders Union and branched out to wider progressive activism.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m a socialist. I’m fine being called a democratic socialist,” Wilson told CNN. “We’re in a moment where most people don’t care that much. People are not that hung up on labels and want to see results on issues that affect their daily lives.”\n \n\n   \n  Asked how her socialism would define her mayoralty, Wilson said she’d encourage outside organizing to keep up pressure on her administration and community wealth-building models, but said, “it’s really more of a long-term, big picture vision for me.”\n \n\n   \n  “In the next four years, maybe it won’t look that different from a progressive Democrat,” she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/europe/ukraine-russia-advances-aerial-bombardment-intl-cmd","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"11:07:00-04:00","title":"Russian forces, aided by heavy aerial bombardments, edge forward in Ukraine","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Despite a call from U.S. President Donald Trump for a combat freeze, Russian forces continue advancing in Ukraine through heavy use of guided aerial bombs, drones, and missiles.

Sun October 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Russian forces are still edging forward along several parts of the long front line in Ukraine – despite yet another call from US President Donald Trump for a  combat freeze  along existing lines.\n \n\n   \n  Both sides “should stop where they are,” Trump said on social media Friday, after meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Washington DC.\n \n\n   \n  But the Russians seem intent on locking in gains before the onset of winter. On Friday, they used a record 268 guided aerial bombs, according to the Ukrainian military, compared to an average of 170 to 180 per day in recent weeks. These bombs, which carry a payload of up to 1,500 kilograms (3,307 pounds), largely target Ukrainian forces and infrastructure close to the front lines.\n \n\n   \n  The Russians have also continued  nightly barrages  of drones and missiles against targets across Ukraine, especially against energy infrastructure. In September, an average of more than 180 drones were launched every night, more than twice the number at the beginning of the year.\n \n\n   \n  In recent days, the Ukrainians have acknowledged that about 20% to 30% of those drones are not being intercepted.\n \n\n   \n  In the last week, Russia has used more than 3,270 attack drones, 1,370 guided aerial bombs, and nearly 50 missiles of various types against Ukraine, Zelensky said Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  To some analysts, the Kremlin has no incentive to compromise as its forces improve their battlefield performance.\n \n\n   \n  “Moscow has developed fresh ways of using drones to find and kill Ukrainian soldiers and to destroy Ukrainian assets, turning what was once an area of weakness into an area of strength,” writes long-time Russia analyst Dara Massicot  in Foreign Affairs .\n \n\n   \n  “It has built better missiles and created more rugged and capable armored systems. It is giving junior commanders more freedom to plan,” Massicot adds.\n \n\n   \n  One town where Ukrainians are under growing pressure is Kupiansk, in the northern region of Kharkiv. Russian troops have advanced to the north and east of the town, which has been under siege for more than a year.\n \n\n   \n  A well-known Russian blogger, War Gonzo, said Saturday on Telegram that there was also fighting in the center of Kupiansk. About 80 Russian troops had infiltrated the town, the Ukrainian military acknowledged on Thursday, and its defenders were “doing everything possible to clear Kupiansk of Russian invaders and prevent the accumulation of enemy infantry in the city.”\n \n\n   \n  One Ukrainian military blogger – Bohdan Miroshnikov – said this week that the Russian tactic “may lead to control (if reinforcements can arrive and consolidate their positions).” He added that while the situation was very complicated, “full occupation of the city is still a long way off.”\n \n\n   \n  Also in Kharkiv region, closer to the international border, the Russians have claimed advances near the town of Vovchansk, including the capture of a nearby village.\n \n\n   \n  In Donetsk, heavy fighting continues around Pokrovsk, with a Russian military blogger claiming Saturday that Russian troops are advancing to the northwestern outskirts of the city. For its part, the Ukrainian military has claimed to have recovered some 70 square miles of territory in the Pokrovsk area over the past two months, in a series of counterattacks.\n \n\n   \n  Oleksandr Syrskyi, the commander-in-chief of Ukrainian forces, insisted Friday that the Russians did not have “the strategic initiative. At the cost of enormous losses, the adversary has achieved only minor advances in certain sections of the front.”\n \n\n   \n  “Ukrainian warriors have ceased the enemy’s spring-summer offensive campaign,” Syrskyi added.\n \n\n   \n  Russia has gained about 120 square miles of territory in the past four weeks, about half of what it seized in the previous four weeks, according to the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University.\n \n\n   \n  And Russian advances come at great cost. As many as 250,000 Russian soldiers have died in Ukraine, with over 950,000 total Russian casualties, according to an  estimate  in June by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a US-based think tank.\n \n\n   \n  Nearly 14,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or wounded in the Pokrovsk area alone since late August, according to Ukraine’s military command. CNN cannot verify battlefield figures.\n \n\n   \n  In the face of these losses, the Russian defense ministry appears to be changing the way it recruits additional personnel. In recent weeks, Russian regions have begun paring back the generous sign-on bonuses used to attract recruits.\n \n\n   \n  The Kremlin has traditionally relied on financial incentives to attract volunteers and avoid another mobilization, but the practice “is likely hitting diminishing returns, which may compel the Kremlin to adopt an alternative approach,” according to the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) think tank.\n \n\n   \n  “Russia may begin to mobilize members of Russia’s active reserve on a rolling basis to sustain its combat operations in Ukraine,” according to ISW.\n \n\n   \n  For its part, Ukraine is betting on long-range strikes targeting Russian energy infrastructure to persuade the Kremlin to accept negotiations. It has stepped up production of its own cruise missiles, although it has been unable as yet to persuade Trump to  supply Tomahawk missiles .\n \n\n   \n  Since the beginning of the year, successful strikes haved been carried out against 45 facilities in Russia’s fuel and energy sector, according to Syrskyi. Industry analysts estimate that one-fifth of Russia’s refining capacity has been disrupted.\n \n\n   \n  But despite the casualties and damage to Russia’s economy, Russian President Vladimir Putin has shown no sign of agreeing to a ceasefire or negotiations with Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  More than 1,300 days since the full-scale Russian invasion began, as one  expert  puts it, “Ukraine cannot destroy Russia’s war capacity, while Russia appears unable to militarily defeat Ukraine.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/19/business/nexperia-us-china-car-prices","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"03:00:00Z","title":"US-China trade dispute over a little-known Dutch chipmaker could halt car production and send prices higher","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A trade dispute between the United States and China over the Dutch chipmaker Nexperia — a critical supplier of automotive transistors and diodes — could disrupt global car production and drive up vehicle prices.

3:00 AM EDT, Sun October 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Few car buyers have heard of Nexperia. But this Dutch company makes chips that are essential for making cars — and now, it’s at the center of a trade dispute that could shutter global auto plants and send already-record-level car prices even higher.\n \n\n   \n  The dispute is just one part of wider trade tensions between the United States and China. The Nexperia saga began in earnest this past December when the US Commerce Department put Nexperia’s parent company, China-based Wingtech Technologies, on a list of companies facing trade restrictions.\n \n\n   \n  Then, this October, China’s Ministry of Commerce banned Nexperia China and its subcontractors from exporting specific finished components and sub-assemblies manufactured in China. The Dutch government took control of Nexperia following this move.\n \n\n   \n  The tensions have prompted concerns of possible auto plant shutdowns, since the chips Nexperia makes are critical to the assembly of the cars and trucks in which they’re installed. The fear is that the trade dispute could halt Nexperia’s production of the chips, and it would be difficult to replace them.\n \n\n   \n  When and if auto plants might be forced to halt operations is not clear. But a  similar chip shortage  following the pandemic caused temporary plant shutdowns and the supply of new autos to drop significantly for more than a year. That shortage in turn helped  drive up the price  of both new and used cars.\n \n\n   \n  Vehicles have become more dependent on computer chips, transistors and diodes on everything from adjusting driver’s seats to feeding the proper amount of fuel into engines and providing braking power. Vehicles can’t be completed if those critical components are unavailable.\n \n\n   \n  While Nexperia is little known outside the industry, its site says the company has more than 6,000 products qualified for use in automobiles, and shipments of 110 billion of its products annually. It has 12,500 employees across Europe, Asia and the United States. It said it’s working on business continuity plans and is “confident that a solution will be found.”\n \n\n   \n  But automaker trade groups are less confident and have sounded the alarm  of possible auto plant shutdowns.\n \n\n   \n  “If the shipment of automotive chips doesn’t resume – quickly – it’s going to disrupt auto production in the U.S. and many other countries and have a spillover effect in other industries,” John Bozzella, CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a lobbying group for most major automakers, said in a statement. “It’s that significant. We’re urging a quick resolution, so U.S. and global automaking remains on track.”\n \n\n   \n  The European Automobile Manufacturers Association said it would take months to get new supplies of the components its members have been getting from Nexperia, while the supply of its chips is expected to last only weeks.\n \n\n   \n  “Automakers have taken steps over the last years to diversify supply chains but risk cannot be mitigated down to zero. This is a cross-industry issue affecting a large number of suppliers and virtually all of our members,” Sigrid de Vries, director general of the European associations, said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  “We suddenly find ourselves in this alarming situation,” she added. We really need quick and pragmatic solutions from all countries involved.”\n \n\n   \n  Nexperia make about 40% of the automotive chips in the segment of the market that includes transistors and diodes, according to Ian Riches, vice president of the global automotive practice for research firm TechInsights.\n \n\n   \n  Automakers are already being forced to deal with increased costs due to tariffs being imposed by the Trump administration. While many are absorbing the costs so far, Kelley Blue Book came out with an estimate last week that the average US new car price just  topped $50,000  for the first time.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/19/politics/trump-brand-federal-government","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"‘Brander in chief’ Trump puts his mark on the federal government","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump is applying his successful business branding strategies from the Trump Organization to the federal government, treating the administration as a marketable product.

‘Brander in chief’ Trump puts his mark on the federal government \n       \n  By Betsy Klein, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EDT, Sun October 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump made his money by slapping his name on hotels and products. Now he’s doing the same thing to the US government.\n \n\n   \n  There’s  TrumpRx , a website for prescription drugs. The  Trump Gold Card , a high-dollar ticket to citizenship. A  Trump coin . A  Trump fighter jet .\n \n\n   \n  Beginning with his decadeslong career in real estate, Trump has been deeply attuned to branding and marketing — capturing the public’s attention in simple but memorable ways.\n \n\n   \n  In his second term as president, Trump and his team have built upon that skill with a sophisticated operation — the federal government now utilizing the lessons learned at the Trump Organization. And the president has been hands-on, treating his administration like a business to be promoted — a precedent that could be adopted by future campaigns and administrations on both sides of the aisle, but that has raised concerns about the commoditization of the White House.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s most significant marketing effort in his political career has been MAGA: “Make America Great Again,” a tagline for his 2016 campaign adopted from a 1980 Ronald Reagan slogan. MAGA has subsequently become the signifier of a much broader political movement — spawning not just hats and T-shirts, but a rallying call and identity.\n \n\n   \n  “What Trump understands is how to capture attention. That is his master stroke,” said Camille Moore, a branding expert and influencer.\n \n\n   \n  “He understands that simplicity and repetition create stickiness. ‘Make America Great Again’ triggers aspirational feelings. These are very simple concepts that anybody can get behind, and that’s what the best branding is based on,” said Moore, who has worked with companies including Saks Fifth Avenue, Netflix and L’Oréal.\n \n\n   \n  Trump and his team have sought to take that success beyond the Oval Office. There are the visual manifestations:  a proposed commemorative $1 coin  featuring the president’s likeness, a draft of which has been confirmed by the US Treasury. It’s not clear whether the design will be minted, since it’s against US law to display the image of a sitting president or living former president on a coin.\n \n\n   \n  Tens of thousands of taxpayer dollars have been  spent on banners  with portraits of Trump hung atop three federal buildings in Washington, DC, according to a report from Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California.\n \n\n   \n  There are branded products, services and spaces: The president recently unveiled TrumpRx, a direct-to-consumer website for discounted drugs set to launch early next year. The name, one White House official said, was the result of a brainstorming session and an effort to reflect Trump’s personal involvement.\n \n\n   \n  “He was not involved in picking the name, but it was not a difficult one to land on. We thought it had a catchy element to it,” Dr. Mehmet Oz, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrator, said in the Oval Office earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  A $1 million immigrant visa called the “Trump Gold Card” promises to “unlock life in America.”\n \n\n   \n  Boeing is building a next-generation fighter jet called the “F-47,” a name that was chosen “in consultation with the Secretary of Defense” and honors the World War II-era P-47 aircraft, the founding year of the Air Force, and “the 47th President’s pivotal support for the development of the world’s first sixth-generation fighter,” according to a  statement  from an Air Force spokesperson obtained by Bloomberg News.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has also called on US military officials to develop a “ Golden Dome ” defense system, a riff on Israel’s Iron Dome.\n \n\n   \n  And  he’s renovated  one of the White House’s most iconic spaces, the Rose Garden, rebranding it as the “Rose Garden Club” with exclusive dinners for officials, lawmakers and donors. The club has a bespoke logo and has been advertised on his official public schedule. That Trump-fostered exclusivity comes as tours of the People’s House for the general public  have been halted  due to construction on the president’s planned ballroom expansion.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s taking an approach more like Nike or Apple than a politician, and that speaks to why it’s working. … He’s leveraging what businesses that make billions of dollars have proven to do,” Moore said.\n \n\n   \n  But unlike Nike or Apple, the US government isn’t a for-profit business.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has insisted he’s paying for White House renovations himself. At a Wednesday night dinner to thank high-dollar donors and investors for their support for his $200 million ballroom, he said the project had been fully funded. At the same dinner, he held up models for a new triumphal arch he’s involved in planning in Washington, DC — another mark of how he’s imposing his aesthetic on the nation’s capital. (It was not immediately clear how it would be paid for.)\n \n\n   \n  Politicians have long sought to take credit for their accomplishments and to make those actions clear to American voters.\n \n\n   \n  But Noah Bookbinder, president of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said the way Trump has gone about it has raised broader concerns about the president’s efforts to promote himself.\n \n\n   \n  “Donald Trump has really supercharged this and made it very much about his name and his identity, and has, in many ways, made the whole government a vehicle to promote him,” Bookbinder said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump branding does not directly violate any laws, but it does violate long-standing norms, he said.\n \n\n   \n  “When you add all of this up, it has the effect of mobilizing the government for the political benefit of a particular leader — and that has some dangerous implications, even if the specific examples are pretty minor in and of themselves,” Bookbinder said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump is the driving force behind many of these efforts.\n \n\n   \n  “All of these have been the president’s ideas, and he is the brander in chief. He’s an expert at marketing. That’s how he made a living and a fortune and created one of the most famous business empires in the world before being elected as president of the United States,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in an interview with CNN. “All of these fun little names are his ideas, and he has a team who’s very much willing to bring them to life.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump has also used these principles over the years to coin monikers for his political opponents: Low Energy Jeb (Bush), Lyin’ Ted (Cruz), Crooked Hillary (Clinton), and Sleepy Joe (Biden).\n \n\n   \n  “It’s so simple. And it’s painfully memorable when your opponent is trying to be so thoughtful and prescribed. You can’t win against that,” said Moore.\n \n\n   \n  World leaders seeking to cultivate closer ties to Trump have also leaned into branding. A peace agreement between the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan has  granted  the US rights to a new corridor: the Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity.\n \n\n   \n     Second term’s the charm \n \n\n   \n  Officials argue that Trump’s branding efforts have been amplified this term by a staff that has a better grasp on who Trump is.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s a big difference this go-round as compared to the previous. He’s a more known entity. And that has made picking up his lead and anticipating what he wants and what he likes and going with it as a branding tool very — not easy — but it’s a skill people have learned how to adopt,” said a White House official granted anonymity to speak freely.\n \n\n   \n  The official said many of the first-term political operatives with decades of expertise weren’t as willing to follow Trump’s less traditional lead.\n \n\n   \n  A second White House official echoed that sentiment: “It’s reflective of how MAGA went from a one-man show to a bigger, well-oiled machine. And the branding reflects how that’s one of the fruits of that investment that he’s made.”\n \n\n   \n  This time around, there has been an emphasis on hiring staff from outside of the Washington bubble who have more diverse backgrounds, including athletics.\n \n\n   \n  “I figured, if someone can make a 2-14 college football team look exciting, then what could they possibly do with legislation? That’s why the videos and a lot of the branded content, it looks different, it looks fresh, it looks like stuff people are use to consuming,” the first   official said.\n \n\n   \n  The Biden administration made its own attempts to brand its successes, including signage  crediting  then-President Joe Biden with construction projects funded by the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law. But the Biden White House largely struggled to connect the president’s achievements with voters.\n \n\n   \n     Reimagining social media  \n \n\n   \n  The Trump White House has also reimagined its role on social media, launching accounts with coordinated aesthetics that often push the envelope and troll Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  Unlike previous administrations, including Trump’s first, there are fewer layers of bureaucracy and approval chains before a post gets published, the first White House official said.\n \n\n   \n  That has prompted blowback on multiple occasions, including a recent racist video  social media post , which appears to be AI-generated, depicting House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries wearing a sombrero and a mustache.\n \n\n   \n  But it has also allowed those accounts to be much more active, something that Moore said Democrats could learn from.\n \n\n   \n  “In the social media age, whoever is more nimble, whoever is faster on their feet, whoever understands social media better — who can pivot — is who can win,” she said, adding, “You have to lean into not being polished.”\n \n\n   \n     ‘I was a product’ \n \n\n   \n  Trump’s understanding of branding principles began early in his time at the Trump Organization, the overarching company of namesake hotel and real estate properties.\n \n\n   \n  “Someone recently said that I was a product — I didn’t mind the comment because the product that the name Trump represents is fantastic,” he  wrote  in a foreword to a “Trump University Branding 101” textbook, published in 2008.\n \n\n   \n  He continued, “There is no way we can ignore the power of branding in the world market today — so take the time to establish your brand carefully. Give it your full attention and realize that every detail and dynamic will be consequential.”\n \n\n   \n  Not all of Trump’s branded endeavors have proved successful. There is an entire  Wikipedia  page of Trump businesses that went bankrupt.\n \n\n   \n  Moore compared Trump attaching his name to products and ideas to the name value of a brand like Apple. While the tech company has experienced  recent troubles , consumers are still buying iPhones — “because there’s a confidence to the name of Apple.”\n \n\n   \n  “What we can learn from him is he understands risk and what’s needed to make an impact,” she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/19/business/trumps-tariffs-local-coffee-roasters","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Trump’s tariffs are brewing trouble for coffee roasters","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration’s imposition of steep tariffs on coffee imports — including a 50% duty on Brazil, 20% on Vietnam, and 10% on Colombia — has led to significant cost increases for U.S. coffee roasters.

Most of it comes from Brazil — 30.7% of US coffee imports based on net weight, according to the UN Comtrade Database — Colombia (18.3%) and Vietnam (6.6%).\n \n\n   \n  The average price of regular coffee at restaurants in August was  10 cents more  than the same time last year, according to data from Toast, a restaurant management software provider. The increase brought the average price to $3.52.\n \n\n   \n  Some relief may be on the way. In September, Rep. Don Bacon, a Republican from Nebraska, and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California, introduced the bipartisan “No Coffee Tax Act” to exempt coffee products from tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  Price hikes may cause some consumers to start brewing their coffee at home, but they will likely continue buying cups from local shops as occasional indulgences.\n \n\n   \n  “(Consumers) may change brands, or they may shop for deals, or perhaps go down in quality — or what they perceive as a quality level — in order to save a little bit of money,” said Erin McLaughlin, a senior economist at the Conference Board, a nonprofit research group.\n \n\n   \n    In DC, roasters eat some tariffs, but consumers still feel the pinch\n \n\n   \n  Coffee drinkers in the nation’s capital are seeing more expensive drip   and espressos these days. According to data from Toast, a regular hot coffee in Washington, DC, averaged $4.21 in August, up 4% from last year. And the   average price of a cold brew costs $5.35,   up 3.7% year-over-year.\n \n\n   \n  Swing’s Coffee Roasters, which was founded in 1916 and has three locations in Virginia and Washington, DC,   has been hit with higher-than-usual costs. Owner Mark Warmuth told CNN that Trump’s tariffs caused a “really difficult situation across the board” when combined with environmental and labor factors that make coffee more expensive.\n \n\n   \n  “Consumers are footing the bill for it,” Warmuth said, adding that “the only loser here is the consumer.”\n \n\n   \n  The cost of a single cup could go up about 10 or 15 cents, Warmuth warned. Even if importing beans costs 50% more, it’s unlikely a single cup would also increase 50%.\n \n\n   \n  DC coffee drinkers may wince at the price, but they aren’t likely   to give up their caffeine fix.\n \n\n   \n  “(Coffee is) kind of considered an affordable luxury. While it might go from $3 a cup to $3.50 a cup, that may not be enough in downtown DC to cause somebody to change their consumption habits,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Chris Vigilante, owner of Vigilante Coffee Company, which has two locations in California and Maryland, said an average pound of coffee   has gone   up from about $4   to   as much as $6. And a 12-ounce bag of beans could increase by 50 cents to $1 for customers, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Vigilante imports much of its coffee from Brazil, and other beans come from countries including Indonesia, Ethiopia and Colombia. Amid  federal layoffs  and other pressures affecting DC residents, he said Vigilante Coffee Company has considered importing coffee from other countries to “diversify our offerings and keep certain price points for our customer base.”\n \n\n   \n  Despite price increases, Vigilante said he’s optimistic that   there are still ways “folks can continue to enjoy great specialty coffee (that) works for their wallet.”\n \n\n   \n  The 50% tariff on top US exporter Brazil, which has seen its coffee bean supply shrink due to a drought, weighs the heaviest on businesses.\n \n\n   \n  Doug Ilg, the owner of Celtic Cup Coffee Roasting in Silver Spring, Maryland, has avoided Brazilian coffee because of the huge tariffs. He doesn’t import coffee himself but buys primarily from third parties and has noticed costs rise in the last eight months.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s tariffs “definitely changed things,” Ilg said.\n \n\n   \n  For instance, customers now may pay roughly 63 cents more per pound of beans compared to January because of the additional cost of tariffs this year, he said.\n \n\n   \n  The additional costs also put more pressure on small and medium-sized businesses that invest more upfront, said McLaughlin of the Conference Board.\n \n\n   \n  Joel Finkelstein, the owner of Qualia Coffee, which sells at farmers’ markets around DC, said it’s “really hard” to anticipate where his business will be in a year or two because of factors such as uncertainty about pricing.\n \n\n   \n  “Every small business, unless you’re in a very fortunate position, is constantly assessing whether it makes sense to stay open,” Finkelstein said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/19/world/us-military-build-up-caribbean-trump-pressures-venezuela","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-04:00","title":"US Military Masses Troops and Assets in Caribbean as Trump Pressures Venezuela","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United States has significantly increased its military presence in the Caribbean over the past two months, deploying over 4,500 Marines and sailors, F-35 fighter jets, MQ-9 Reaper drones, and advanced naval assets including destroyers, submarines, and surveillance aircraft.

\nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EDT, Sun October 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US military has been steadily massing a large number of troops, naval and air assets in the Caribbean over the last two months, conducting training missions off the coast of Venezuela, reopening a military base in Puerto Rico that had been shuttered for decades, and  attacking  speedboats carrying suspected drug traffickers from Venezuela and Colombia.\n \n\n   \n  As of Tuesday, a significant percentage of all deployed US naval assets globally are also now located in  US Southern Command , the US military’s command responsible for operations in the region, according to a fleet tracker published by the United States Naval Institute’s news portal.\n \n\n   \n  That includes the Iwo Jima Amphibious Ready Group and the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit, amounting to more than 4,500 Marines and sailors, three guided-missile destroyers, an attack submarine, a special operations ship, a guided missile cruiser and P-8 Poseidon reconnaissance aircraft.\n \n\n   \n  At the same time, the US has deployed 10 F-35 fighter jets to Puerto Rico, which has become a hub for the US military as part of the increased focus on the Caribbean. The US has also deployed at least three MQ-9 reaper drones to the island, according to images captured by Reuters in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico.\n \n\n   \n  Naval Station Roosevelt Roads in Puerto Rico, a US military installation that had been shuttered since 2004, is now back up and running, according to satellite imagery and photos taken at the base. At least one AC-130J Ghostrider, a heavily armed plane capable of providing air support to ground troops, was  photographed  equipped with Hellfire missiles at José Aponte de la Torre Airport in Puerto Rico, which is used by the installation. A separate image,  captured  by a local photographer, appears to show another Ghostrider at the same facility. That airport has been  a staging ground  for US military operations in the region over the last several months.\n \n\n   \n  In a review of open-source flight data, CNN identified over 200 military flights conducted in the Caribbean over the two-month period between August 15 and October 15. The missions were carried out by 83 separate aircraft, including intelligence-gathering planes and tankers used to refuel jets in midair.\n \n\n   \n  Several intelligence gathering assets may also have been diverted from surveillance operations in Eastern Europe to the Caribbean, flight data suggests. Since August 22, three Boeing P-8 Poseidon aircraft used for signals intelligence gathering crossed the Atlantic into the Caribbean theater.\n \n\n   \n  In early October, “Little Bird” light attack helicopters first identified by the Washington Post and MH-60M Black Hawk helicopters were also spotted conducting training operations off the coast of Trinidad and Tobago. The Little Bird is a highly specialized helicopter typically used by US Special Forces for covert missions.\n \n\n   \n  The huge buildup has raised questions about the Trump administration’s intent in the region. The administration has said repeatedly that the military presence is part of a counter-drug trafficking campaign, but President Donald Trump has also been weighing strikes inside Venezuela itself as part of a broader strategy aimed at weakening leader Nicolas Maduro, CNN has reported.\n \n\n   \n  Experts generally agree that at this point, the US does not have enough assets or troops in place to launch an incursion to control Venezuela itself.\n \n\n   \n  “The military presence in the Caribbean is too big for just hitting a few speedboats, though it is not big enough for an invasion of Venezuela,” Elliott Abrams, who served as the US envoy to Venezuela during Trump’s first term, told CNN on Thursday. “What’s in the middle, I think, is a pressure campaign, meant to rattle Venezuela.”\n \n\n   \n  The US does have the ability now to conduct strikes inside Venezuela from afar. Trump could order Tomahawk missile strikes, for example, from the guided-missile destroyers, cruiser and submarine stationed in the Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s enough to cause pain but not to seize terrain,” Peter Singer, a strategist and Senior Fellow at New America focusing on defense issues, told CNN, referring to the military buildup. “We’re not talking about an invasion and occupation force,” Singer said.\n \n\n   \n  Venezuela is not a military powerhouse, but it is a huge country with difficult and varied terrain. Hurricane season is not over, and the US has not fought a tropical war in two generations, a former US official with deep experience in the region said. And at this moment, the US does not dominate the airspace over Venezuela, the former official noted. Venezuela has S-300 anti-aircraft missile systems, anti-aircraft guns, shoulder-launched air defense systems, and F-16 fighter jets.\n \n\n   \n  Like Abrams, Singer said he believes “so much at this stage is about signaling and pressuring” Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  To that end, the US flew B-52 bombers near Venezuela’s coast for four hours on Wednesday, in what appeared to be a show of force. At their closest point, the bombers reached 48 miles from Los Roques, a small Venezuelan island archipelago of a few thousand residents.\n \n\n   \n  The bombers remained in a part of Venezuela’s flight information region, or FIR, that is international airspace, but controlled by the country’s aviation authority. Venezuela’s FIR extends far beyond the country’s airspace.\n \n\n   \n  The US military has also conducted several training missions in that area in recent weeks, including  live-fire training  and flight operations in the waters near Venezuela earlier this month, and at least five flights of a T-38 jet — used for pilot training — in the Caribbean since September 22, according to open-source flight data.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Katie Bo Lillis, Thomas Bordeaux, Isa Cardona and Isa Soares contributed reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/19/us/remigrate-dhs-explained","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"08:00:00-04:00","title":"DHS Issued a Call to 'Remigrate.'

\nUpdated: \n        8:00 AM EDT, Sun October 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A nine-letter  social media post  was all it took for the Department of Homeland Security to spark a torrent of backlash online this week, drawing the ire of politicians and prompting comparisons to Europe’s far right.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday afternoon, DHS posted a declaration on X for immigrants to “remigrate,” threading a link to the agency’s self-deportation app.\n \n\n   \n  At first glance, the post could be seen as a straightforward reference to the Trump administration’s long-standing immigration policies, which have called for immigrants to “voluntarily self-deport” back to their home countries.\n \n\n   \n  But experts who study and monitor extremism and the far right told CNN they’d urge caution when invoking the word, which has historic roots, including Nazi ideology and, more recently, a violent conspiracy theory that’s inspired terrorist attacks in the US and abroad.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know:\n \n\n   \n    A brief, dark history of a loaded word\n \n\n   \n  Extremism expert Cynthia Miller-Idriss was researching Nazi iconography for her  2019 book  when she said she came across an image that made her pause.\n \n\n   \n  The picture – emblazoned on a T-shirt – showed Jewish people being loaded onto a ship bound for Madagascar. It was captioned, “Have a nice trip,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  And it was a reference to the Nazis’ “ Madagascar Plan .”\n \n\n   \n  In the late 1930s, “before the concentration camps and gas chambers … there was a solution to remigrate Jews to Madagascar,” Miller-Idriss explained.\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, Adolf Hitler weighed multiple remigration policies and other antisemitic proposals before arriving at his final, devastating solution to the  “Jewish Question”  – the Holocaust.\n \n\n   \n  And although the world vowed “never again,” Miller-Idriss said decades later, neo-Nazis were proudly wearing references to the antisemitic remigration proposal on T-shirts.\n \n\n   \n  Remigration is “this idea that you should send people ‘who don’t belong in this country’ to another place,” Miller-Idriss said.\n \n\n   \n  While remigration isn’t often used in daily conversation, Miller-Idriss told CNN in recent years the concept has found a champion in a new far-right conspiracy: The Great Replacement Theory.\n \n\n   \n  The far right believes “any particular state that has a White majority population that wants to retain it – or restore it – you would have to get rid of people of color,” Miller-Idriss said.\n \n\n   \n  “And you either do that violently … or by remigrating them.”\n \n\n   \n    A dubious solution to a racist conspiracy\n \n\n   \n  Although many have likely never heard of the replacement theory, we’ve all lived through its violent consequences.\n \n\n   \n  In July 2011, a Norwegian neo-Nazi  went on a rampage , detonating a bomb in Oslo, Norway, before opening fire at a Labour Party youth camp on nearby Utoya Island.\n \n\n   \n  He killed 77 people. In the aftermath, experts began wading through the 1,500-page manifesto the terrorist reportedly posted online just before the attack.\n \n\n   \n  They found it was riddled with references to  the replacement theory,  a once-fringe conspiracy that falsely argues a shadowy cabal is conspiring to eradicate the White European population by replacing them with non-European immigrants.\n \n\n   \n  Although the attack was widely condemned, experts told CNN the conspiracy ultimately found  a new foothold  amid the rise of far-right movements in Europe and the United States.\n \n\n   \n  And as it spread, terrorist attacks followed: at a  mosque  in Christchurch, New Zealand. At a  Walmart in El Paso, Texas . And, most recently, at a  grocery store  in Buffalo, New York.\n \n\n   \n  Each attack, Miller-Idriss said, was inspired in some way by the replacement conspiracy.\n \n\n   \n  In Europe, as the ethnonationalist Identitarian movement gained traction in the mid-2010s, far-right politicians began touting what had historically been a more palatable solution to the so-called replacement theory: the large-scale deportation of non-Europeans.\n \n\n   \n  “The more political, nonviolent response (to the conspiracy theory) is to advocate for remigration policies – very, very large scale deportation of non-Europeans from the countries that they live in,” said Jakob Guhl, director of policy, research and counterterrorism for the Institute for Strategic Dialogue.\n \n\n   \n  “The concept of remigration has been so successful because it’s not 100% clear what people mean by it.”\n \n\n   \n  On one end of the spectrum, Guhl said, there are politicians who are advocating for returning those who no longer have a legal right to remain in a country. But on the other, more extreme end, he said the conversation quickly turns to maintaining a country’s White so-called ethnic purity.\n \n\n   \n  The ambiguity “really allows the far right to push this term and have people kind of interpret it in the way they prefer,” Guhl said.\n \n\n   \n  Across Europe, nationalist and far-right groups have successfully pushed “remigration” to the forefront through panels, podcasts, political campaigns and posts on social media, Guhl said.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it’s really important to understand that it’s language that has been strategically used, and that has sort of been intentionally kept a little bit vague in order for very extreme nationalist positions to enter the mainstream,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  But for far-right groups like AFG in Germany and the National Rally in France, he said, “this is really about creating greater ethnic homogeneity, creating Whiter countries.”\n \n\n   \n    Remigration in action\n \n\n   \n  CNN reporter Barbie Latza Nadeau has spent years covering immigration and tracing the rise of the far right in Italian politics.\n \n\n   \n  The election of  Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni , in 2022, marked the ascension of such right-wing policies in Italy and her administration has since ushered in a dramatic crackdown on immigration and asylum-seekers through remigration.\n \n\n   \n  “Italy is the Texas and California of the United States, in terms of irregular migration, and the Mediterranean Sea is the Rio Grande,” Latza Nadeau said.\n \n\n   \n  Migrants attempt to cross the Mediterranean from North Africa and try to enter Europe to claim asylum along the Italian coast. But their boats are often met with tragedy, as many become  stranded  or  capsize  in the rough seas,  prompting rescue  from the Italian Coast Guard.\n \n\n   \n  According to the  Dublin Regulation , if a migrant arrives in a European Union member state, the first country where they arrive must care for them and process their cases. But in 2023, Meloni’s government  struck an agreement  with Albania – a non-EU country – to build controversial migrant detention centers and subvert the EU agreement.\n \n\n   \n  The following year Italy  began deporting asylum-seekers  there to await processing. The remigration policy has been  beset by legal challenges  and in August, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled while the facilities in Albania could remain open, Italy needed to ensure asylum-seekers aren’t being remigrated to dangerous situations in their home countries.\n \n\n   \n  But the centers aren’t the only mechanism the Italian government has to remigrate immigrants and asylum-seekers. Being born in Italy does not automatically make you a citizen which, Latza Nadeau said, makes it easier for the country to target, detain and deport migrants – and their families – back to their country of origin.\n \n\n   \n  Even though her children were born in Italy to an American journalist who legally has a right to work and live in the country, Latza Nadeau said her kids could face deportation to the US, a country they’ve never really known.\n \n\n   \n  “Remigration means in Italy that anyone – even if your kids are born here, even if you’re totally ‘legal’ – can send your kids away,” she said. “My kids have to have better documents than almost anyone I know to stay in Italy.”\n \n\n   \n  This spring, tensions flared in Milan as far-right activists gathered in the city to hold a Remigration Summit. The event was met with protests and demonstrators clashed with police.\n \n\n   \n  Latza Nadeau said for many in Europe today, remigration has been seen as just another outgrowth of the push for immigration reform, but historically the policy has been used as a tool for ethnic cleansing.\n \n\n   \n  “Remigration in the context of Europe, you don’t have to go back very far to figure out that this started in a time when Mussolini remigrated the Roma people … or sending Jewish people to the concentration camps,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “These were words that were used during that period of time, and reimagined now.”\n \n\n   \n    More than semantics\n \n\n   \n  In April, the  State Department proposed  shifting the responsibilities of several offices in the agency from refugee support toward creating offices that would support “the Administration’s efforts to return illegal aliens to their country of origin.”\n \n\n   \n  According to the proposal, one of the new offices would be called the “Office of Remigration.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN asked DHS to further explain the policies and context behind Tuesday’s controversial social media post. In response, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin questioned the reporter’s ability to understand English.\n \n\n   \n  “Is the English language too difficult for you?” McLaughlin wrote in email, before citing the Collins English Dictionary’s definition of the verb “remigrate.”\n \n\n   \n  “We urge all illegal aliens to remigrate and self-deport using the CBP Home app,” McLaughlin said.\n \n\n   \n  But when pressed to respond to CNN’s initial inquiry about the controversy over the post – and its far-right connotations – McLaughlin did not respond.\n \n\n   \n  “The best-case scenario is that’s not what DHS intends, and in that case, they should choose a different word because (remigrate) is a signal,” Miller-Idriss said.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s read as a dog whistle by the extreme right, by White supremacists who will see it that way.”\n \n\n   \n  For now, both Miller-Idriss and Guhl told CNN they’re more focused on whether far-right extremists – in the US and abroad – will view the DHS post as a call to action.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m more concerned with, ‘Does it signal legitimation to groups that promote violent types of ethnic cleansing, or that believe that ethnic cleansing through violence is the right path forward for this country,’” Miller-Idriss said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/19/us/cowboys-fashion-politics-cec","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"06:00:00-04:00","title":"Why are you seeing cowboys everywhere?","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the widespread cultural resurgence of cowboy imagery in 2025, driven by fashion, media, and political symbolism.

cowboys everywhere? \n       \n  By Leah Asmelash, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:00 AM EDT, Sun October 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Across advertising and popular media, seemingly everyone is grabbing their fringe, denim and Stetson boots, in a wholehearted embrace of the American West.\n \n\n   \n  It’s cowboys – and they’re “everywhere,” said Emily Keegin, a photo director for both magazines and brands. “It’s more pervasive than I think I’ve ever seen a trope in recent history.”\n \n\n   \n  Long associated with a hardworking, old-school, rugged American masculinity, the cowboy’s current popularity could be a reflection of our national politics —  conservatives , including members of the  Trump administration , have embraced cowboy hats and similar imagery. But today’s prevailing cowboy image also highlights how cultural myths are continuously upcycled and resold, regardless of their origins.\n \n\n   \n  Cowboy-inspired fashion graced October’s issue of Vogue, which featured cover stars  Kendall Jenner and Gigi Hadid on horses  at a Wyoming ranch. Beyoncé’s  “Cowboy Carter” tour  had thousands two-stepping in their country best. The longstanding Western drama “Yellowstone,” its spinoff “1923” and the Billy Bob Thornton-led “Landman” are among some of the  most-watched TV series . And a wide range of brands including  fast-casual restaurant Sweetgreen  and luxury outerwear brand  Canada Goose  have embraced cowboy hats and rusted-red canyon backdrops in ad campaigns.\n \n\n   \n  “This idea of American patriotism ties into this identity,” said Melynda Seaton, art historian at East Texas A&M University. “And I think now, we’re seeing it more.”\n \n\n   \n    Our ideas about cowboys are divorced from reality\n \n\n   \n  Our collective interest in cowboys can be traced to at least the 1880s, when the Buffalo Bill Wild West shows — a theatrical vaudeville traveling performance — brought romantic and entertaining notions of the West and cowboys to the collective popular culture. Since then, those tropes, popularized by Western films, have reappeared in cycles, Seaton said.\n \n\n   \n  Singing cowboys like Gene Autry and Western actor John Wayne became synonymous with patriotism, further forging the link between cowboys and American identity. That these connections were cemented during McCarthyism and the Red Scare — a time when the American way was perceived to be under threat — is no accident, Seaton said.\n \n\n   \n  “We started isolating this idea of the cowboy being the epitome of American values,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  But pop culture’s depiction of cowboys and the American West is selective.  In ad campaigns, television shows, and even in political discourse, the myth of the cowboy is inherently good, inherently brave, inherently tied to the (American) land. The less glamorous side — the poop shoveled, the low wages — is rarely shown.\n \n\n   \n  “One of the things that nobody ever talks about is they only film in the summer for (‘Yellowstone’), because the climate is way too harsh to film in the winter,” Seaton said. “So there’s this weird, only showing the good parts of cowboy culture, but not the bad parts.”\n \n\n   \n  Fashion photographer Richard Avedon exhibited a famous series of portraits from the American West in 1985, having traveled through 17 states and nearly 200 towns  from Texas to Idaho . His portraits poked a hole into the romantic mythology of the American West, telling instead a story of poverty and struggle. A North Dakotan farmer with one arm stares at the camera. A 9-year-old boy in Montana cradles a rifle. A Nebraskan slaughterhouse worker’s white uniform is dyed dark with blood.\n \n\n   \n  The  New York Times  “ripped the exhibition apart,” Seaton said, and many city-dwellers bristled at the harshness of the photos.\n \n\n   \n  Avedon’s portraits are a grim contrast from what we see in old Western films or the fashion and ad campaigns and TV shows of today. The spectacle of the cowboy is so devolved from the actual work of the West, Seaton said, that they exist almost as two separate entities. It is not the actual cowboy that we are interested in; instead, it’s the cowboy costume we have come to mythologize.\n \n\n   \n    Cowboys and the conservative swing\n \n\n   \n  The last time Keegin recalls this level of cowboy costuming was the late 1990s, toward the end of the Clinton administration. “PC culture” was being vilified, she said, and George W. Bush’s Texan twang and plainspoken nature appealed to many.\n \n\n   \n  In other words, there was a pushback against urban-ness and all it has come to represent, Keegin said — liberal values, “elites,” academia, all points still contested today. The cowboy costume’s appeal is in its opposition to that image. As the cowboy image has come to take on these meanings, Republicans’ use of it to gain political favor is  well-documented .\n \n\n   \n  “When we decide that there is ‘real America,’ we tend to buy cowboy hats,” Keegin said.\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, this rise in cowboy imagery can be attributed in part to the current wave of cultural conservatism, exhibited not just by the Trump administration but by resurging interest in  traditional gender roles  and  conservative social media stars . That resurgence is mirrored in our cultural imagery.\n \n\n   \n  “We are influenced by the politics around us, even if we don’t agree with those politics,” Keegin said. “The aesthetics of those politics influence our choices.”\n \n\n   \n  Arizona native Ben Christensen is a creative director whose work highlights the American West. A recent ad for Zara featured his daughter and her friends dancing in cowboy boots and hats backdropped against the Arizona desert, and he’s brought his signature Western vibe to other campaigns and brands, too. As the cowboy image has become more ubiquitous, Christensen said more companies are capitalizing on its trendiness. Today, the cowboy represents traditional American values, Christensen said: honest, hard working, God-loving and respectful.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s very old school, but it’s very refreshing,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Politicians toy with those associations in their own cowboy costuming. Trump, who grew a reputation among some as a  “champion of the common man,”  does not explicitly present himself as a cowboy in the way of Bush or Ronald Regan. (The latter specifically wore a cowboy hat in campaign materials despite only playing a cowboy on TV.) Yet, historians have noted that his rhetoric and policies play into the individualist and patriotic characteristics associated with the beloved Western cowboy.\n \n\n   \n  “The Trump administration has taken cowboy individualism now to an extreme, I believe, gutting the US government and centering power in a dominant president, while also pulling the United States out of the web of international organizations that have stabilized the globe since World War II,” said historian Heather Cox Richardson during a public lecture at the University of British Columbia  earlier this year .\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s investment in Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol — the latter of which has reignited its  recruitment presence at rodeos  — can also be seen as a product of this overarching cowboy imagery, which “feeds a conviction that true men dominate situations, both at home and abroad, with violence,”  Richardson wrote . Just as Hollywood cowboys once defended the American frontier, real ones can now do the same at the American border.\n \n\n   \n    A white-washing in real time\n \n\n   \n  The popular image of the cowboy is not one rooted in the actual history of cowboys — who were originally  Mexican, Native  or  enslaved Black Americans  — but rather in myths perpetuated by entertainment. Yet the role people of color have played in the American West is one that has only recently been highlighted and celebrated.\n \n\n   \n  Black horseback riders during the 2020 George Floyd protests ignited a national dialogue around Black urban cowboys that continued through  heavy media coverage  and, later, photography books and  exhibitions . Beyoncé’s 2024 country album “Cowboy Carter” and the ensuing tour was an albeit  imperfect  education in Black rodeo and country culture. And just two months before the release of “Cowboy Carter,” Louis Vuitton creative director Pharrell Williams  showcased dozens of looks  during Paris Fashion Week inspired by the diversity of the American frontier.\n \n\n   \n  Gabriela Hasbun is the photographer behind “The New Black West,” a book of photography that highlights modern Black cowboys and the Black rodeo, showcasing the current, active role Black Americans play in stewarding cowboy culture. Hasbun has covered the Bill Pickett Rodeo in Oakland, California, since 2007, and she remembers the days when the audience in the stands was sparse, primarily locals and rodeo people there to support the community. Fast forward to 2022, she said, and the rodeo was completely sold out.\n \n\n   \n  “This is a very hardworking community that puts a lot of effort in making this rodeo happen,” Hasbun said. “They’ve been doing it since 1984, and only until recently have they been applauded.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, the images and political messages being pushed in 2025 continue to rely on earlier stereotypes of the Western cowboy. Urban cowboy culture and the diversity of the West has never been more known, yet its visibility has been a blip.\n \n\n   \n  “Yet again, we’re seeing a trend be ushered into the zeitgeist by Black Americans and then whitewashed a few years later,” Keegin said.\n \n\n   \n  That doesn’t concern Kirk Bailey, president of the Oakland Black Cowboy Association, who has seen the interest in cowboys and horseback riding balloon since 2019. The more people learn about cowboy culture and the diversity within it, he said, the more interested they’ll be.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think it’s a trend that’s going to die off anytime soon,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Perpetuated by popular media and politicians alike, the cowboy costume’s current ubiquity is evidence of the image’s grip on the American imagination. While not always a reflection of the true history of real cowboys, its cyclical commercialization is, in its own right, an American tradition.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/politics/caribbean-boat-strike-survivors","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"12:29:00-04:00","title":"US Releasing Survivors of Strike on Suspected Drug Vessel to Their Home Countries","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United States released two survivors of a military strike on a suspected drug vessel in the Caribbean to their home countries, Ecuador and Colombia, under President Donald Trump’s administration.

releasing survivors of strike on suspected drug vessel to their home countries \n       \n  By Natasha Bertrand, Zachary Cohen, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:29 AM EDT, Sun October 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US released the  two survivors  of Thursday’s  military strike  on a suspected drug vessel in the Caribbean to their home countries of Ecuador and Colombia, President Donald Trump said Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said it was his “great honor” to destroy a drug-carrying “submarine” with “four known narcoterrorists on board,” two of whom were killed.\n \n\n   \n  “At least 25,000 Americans would die if I allowed this submarine to come ashore. The two surviving terrorists are being returned to their Countries of origin, Ecuador and Colombia, for detention and prosecution,” he posted on Truth Social. “Under my watch, the United States of America will not tolerate narcoterrorists trafficking illegal drugs, by land or by sea.”\n \n\n   \n  Jeison Obando Perez, 34, was named as the survivor returned to Colombia  in a post on X  from the country’s interior minister Armando Benedetti. Perez arrived “with brain trauma, sedated, drugged, breathing with a ventilator,” Benedetti said, adding that he had received medical attention.\n \n\n   \n  Benedetti called Perez a “criminal” who “will face justice for drug trafficking.”\n \n\n   \n  Ecuador’s Ministry of the Interior said Saturday that it received one of the survivors. Authorities told CNN the survivor “is being medically evaluated.” They added that “the corresponding legal process will follow,” but gave no further details.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reported earlier Saturday that the US was considering releasing the survivors to their home countries. Administration officials were scrambling to determine what to do with the individuals, the first known survivors of the six US military strikes carried out in the Caribbean since September.\n \n\n   \n  The US military detained the survivors after the strike Thursday, marking the first time the Trump administration’s campaign targeting drug traffickers has resulted in the US holding prisoners.\n \n\n   \n  Thursday’s strike was the sixth known strike on a boat allegedly involved in drug trafficking. It came as the US has deployed  scores of military assets  to the Caribbean as it promises further strikes on alleged drug boats, part of the administration’s effort to drive down drug flow into the US and pressure Nicolás Maduro, Venezuela’s authoritarian president.\n \n\n   \n  The situation was potentially going to set up a legal and policy dilemma for the administration because it was unclear under what legal authority the US military can hold the prisoners, Brian Finucane, a former State Department lawyer who specializes in war powers issues, previously told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  One of the sources told CNN the legally dubious situation is why the administration was considering releasing the individuals from US military custody.\n \n\n   \n  The administration has produced a  classified legal opinion  that justifies lethal strikes against a secret and expansive list of cartels and suspected drug traffickers, CNN has reported. Historically, however, those involved in drug trafficking were considered criminals with due process rights, with the Coast Guard interdicting drug-trafficking vessels and arresting smugglers.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has also argued that the president has broad authorities under Article II of the Constitution to conduct the strikes against what it claims are “narco-terrorists,” but lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have questioned that theory. Congress, which maintains broad authority under Article I of the Constitution to declare war, has not authorized an armed conflict against drug traffickers.\n \n\n   \n    Petro accuses US of violating territory\n \n\n   \n  Late Saturday night, Colombia’s President Gustavo Petro accused the United States of killing a fisherman in a separate, earlier, strike on a vessel.\n \n\n   \n  “US government officials have committed a murder and violated our sovereignty in territorial waters,” Petro wrote  in a post on X .\n \n\n   \n  “Fisherman Alejandro Carranza had no ties to the drug trade and his daily activity was fishing,” he said, adding that the “boat was adrift and had its distress signal up due to an engine failure.”\n \n\n   \n  Relatives of Carranza told state-owned TV channel  RTVC Noticias  that he was killed in a US strike on his fishing boat on September 15.\n \n\n   \n  The family said the boat had set off from La Guajira, a peninsula on the northern border with Venezuela, and claimed the boat would not have been out of Colombian waters at the time of the attack, which killed the three people on board, the report said.\n \n\n   \n  “We await explanations from the US government,”  Petro wrote on X .\n \n\n   \n  On September 15, President Trump announced a US strike had  killed  three “confirmed narcoterrorists from Venezuela in International Waters transporting illegal narcotics,”  in a Truth Social post.  He included video showing a boat sitting idle in the water before exploding into flames. It is the only strike the US has publicly acknowledged on that day.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has asked the White House for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this week,  two people briefed by the Pentagon  about the US strikes told CNN that at least one military strike in the Caribbean over the last two months had targeted Colombian nationals on a boat that had left from Colombia. The strike the sources identified was on September 19.\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Isa Cardona, Max Saltman, Ana María Cañizares, Anabella González and Isabel Tejera contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/19/asia/afghanistan-pakistan-ceasefire-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"20:39:00-20:40","title":"Pakistan and Afghanistan agree to new ceasefire after more than a week of deadly clashes","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pakistan and Afghanistan have agreed to a new immediate ceasefire following over a week of deadly clashes along their 1,600-mile border, mediated by Qatar and Turkey.

peace and stability” in talks mediated by Qatar and Turkey, the ministry said.\n \n\n   \n  The announcement came after Afghanistan’s Taliban leadership accused Pakistan of conducting more airstrikes on its territory, in a continuation of the worst fighting between the two nations since the Taliban returned to power in Kabul in 2021.\n \n\n   \n   Violence between the neighbors  along their disputed, 1,600-mile border broke out on October 10 after Afghanistan first accused Pakistan of conducting airstrikes in Kabul and launched retaliatory attacks. Pakistan has long accused Kabul of harboring the Pakistani Taliban militant group (known as the TTP), which its Afghan namesake denies.\n \n\n   \n  As part of the ceasefire agreement, Kabul agreed not to “support groups carrying out attacks against the Government of Pakistan,” while both sides would “refrain from targeting each other’s security forces, civilians, or critical infrastructure,” according to a statement from Taliban spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  The countries had agreed to a 48-hour ceasefire Wednesday, after days of clashes which killed dozens of fighters and civilians on each side. The ceasefire was extended Friday amid plans for mediation, but violence continued.\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of the talks Saturday, the Taliban confirmed a high-level delegation led by Afghanistan’s defense minister had departed for Doha. It accused Pakistani forces of conducting airstrikes on civilian areas in the border province of Paktika.\n \n\n   \n  While Afghanistan “reserves the right to respond to these violations, in order to maintain the dignity and integrity of its negotiating team, its forces have been instructed to refrain from undertaking new military operations at this time,” Mujahid said in a statement at the time.\n \n\n   \n  Pakistan’s information minister said that its security forces had struck “verified” camps of Islamist militants along the border, and rejected that it was targeting Afghan civilians.\n \n\n   \n  “All speculations and assertions being made regarding targeting of civilians are false and meant to generate support for terrorist groups operating from inside Afghanistan,” Attaullah Tarar said in a  post to X Saturday. \n \n\n   \n  Tarar said the militants had attempted to attack Pakistan during the ceasefire period, but that Pakistan had repelled the attacks, killing more than 100 fighters. CNN could not verify the death toll or any targets.\n \n\n   \n  The Afghanistan Cricket Board said eight people, including three cricket players, were killed in a Pakistani attack in Paktika, in a  post to X Friday. \n \n\n   \n  The players had been “targeted during a gathering” after returning home from a friendly cricket match, the board said.\n \n\n   \n  Expressing its “deepest sorrow and grief,” the board announced Afghanistan would pull out of the three-nation T20I cricket tournament next month involving Pakistan, as well as Sri Lanka.\n \n\n   \n  The fighting between the two countries in recent weeks marks the deadliest escalation since the US withdrew from Afghanistan in 2021, and could signal a new period of instability for the once-friendly neighbors.\n \n\n   \n  Pakistan was one of the main backers of the Taliban after its ouster by NATO troops in 2001, and during its subsequent insurgency against the US-backed Afghan government.\n \n\n   \n  But the TTP has re-emerged as one of Pakistan’s biggest national security threats, conducting 600 attacks against Pakistani forces in the past year, according to a recent report by the independent nonprofit Armed Conflict Location & Event Data (ACLED).\n \n\n   \n  Since the recent clashes broke out, at least three dozen civilians have been killed and hundreds wounded in Afghanistan, the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA)  said Thursday. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/politics/marine-corps-anniversary-jd-vance","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"20:15:00-20:30","title":"Vance Celebrates Marine Corps’ 250th Anniversary with California Event That Sparks Back-and-Forth with Newsom","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Vice President JD Vance celebrated the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Marine Corps at Camp Pendleton, California, with a large-scale live fire demonstration involving military vehicles and artillery, sparking criticism from Governor Gavin Newsom over public safety risks.

Gavin Newsom over a live artillery demonstration.\n \n\n   \n  The Camp Pendleton demonstration, which the Marines called the largest in a decade in the continental US, involved fighter jets, helicopters, Navy vessels and live fire from a towed howitzer.\n \n\n   \n  Newsom closed a section of Interstate 5 in Southern California “due to extreme life safety risk and distraction to drivers, including sudden unexpected and loud explosions.”\n \n\n   \n  “Firing live rounds over a busy highway isn’t just wrong — it’s dangerous,” Newsom, a Democrat who has  frequently sparred  with the Trump administration, said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Vance’s office disputed the claim that the demonstration was dangerous. William Martin, Vance’s communications director, said in a statement to CNN that the Marine Corps deemed the demonstration “an established and safe practice” and “part of routine training at Camp Pendleton.”\n \n\n   \n  “If Gavin Newsom wants to oppose the training exercises that ensure our Armed Forces are the deadliest and most lethal fighting force in the world, then he can go right ahead,” Martin said. “It would come as no surprise that he would stoop so low considering his pathetic track record of failure as governor.”\n \n\n   \n  In remarks from Camp Pendleton, Vance — the first Marine to serve as vice president — spoke of his time in the military, saying, “I would not be here today, I would not be the vice president of the United States, I would not be the man I am today were it not for those four years that I served in the Marine Corps.”\n \n\n   \n  Vance  enlisted in the military  after high school, spending four years in the Marines and serving a tour in Iraq in 2005 as a combat correspondent.\n \n\n   \n  In his remarks, he also focused on the Trump administration’s  campaign against  “woke” aspects of the military. “It is not our diversity that makes us stronger,” Vance said. “It is our common purpose, it is our common mission and it is the fact that every single person here bleeds Marine Corps green.”\n \n\n   \n  Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, who took the podium before Vance, made a similar argument.\n \n\n   \n  “I look out at this crowd, I see a lot of different types of faces. The truth is your diversity is not your strength. Never has been,” Hegseth said. “Your strength is in your unity of purpose.”\n \n\n   \n  Since President Donald Trump returned to office in January, the Pentagon has cracked down on diversity initiatives and rolled back efforts made over the last decade attempting to eradicate toxic culture in the military.\n \n\n   \n  During Saturday’s celebration, Vance also delivered a message from the president, acknowledging the  weekslong government shutdown  but placing blame on Democrats — particularly, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.\n \n\n   \n  “I bring greetings today from our commander in chief, Donald J. Trump, and he wanted me to tell each and every single one of you that he’s proud of you, that he loves you and that despite the Schumer shutdown, he is going to do everything he can to make sure you get paid exactly as you deserve,” Vance said.\n \n\n   \n  As CNN has reported, as thousands of federal workers remain furloughed or are working without pay, the Department of Defense is  continuing to pay troops  by using “unobligated research development testing and evaluation funds.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/19/middleeast/how-western-sanctions-iran-hurt-middle-class-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"12:01:00-04:00","title":"How Western sanctions on Iran have hurt the same middle class that drives reform","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Western sanctions on Iran since 2012—intensified in 2012 and again in 2018—have severely damaged the country's economy, leading to a dramatic shrinkage of the middle class, which historically served as a stabilizing and reformist force in Iranian society.

have hurt the same middle class that drives reform \n       \n  By Leila Gharagozlou, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:01 AM EDT, Sun October 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Iranian middle class, long a force of political moderation, stability, economic growth, and the base of the country’s reform movement, is shrinking fast under the pressure of Western sanctions, researchers say. Left in its wake are rising societal resentments and an ever-increasing wealth gap.\n \n\n   \n  A study published in the  European Journal of Political Economy  has used an innovative method to investigate the true extent and damage of Western sanctions on Iran since 2012 and how they have resulted in a dwindling middle class, leaving more Iranians to struggle on low incomes as a small elite prospers.\n \n\n   \n  Resentment between the social classes is clear when speaking with Iranians, and the frustration felt by a young, highly educated population is more palpable than ever. Iran’s current unemployment rate is 7.4% according to the Statistical Center of Iran, while the International Monetary Fund (IMF) puts the  rate at 9.2%  for 2025.\n \n\n   \n  “You can feel the difference between rich and poor more than ever; everything has become expensive, whether it’s bread or chicken. Meanwhile, you see people in luxury coffee shops, luxury restaurants,” said Elham, a schoolteacher in Tehran who is trying to make ends meet. Elham asked to be identified by her first name due to security concerns, as did other Iranians in the country who spoke with CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The minimum wage in Iran is approximately 104 million rials, about $110 per month. The prices of basic goods have risen, with an annual inflation rate of 42.4%, according to October figures from the IMF. In South Tehran, the price of basic household staples like rice has nearly quadrupled, according to shopkeepers and residents. Meanwhile, on the other side of the city, wealthy residents attend exclusive Pilates studios charging 17 million rials.\n \n\n   \n  The recent conflict with Israel highlighted the wealth gap. While the Israeli bombing of Iran’s capital targeted both wealthy and less well-off areas of Tehran, residents with means and access to extra fuel amid a fuel shortage were able to  flee the city  and even the country. One resident, Reza, 36, said: “I couldn’t leave Tehran, even if I wanted to. I couldn’t get fuel to drive anywhere, and I can’t afford the trip to Armenia or Turkey.”\n \n\n   \n  The growing wealth gap and inequality are like a festering wound and Mohammad Reza Farzanegan, a professor of the economics of the Middle East at the University of Marburg in Germany and one of the authors of the new study, told CNN the gap could lead to deep social resentment and damage national unity in the country of around 92 million.\n \n\n   \n  While the Iranian elite continue to reap the benefits of the current system, he said, “the rest of society is left to compete for declining resources in a diminishing economy. The result is a society with increasing inequality and perception of inequality.” The perception of inequality, he added, is even more dangerous to societal stability than the true inequality that exists.\n \n\n   \n  Sanctions have long been billed by the West as a humane tool in the foreign policy and diplomatic arsenal, often described by proponents as being surgical and precise, targeting governments and leaders with minimal civilian impact. However, by studying Iran, one of the most heavily sanctioned countries in the world, the researchers have found that not only have sanctions decimated the economy, they have also punished the segment of the Iranian population which has historically pushed for reforms and change, the middle class.\n \n\n   \n  Farzanegan and his co-author, Nader Habibi, a professor of economics at Brandeis University in the United States, used a synthetic control method to create a data-driven, non-sanctioned “twin” of Iran and compare that twin to the real, sanctioned Iran. The results reveal the significant humanitarian, societal, and political impact of this economic tool on the general population.\n \n\n   \n  According to the study, from 2012-2019, when comparing the real Iran and the non-sanctioned “twin,” researchers found that, were it not for sanctions, the Iranian middle class would have expanded by 17%. By 2019, the middle class of the real Iran was 28% smaller than it should have been, according to their modeling. A  separate study  published in the book “How Sanctions Work” looked at household data in Iran and estimated that roughly 9 million people lost middle-class status between 2011 and 2019.\n \n\n   \n  Farzanegan believes Iran provides a unique case study. Firstly, the scale and intensity of the sanctions imposed on it are unique. While the country has faced sanctions on and off since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, when the Western-installed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was overthrown, paving the way for clerical rule, Iran was hit with the strictest sanctions in modern history in 2012 under the Obama administration. A short respite came after the signing of the nuclear deal known as the JCPOA in 2015, but Iran was once again sanctioned by President Donald Trump in 2018, through his “maximum pressure” policy.\n \n\n   \n  Secondly, Iran holds a unique position among sanctioned countries due to its demographics, which includes a “large, educated and previously growing middle class,” Farzanegan said. The Western sanctions, he explained, have “attacked the very heart of Iran’s modern social structure.”\n \n\n   \n    Century in the making\n \n\n   \n  The creation of the Iranian middle class – made up of civil servants, teachers and professionals – has been a century in the making, with efforts over the last 45 years focused on lifting poor, marginalized communities through education and opportunity.\n \n\n   \n  From the 1990s, after the Iran-Iraq war of the previous decade, the Iranian middle class saw increased growth through 2012.  Beyond its role in politics, the middle class in Iran has also been a generator of entrepreneurship, giving birth to some of its most successful startups, like Snapp, Iran’s answer to Uber, or Digikala, the Iranian equivalent of Amazon.  But many young Iranians say they see few opportunities now.\n \n\n   \n  “I spend a lot of time wondering if I should leave, thinking about where I should go, and where I can even get a visa. I drive Snapp, and I do courier services at the moment, but it is still a struggle. I’m not sure what else to do with so few jobs,” said Ali, a 34-year-old based in Tehran.\n \n\n   \n  Ali, like many Iranians, has fallen on hard times. Educated as a computer engineer, he has struggled to find work in his field. His concerns have only grown since Israel and the United States carried out strikes in Iran in June, targeting its nuclear program, and as diplomatic efforts between the US and Iran have fizzled, entrenching sanctions further.\n \n\n   \n  The political damage from years of sanctions can already be seen within Iranian society, analysts say. “Sanctions have weakened independent economic actors while strengthening state-linked and security-sector players like the IRGC and bonyads,” said Sina Toossi, a senior fellow at the US-based Center for International Policy think tank. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or IRGC, is one of the most powerful branches of the Iranian military, also holding political, ideological and economic power, and bonyads are government-backed charitable trusts.\n \n\n   \n  “By channeling resources to actors who benefit from isolation, sanctions have tilted the balance toward factions built on control and confrontation, entrenching hardliner power,” Toossi said.\n \n\n   \n    Changed face of protest\n \n\n   \n  The middle class is historically a force of moderation and stability in Iran, bridging the gaps in society and counteracting extremes.  “The middle classes have the economic security and education to advocate for civil liberties and political accountability,” said Farzanegan. “Our  research  shows that sanctions have systematically taken this security. When people are busy with daily survival, their capacity for organized, long-term political engagement is severely diminished.”\n \n\n   \n  The Iranian middle class has long been the backbone of the reform movement, and the driver of many of Iran’s protest movements over the decades. It has been the base for reformist leaders like President Mohammad Khatami in 1997, President Hassan Rouhani in 2013 and now President Masoud Pezeshkian.\n \n\n   \n  With a reduced middle class, Farzanegan warns that one begins to see a small, elite group profiting off and simultaneously insulated from sanctions at the top, and, at the bottom, what he calls “the new poor” – millions of Iranians pushed down the socio-economic ladder. “Sanctions, combined with corruption, function like Robin Hood in reverse, taking from the middle class and poor to enrich the powerful,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  This doesn’t fully destroy political engagement but changes it. “The political mantle has shifted from a middle-class demand for rights and reforms to a working-class cry for survival and bread,” says Farzanegan.\n \n\n   \n  This shift can be seen in working-class-led protests like the November 2019 fuel protests. While those types of protests are an important force, Farzanegan said, they are “more fragmented and focused on short-term economic grievances, making them both volatile and vulnerable to state repression.”\n \n\n   \n  Another issue is that pushing people into poverty increases their reliance on government services. In Iran, this means relying on IRGC-connected social services that have themselves been hamstrung by sanctions, creating an “unsustainable trap,” Farzanegan said.\n \n\n   \n  Sanctions have crippled the government’s primary source of revenue, oil exports, limiting the state’s ability to provide for millions of impoverished Iranians through social safety nets.\n \n\n   \n  Where Iran goes from here is unclear, even as concerns of renewed conflict linger.  Rebuilding a middle class, while possible, is a “generational challenge,” said Farzanegan. “It is not a switch that can be flipped back on, even if all sanctions were lifted tomorrow.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/19/politics/how-qatar-became-trumps-key-ally-in-his-middle-east-peace-efforts","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"12:00:00-04:00","title":"How Qatar Became Trump’s Key Ally in His Middle East Peace Efforts","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During Donald Trump’s presidency, Qatar transformed from a target of criticism during the 2017 Gulf blockade to a pivotal diplomatic ally in U.S. peace efforts across the Middle East.

October 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As he flew to the Middle East to celebrate his diplomatic victory on a  ceasefire and hostage release in Gaza,  President Donald Trump heaped praise on one ally in particular: Qatar.\n \n\n   \n  “Qatar was a tremendous help to getting this done. I hope people can realize that,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One. “It was very tough and very dangerous for Qatar. They were very brave.”\n \n\n   \n  The Gulf nation has long been a broker in diplomatic negotiations but its key role as mediator, along with Egypt, in the Gaza talks further cemented its stature in the eyes of the US president.\n \n\n   \n  In a sign of the warm relationship within his first 10 months in office, Trump  received a plane  meant to be used as Air Force One from Doha and the president signed an executive order giving Qatar an unprecedented bilateral defense pact with the US following an Israeli strike on Hamas leaders in its capital Doha.\n \n\n   \n  But Trump’s effusive praise was a far cry from his stance on Qatar in the early months of his first term, when he accused the nation of funding terrorism in the region.\n \n\n   \n  US officials, regional sources, and experts say the vastly improved relations are due to the development of personal relations between Trump and members of his close inner circle and Qatari leaders, a steady campaign of lobbying, and the nation’s ability to deliver as an effective interlocutor between the US and a vast number of players including the Taliban, the Houthis, Iran and Hamas.\n \n\n   \n  “I can’t recall any country that’s had the turnaround that Qatar has,” said Ben Freeman, who tracks foreign influence at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft.\n \n\n   \n    ‘The Qataris were critical’\n \n\n   \n  Trump signaled the importance of his relationship with Qatar to his second term by including the small nation on the first overseas trip after his inauguration.\n \n\n   \n  Trump immediately tapped into the relationships that had developed during his first term and had been strengthened by business deals that his friends and family had done with Qatar in recent years, explained current US officials and regional diplomats.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump family’s business ties to the Middle East have more than tripled since the president’s first term in office, a  CNN tally of the deals  found in May. Earlier this year, the Trump Organization announced plans for a Trump-branded golf resort in Qatar that was supported by a firm backed by Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund.\n \n\n   \n  The Qatari Emir also maintained direct contact with Trump during his years out of office, which is something not all other world leaders did, a source familiar with the matter said.\n \n\n   \n  The familiarity made for productive, trustworthy and blunt interactions, sources said.\n \n\n   \n  Freeman noted that Trump “wants to be seen as this great dealmaker” and win the Nobel Peace Prize, and Qatar is seen as being able to “help him get done on the international stage what he wants to get done.”\n \n\n   \n  Qatar helped to draft the 21-point plan for peace in Gaza that Witkoff initially shared with Arab and Muslin nations in New York, which led to pivotal discussions that laid the groundwork for the hostage release and ceasefire which came just weeks later, a source said.\n \n\n   \n  And then, when last week’s high-stakes negotiations occurred in Egypt, Trump’s top envoy Steve Witkoff and his son-in-law Jared Kushner met privately with Hamas leader Khalil al-Hayya and a senior Qatari official, a meeting which led to a breakthrough in negotiations, according to two sources familiar with the matter. It came as Hamas was looking for reassurances that Israelis would not reignite the war after the Israeli hostages held by the group were released.\n \n\n   \n  The Qataris sought out Witkoff and Kushner for the meeting, first reported by Axios, which was pivotal in securing the agreement to release hostages and put a ceasefire into effect later that night.\n \n\n   \n  “Plain and simple, that agreement would not have been accomplished without the Qataris,” said an administration official. “The Qataris were critical in facilitating discussions with Hamas that were crucial in securing a final agreement in Egypt.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump spoke highly of the Qatari Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani when they signed an agreement aimed at regional peace alongside other regional leaders.\n \n\n   \n  “His Highness Sheikh Tamim is respected by everybody. He’s respected by everybody, and in the most positive way. Not only because of power, because of his heart. He’s got a tremendous heart and he’s a great leader, and his country loves him,” Trump said.\n \n\n   \n  Still, Qatar remains a controversial topic within Trump’s orbit, with some key allies of the president voicing deep concerns about the country’s growing influence.\n \n\n   \n  Among the loudest critics of Qatar is far-right activist Laura Loomer, an influential figure within the administration who slammed the announcement Qatar would be allowed to build an Air Force training facility in Idaho last week.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s Republican allies in Congress have also been left in the dark, at times, about Qatar’s dealings with the administration, even on matters that directly impact the states they represent.\n \n\n   \n  Idaho’s entire GOP-led congressional delegation, which includes chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Sen. Jim Risch, and its Republican Governor, only learned that the administration had formally agreed the Air Force training deal when it was announced publicly by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  Qatar’s relationship with the Trump administration was also tested earlier this year when the US did not notify them before Israel carried out a military strike against Hamas leaders in Doha. US officials scrambled to contain the potential fallout from the strike by reassuring Qatar it, too, was left in the dark by the Israelis, despite evidence top administration officials were told before bombs were dropped.\n \n\n   \n  Ultimately, Trump pushed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to apologize to Qatar — which he did via phone from the Oval Office during a recent trip to the White House. Sources familiar with the incident told CNN that the administration’s failure to notify Qatar ahead of time, given its central role in negotiations, initially raised serious questions about US credibility at the time. But when Trump forced Netanyahu’s apology, the “answer came back very firmly” that the US was serious about maintaining the US-Qatar alliance, according to a regional source said.\n \n\n   \n  “You saw the picture, Netanyahu reading from a paper. The picture talks more than the pen,” the regional source said, noting the executive order bolstering the alliance between the US and Qatar.\n \n\n   \n    Qatar delivering on Taliban talks crucial to first term shift\n \n\n   \n  The relationship between Trump and Qatar started on tense footing during his first term.\n \n\n   \n  “Qatar’s influence in the US in 2016 was nominal at best,” Freeman told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  In June 2017, at the beginning of a diplomatic crisis sparked by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain cutting diplomatic ties and imposing a blockade on Qatar, Trump lambasted Doha.\n \n\n   \n  “We had a decision to make,” Trump said, describing conversations with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries. “Do we take the easy road or do we finally take a hard but necessary action? We have to stop the funding of terrorism.”\n \n\n   \n  The aggressive remarks perplexed even his then Secretary of State Rex Tillerson who asked aides following the speech how the comments had ended up in the president’s speech, according to a source familiar with the interaction.\n \n\n   \n  Tillerson and top military officials then made it a priority in the following months to brief Trump on the strong US-Qatar relationship on both military and diplomatic fronts, particularly providing details about Qatar being home to Al-Udied which is the largest US military base in the region.\n \n\n   \n  Tillerson, a former Exxon executive, also had particularly close relations with Qataris after having done energy deals with the Gulf nation.\n \n\n   \n  Around the same time, according to Freedman, Doha “sought to flip the script really quick and went on a lobbying and PR firm hiring blitz.”\n \n\n   \n  “They started hiring Republican heavyweights from (former Attorney General) John Ashcroft’s firm, several other firms, Ballard, that were very close to the President,” Freeman explained. Attorney General Pam Bondi was a registered lobbyist for Qatar during Trump’s first term.\n \n\n   \n  But over time the blockade made Trump more receptive to Qatar, a former administration official said. The Gulf nations claimed the blockade was an effort to apply economic pressure on Qatar as a result of its alleged support for terrorism, but as it continued Trump worried it was stifling progress and economic ties in the region, the official said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump was also irritated at the other regional players for putting the blockade into place without giving the US advance notice – a move they took just weeks after Trump had visited Saudi Arabia, which was the first overseas trip of his administration.\n \n\n   \n  “Trump gives people under attack the benefit if the doubt, he also felt blindsided by the move which he did not like,” said a former Trump administration official.\n \n\n   \n  Less than a year after his inflammatory White House remarks, in April 2018, Trump hosted the Qatari Emir at the White House.\n \n\n   \n  When the Emir visited Washington for a second time in 2019, administration officials noticed that the two developed a good personal rapport, multiple sources said. Trump went to a Treasury Department dinner with the Emir which he had not been scheduled to attend – reflecting a real warming in relations, sources said. At that time, Doha was hosting talks between the US and the Taliban as Trump pushed for an end to the war in Afghanistan.\n \n\n   \n  “Things were fine, but they had not gone from opponents to friends,” said John Bolton, Trumps’ national security adviser at the time.\n \n\n   \n  That changed, Bolton recalled, after the signing of the Doha agreement between the Taliban and the Afghan government which set into motion the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan. Trump’s top Taliban negotiator, Zalmay Khalilizad, spent copious amounts of time with the Taliban in Doha, meetings that paved the way for the agreement to be signed.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s really the point where they moved, started moving towards the relationship they have now,” Bolton said. “The American president had asked them to do something and they were doing it.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump himself has chalked up the difference to having not really known the country in 2017 when he first became president.\n \n\n   \n  “I didn’t really know them very well,” Trump told reports of his initial take on the small but rich nation in 2017. “As I got to know them, I got to understand them, and I got to realize that they’re in the middle of they are right in the middle of everything. Other countries are there, but they’re an hour and an hour-and-a-half away. A big difference.”\n \n\n   \n    Qatar has come through for Trump where others failed\n \n\n   \n  In Trump’s second term there have been multiple instances where the administration has gone back to Qatar when other intermediaries have not delivered.\n \n\n   \n  During Gaza talks earlier this year, the administration at one point tried a new tact putting a Palestinian-American who was not a government official in charge of the talks with Hamas to try and drive a Gaza ceasefire. But when that approach failed to produce results, they shifted back to Qatar as the critical interlocutor with the group.\n \n\n   \n  A similar situation unfolded when it came to efforts to draw Iran into a new nuclear deal. The Trump administration initially relied on Oman to facilitate months of indirect talks with Iran led by Witkoff, but when those talks fell apart the administration turned back to Qatar to engage in dialogue with Iran. Ultimately the deal never manifested, and Trump carried out strikes on Iran’s nuclear sites. But the importance of Qatar as a trusted go-between had been cemented once again.\n \n\n   \n  Now, advancing the Gaza agreement to the next phase which would include de-militarizing Hamas is set to further test Qatar’s ability to serve as a back-channel with Hamas. White House Spokesperson Anna Kelly said that the Qataris are “invested in ensuring that the deal is implemented.”\n \n\n   \n  But the breadth of efforts that the US and Qatar are working on are also widespread. Dr. Majed Al Ansari, the spokesperson for Qatar’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, cited the wide range of issues the country is working on with Trump.\n \n\n   \n  “We are working right now with the administration on DRC-Rwanda, working with them on Venezuela, working with them on Colombia, working with them on the myriad of issues, some of them I can’t mention right now, all related to peace facilitation,” he said at the Concordia Summit event on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in late September.\n \n\n   \n  “That appreciation of the relationship in Qatar does not go unnoticed,” Al Ansari continued.\n \n\n   \n  “This goes beyond any individual, but working with President Trump, working with this administration very closely, is something that has brought a lot of results,” he said. “It’s a relationship that is beneficial for the region as a whole and for the world.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Zachary Cohen contributed reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/middleeast/israel-receives-hostage-body-from-gaza-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"19:00:00Z","title":"Israel Identifies Body of Tenth Hostage as Delicate Truce Enters Second Week","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israel has identified the body of Eliyahu (Churchill) Margalit, a 75-year-old man killed in the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack, as the tenth deceased hostage returned from Gaza under a fragile ceasefire.

Dahman and Eugenia Yosef, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:27 PM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The body of a tenth deceased hostage returned to Israel from Gaza under the recent ceasefire deal has been identified as the truce entered a second week despite facing a number of tests and with the next steps unresolved.\n \n\n   \n  “Kibbutz Nir Oz announces the return for burial of our beloved Eliyahu (Churchill) Margalit, of blessed memory,” a spokesperson for the kibbutz, or village, said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  The Israeli Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed the identity of Margalit, who was 75 at the time he was killed in the Hamas-led attack on Israel on October 7 two years ago. His body was later taken to Gaza, the Israeli military said.\n \n\n   \n  “We will always remember him as a kind-hearted man whose world was filled with family, kibbutz, nature, and animals,” the kibbutz said.\n \n\n   \n  There are now 18 deceased hostages left in Gaza following the return of Margalit’s body.\n \n\n   \n  Frustration has  intensified  in Israel over the delay in returning the bodies of remaining hostages, a condition outlined in the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas that went into effect last week.\n \n\n   \n  Hamas has  said  that it handed over all of the hostage remains that it could access. Israeli intelligence has  assessed  that Hamas may not be able to find and return all the remaining dead hostages in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  Even so, Israel  believes  that Hamas does know the locations of some of the deceased hostages it claims are missing, according to two Israeli sources familiar with the matter, and Israel’s Foreign Minister has accused Hamas of trying to use them as bargaining chips.\n \n\n   \n  Hamas’ armed wing, al-Qassam Brigades, has previously called for help, saying on Wednesday that “significant efforts and special equipment” are needed to recover the bodies of the remaining hostages.\n \n\n   \n  In that statement, al-Qassam Brigades said it has “abided by what was agreed upon and has handed over all the living captives in its possession and the corpses it could access.”\n \n\n   \n    Ceasefire holds despite killings\n \n\n   \n  For the moment, both sides appear to believe the ceasefire in Gaza is holding though not without coming under strain from the failure of Hamas to return all the bodies, the initially slow entry of aid into the enclave, and continued, if isolated, incidents of killings of Palestinians in Israeli strikes.\n \n\n   \n  A Palestinian family travelling back to their home in the north of the Gaza were killed by the Israeli military on Friday after their vehicle crossed a line that marks Israel’s control under the ceasefire agreement, the spokesperson for Gaza’s Civil Defense, Mahmoud Basal, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The vehicle was carrying 11 civilians, including several women and children, Basal said. After coordinating with the United Nations, Gaza’s civil defense recovered on Saturday nine bodies, including four children and three women. The bodies of two other children are missing, the civil defense said.\n \n\n   \n  The Israeli military told CNN its troops “fired warning shots” after a “suspicious vehicle was identified crossing the yellow line” – a reference to the initial Israeli withdrawal line. The military said the “vehicle continued to approach the troops in a way that caused an imminent threat to them.”\n \n\n   \n  Hamas has accused Israel of violating the ceasefire with such killings, but no retaliatory action was taken as of Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  Israel has also allowed more aid to enter in recent days but aid groups are calling for the opening of more crossings to improve deliveries.\n \n\n   \n  The World Food Programme said on Friday that it has not been able to bring enough food into Gaza because conditions are “extremely difficult”, including communities being on the move, the parlous road conditions, and the fact only two border crossings are open.\n \n\n   \n  The Rafah border crossing, a key gateway that connects Gaza to Egypt, has yet to open.\n \n\n   \n  The crossing was set to open to civilian traffic in both directions as part of the ceasefire agreement, but Israel’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), said on Thursday that the date of the opening “will be announced at a later stage.”\n \n\n   \n  Israel’s Foreign Minister said last week it could open on Sunday. But on Saturday, Netanyahu’s office said it would remain closed until further notice, adding that the crossing’s opening would be subject to Hamas meeting the terms of the ceasefire.\n \n\n   \n  “Its opening will be considered depending on how Hamas fulfills its part in returning the hostages and implementing the agreed-upon outline,” a statement from his office said.\n \n\n   \n    Phase Two\n \n\n   \n  Negotiations on the crucial next stages of the ceasefire deal began in Egypt last week, an Israeli source and a regional official told CNN, with the talks focusing on the demilitarization of Gaza, governance of the strip and the formation of an international force to help secure the enclave after two years of war.\n \n\n   \n  A 20-point plan presented by the Trump administration to end the war in Gaza states that the enclave will be administered by a non-political technocratic group of Palestinians and an overseeing body called the ‘Board of Peace’ - set to be chaired by United States President Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n  An International Stabilization Force (ISF) made up of troops from several countries will be constructed to secure the strip, according to the plan.\n \n\n   \n  But even though Hamas dispatched its chief negotiator to Cairo for discussions over the Palestinian committee set to govern Gaza, the militant group remains vague over its disarmament and transfer of power.\n \n\n   \n  And countries set to join the International Stabilization Force are still negotiating its structure, with some asking for a mandate from the UN Security Council before joining.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Lauren Izso contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/sport/soccer-premier-league-ange-postecoglou-fired-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"10:58:00-04:00","title":"Ange Postecoglou Fired by Nottingham Forest After 39 Days","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ange Postecoglou, the Australian football manager previously successful at Tottenham and Celtic, was fired by Nottingham Forest just 39 days after being appointed, marking the shortest managerial tenure in Premier League history.

CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:06 PM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Perhaps the question is not why now, but why it hadn’t happened sooner.\n \n\n   \n  In a move that cements his banishment from royal life,  Prince Andrew  announced he was relinquishing the use of his royal titles and honors, and would no longer be known as the Duke of York.\n \n\n   \n  The decision, announced Friday, was made in close consultation with  Britain’s King Charles III , who is believed to be glad at the outcome, while Prince William and other members of the royal family were also consulted on the discussions, CNN understands.\n \n\n   \n  Along with his statement, Andrew also continued to once again “vigorously deny the accusations against me.”\n \n\n   \n  Dukedom is the highest rank in the British peerage, and the title was given to Andrew on the morning of his wedding to  ex-wife Sarah Ferguson  by his mother, the late Queen Elizabeth II. The announcement on Friday evening draws a line once and for all, without having to go through the messy machinations of a parliamentary intervention, which would have been required to remove the dukedom.\n \n\n   \n  The relinquishment of such a title within the British royal family is incredibly rare.\n \n\n   \n  The last instance is understood to be over 100 years ago, when Prince Charles Edward, who was one of Queen Victoria’s grandsons, had the title of Duke of Albany stripped from him by the British parliament under the Titles Deprivation Act 1917 for fighting for Germany, where he was Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, during World War I.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew still retains the title “prince,” bestowed on him at birth as the son of the then reigning monarch. But he is giving up all other titles conferred on him in honor by the royal family. For a man who clearly relishes his status, this is no small loss.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew stepped down from public life in 2019 following a disastrous BBC interview in which he was questioned about his friendship with disgraced financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  Three years later, in 2022, he  stopped  using the style His Royal Highness, or HRH, and was stripped of his military titles and charity patronages.\n \n\n   \n  Yet the fallout from his association with Epstein, who died by suicide in 2019 while awaiting trial in the United States on federal charges of sexually abusing underage girls, has continued to plague him.\n \n\n   \n  Friday’s decision is thought to be Andrew’s own, and was made in recognition of the fact that his personal issues continue to be a distraction from the wider work of the royal family, his statement Friday said.\n \n\n   \n  While it appears to have been his choice, he – and the rest of the Windsor clan – were facing mounting pressure to resolve the situation. CNN historian and royal expert Kate Williams said Andrew had become “toxic to the royal brand.”\n \n\n   \n  “This is a signal that… we will not see him in family events, we are not going to see him when there’s a big celebration for King Charles’s 80th birthday in a couple of years; Andrew is out of the fold,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “The question is, is this enough to stop the backlash overall tainting the royal family?”\n \n\n   \n  Williams believes a question mark now hangs over Andrew’s continued residence in the Royal Lodge, a 30-room mansion in Windsor, although he has a private tenancy agreement for the property with the Crown Estate which has not been affected by the change in use of titles and honors, according to a royal source.\n \n\n   \n  The thorny issue of what do with Andrew has loomed over the King since he ascended to the throne in 2022.\n \n\n   \n  Charles’ dilemma was one perhaps unique to royals. Andrew is both his brother and a senior member of an ancient institution.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew has largely stayed out of the limelight since 2019 and has only generally attended private family events – one of the most recent being the  Duchess of Kent ’s funeral service, at which he was accompanied by Sarah Ferguson.\n \n\n   \n  At the same time, this step-back from public life has done little to stop the headlines.\n \n\n   \n  His links to Epstein have remained in the spotlight, with the prince facing fresh backlash during the 2021 sex trafficking trial of disgraced British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, when one of her accusers named Andrew as a passenger on Epstein’s private jet.\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks, multiple British news outlets reported on an email which appeared to raise questions over Andrew’s stated timeline regarding when he cut off contact with Epstein. Similarly, his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson, who will now no longer use the title Duchess of York, has faced backlash in recent weeks.\n \n\n   \n  Files from Epstein’s estate continue to be released by the US House Oversight Committee and there has been media speculation as to whether Andrew’s name will feature in those.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, a posthumous memoir by Virginia Giuffre, who had previously alleged that she had been forced to have sex with the prince after being trafficked by Epstein, is due to be published in the coming days.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew had repeatedly denied Giuffre’s allegations. In 2022, Giuffre and Andrew reached an out-of-court settlement after she sued him for sexual assault. She died by suicide in April at age 41.\n \n\n   \n  The book’s release comes in the same week that King Charles and Queen Camilla are headed to the Vatican for a historic state visit.\n \n\n   \n  Epstein aside, Andrew has also faced questions over his relationship with an alleged Chinese spy, named by a British court in December as Yang Tengbo. Yang is alleged to have worked for China’s United Front Work Department (UFWD), a branch of the ruling Communist Party tasked with gaining influence both at home and overseas. A court hearing described Yang as having developed an “unusual degree of trust” with the younger brother of King Charles.\n \n\n   \n  In April this year, a 10-page document on Andrew’s relations with Yang was  released  by British courts.\n \n\n   \n  It seems the palace realized that the institution’s reputation was continuing to be impacted by the disgraced prince despite the previous moves to remove him as a working royal, which may be why further internal discussions took place, leading to Friday’s announcement.\n \n\n   \n  There will be those – including monarchy-abolishment campaign group Republic who described the move as “too little, too late” – who say palace should have acted sooner.\n \n\n   \n  Giuffre’s brother Sky Roberts  told CNN  that “this is what my sister was fighting for for so many years,” following the news that Andrew had given up using his remaining titles.\n \n\n   \n  “Today is a day where we’ve shed a lot of happy and sad tears. Happy because it’s a good start,” he said. “Her kids get to know their mom as somebody that really did something in this world, that she actually spread a lot of good and was able to hold people to account.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/politics/george-santos-sentence-commuted","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"09:44:00-04:00","title":"Former Rep.

George Santos released from prison after Trump commutes his sentence \n       \n  By Samantha Waldenberg, Kaanita Iyer, Fadel Allassan, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:44 AM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Disgraced former Rep. George Santos,  who had been serving a seven-year term  for the fraud charges that got him ousted from Congress, was released from prison on Friday night after President Donald Trump commuted his sentence, his lawyer tells CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Trump first announced the commutation on Truth Social on Friday evening, and, according to attorney Joseph Murray, Santos’ family picked him up from the prison about five hours later.\n \n\n   \n  “George Santos was somewhat of a ‘rogue,’ but there are many rogues throughout our Country that aren’t forced to serve seven years in prison,” the president wrote on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  “George has been in solitary confinement for long stretches of time and, by all accounts, has been horribly mistreated. Therefore, I just signed a Commutation, releasing George Santos from prison, IMMEDIATELY. Good luck George, have a great life,” Trump added.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s commutation comes just months after Santos, 37, surrendered on July 25 to serve  87 months in prison .\n \n\n   \n   Before he surrendered, Santos told Saudi outlet Al Arabiya English that he asked Trump for a pardon but believed he “got stonewalled.”\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think it made it to the president,” Santos said of his pardon request at the time. “Unfortunately, gatekeepers have blockaded for it to ever get to the president.”\n \n\n   \n  But even from behind bars, Santos continued to make his case.  According to his verified X page , he wrote an open letter to Trump earlier this week, pleading for “fairness” while also saying he takes “full responsibility” for his actions.\n \n\n   \n  “Mr. President, I am not asking for sympathy. I am asking for fairness — for the chance to rebuild. I know I have made mistakes in my past. I have faced my share of consequences, and I take full responsibility for my actions. But no man, no matter his flaws, deserves to be lost in the system, forgotten and unseen, enduring punishment far beyond what justice requires,” Santos wrote in  the letter published in The South Shore Press. \n \n\n   \n  The law firm that represented Santos celebrated the president’s move, telling CNN, “We applaud the President for correcting this injustice.”\n \n\n   \n  Murray  posted on X  a message on behalf of Santos thanking GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene -who he said “fought like a lion” for him – as well as  Lauren Boebert , Anna Paulina Luna, and former Congressman Matt Gaetz, whom he described as “in regular contact.”\n \n\n   \n  Santos also expressed gratitude to “the greatest DOJ team ever assembled”, specifically naming Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, Associated Deputy AG Diego Pestana, and US Pardon Attorney Ed Martin, among other. Martin  wrote on X  he was “honored” to have played “a small role” in Trump granting “clemency” to Santos, and thanked the president for “making clemency great again.”\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the commutation drew mixed reaction from lawmakers. Taylor Greene — who wrote a letter to Trump in August asking him to commute Santos’ sentence — also thanked the president in a  post on X , adding that Santos “was unfairly treated and put in solitary confinement, which is torture!!”\n \n\n   \n  House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, however, slammed Trump for focusing on Santos instead of Americans’ health care — an issue at the center of the ongoing government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “Donald Trump has time to free serial fraudster George Santos from prison. But he can’t be bothered to address the Republican healthcare crisis crushing working class Americans,” Jeffries said in a  post on X .\n \n\n   \n  In August 2024, the former congressman pleaded guilty to aggravated identity theft and wire fraud charges stemming from activity during his 2022 midterm campaign.\n \n\n   \n  “I deeply regret my conduct,” Santos said in court at that time. “I accept full responsibility for my actions.”\n \n\n   \n  Santos was expelled from Congress in December 2023, before completing a full term in the US House – becoming only the sixth lawmaker ever to be expelled from the chamber.\n \n\n   \n  During his short time in Congress, reports emerged of Santos having fabricated parts of his biography, including his employment history and education. He  eventually admitted to  doing that.\n \n\n   \n  Santos represented parts of Long Island and Queens and attempted to run in another New York district before pleading guilty.\n \n\n   \n  Santos had been serving out his sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution in Fairton, in southern New Jersey, per the federal Bureau of Prisons.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/europe/zaporizhzhia-ukraine-power-iaea-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"08:52:00-04:00","title":"Work underway to restore power at Ukrainian nuclear plant as UN announces rare local ‘ceasefire zones’","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Work is underway to restore power to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) in Ukraine after a four-week blackout, the longest since the war began.

1:00 PM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Over the last two years, many big-name celebrities have made noise on behalf of a permanent ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.\n \n\n   \n  Now that a ceasefire —  no matter how fragile it may be  — has been reached, the tensions in Hollywood show no signs of ending. In this heated environment, even what you post online, and when you post it, is fodder.\n \n\n   \n  Erin Foster, creator of Netflix’s hit series “Nobody Wants This,” went on Instagram this week to ask: “I’m not sure why everyone is being so utterly quiet today, but there is a deal in place that will finally bring peace to Palestinians. Why are you not celebrating it?”\n \n\n   \n  “After 2 years of screaming ‘Ceasefire Now!!’ It is clear that was never the issue. It was eradicating Israel,” actress Debra Messing wrote on her Instagram this week. (Messing is one of Hollywood’s most vocal pro-Israel voices.) “The silence of the ‘Free Palestine’ movement is sickening,” she re-posted. “Your silence makes it unavoidably obvious that it’s only about terrorizing Jews.”\n \n\n   \n  Pro-Palestinian and anti-war celebrities have used red carpets, award shows and their social media accounts to keep focus on the people of Palestine. Mark Ruffalo, for one, reposted a message this week from Film Workers for Palestine that said, “We share in the relief of Palestinians in Gaza that Israel’s relentless slaughter may be coming to an end.” A week ago, he also reposted a note from the group Artists4Ceasefire that expressed hope about the ceasefire and for the return of hostages to Israel. He was among those criticized for not marking the return of the Israeli hostages since they were released earlier this week.\n \n\n   \n  Cynthia Nixon, similarly, had posted a message to “Free all the hostages and Free Palestine” on October 9, but pro-Israel activists said that she didn’t acknowledge the return of Israeli civilian hostages. These activists also suggested that none of these celebrities spoke up about Hamas executing Palestinians in the streets of Gaza this week.\n \n\n   \n  The execution-style killings of Palestinians in Gaza has a potential to trigger an unraveling of the ceasefire. President Donald  Trump warned  Hamas this week that “We will have no choice but to go in and kill them,” in  an escalation of rhetoric  during this brittle moment.\n \n\n   \n  “Celebrities that have been so outspoken and so engaged with this conflict and calling out Israel almost on a daily basis have all gone quiet about the brutal murder of Palestinians in Gaza since the ceasefire began,” says Hen Mazzig, senior fellow at the pro-Israel Tel Aviv institute, which utilizes influencers online to enact opinion change about both Jews and Israel. He made the claim that these activists didn’t care about Palestinians but were only using the cause to attack Israel, saying that “the mask was off”: “We know exactly what they stand for and we know exactly what it was all about — I think it’s clear it was about using their platform to attack Israel.”\n \n\n   \n  Javier Bardem — who has been one of Hollywood’s biggest critics of Israel and most passionate advocates for Palestinians — spoke to CNN about the executions specifically.\n \n\n   \n  “Of course, I am completely against the execution of anyone including Palestinians by Hamas. It is an atrocious act of violence,” Bardem said in a statement, speaking on the matter for the first time. “Everyone deserves a fair trial where the accusations are shown and proven, and only then be rightfully accountable by a fair law that obviously does not include execution.”\n \n\n   \n    The boycott that will pit studios and talent against each other\n \n\n   \n  Bardem is one of nearly 4,000 Hollywood figures who signed a pledge last month to boycott Israeli film institutions. The pledge said that Israel’s filmmaking industry is “implicated in genocide and apartheid against the Palestinian people.”\n \n\n   \n  On the Emmys red carpet last month, Bardem wore a keffiyeh and did a series of interviews to support the people of Palestine, telling   Variety , “I cannot work with somebody that justifies or supports the genocide. That’s as simple as that. And we shouldn’t be able to do that, in this industry or any other industry.”\n \n\n   \n  The Israeli film boycott, organized last month by Film Workers for Palestine, drew support from a substantial number of A-listers, including Emma Stone, Joaquin Phoenix, Ayo Edebiri, Ilana Glazer, Susan Sarandon, Ruffalo, Nixon and Bardem.  (A representative for Nixon did not respond to CNN’s request for comment. Ruffalo’s representative said he was unavailable and in production overseas.)\n \n\n   \n  The boycott prompted an open letter from a different group of Hollywood artists, including Liev Schreiber, Gene Simmons, Sharon Osbourne, Jerry O’Connell, Howie Mandel, Mayim Bialik and Messing who denounced the call to stop working with Israeli film institutions over the war in Gaza, stating that the letter promotes “censorship and the erasure of art.”\n \n\n   \n  Paramount and Warner Bros. – which are both under the leadership of pro-Israel CEOs in David Ellison and David Zaslav, respectively – have issued statements taking a clear stand against the Israel film boycott, in a strong and rare public position from two major Hollywood studios. (Warner Bros. shares the same parent company as CNN.)\n \n\n   \n  Now, they will have to contend with thousands of artists in the creative community who disagree with their company’s stance.\n \n\n   \n  Bardem told CNN that the Film Workers for Palestine pledge to boycott Israeli film institutions is about holding institutions accountable.\n \n\n   \n  “I want this to be very clear. We do not discriminate against any person based on their nationality, race, religion, or gender,” Bardem told CNN. “We of course believe discrimination of any kind is wrong and do not support that and have continued to reiterate this. We support holding companies and institutions all over the world accountable, not individuals, for their complicity and participation in the genocide of the Palestinian people in Gaza, and the illegal settlement of the West Bank.”\n \n\n   \n  A representative for Artists4Ceasefire – which was the first advocacy group to galvanize prominent celebrities to call for a ceasefire after October 7, 2023 – declined to participate in an interview with CNN about next steps for the movement now that a ceasefire deal has been reached, but provided a statement about their mission of achieving a permanent ceasefire. (The representative also declined to identify who runs the organization, saying that “we are a collective of artists and advocates.”)\n \n\n   \n  That group is behind the red pins that many celebrities – from Ruffalo to comedian Ramy Youssef to singer Billie Eilish – wore on the Oscars red carpet, symbolizing solidarity with Palestinian people.

at risk of losing food stamps next month amid shutdown \n       \n  By Tami Luhby, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:00 AM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Roughly 42 million people are at risk of losing critical food assistance in November amid the federal government shutdown. And it’s not clear whether the Trump administration will step in to find the funds to continue paying benefits, as it has with  other priorities .\n \n\n   \n  The food stamp program will run out of money in two weeks, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins told reporters at the White House on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “So you’re talking about millions and millions of vulnerable families, of hungry families that are not going to have access to these programs because of this shutdown,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Like other members of the Trump administration, Rollins cast blame on the Democrats,  posting on X  Thursday that they are putting “their political agenda ahead of food security for American families.”\n \n\n   \n  Democrats have argued Republicans are at fault for being unwilling to negotiate a spending deal that includes the extension of  expiring enhanced Obamacare premium subsidies .\n \n\n   \n  Rollins’ comments came a week after the US Department of Agriculture told states that there is not enough money to pay full food stamp benefits in November if the lapse in federal funding continues. The agency asked states to hold off on November payments until further notice.\n \n\n   \n  About one in eight Americans receive help buying food through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, the formal name for food stamps. A key pillar of the nation’s safety net, the program provides enrollees with an average monthly benefit of $188 per person, as of May.\n \n\n   \n    Debate over contingency funding\n \n\n   \n  The nation’s largest anti-hunger program, SNAP has a contingency fund of about $6 billion, but November benefits are expected to total around $8 billion. The USDA’s shutdown plan noted multi-year contingency funding is available to fund benefits in the event of a lapse.\n \n\n   \n  Asked whether the USDA intends to make at least a partial benefit payment next month, a senior agency official pointed to Rollins’ comments that the program’s funding will be depleted in two weeks.\n \n\n   \n  New York Gov. Kathy Hochul blasted the Trump administration for requiring states to halt the process of issuing monthly benefits.\n \n\n   \n  “This is a deliberate and unprecedented decision intended to inflict pain on millions of hardworking American families — the federal government should instead do everything in its power to prioritize our most vulnerable and make funding available for this critical program,” Hochul, a Democrat, said in a statement Friday.\n \n\n   \n  The food stamp program is the second nutrition assistance lifeline at risk of running out of money amid the ongoing standoff on Capitol Hill between Republicans and Democrats over approving a federal spending package for the current fiscal year. The impasse forced the federal government to shut down on October 1.\n \n\n   \n  WIC, which provides food aid to nearly 7 million pregnant women, new moms and young children, was on course to deplete its funding earlier this month. But the Trump administration shifted $300 million in  tariff revenue  that’s typically used to fund child nutrition programs to keep WIC operating. The infusion should be enough to cover benefits for the rest of the month, according to the National WIC Association.\n \n\n   \n  However, there is not enough of that tariff revenue to also shore up the food stamp program for November, a senior USDA official told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The looming lack of funding is already forcing 17 states to stop accepting new food stamp applications. That’s because their systems would require them to send partial October payments with November’s benefits. Other states are able to separate payments for the two months and can distribute October’s aid to new enrollees.\n \n\n   \n  This is not the first time that food stamps have been at risk during a shutdown. During the record-long impasse that began in December 2018, the USDA initially said benefits would run dry at the end of January. But the agency then said it would use a provision allowing it to make obligated payments within 30 days of a government funding lapse to  cover February payments . That workaround ultimately wasn’t needed since the shutdown ended in late January.\n \n\n   \n    Critical program\n \n\n   \n  Food stamps provide critical assistance to families who need the help to be able to eat, said Gina Plata-Nino, acting director of SNAP at the Food Research & Action Center, an advocacy group.\n \n\n   \n  The November benefits are especially important with Thanksgiving on the horizon, she said. And food pantries can’t fill the gap since they are already under strain.\n \n\n   \n  The administration should act urgently to protect food stamp benefits, as it has done with its other priorities during the impasse, said Ty Jones Cox, vice president of food assistance at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n \n\n   \n  “We can’t let households who need help purchasing food become another casualty of this shutdown,” she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/business/steinway-piano-factory-trump-trade","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"08:00:00-04:00","title":"How a company from the Gilded Age could be the future of US manufacturing","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores how Steinway & Sons, a 150-year-old piano manufacturer in Astoria, Queens, remains a rare success story in US manufacturing.

\n        8:00 AM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Oversized crowbars bend wood for a piano’s rim. Circular sanders smooth rough edges on costly Sitka spruce soundboards. Hammers and chisels notch a bridge to allow piano strings to vibrate freely.\n \n\n   \n  For 30 years, Bernard Craddock has been one of the roughly 200 workers handcrafting pianos at the 150-year-old Steinway & Sons factory in Astoria, a neighborhood in the New York borough of ﻿Queens.\n \n\n   \n  “Everybody has a specific job here,” Craddock said, working on a piano frame. “My job is to set this straight for the hammers to hit the strings.”\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump has vowed to start an American manufacturing renaissance, one of the main aims of his trade war. But manufacturing isn’t easy anywhere in the United States thanks to high costs, strict regulations and lack of workers with the necessary skills.\n \n\n   \n  Steinway & Sons, however, is a rare bright spot in US manufacturing. A company that thrives because it doesn’t mass produce its product. Instead, it uses a small workforce of skilled craftsmen to produce a premium item — world-class pianos.\n \n\n   \n  “They have this storied, legacy brand,” said Adam Hersh, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute. “They can charge a premium for that, but they also are serving higher market segments that can afford to pay those premium prices and need to because they’re performing on pianos at the highest levels.”\n \n\n   \n  Most US manufacturers are forced to compete on price, which has become tougher as Trump’s tariffs, especially on key inputs like steel, aluminum and copper, have raised prices.\n \n\n   \n  But by making pianos many consider the best in the world, Steinway can charge high enough prices to keep its US-based operation up and running. A Steinway grand piano can be priced as low as $90,000 or as much as $200,000.\n \n\n   \n  “I think we are the largest manufacturer remaining in New York City, we’re very proud of that. It’s not easy to continue to manufacture in New York,” Steinway & Sons CEO Ben Steiner told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Steiner said his company thrives because it focuses on quality merchandise.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s no other way with the cost structure that we have to operate in New York City, or even operating in the United States or in Europe,” he added. “Unless you’re focused on quality and innovation, you’re not going to survive.”\n \n\n   \n    Trump’s trade agenda could affect jobs\n \n\n   \n  Despite the stated goal of reshoring manufacturing jobs, Trump’s tariffs on most US imports may be  having the opposite effect .\n \n\n   \n  The US shed another  12,000 manufacutring jobs in August , the latest data available, for the fourth month in a row. Roughly 42,000 jobs have been lost since April.\n \n\n   \n  Hersh said Trump’s chaotic trade agenda is acting as a roadblock to factory hiring.\n \n\n   \n  “Businesses don’t like (tariffs), but they can adjust to a reasonable tariff,” Hersh said. “(Trump has) created uncertainty for the economy that just has businesses sitting on their hands, not being able to make decisions about investment or to hire new workers.”\n \n\n   \n  The White House told CNN that the goal of Trump’s policy is to ensure domestic manufacturers are able to source everything they need in the US, from inputs to workers.\n \n\n   \n  “America cannot just be an assembler of foreign-made parts. The Trump administration is taking a nuanced, multi-faceted approach to reshore every step of the manufacturing that’s critical to our national and economic security,” said White House spokesman Kush Desai. “There is no shortage of American hands and minds to build America’s next industrial Golden Age.”\n \n\n   \n  But American manufacturing looks very different from five decades ago, when millions of workers were employed to perform specific tasks along assembly lines. After trade agreements flourished in the 1990s, many of those jobs moved abroad.\n \n\n   \n  And in today’s age of automation and artificial intelligence, factory floors are increasingly filled with robots. That means US factories require fewer workers with specialized skills.\n \n\n   \n  Like at Steinway, where making pianos suitable for the world’s best concert halls isn’t a quick process. Building a piano takes Steinway’s skilled craftsmen 11 months from start to finish. On average, workers complete only four or five pianos a day.\n \n\n   \n  And because the piano’s many components are domestically sourced, Steiner said tariffs haven’t impacted them significantly.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s minor impacts in certain materials, but because we manufacture in the United States, it’s not a major issue for us,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    Maintaining a consistent workforce\n \n\n   \n  While top-of-the-line pricing and domestic sourcing can solve a lot of problems for Steinway, it can’t solve them all.\n \n\n   \n  One of the biggest challenges facing the piano maker is a potential shortage of Sitka spruce lumber, which Steiner said makes the very best instruments.\n \n\n   \n  “For the Sitka spruce, we find that the best in the world comes from a particular part of Alaska where there’s a very short growing season,” he said. “As a consequence, the trees grow very slowly.”\n \n\n   \n  And Steinway needs to make sure one other component is in good supply: skilled workers.\n \n\n   \n  The factory in Astoria has been in almost continuous operation since 1873, with only temporary pauses in piano production during the Great Depression and World War II. During that time, the company produced glider parts for the war effort.\n \n\n   \n  “It not only kept the lights on, so to speak, but it kept some of the valued craftspeople around,” said Anthony Gilroy, Steinway’s Vice President for Marketing and Communications. “The Steinways were smart enough to know that after the war you’d get a lot of people coming back willing to work but without the skills to build pianos, and you needed these old timers, if you will, here in the factory to train the next generation of piano makers.”\n \n\n   \n  That’s part of the reason Steinway & Sons has never considered relocating out of New York City. It’s those highly specific jobs – performed by “old timers” like 30-year craftsman Craddock in the frame assembly department – why Steinway keeps calling Astoria home.\n \n\n   \n  “The skills that they have, you can’t replicate it. You can’t just open up a factory somewhere else and have those skills,” said Steiner. “So long as our craftspeople are here I can’t think of any reason why they wouldn’t be, then we’ll still be making our pianos here.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/us/arizona-inmate-execution-richard-djerf","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"09:03:00-04:00","title":"Arizona Executes Man for Killing 4 Members of a Phoenix Family in 1993","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a significant execution event, Richard Kenneth Djerf, 55, was put to death in Arizona on October 18, 2025, for the 1993 murder of four members of the Luna family in Phoenix—Albert Luna Sr., Patricia Luna, 18-year-old Rochelle Luna, and 5-year-old Damien Luna—after being driven by a motive of revenge over a previous theft allegedly committed by Albert Luna Jr. The execution, the second in Arizona that year and the fourth in the U.S. that week, followed years of criticism and procedural failures, including a botched 2014 execution and multiple pauses since 2014.

Phoenix in 1993 \n       \n  By Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:03 AM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  A man convicted of killing four members of a Phoenix family over 30 years ago in an act of revenge over stolen goods was put to death Friday in Arizona’s  second execution of the year .\n \n\n   \n  Richard Kenneth Djerf, 55, died by lethal injection for the killings of Albert Luna Sr. and Patricia Luna; their daughter Rochelle Luna, 18; and son Damien Luna, 5, at their home on Sept. 14, 1993. Djerf, who was in prison for over 29 years, chose not to seek clemency.\n \n\n   \n  His execution was the  fourth in the country this week  and the 39th of the year.\n \n\n   \n  “Those four innocent victims deserve justice, and their loved ones deserve closure,” said Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, whose office sought the execution.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors said Djerf blamed another family member, Albert Luna Jr., who did not witness the killings, for an earlier theft of electronics and a gun from his apartment. Djerf became obsessed with exacting revenge and went to the home months later claiming to be delivering flowers, prosecutors said.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities say Djerf sexually assaulted Rochelle Luna and slashed her throat; beat Albert Luna Sr. with an aluminum baseball bat then stabbed and shot him; and tied Patricia and Damien Luna to kitchen chairs before fatally shooting them.\n \n\n   \n  Djerf declined to make any last statement. He did not put up any resistance but took a few heavy breaths and emitted a brief snoring sound after the lethal drugs were administered, John Barcello, deputy director of the Arizona Department of Corrections, Rehabilitation and Reentry, said during a news conference Friday.\n \n\n   \n  No representatives of the victims were present, Barcello said.\n \n\n   \n  It took about 10 minutes for the execution team to insert the IV lines into his veins so the drugs could be administered. After the first of two pentobarbital shots were given, he made several sounds, including a grunt and puffing sound. About 15 minutes elapsed between the first pentobarbital shot and the declaration that he was dead.\n \n\n   \n  Barcello said Djerf’s veins “were not optimal” and it required a few attempts to successfully place the IV.\n \n\n   \n  “By all accounts the process went according to plan and without any incident,” Barcello said. A month ago, Djerf  released a statement  in which he acknowledged carrying out the killings and apologized for the pain he caused.\n \n\n   \n  Arizona has been criticized in the past for taking too long to insert IVs during lethal injection executions. Experts say it should take seven to 10 minutes from the beginning of insertion until a proclamation of death.\n \n\n   \n  The state has paused executions twice since 2014 amid concerns over its use of the death penalty.\n \n\n   \n  There was a nearly eight-year hiatus brought on by difficulties in obtaining the needed drugs and criticism that a 2014 execution was botched: Joseph Wood was injected with  15 doses  of a two-drug combination over two hours, leading him to snort repeatedly and gasp hundreds of times before he died.\n \n\n   \n  Executions resumed in 2022, and  three prisoners were put to death  that year. They were paused again in 2023 after Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs ordered a review of the capital punishment protocol and Democratic Attorney General Kris Mayes agreed not to pursue any executions.\n \n\n   \n  The review ended in November 2024, when Hobbs fired a retired federal magistrate she had appointed to examine execution procedures, and the state corrections department announced changes in the lethal injection team.\n \n\n   \n  Arizona last carried out a death sentence in mid-March,  executing Aaron Brian Gunches  for the 2002 killing of Ted Price.\n \n\n   \n  With Djerf’s execution, there are now 107 prisoners on Arizona’s death row.\n \n\n   \n  Five more executions are scheduled in the U.S. this year — two in Florida and one each in Alabama, Oklahoma and Tennessee, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/16/us/trump-universities-compact-funding","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"12:57:00.000+00:00","title":"Six Universities Reject White House Funding Deal with Attached Ideological Demands","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Six of nine universities—MIT, Penn, Brown University, USC, Dartmouth College, and the University of Virginia—have rejected a White House proposal to join a funding compact that would provide preferential access to federal grants in exchange for ideological changes such as removing sex and ethnicity from admissions, capping international enrollment, and adopting gender definitions based on biological processes.

Multiple other schools have yet to respond \n       \n  By Taylor Romine, Betsy Klein, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:57 PM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The battle for academic freedom and institutional sovereignty in higher education continues to play out as another university has rejected  a White House offer for expanded access to federal funding  in return for agreeing to a series of demands.\n \n\n   \n  After a meeting at the White House Friday, the University of Virginia declined an offer by the Trump administration to join a compact that would potentially give preferential funding in exchange for a list of changes to school policy, including no longer considering sex and ethnicity in admissions and capping international enrollment. The letter was sent to nine universities at the beginning of the month, and a total of five schools have rejected the offer so far.\n \n\n   \n  The compact is aimed at “the proactive improvement of higher education for the betterment of the country,” according to a letter sent to the universities.\n \n\n   \n  USC, Penn, Brown University, Dartmouth College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have all also rejected the proposal. Other schools – a mix of public and private universities – have either said they are reviewing the compact or haven’t commented publicly.\n \n\n   \n  Before UVA announced it was declining the offer, Trump officials on Friday convened representatives from the school and several other universities – including three additional schools that have now been asked to sign on to the compact, a White House official said.\n \n\n   \n  The White House cast Friday’s conversation as “productive” and said it is now up to the schools to decide. CNN has reached out to the remaining schools for comment.\n \n\n   \n  The offers come as the Trump administration attempts different methods of crafting an unprecedented level of control over universities – among the centers of cultural debate in American life.\n \n\n   \n  As universities contemplate the Trump administration’s offer, here is what we know about the choice ahead.\n \n\n   \n    What the compact is\n \n\n   \n  Letters were sent to nine universities on October 1, asking them to agree to a series of demands in return for expanded access to federal funding.\n \n\n   \n  The schools that received the initial letters, according to a White House official, include: Vanderbilt University, University of Pennsylvania, Dartmouth College, University of Southern California, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of Texas at Austin, University of Arizona, Brown University and University of Virginia. Several of these schools have already had  funding   disputes  with the administration.\n \n\n   \n  Since then, another three schools – Arizona State University, University of Kansas, and Washington University in St. Louis – were also asked to take part in the agreement, a White House official said. Representatives from the three schools were at Friday’s meeting at the White House, along with Vanderbilt University, Dartmouth College, the University of Texas at Austin, the University of Arizona, and UVA.\n \n\n   \n  The universities were asked to implement ideological polices, such as removing factors like sex and ethnicity from admissions consideration, to foster “a vibrant marketplace of ideas on campus” with “no single ideology dominant, both along political and other relevant lines,” as well as to assess faculty and staff viewpoints, and adopt definitions of gender “according to reproductive function and biological processes,” according to a copy of the document obtained by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Schools that sign on must also commit to reforming or shuttering “institutional units that purposefully punish, belittle, and even spark violence against conservative ideas,” the document says.\n \n\n   \n  The letters also request changes to other aspects of university culture, including a commitment to “grade integrity,” a mandatory five-year freeze on tuition costs, and a 15% required cap on international students, the document says.\n \n\n   \n  If the schools enter the agreement, they “would be given priority for grants when possible as well as invitations for White House events and discussions with officials,” a White House official said when the letters were sent.\n \n\n   \n  To ensure enforcement, the compact would require faculty, students and staff to participate in an annual “anonymous poll” to see if universities are complying with the agreement.\n \n\n   \n  While the letter said that “limited, targeted feedback” would be welcomed, the compact was “largely in its final form” and hoped to have initial signatories “no later than November 21, 2025.”\n \n\n   \n  An initial copy of the compact was drafted in December, according to a source familiar with the matter, with edits and changes made collaboratively since the president returned to the White House.\n \n\n   \n    What is at stake for the schools\n \n\n   \n  Colleges and universities have been a target for Trump’s second term, and this is one of several attempts to get select universities to comply with their ideological requirements.\n \n\n   \n  Some schools, including several of the nine schools that received the letters, have been involved in funding battles since the new administration assumed power. While some prominent schools have made deals or concessions, others  maintain their concerns  despite pressure through government investigations or revoked grants.\n \n\n   \n  Schools have even invested in federal lobbying,  with a CNN analysis showing  that Trump’s higher education targets have together spent 122% more in lobbying expenses in Q2 of this year compared with last year, with nine out of 14 institutions singled out by Trump doubling their spending since last year.\n \n\n   \n  Signing onto the compact would give the universities “a competitive advantage,” a White House official previously said. The letter also said that it would “yield multiple positive benefits for the school, including allowance for increased overhead payments where feasible, substantial and meaningful federal grants, and other federal partnerships.”\n \n\n   \n    How schools have responded\n \n\n   \n  Of the nine universities that the officials said were sent the letter, six have formally responded by declining the offer – MIT, Penn, Brown University, USC, Dartmouth College and the University of Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  Dartmouth College declined the offer Saturday morning. Dartmouth President Sian Leah Beilock maintained the school needs to set its own policies according to its mission and values, she said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  “I do not believe that a compact—with any administration—is the right approach to achieve academic excellence, as it would compromise our academic freedom, our ability to govern ourselves, and the principle that federal research funds should be awarded to the best, most promising ideas,” Beilock said.\n \n\n   \n  The University of Virginia  declined the offer  Friday, just hours after school officials attended a meeting at the White House regarding the compact. While there are many areas of agreement in the proposed compact, “we believe that the best path toward real and durable progress lies in an open and collaborative conversation,” university interim President Paul Mahoney said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  University of Pennsylvania President J. Larry Jameson  said  he informed the US Department of Education Thursday that the school declines the proposed compact after receiving input from faculty, students, trustees and others.\n \n\n   \n  Penn “provided focused feedback highlighting areas of existing alignment as well as substantive concerns,” Jameson said in a statement to the community.\n \n\n   \n  USC  also declined the offer  Thursday, with the university’s Interim President Beong-Soo Kim citing concerns with agreeing to the compact.\n \n\n   \n  While the school recognizes the administration is trying to address issues in higher education, “tying research benefits to it (the compact) would, over time, undermine the same values of free inquiry and academic excellence that the Compact seeks to promote,” Kim said in a letter to Department of Education Secretary Linda McMahon that was shared online.\n \n\n   \n  “Other countries whose governments lack America’s commitment to freedom and democracy have shown how academic excellence can suffer when shifting external priorities tilt the research playing field away from free, meritocratic competition,” Kim said. California Gov. Gavin Newsom previously threatened to  withhold state funding  to universities in his state that agree to the compact.\n \n\n   \n  MIT  announced its refusal  on October 10, when university President Sally Kornbluth said she acknowledged “the vital importance of these matters,” but that the compact included principles that ultimately “would restrict freedom of expression and our independence as an institution.”\n \n\n   \n  Brown University President Christina H. Paxson made similar comments in  her Wednesday letter to the administration , saying they plan to  abide by a July 30 agreement  they previously reached with the government, but that this compact “by its nature and by various provisions would restrict academic freedom and undermine the autonomy of Brown’s governance.”\n \n\n   \n   Vanderbilt University  and the University of Arizona have said they are reviewing the compact, with Arizona’s president saying the “proposal has generated a wide range of reactions and perspectives.” Neither of the schools have indicated if they are planning to sign on or not.\n \n\n   \n  The University of Texas at Austin took a different tone than its counterparts. They didn’t say if they would sign the agreement, but they “welcome the new opportunity presented to us and we look forward to working with the Trump Administration on it.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/sport/baseball-mlb-mariners-blue-jays-game-5-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"07:49:00-04:00","title":"Eugenio Suárez grand slam powers Seattle Mariners to within one win of first World Series","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Eugenio Suárez hit a historic grand slam in the bottom of the eighth inning, giving the Seattle Mariners a 6-2 lead over the Toronto Blue Jays and pushing them within one win of their first World Series appearance in franchise history.

Jamie Barton, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:49 AM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  It is no exaggeration to say the most important swing of the bat by a  Mariner  in 30 years happened on Friday night.\n \n\n   \n   Eugenio Suárez  approached the plate in the bottom of the eighth inning with the score tied at two each. Moments later, he hit just the second grand slam in franchise postseason history to give Seattle a 6-2 win over the  Toronto Blue Jays  and put the Mariners closer to the World Series than they have ever been.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve been waiting for games like this my whole career,” said Suárez in an emotional postgame press conference to which he brought his two daughters.\n \n\n   \n  “Today I had it. Today I had it in front of our crowd, in front of my family – my two daughters, my wife. The moment is very special right now.”\n \n\n   \n  After defeating the New York Yankees in the 1995 American League Division Series (ALDS) – a win which many believed  saved baseball in Seattle  – the Mariners came within two wins of the World Series in the resulting Championship Series but ultimately lost out to Cleveland.\n \n\n   \n  Five years later they were within two victories of the promised land once again, but could not get past the Yankees.\n \n\n   \n  Now, Seattle needs just one more win to erase its unwanted record of being the only active major league franchise never to make it to the Fall Classic.\n \n\n   \n  “After Geno’s grand slam, I’m not sure I’ve heard that building any louder than that,” said Mariners manager Dan Wilson.\n \n\n   \n  “It makes you emotional thinking about that, and just how loud it was in that moment. Talking to a lot of people who have been around here since the 2001 days, and they don’t remember a time that it was this loud before.”\n \n\n   \n  After the Blue Jays had tied the series with two alarmingly comfortable wins in Seattle in Games 3 and 4, Suárez got the Mariners on the board with a solo home run to left field in the second inning.\n \n\n   \n  A magnificent double play from Cal Raleigh got Seattle out of a bases-loaded jam in the fourth, but the Blue Jays struck back after Mariners starter Bryce Miller was surprisingly sat down in the fifth inning.\n \n\n   \n  A two-out double from George Springer brought home Addison Barger in the fifth to tie the game, before Ernie Clement’s single drove in Alejando Kirk an inning later.\n \n\n   \n  By the eighth inning, the Mariners were facing the serious possibility of having to win both games in Toronto to take the series. But they found a spark from a familiar source, Raleigh tying the game with a floaty fly ball which hung in the air for 6.7 seconds before just barely clearing the wall in left field.\n \n\n   \n  “It felt like Cal’s ball was in the air for about an hour,” smiled Wilson after the game.\n \n\n   \n  Raleigh’s homer – his fourth this postseason and his 64th including the regular season – means he is now tied with Aaron Judge in 2022 for the most in a single year in the American League.\n \n\n   \n  It was also Seattle’s first game-tying or go-ahead home run in the eighth inning or later of a playoff game since Bret Boone in Game 4 of the 2001 American League Championship Series (ALCS).\n \n\n   \n  Having waited 24 years for such a dramatic postseason homer, Seattle fans were treated to another just moments later when Suárez’s heroics gave the Mariners an insurmountable lead.\n \n\n   \n  They now lead the series 3-2 and go back on the road. Game 6 takes place in Toronto on Sunday night.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/uk/prince-andrew-gives-up-royal-titles-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"07:51:00-04:00","title":"Prince Andrew gives up royal titles after string of scandals","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Prince Andrew has officially stepped back from using his royal titles, including Duke of York, after years of public scrutiny stemming from allegations of sexual misconduct linked to Jeffrey Epstein and ties to an alleged Chinese spy, Yang Tengbo.

CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:30 AM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Donald Trump may not be on the ballot in the fall’s biggest political races, but both sides are counting on him to help them win.\n \n\n   \n  A year after winning back the White House, Republicans are racing to motivate voters who love the president and Democrats are rallying those who don’t, as the races for governor in New Jersey and Virginia play out as an early referendum on Trump’s second term.\n \n\n   \n  “If you get a flat tire on the way home today, she’s going to blame President Trump,” said Jack Ciattarelli, the Republican nominee in New Jersey, drawing laughs as he takes aim at his Democratic rival, Rep. Mikie Sherrill. “There’s nothing she won’t blame on the president.”\n \n\n   \n  Facing a fierce fight, Sherrill is quick to invoke Trump in a different way, telling supporters: “That tariff plan? It’s a world-wide extortion scheme so that the Trump family can make billions of dollars. That is not creating opportunity for anyone in New Jersey.”\n \n\n   \n  New Jersey and Virginia are the only two states in the country that hold gubernatorial elections the year after a presidential campaign. The races could provide an early glimpse at the mood of the electorate, particularly toward the president’s party, but also as a test of enthusiasm as Democrats scramble to rebuild.\n \n\n   \n  The White House is keeping a close eye on both contests, yet Trump has only made a formal endorsement in New Jersey. He is poised to record messages on behalf of Ciattarelli and hold telephone rallies for his campaign, both of which are intended to specifically remind Trump voters about the urgency of the Nov. 4 contest.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re deploying his help in very strategic ways,” said Ciattarelli, who is seeking to walk a careful line of tapping into forces of the MAGA movement, while trying to dampen criticism of being too aligned with Trump. “This race is about New Jersey. It’s not about the president.”\n \n\n   \n  In Virginia, the government shutdown hangs over the race, with hundreds of thousands of federal workers, active-duty military and government contractors living in the state. The contest between former Rep. Abigail Spanberger, a Democrat, and Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, a Republican, is seen as less competitive, which is among the reasons that aides to Trump say he has kept more of a distance.\n \n\n   \n    New Jersey gains\n \n\n   \n  It’s far from certain how successful attempts to insert Trump into the race will be – or whether they could backfire on Democrats. He made significant gains in both states last fall, but his improvement was particularly notable in New Jersey, where Trump lost by 6 points after a punishing 16-point defeat in 2020.\n \n\n   \n  Sherrill and Spanberger, who were among the Democrats elected to Congress in 2018 during the first midterm election of Trump’s presidency, are relying less on arguments of protecting democracy and more on the tangible impacts of Trump’s policies in his second term.\n \n\n   \n  When the president said from the Oval Office this week that he “terminated” the Gateway tunnel, a $16 billion commuter rail between New Jersey and New York, as retribution to Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer, Sherrill seized on the moment. She said New Jersey would lose tens of thousands of jobs and residents would suffer because of Trump’s actions.\n \n\n   \n  “We see an out of control president, just at his whim, saying he’s going to cancel it,” Sherrill told reporters Thursday. “We are going to stand up and fight for that.”\n \n\n   \n  Less than three weeks before the election, the president’s words injected a fresh headache into the race for Ciattarelli and set the table for a real-world test of his embrace of Trump. He said he supported the “a critical infrastructure project,” adding New Jersey needed a new governor who had a good relationship “and when necessary, disagree” with Trump.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump effect is on full display in dueling campaign ads, where Sherill repeatedly calls her rival “Jack Ciattarelli, the Trump of Trenton.” Ciattarelli fires back, saying: “New Jersey’s a mess and all Mikie Sherrill wants to talk about is President Trump. Come on.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s also playing out on the debate stage when candidates were asked to grade Trump’s performance. Ciattarelli gave him an “A,” saying: “I think he’s right about everything he’s doing.” Sherrill blasted her opponent and his support of Trump, declaring: “I’d give him an F.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Banking on that voters’ remorse’\n \n\n   \n  For Republicans, it’s yet another test of how many Trump voters will cast ballots in elections in which his name is not on the ballot. The outcome could provide important lessons for both parties heading into the 2026 midterm elections, with control of Congress on the line.\n \n\n   \n  With early voting well underway in New Jersey and Virginia, conversations with voters suggest an exhaustion factor with Trump. Yet, for many, it’s unclear whether the president will be a deciding factor in a race driven by economic concerns like affordability and a call for change.\n \n\n   \n  Sherrill is seeking to replace New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, who has been in office for eight years. Not since 1961 have Democrats won three consecutive elections as governor.\n \n\n   \n  “This is not Trump’s race, it’s Jack’s race,” said Kathy Mueller Rohan, a voter from Morris County, New Jersey, which Trump narrowly carried last fall after losing it by about 4 points in 2020. “I don’t think he needs Trump to win.”\n \n\n   \n  But she believes the president could be helpful, particularly in places where he gained ground. New Jersey is among the states that saw some of the biggest swings toward Republicans in his third presidential election, particularly in non-white communities, which is one of the reasons Democrats have been sounding the alarm about the Sherrill-Ciattarelli race.\n \n\n   \n  “Quite frankly we’re concerned Donald Trump won Passaic County in last year’s election, so we have our work cut out for us,” said Mayor Andre Sayegh of Paterson, who supports Sherrill. “We’re being very aggressive in attempting to organize and motivate voters turned off by Trump.”\n \n\n   \n  The shift towards Trump in Passaic County, home to a large Hispanic community, is one of many painful snapshots of the last election that has not been forgotten by Democrats. It’s a county that Joe Biden won by more than 16 points in 2020 and Trump won by nearly 3 points in 2024.\n \n\n   \n  Sayegh, whose office walls are decorated with pictures of John F. Kennedy, said cultural issues have driven many voters in his area away from the Democratic Party. He believes this election is an opportunity for Democrats to rebuild and, perhaps, rebrand.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not a year ago – now he’s in!” Sayegh said, reflecting on the first year of Trump’s second term. “People, quite frankly, may have voters’ remorse. We’re banking on that voters’ remorse.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/us/dhs-credibility-chicago-immigration-ice","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-04:00","title":"In immigration crackdown, DHS statements on arrests face a problem of credibility","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A series of public statements by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) during a migrant crackdown in Chicago and Massachusetts have been contradicted by local officials, legal filings, and eyewitness videos.

\nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A series of public statements from the Department of Homeland Security during its  migrant crackdown in Chicago  and across the country has been contradicted or undermined by local officials, a civil rights attorney and a legal filing.\n \n\n   \n  These issues have been particularly notable in three prominent incidents: the arrest of a WGN employee, the shooting of a US citizen accused of ramming police vehicles and ICE’s detention of a 13-year-old in Massachusetts.\n \n\n   \n  A closer look at the incidents underscores the broader skepticism of the Department of Homeland Security’s statements as federal agents have moved into city streets in Chicago and elsewhere.\n \n\n   \n  Last week, a  federal judge temporarily halted  the Trump administration’s deployment of National Guard troops in Illinois, saying its statements about protests were “not reliable.” The administration had highlighted several arrests for carrying weapons and assaulting federal agents – but the judge responded that federal grand juries had refused to indict at least three of those arrested, indicating a lack of probable cause.\n \n\n   \n  “In addition to demonstrating a potential lack of candor by these affiants, it also calls into question their ability to accurately assess the facts,” US District Court Judge April Perry wrote in her order of those incidents.\n \n\n   \n  A judge openly questioning the credibility of law enforcement reflects a larger problem and raises questions as to what recourse ordinary citizens or immigrants have when accused.\n \n\n   \n  “A lawyer’s credibility isn’t just about personal integrity; it’s a factor judges are required to consider when ruling,” said Elliot Williams, CNN legal analyst and former federal prosecutor. “Simply put, parties lose when courts find their lawyers untrustworthy. DHS’s problem is how alarmingly consistent judges have been with their questions about the department’s work and its attorneys’ trustworthiness.”\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has appealed the ruling. DHS has said it is targeting arrests of the “worst of the worst,” and its agents are facing a surge in attacks against them.\n \n\n   \n  To understand this credibility issue, CNN took a closer look at DHS statements about the three high-profile incidents involving federal immigration enforcement.\n \n\n   \n  Asked about the contradictions between the DHS statements and other evidence, a spokesperson said, “We stand by everything we have previously said.”\n \n\n   \n    Arrest of WGN employee\n \n\n   \n  Video from a bystander last week captured the arrest of an employee working for the  Chicago TV station WGN .\n \n\n   \n  In the video, officers put the employee, Debbie Brockman, in handcuffs while she lies prone on the ground, her pants falling down. The officers then put her in an unmarked vehicle and leave the scene.\n \n\n   \n  “I asked the agents like, well, why are you detaining this person?” Josh Thomas, the witness who took the video of the arrest, told CNN. “They basically tell me she’s obstructing justice.”\n \n\n   \n  Thomas said he did not witness Brockman’s interaction with the agents before she was detained.\n \n\n   \n  Brockman was released without charges – either for obstructing justice or assault – after about seven hours of detention, according to her attorneys.\n \n\n   \n  After the video spread on social media, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia  McLaughlin said in a post on X  that the arrest came as US Border Patrol was driving around conducting immigration enforcement.\n \n\n   \n  “Deborah Brockman, a U.S. citizen, threw objects at Border Patrol’s car and she was placed under arrest for assault on a federal law enforcement officer,” McLaughlin said.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, her attorneys disputed McLaughlin’s version of events and said she was attacked by federal agents while on her morning commute.\n \n\n   \n  “Ms. Brockman and her legal team adamantly deny any allegation that she assaulted anyone. Rather, Ms. Brockman was the one who was violently assaulted by federal agents on her way to work,” the attorneys said.\n \n\n   \n    Car ramming suspect and firearm\n \n\n   \n  DHS’s statements about the shooting of a 30-year-old US citizen have been undermined by a criminal complaint and by an attorney who watched body-camera footage of the incident.\n \n\n   \n  Marimar Martinez, the US citizen, was arrested and shot multiple times by a Customs and Border Protection agent in Chicago on October 4.\n \n\n   \n  McLaughlin, the DHS assistant secretary, said in a  post on X  that multiple drivers, one of whom was “armed with a semi-automatic weapon,” rammed a law enforcement vehicle.\n \n\n   \n  “Law enforcement was forced to deploy their weapons and fire defensive shots at an armed US citizen who drove herself to the hospital to get care for wounds,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  A  DHS press release  repeated the allegation that Martinez was “armed with a semi-automatic weapon.” Together, the statements gave the impression Martinez had been brandishing her firearm when she was shot.\n \n\n   \n  Martinez was charged in federal court with forcibly assaulting, impeding, and interfering with a federal law enforcement officer. The criminal complaint, though, does not mention a semi-automatic weapon or that Martinez was armed.\n \n\n   \n  Instead, the complaint alleges Martinez drove into and side-swiped a CBP vehicle. When an agent got out of the vehicle, Martinez drove at the agent, who fired about five shots at Martinez, the complaint states.\n \n\n   \n  In court Wednesday, Assistant US Attorney Aaron Richard Bond said Martinez “forcibly impeded Border Patrol agents,” and that the case involved a dangerous weapon – a motor vehicle. Martinez pleaded not guilty.\n \n\n   \n  Martinez’s attorney, Christopher Parente, told CNN she has a concealed-carry license and had a handgun in her purse, inside a holster with the snap closed. “(It was) never brought out in this incident,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Parente has disputed the government’s account generally as well. He said he viewed body-camera footage, which has not been made public, that he said shows a CBP vehicle swerved into Martinez’s vehicle — not the other way around. Then, “within seconds,” an officer jumped out of his vehicle and fired at Martinez, Parente said.\n \n\n   \n  “Normally in a criminal case I would not speak to the media until the case is over, but there is such misinformation out there that the public needs to see this is not what they’ve been sold by the government,” Parente told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “I think anybody who sees what’s going on today is going to question these indictments coming out of the Department of Justice,” he added.\n \n\n   \n    Arrest of Massachusetts teen\n \n\n   \n  A 13-year-old in Everett, Massachusetts, was  detained by ICE  and moved to a different state last week in a case in which local officials have contradicted a key statement from a DHS official.\n \n\n   \n  The arrest took place October 9 when police called Josiele Berto, the mother of 13-year-old Arthur, to say her son had been arrested. The teenager was then detained by ICE and moved to Virginia, she soon learned.\n \n\n   \n  The Berto family is from Brazil and have had a pending asylum application since arriving in the US in 2021, Berto said.\n \n\n   \n  McLaughlin, the DHS official,  posted on X  what she said were the “facts” of the case, saying the teenager “was in possession of a firearm and 5-7 inch knife when arrested.”\n \n\n   \n  Everett Mayor Carlo DeMaria said a teenage boy – who he did not name because he is a juvenile – was arrested after Everett Police received a “credible tip” accusing him of making “a violent threat against another boy within our public school.”\n \n\n   \n  He confirmed the presence of the knife but was adamant that the teen did not have a firearm. “No guns were found,” DeMaria said.\n \n\n   \n  DHS did not respond to CNN’s request for comment on the discrepancy between the statements by McLaughlin and DeMaria over whether the child had a gun.\n \n\n   \n    Judge calls for use of body cameras\n\n \n\n   \n  Credibility questions have long trailed law enforcement agencies, whether federal or local, and police statements immediately after an arrest have occasionally proved to be incorrect or misleading. The murder of George Floyd, for example, was  initially described by Minneapolis Police  as, “Man dies after medical incident during police interaction.”\n \n\n   \n  Juliette Kayyem, CNN senior national security analyst and former DHS executive, said misleading claims can be exposed in the modern age.\n \n\n   \n  “In an era where everyone has a camera in their pocket, social media has been flooded with videos of immigration operations,” she said. “DHS must seriously understand that any blatantly misleading claim about tactics can often be easily disproved in this new digital age, especially if they’re happening frequently.”\n \n\n   \n  The credibility questions have also placed a spotlight on one law enforcement tool often missing from immigration enforcement operations: body-worn cameras. The technology is a staple at police departments across the country, documenting encounters with the public and helping clarify questionable incidents and competing claims.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, a federal judge in Chicago questioned whether federal law enforcement agents are following an earlier order and said she will  require all agents with body cameras  to have them on during encounters with immigration protesters.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s the nice thing about body cameras is that they pick up events before the triggering event happens,” she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/politics/kim-jong-un-donald-trump-asia-trip","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00Z","title":"Trump officials quietly discussing Kim Jong Un meeting during upcoming Asia trip","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Trump administration officials are privately discussing a potential meeting between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during Trump’s upcoming Asia trip.

Trump’s initial outreach to the North Korean leader earlier this year never received a reply because the North Koreans would not accept the letter, two sources told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  For the upcoming trip, the White House has instead been far more  focused on arranging a meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping  amid escalating trade tensions between the US and China.\n \n\n   \n  But Trump has publicly and privately expressed a desire to meet his North Korean counterpart, and officials have left the door open to a meeting while he’s on his trip to Asia. In Trump’s first term, officials arranged a  handshake between the two men in the Korean demilitarized zone  in less than 48 hours after the president  tweeted an invitation  to get together — an example of how quickly things can change.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s personal interest in a potential sit-down with Kim was  initially piqued after Trump hosted South Korean President Lee Jae Myung  at the White House in August, the sources said. During their meeting, Lee formally invited Trump to attend the gathering of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) trade ministers in South Korea and suggested the setting could provide Trump with a prime opportunity to meet with Kim, CNN previously reported.\n \n\n   \n  Trump was open to the idea, telling Lee he would look into it.\n \n\n   \n  “I will do that, and we’ll have talks. He’d like to meet with me,” Trump said of the North Korean leader. “We look forward to meeting with him, and we’ll make relations better.”\n \n\n   \n  For his part, Kim also expressed an openness to sitting down with Trump during a speech before the North Korean parliament last month, according to comments carried by North Korean state media.\n \n\n   \n  “Personally, I still have good memories of US President Trump,” Kim said during his speech, per the reports. “If the US drops its hollow obsession with denuclearization and wants to pursue peaceful coexistence with North Korea based on the recognition of reality, there is no reason for us not to sit down with the US.”\n \n\n   \n  But things have shifted since Trump met Kim in 2019 at Panmunjom on the border that divides the two Koreas. South Korea played a major part in bringing North Korea back to the table and laying the groundwork for that meeting, in which Trump become the first US president to step foot in the isolated and reclusive North.\n \n\n   \n  Ties between the two Koreas were much warmer then. South Korea’s new president has only been in power a few months and has yet to undo the legacy of his predecessor, who was far more hawkish towards Kim’s regime.\n \n\n   \n  According to South Korea’s Unification Ministry, there is no ongoing communication between South and North Korea regarding a possible North Korea-US summit.\n \n\n   \n  And while White House security teams have made two trips to South Korea to scout out locations ahead of Trump’s arrival, none of those trips was to the Panmunjom area, a South Korean government source said, suggesting a repeat of  the 2019 summit with Kim  is not in the cards for now.\n \n\n   \n  The White House declined to comment.\n \n\n   \n    A hastily arranged handshake\n \n\n   \n  The high-profile summits between Trump and Kim during the president’s first term failed to accomplish the president’s main goal: reining in North Korea’s nuclear program.\n \n\n   \n  Their meetings in Hanoi and Singapore came after intense prep work between the two sides that focused heavily on logistics and substance. As a result, administration officials and experts believe that if they were to meet again, both sides would have to be making arrangements now.\n \n\n   \n  But not every engagement between the two leaders was built upon the prolonged planning of working-level officials. The last meeting between Trump and Kim in 2019 was arranged hastily after the president tweeted an invitation to get together.\n \n\n   \n  The post abruptly set the wheels into motion for the two to meet at the DMZ – a now famous visit that resulted in Trump briefly stepping over the demarcation line into North Korea.\n \n\n   \n  At the time of that invitation, there had not been any active communications between the two sides for months, CNN previously reported. Rather, Trump had departed his last summit with the North Korean leader in Hanoi earlier that year without a deal or any signs of progress, signaling the breakdown of diplomatic efforts at the highest level.\n \n\n   \n  “Sometimes you have to walk,”  Trump said during  a news conference following the conclusion of the Hanoi summit, which broke up earlier than planned. “This was just one of those times.”\n \n\n   \n  Prior to Trump’s 2019 South Korea trip, his former North Korea staffers had considered trying to organize another meeting between the two leaders, but ultimately decided against it because they did not think that the moment was ripe to draw North Korea back to the table, according to former administration officials.\n \n\n   \n  That changed, however, when Trump began expressing interest in a sit down while he was on the ground in Asia.\n \n\n   \n  The president mentioned a possible meeting when he met with Chinese leader Xi at the time. He asked his then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo if he thought it would be a good idea, according to a former administration official. Pompeo said he would look into it. To the surprise of many of the members of the team working on the North Korea portfolio, Trump’s tweet went out the next morning.\n \n\n   \n  “After some very important meetings, including my meeting with President Xi of China, I will be leaving Japan for South Korea (with President Moon). While there, if Chairman Kim of North Korea sees this, I would meet him at the Border/DMZ just to shake his hand and say Hello(?)!” Trump tweeted.\n \n\n   \n  Trump administration officials immediately went into overdrive as they tried to figure out if Kim would accept. A Korean Central News Agency article came out hours after Trump’s tweet signaling Pyongyang’s openness to the meeting – something the Trump administration closely noted, the former official said. While the article stated that the North Koreans did not know the purpose of the meeting, they did not close the door on the possibility. Administration officials at that point believed a meeting was highly likely, the source said.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration then activated the US-North Korea hotline located at the DMZ that is manned 24/7 by a US military officer who speaks Korean. But the calls went unanswered. Then they turned to another tactic that they had used before: a bullhorn. A US military officer went to the border and used the bullhorn to project the message to the North Korean side that the US was trying to communicate with them about a leader-level meeting, the former official said. On the other side, a North Korean recorded the message but did not respond.\n \n\n   \n  Hours later, the hotline rang with an invitation for a US delegation to come to North Korea for a planning meeting. The US delegation, which included the Special Representative for North Korea Stephen Biegun, State Department official Kevin Kim and the NSA Senior Director for the Korean Peninsula Allison Hooker, flew from Seoul to the DMZ the same night that Trump’s tweet had been sent, where they met for about an hour with their North Korean counterparts. The two sides discussed the possible meeting but nothing was formally agreed to, and the Trump administration officials left with North Korea’s request for a detailed proposal by midnight. That proposal was faxed to Pyongyang when the officials returned to Seoul.\n \n\n   \n  North Korea’s response did not come overnight, and in the morning, US officials were monitoring every possible channel closely. Then a clear signal came through: the North Koreans had sent an expansive team to clean their side of the space along the Military Demarcation Line that divides North and South Korea, which was highly unusual. Then the hotline rang, and the news came that Kim Jong Un would partake in the meeting with Trump later that day.\n \n\n   \n  As he approached the North Korean leader, Trump took 20 steps into the country, making history as the first sitting US leader to set foot in the hermit kingdom. The two leaders then shook hands and met for about an hour.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/travel/travel-news-nazi-underground-city","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"06:00:00-04:00","title":"Deep underground, the Nazis built a city for thousands of soldiers.

In the 1980s and ‘90s, a subculture known as the Bunker People took over the tunnels, hosting unauthorized and often dangerous events here, from raves to weddings. Today, bats are its inhabitants, some 40,000 of them taking refuge in the darkness.\n \n\n   \n  In the 21st century, it’s been given new life as a dark tourism destination, with 19 miles of tunnels open to explore in the Międzyrzecz Fortified Region Museum.

2:15 AM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky failed to obtain Tomahawk missiles for strikes on Russia from a meeting with Donald Trump on Friday, with the US president later calling for both sides to cease fighting and accept current battle lines.\n \n\n   \n  Zelensky had traveled to Washington hoping to receive the long-range cruise missiles, which he believes could deliver a decisive blow to the Kremlin’s war economy by enabling targeted strikes on oil and energy facilities deep inside Russia.\n \n\n   \n  However, during opening remarks at a White House working lunch, Trump expressed  hopes to resolve the war  “without thinking about Tomahawks,” adding that the weapon is one America “needs.”\n \n\n   \n  And Zelensky appeared to come away empty-handed, describing the meeting as “productive” but declining to comment further on Tomahawks because the US “doesn’t want escalation.”\n \n\n   \n  Hours

But kids are shouting it for good reason \n       \n  By Scottie Andrew, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:00 AM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Not since 69 has a number caused this much disruption.\n \n\n   \n  “6-7,” pronounced “ six-seveeeeen ,” is haunting school halls across the country (including  South Park Elementary ), making it the Gen Alpha nonsense phrase of the moment. Kids are shouting it in classrooms when a teacher turns to page 67, when lunchtime is 6 to 7 minutes away or for no reason at all.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s like a plague — a virus that has taken over these kids’ minds,” said Gabe Dannenbring, a seventh-grade science teacher in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. “You can’t say any iteration of the numbers 6 or 7 without having at least 15 kids yell, ‘6-7!’”\n \n\n   \n  It’s a joke without a punchline (or a setup, for that matter). 6-7 means nothing, but using it can make a student feel like a member of a bigger, cooler group of their peers.\n \n\n   \n  “It becomes a language game to them that, it would seem, only folks in their group know how to play,” said Gail Fairhurst, a University of Cincinnati professor who teaches leadership communication (and Gen Alpha speak).\n \n\n   \n   Skibidi toilets  and  rizzes  come and go. 6-7 is likely destined for the slang graveyard soon, now that adults are talking about it so much. But there’s something almost profound about its infinite interpretations, its refusal to be defined.\n \n\n   \n  “I think that’s part of what upsets people about it, and I think that’s part of what people like about it,” said Taylor Jones, a  linguist  and social scientist.\n \n\n   \n    An attempt at explaining 6-7 (but don’t worry, no one knows what it means)\n \n\n   \n  There may be no coherent explanation for 6-7, but here goes anyway: The number appears in the chorus of “Doot Doot (6 7),” a viral  song  by the Philadelphia rapper Skrilla. (In Skrilla’s case, according to Jones, 6-7 is likely a reference to the 10-67 police code, which is often used to report a death.)\n \n\n   \n  In December 2024, around the same time “Doot Doot” started taking off, high school basketball phenom Taylen Kinney appeared to create a gesture to accompany the phrase. In a  clip  shared by his Overtime Elite team, Kinney’s teammate asks him to rate a Starbucks drink out of 10.\n \n\n   \n  “Like a 6 … 6 … 6-7,” he says, adding an indecisive gesture, as though he were weighing two options in his palms.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly thereafter, Kinney started incorporating the song and gesture into his  TikToks , where he has over 1 million followers.\n \n\n   \n  The song started appearing in  sports highlight reels , including those for Charlotte Hornets point guard LaMelo Ball. (He stands at  6 feet, 7 inches , natch.) Ball  doesn’t seem annoyed  by the memes yet, but the NBA season hasn’t officially started, so there’s still time.\n \n\n   \n  A face of 6-7 emerged in March, when a  video  caught a young, overexcited spectator at an amateur basketball game shouting “6-7!” with the accompanying hand gesture. He became the embodiment of that annoying classmate who can’t stop spouting nonsense phrases. Somehow, the internet decided this stereotype’s name was Mason — and thus, Mason 67 has become another inside joke. (This “Mason” character has since become an icon of online analog horror,  per  Know Your Meme, but that’s another story.)\n \n\n   \n  So, if a kid uses any of the above explanations when you ask what the heck 6-7 is, they’re probably right. But most kids don’t even know where it came from, Dannenbring said.\n \n\n   \n  “Nobody knows what it means,” he said. “And that’s kind of the funny thing about it.”\n \n\n   \n  Its meaninglessness is partly due to what Jones calls “semantic bleaching,” where a phrase is divorced from its original context and comes to mean something entirely different (or, in this case, nothing).\n \n\n   \n  Using 6-7 comes down to a willingness to have fun, Jones said: “Do you have a little bit of whimsy? Or are you a party pooper?”\n \n\n   \n    Kids scream ‘6-7’ to belong (and that’s cool)\n \n\n   \n  Sure, it’s nonsense, but 6-7 serves a critical social function. It’s a shibboleth, or a phrase that signifies that one belongs to an “in” group, Jones said. People who don’t say it or get it are on the outs. And what kid doesn’t want to belong?\n \n\n   \n  “Language is a way for people to form community,” said Fairhurst. “Even if it’s a nonsense term, if they seem to know what it means, that can be a unifying force. And if somebody isn’t understanding the term, it can exclude people from that community, as well.”\n \n\n   \n  6-7 has also survived longer than other internet nonsense words — even that pesky “skibidi” — likely because “grown-ups are so angry about it,” Jones said.\n \n\n   \n  “The fact that you can get a big reaction from somebody for something just totally meaningless — that might give it longer longevity than it might otherwise have,” Jones said.\n \n\n   \n  Fed-up teachers are banning it from their classrooms or making exasperated TikToks about the number of times they’ve heard it in a single school day (for Dannenbring, the  record is 75 ). Shouting “6-7!” after it’s forbidden becomes a “way to show resistance,” said Fairhurst.\n \n\n   \n  Teachers are now playing defense by using 6-7 themselves. A Michigan middle school choir teacher successfully staved away cries of “6-7” by  incorporating  it into a warmup song that also includes “slay,” “Ohio” and “ rizz .”\n \n\n   \n  “Don’t scream at me … even though you get excited,” the teacher begs her class before they begin chanting “6-7, 6-7, 6-7, skibidi,” a chorus of little cringe cherubs.\n \n\n   \n  When instructing his students to open their textbooks to page 67, Dannenbring will suddenly adopt the timbre of his enthusiastic seventh graders, who immediately protest their teacher using a phrase that does not belong to him. (At 27, Dannenbring is an elder member of Gen Z. But a young teacher is still a teacher, and, therefore, too old to play.)\n \n\n   \n  “If you don’t play into it, yeah, it’s super disruptive,” Dannenbring said. “If you acknowledge it, then it gets over with in about 15 seconds.”\n \n\n   \n  And if  that  doesn’t shut down the conversation, he said he uses it incorrectly on purpose: “‘That’s so 6-7 of you.’”\n \n\n   \n  “The easiest way to kill it is for teachers to say that it’s cool,” Jones said.\n \n\n   \n  Comedian Josh Pray has started using it in front of his kids, working it into his  videos , desperate to reclaim a formerly innocuous number.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m trying to take our numbers back!” he said. “I’ll be 67 before they know it, and I don’t want to hear that specific tone all around me as a taunt to my age!”\n \n\n   \n    Maybe ‘6-7’ isn’t brainrot after all (you were a dumb kid, too)\n \n\n   \n  Fear not, parents — incessantly screaming “6-7!” is not enough to prove that your children are “ brainrotting .” Concerns about literacy falling and critical thinking skills diminishing are legitimate, but they’re being “projected onto normal, youthful behavior,” Jones said.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re rewriting our own history,” Jones said. “This is not anywhere near being a new phenomenon.”\n \n\n   \n  Every generation invents its own slang, and language evolves in ways most of us will never consciously perceive, Jones said. Kids will always come up with cool new phrases (like  “cool”! ), and adults will be left scratching their heads in confusion.\n \n\n   \n  Nonsense phrases like this aren’t inherently harmful, and 6-7 certainly isn’t going to bring about the end of the English language, Fairhurst said. But its popularity  could  be a benign symptom of our “post-truth” society, she said, where the meaning and specificity of communication matters less than people’s interpretation of it.\n \n\n   \n  “It seems like it’s sort of a relative of that kind of phenomenon, where we’re just using language to use language, and not because we see something particularly meaningful or particularly real about it,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps 6-7 is already on its way out — it’s survived for nearly a year, essentially a century in TikTok time. Some of Dannenbring’s students are starting to roll their eyes when they hear their classmates yelling it. Middle school teacher and comedian Philip Lindsay said he’s already hearing potential replacements in his classroom — “41,” for one, another similarly meaningless number that makes kids inexplicably giggle.\n \n\n   \n  “41 was started to try and dethrone 6-7,” Lindsay said. “6-7 just happened. 41 was pushed.”\n \n\n   \n  The way Dannenbring sees it, slang can get a lot worse than 6-7. Past trends have inspired students to stick pencils into their school-issued laptops to set them on fire or rip sinks straight off the walls of their school bathrooms.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve had those words before, like Skibidi toilet,” he said. “This one is  significantly  less annoying.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/economy/trump-xi-tariff-trade","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"The latest chapter of the Trump-Xi ‘situationship’ explained","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reports on the re-escalation of trade tensions between the United States and China, following a previous month-long truce.

‘situationship’ explained \n       \n  Analysis by Elisabeth Buchwald, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Another spat between the leaders of the world’s two largest economies has quickly escalated, and if President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping don’t lower the temperature soon, both nations stand to pay an exorbitant price.\n \n\n   \n  Sky-high tariffs had brought trade between the two countries to a screeching halt earlier this year, before they reached a monthslong truce and substantially lowered levies on one another.\n \n\n   \n  But trade tensions have reignited, with Trump threatening to impose tariffs  starting at 130%  on Chinese exports by November 1, up from the 30% minimum rate currently in effect. Trump also said he’s prepared to impose export controls on what he referred to as “any and all critical software” to China. Beijing has signaled it would retaliate to all these actions.\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, Trump sounded confident he and Xi could resolve matters amicably, telling reporters that he intends to still meet with the Chinese leader on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea later this month. And US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who helps lead trade negotiations with China, said Friday that “things have deescalated” recently.\n \n\n   \n  But that was Friday. At any second, the tide could turn.\n \n\n   \n  So, how did we get here?\n \n\n   \n    Trump’s qualms with China\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month,  Beijing announced  plans to restrict exports of rare-earth minerals, critical materials needed to power a wide range of electronics. Under the new rules set to take effect later this year, five rare-earth elements were added to China’s existing list of seven other highly restricted rare-earth exports.\n \n\n   \n  Furthermore, China’s plan calls for mandated licenses for technology needed to mine, smelt and process rare earths, and to make magnets. Foreign governments and businesses would also need licenses to exchange Chinese-sourced rare earths or technology containing them.\n \n\n   \n  The country’s Ministry of Commerce said the restrictions aim to prevent materials from “being used, directly or indirectly, in military and other sensitive fields.”\n \n\n   \n  A day after Beijing announced those measures, Trump took to Truth Social, saying, “Our relationship with China over the past six months has been a very good one, thereby making this move on Trade an even more surprising one.”\n \n\n   \n  He went on to say that China has “quietly amassed into somewhat of a Monopoly position” with rare earths and called the new restrictions “a rather sinister and hostile move, to say the least.”\n \n\n   \n  US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, who has worked on trade agreements with China alongside Bessent, said last week: “It’s a clear repudiation of everything we’ve been working towards for the last six months, which was a stable tariff situation and a continued flow of rare earths.”\n \n\n   \n    What’s provoked China\n \n\n   \n  Beijing’s actions came after a series of moves Washington took that drew the ire of Chinese counterparts.\n \n\n   \n  Among them were  ramped-up restrictions  on worldwide exports to Chinese tech giants, including Huawei, of any parts of products manufactured using American equipment or software.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Commerce called the move announced last month “extremely malicious,” adding that the country would “take necessary measures” to protect the rights and interests of its companies.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration earlier this month also started taxing Chinese ships docked at American ports as well as products transported on Chinese-made ships. Beijing responded with a tit-for-tat fee at its ports.\n \n\n   \n  Washington, meanwhile, up until recently, kept extremely tight restrictions on exports of highly advanced chips, aiming to prevent Beijing from making more advancements in artificial intelligence.\n \n\n   \n  A meeting between Trump and Xi at APEC could be an opportunity to hash out their differences face to face as opposed to through American and Chinese officials. But things could just as easily devolve, pushing the two nations even further apart.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/africa/gen-z-topples-madagascars-president-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"06:46:00-04:00","title":"Gen Z protesters toppled Madagascar’s president.

The movement succeeded through a convergence of youth mobilization via social media and military action, with power now held by army commander Michael Randrianirina.

While some leaders like President Ruto of Kenya have challenged critics, others like President Museveni of Uganda have responded with repression.

Should other African leaders worry? \n       \n  By Nimi Princewill, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:46 AM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  This week, the military in Madagascar grabbed power as youth-led protests escalated, forcing President Andry Rajoelina to flee.\n \n\n   \n  The scenario was a familiar one for Rajoelina, 51, a former DJ, who was initially brought to power by the military in 2009 after another youth-driven uprising sent his predecessor into exile.\n \n\n   \n  Events in Madagascar reflect a broader trend of similar protests in recent years, impacting countries across Africa, Asia and South America.\n \n\n   \n  Although the protests differ in their specific causes, they share a common characteristic: they are primarily led by Generation Z (people born between the mid-1990s and early 2010s), who are voicing their dissatisfaction with their governments.\n \n\n   \n  Technology is also a common feature of the protests, which are organized and mobilized through social media.\n \n\n   \n  In  Nepal , a Gen Z movement fuelled by outrage over a social media ban, government corruption and limited economic opportunities led to the ousting of the prime minister in September.\n \n\n   \n  This followed a similar change in  Bangladesh  in 2024. The Bangladeshi ‘ Gen Z revolution’  involved weeks of intense protests, predominantly led by students, and resulted in the ousting of the nation’s long-serving leader Sheikh Hasina.\n \n\n   \n  Likewise, in 2022, youth protesters in  Sri Lanka  also succeeded in toppling the ruling regime.\n \n\n   \n  For Madagascar’s Gen Z, removing their president was a priority. However, while Bangladeshis saw a Nobel Peace Prize winner replace Hasina, Madagascar’s president was replaced by the military – meaning the country’s youth may have to wait for their choice of leader.\n \n\n   \n  Madagascar is now  under the control of Michael Randrianirina , the commander of a powerful army unit that previously supported Rajoelina’s rise to power.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for the movement, Elliot Randriamandrato, told news agency Agence France-Presse (AFP) that “the past few weeks are a half-victory, the real struggle begins now.”\n \n\n   \n  But he believes Rajoelina’s removal was expedited by the military’s involvement.\n \n\n   \n  “People need to understand that one couldn’t have happened without the other,” Randriamandrato told AFP. “Just the military, it wouldn’t have been possible. Just us, it would’ve taken months, even though we were ready for that. The turning point came from the convergence of both.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘African leaders should be wary’\n \n\n   \n  The question now is whether what happened in Madagascar will be repeated elsewhere on the continent.\n \n\n   \n  Young people in Africa have been increasingly vocal, calling for major reforms amid growing unrest. The continent has the  world’s youngest population .\n \n\n   \n  In North Africa, young Moroccans have coalesced under the banner of the  “GenZ 212” movement , named after the nation’s international dialling code.\n \n\n   \n  They are critical of the Moroccan government’s priorities, faulting authorities for investments in sports infrastructure which they say overshadow healthcare and education. Recent demonstrations have led to deadly confrontations and  reports of police violence .\n \n\n   \n  In East Africa, Kenya  witnessed protests  stemming from a contentious finance bill that raised taxes during a cost-of-living crisis. These grievances have morphed into calls for regime change, with numerous fatalities reported.\n \n\n   \n  Kingsley Moghalu, a former presidential candidate from Nigeria and a public policy expert, told CNN that these movements signify a growing consciousness among young people of their political power.\n \n\n   \n  Moghalu warns that “underperforming African leaders should be very wary.”\n \n\n   \n  Rajoelina’s removal might rejuvenate protest movements that have lost momentum across the continent, according to Swikani Ncube, a lecturer at the University of Johannesburg in South Africa.\n \n\n   \n  Mass protests in Kenya have not occurred since July. Similarly, a youth uprising in  Mozambique , following a disputed election last year, has been suppressed.\n \n\n   \n  “Where these (protests) had died down, the perceived successes of the youth in Madagascar may serve as a reference point for those who were either losing steam or simply second-guessing their intentions to embark on sustained protests,” Ncube told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    Resistance from African Leaders\n \n\n   \n  As youth protests grow stronger, African governments, particularly those that are military-led, are unlikely to surrender their positions without a fight. Even civilian-led administrations have proven survival skills.\n \n\n   \n  In Kenya, President William Ruto, facing increasing pressure to resign, dared his critics to oust him from office before the next elections in 2027.\n \n\n   \n  “I want to tell those characters giving us lectures that they can change this administration using violence and unlawful means before 2027, let them try,” he  said in July , in response to violent demonstrations.\n \n\n   \n  In neighboring Uganda, protests inspired by demonstrations in Kenya took place last year, organized by young people denouncing government corruption. During these protests, dozens of activists were arrested.\n \n\n   \n  President Yoweri Museveni, 81, has ruled Uganda with an iron fist for nearly four decades. He warned earlier that demonstrators were  “playing with fire.” \n \n\n   \n  Museveni plans to run for a seventh term in office next year, but he faces a potential challenge from  Bobi Wine , the country’s main opposition leader who is 43 years old. Wine has experienced multiple arrests by Ugandan security forces over the years.\n \n\n   \n  In Madagascar, Rajoelina has shown no signs of relinquishing power following his removal. Although he’s in exile, he hasn’t formally resigned and calls his ousting a coup.\n \n\n   \n    What’s wrong with governance in Africa?\n \n\n   \n  Africa is no stranger to coups or swift changes in government. Security remains a major challenge, with the Sahel – a region stretching from Senegal to Sudan – accounting for more than half  the terror-related deaths worldwide .\n \n\n   \n  More broadly, populations have been frustrated by their leaders’ inability to tackle corruption or deliver much-needed jobs and services.\n \n\n   \n  “The failure of governance in Africa is the most important challenge facing the continent, and it’s very deep-rooted,” said Moghalu.\n \n\n   \n  What makes the Gen Z movement so dangerous to African leaders is that the continent is home to some of the world’s poorest countries, and unemployment is rampant, particularly among young people who make up over half of the population.\n \n\n   \n  Although the demands of young people vary across the continent, Moghalu highlighted a common thread: “Their decision to vent their frustration (on issues plaguing the continent) and take action, rather than bottle it up.”\n \n\n   \n  If these challenges persist, youth-led uprisings are likely to become a regular occurrence in Africa, he warned.\n \n\n   \n  “The Gen Z are an impatient and assertive generation. And the rise of technology makes it easier for them to mobilize.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/weather/severe-storms-tornado-south-midwest-forecast-climate","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"02:30:00-04:30","title":"Severe thunderstorms with dangerous winds, isolated tornadoes threaten South and Midwest this weekend","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Severe thunderstorms with dangerous winds, isolated tornadoes, and heavy rain are threatening the South and Midwest this weekend, particularly in northeast Texas, eastern Oklahoma, northern Louisiana, and parts of Arkansas and the mid-Mississippi Valley.

CNN\n \n   \n  Thunderstorms erupting in the South and Midwest to kick off the weekend could turn severe and produce dangerous winds, a few tornadoes and heavy rain.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not been a particularly active fall so far, but the return of severe thunderstorms is a reminder this season, and occasionally  winter , can have a similar clash of the weather ingredients that generate spring’s powerful storms.\n \n\n   \n  Northeast Texas, eastern Oklahoma and northern Louisiana up   to Arkansas and parts of the lower and mid-Mississippi valleys have the greatest chance to see severe storms Saturday afternoon into the night.\n \n\n   \n  Strong winds capable of knocking out power and damaging or uprooting trees are the biggest threat, though there’s enough spin in the atmosphere to generate isolated tornadoes that can form quickly with little advance warning. Large hail, from quarter-size to possibly as large as golf balls, could also accompany a few of the storms.\n \n\n   \n  Little Rock, Arkansas; Memphis, Tennessee; Shreveport, Louisiana; and Paducah, Kentucky, are some of the cities where people should stay alert for severe weather warnings while tackling weekend plans.\n \n\n   \n  Heavy rain could also trigger flash flooding in spots, though much of the region is so dry, the downpours are needed.  Moderate to severe drought  covers a large chunk of the lower and mid-Mississippi valleys as well as the Ozarks of southern Missouri and northeast Arkansas.\n \n\n   \n    An unusually warm Gulf is fueling this threat\n \n\n   \n  Fall typically brings to mind cool, crisp air and blue skies, but the United States is seeing unusually warm air stream northward ahead of a cold front in the central part of the country. High temperatures Saturday are predicted to be anywhere from  10 to 20 degrees above average  from Texas to the Ohio Valley, with 80s as far north as Indiana and Ohio.\n \n\n   \n  Columbus, Ohio, could approach its daily record high of 83 degrees Saturday, while San Antonio, Texas, flirts with a daily record of 93 degrees.\n \n\n   \n  Storm systems become more energetic in the fall and winter as the jet stream — a narrow band of strong winds high in the atmosphere where commercial planes fly — strengthens and drops south into the US. Storms riding the jet stream can turn severe anytime southerly winds pull up warm, humid air from the Gulf. Gulf waters are unusually warm right now, adding an extra punch of moisture to this weekend’s setup.\n \n\n   \n  The South and, occasionally, lower parts of the Midwest like the Ohio and mid-Mississippi valleys tend to be the regions most affected by severe thunderstorms in fall and winter. In some cases, a major winter storm will dump heavy snow in northern areas, while the South contends with a springlike severe storm threat from the same system.\n \n\n   \n  And with the loss of daylight in those months, there is a greater chance the threat of dangerous storms carries into the evening and overnight hours. Nighttime tornadoes are nearly twice as likely to be deadly than daytime ones, a  2022 study  found.\n \n\n   \n  Colder weather is coming in the weeks and months ahead, but severe storms will no doubt make an appearance at times, so it’s important to stay vigilant and have a preparedness plan in place year-round.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/politics/gop-rhetoric-no-kings-protests-analysis","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"The GOP’s extraordinary rhetoric about the ‘No Kings’ rallies","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The GOP, led by figures like Donald Trump, Mike Johnson, Tom Emmer, and others, has escalated rhetoric claiming that the 'No Kings' rallies are filled with antifa, terrorists, and violent extremists.

(Trump’s own rallies often include people holding matching signs that were handed out, as  comedian Jimmy Kimmel noted .)\n \n\n   \n  And White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt issued perhaps the most extreme comments Thursday on Fox News.\n \n\n   \n  “The Democrat Party’s main constituency are made up of Hamas terrorists, illegal aliens, and violent criminals,” Leavitt said.\n \n\n   \n  The first thing to note is that the kinds of broad brushes being employed here are exactly the kinds of broad brushes Republicans have previously decried.\n \n\n   \n  They’ve spent years assailing Hillary Clinton for putting large numbers of Trump supporters in what she called a “basket of deplorables.” Even less than a year ago, they were seemingly apoplectic about President Joe Biden  arguably calling some Trump supporters “garbage.” \n \n\n   \n  Leavitt herself cast the latter episode as proof that Biden and Kamala Harris “despise the tens of millions of Americans who support” Trump.\n \n\n   \n  The comments also come even as Republicans after Charlie Kirk’s assassination sought to link the coarsening of our rhetoric – things like calling Trump a “fascist” – to political violence.\n \n\n   \n  Does that not also apply to calling wide swaths of the electorate terrorist sympathizers? The administration has now moved from decrying those broad brushes to embracing them.\n \n\n   \n  But even beyond that, it’s a weird strategy.\n \n\n   \n  These aren’t the first “No Kings” rallies, after all. They were also held across the country back in June, and they were overwhelmingly peaceful. The  scenes  were largely full of very normal-looking, liberal Americans speaking their minds.\n \n\n   \n  Fox News this week managed to find  five incidents of violence and/or arrests  from the June rallies – rallies which, again, drew millions.\n \n\n   \n  But two of them were actually  alleged attacks   against  the protesters , with people allegedly targeting them with motor vehicles. In another case in Florida,  2 of 3 people arrested were counter-protesters . A fourth example was a  deadly shooting by a “peacekeeper”  who apparently feared someone was about to carry out a mass shooting. (As of last month, it  wasn’t clear  that either the peacekeeper or the other man would even face charges.)\n \n\n   \n  Anything can happen on Saturday, but the scenes could also provide a rather rapid counterpoint to the alternate reality the GOP is attempting to paint.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic politicians like  California Gov. Gavin Newsom  and  many   others  this week have made a point to emphasize these comments reinforce the need to keep the proceedings peaceful. Some have warned those assembled not to give the administration any scenes that might give it pretexts for Trump’s militarization of the homeland.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona said Trump is “trying to incite violence as a justification just for more control.”\n \n\n   \n  If anything, the scenes in Portland, Oregon, in recent weeks suggest such messages are being received.\n \n\n   \n  Protesters there have taken to  wearing costumes and otherwise engaging in light-hearted forms of protest . Their efforts appear aimed at betraying the ridiculousness of Trump’s decision to send in the National Guard. A Trump-appointed judge has said the administration’s claims of violence in Portland – which Trump has labeled “war ravaged” – are “ untethered to the facts .”\n \n\n   \n  To this point, Trump’s argument that the left is unusually violent doesn’t appear to have penetrated American public opinion.\n \n\n   \n  A  Marquette University Law School poll  last month showed Americans are about evenly split on whether left-wing violence or right-wing violence was a bigger problem. And a  CBS News-YouGov poll  this month actually showed significantly more Americans called the Republican Party “extreme” (59%) as said the same about the Democratic Party (46%).\n \n\n   \n  The stakes here are huge. To the extent Trump can turn this into reality in Americans’ minds, it opens the door to all kinds of powers he craves. That’s not just when it comes to militarizing US soil, but also wielding heavy-handed tools to crack down on the political left, as he’s made clear he’d very much like to do.\n \n\n   \n  Saturday begins a new phase in this high-stakes moment for our country.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/sport/baseball-los-angeles-dodgers-nlcs","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"12:04:00Z","title":"Shohei Ohtani’s legendary night leads Los Angeles Dodgers to another World Series, sweeping Milwaukee in 4 games","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Shohei Ohtani delivered a historic performance in Game 4 of the National League Championship Series, leading the Los Angeles Dodgers to a four-game sweep of the Milwaukee Brewers.

\nUpdated: \n        12:04 AM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  It’s once again Sho-time in the World Series.\n \n\n   \n  The Los Angeles Dodgers will have a chance to defend their World Series title in this year’s Fall Classic after a Game 4 win over the Milwaukee Brewers, clinching a four-game sweep in the National League Championship Series. The Dodgers were led by their otherworldly star, Shohei Ohtani, who hit three home runs, struck out 10 batters and got the win for the Dodgers.\n \n\n   \n  It was one of the greatest individual performances in the history of the game, let alone on a stage of this magnitude. Ohtani, the Japanese two-way star who has been breaking boundaries since he joined the league, looked sterling in a six-inning, shutout performance.\n \n\n   \n  And then when he walked to the plate to do something no other player does in Major League Baseball these days – hitting while being a starting pitcher – Ohtani helped himself out. He hit home runs in the first, fourth and seventh innings, with the last one sending his teammates into hysterics.\n \n\n   \n  According to MLB statistician Sarah Langs, Ohtani became the first player in league history to hit three home runs and strike out at least one batter, let alone 10. Per the TNT Sports broadcast, Ohtani became the first starting pitcher since 1900 to hit a leadoff home run in the regular season or the playoffs, and the first starting pitcher since 1900 to hit multiple home runs in a postseason game.\n \n\n   \n  All of those incredible superlatives come with one other amazing fact, given that starting pitchers usually thrive on a regular five-day schedule for starts: It was the first time Ohtani had pitched in 13 days.\n \n\n   \n  He was, quite obviously, named the NLCS MVP for his performance.\n \n\n   \n  “It was really fun on both sides of ball today,” Ohtani said via his translator while holding the NLCS MVP trophy. “As a representative, I am taking this trophy and let’s get four more wins.”\n \n\n   \n  Far from the home runs that baseball fans are used to seeing from pitchers, Ohtani’s blasts were absolutely majestic. He led off the game for the Dodgers with a 427-foot blast, hit a gigantic 469-foot homer in the fourth and topped it off with another mega 446-foot blast in the seventh.\n \n\n   \n  “We won it as a team and this is really a team effort so I hope everybody in LA and Japan and all over the world can enjoy a really good sake,” Ohtani added.\n \n\n   \n  It’s the fifth time in the last nine seasons that the Dodgers have won the National League pennant, the 26th trip to the World Series in their history.\n \n\n   \n  “Oh my God. I’m still speechless,” Dodger first baseman Freddie Freeman said of his teammate’s performance in an interview with the TNT broadcast after the game.\n \n\n   \n  “Sometimes you have to check him and make sure he’s not made of steel when he does something like that. Absolutely incredible. The biggest stage and he goes and does something like that. It’ll probably be remembered as the Shohei Ohtani Game.”\n \n\n   \n  Ohtani’s game drew the admiration from another Dodgers star, Clayton Kershaw.\n \n\n   \n  “We all know about Shohei but until you play with him and you see him, it’s just a different level,” said Kershaw, the team’s future hall of famer who is coming out of the bullpen in the playoffs.\n \n\n   \n  With the Seattle Mariners taking a 3-2 lead in the American League Championship Series over the Toronto Blue Jays earlier in the night, the Dodgers will have to wait to find out who their opponent will be in the Fall Classic.\n \n\n   \n  But whoever the American League champion is will be facing a buzzsaw.\n \n\n   \n  The Dodgers have lost just one game in this postseason and their pitching hasn’t allowed more than one run per game since a loss to the Philadelphia Phillies in the National League Divisional Series more than a week ago. Starters Blake Snell, Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Tyler Glasnow and Ohtani make up one of the most formidable playoff rotations in recent memory and their lineup with Ohtani at the top followed by stars like Mookie Betts, Freeman, Teoscar Hernandez and a slew of others.\n \n\n   \n  “Before this season started, they said the Dodgers are ruining baseball,” manager Dave Roberts said to an applauding crowd on hand at Dodger Stadium. “Let’s get four more wins and really ruin baseball.”\n \n\n   \n  No team has repeated as World Series champions since the New York Yankees dynasty of the last 1990s and early 2000s won three straight titles between 1998 and 2000. The Dodgers are the first team to even make it back to the World Series the year after winning it since the Phillies did it in the late 2000s.\n \n\n   \n  Kershaw is one of the few players still in the league who was playing when the Phillies made that run. He’s on his last go-round now, retiring after the season and is relishing the opportunity to make history.\n \n\n   \n  “Just to be a part of this team … I’m so happy to be a part of it. This group of guys is awesome, we have a blast and we’re playing so good. It’s just awesome. Whether I get to pitch or not, I’m just glad I get to be a part of it. It’s so fun.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/us/alaska-storm-damage-evacuees-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"11:27:00-04:00","title":"Alaska storm damage so bad many evacuees won’t go home for at least 18 months, governor says","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"After a powerful storm fueled by the remnants of Typhoon Halong, remote Alaska villages such as Kipnuk and Kwigillingok suffered catastrophic flooding and wind damage, with over 90% of homes destroyed in Kipnuk and nearly one-third uninhabitable in Kwigillingok.

Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  Damage to remote Alaska villages hammered by flooding  last weekend  is so extreme that many of the more than 2,000 people displaced won’t be able to return to their homes for at least 18 months, Gov. Mike Dunleavy said in a request to the White House for a major disaster declaration.\n \n\n   \n  In one of the hardest hit villages, Kipnuk, an initial assessment showed that 121 homes — or 90% of the total — have been destroyed, Dunleavy wrote. In Kwigillingok, where three dozen homes floated away, slightly more than one-third of the residences are uninhabitable.\n \n\n   \n  The remnants of Typhoon Halong struck the area with the ferocity of a Category 2 hurricane, Dunleavy said, sending a surge of high surf into the low-lying region. One person was killed, two remain missing, and rescue crews plucked dozens of people from their homes as they floated away.\n \n\n   \n  Officials have been scrambling to  airlift people  from the inundated Alaska Native villages. More than 2,000 people across the region have taken shelter — in schools in their villages, in larger communities in southwest Alaska or have been evacuated by military planes to Anchorage, the state’s largest city.\n \n\n   \n  Anchorage leaders said Friday they expect as many as 1,600 evacuees to arrive. So far about 575 have been airlifted to the city by the Alaska National Guard, and have been staying at a sports arena or a convention center. Additional flights were expected Friday and Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  Officials are working on figuring out how to move people out of shelters and into short-term accommodations, such as hotels, and then longer-term housing.\n \n\n   \n  “Due to the time, space, distance, geography, and weather in the affected areas, it is likely that many survivors will be unable to return to their communities this winter,” Dunleavy said. “Agencies are prioritizing rapid repairs … but it is likely that some damaged communities will not be viable to support winter occupancy, in America’s harshest climate in the U.S. Arctic.”\n \n\n   \n  The federal government already has been assisting with search and rescue, damage assessments, environmental response and evacuation support. A major disaster declaration by President Donald Trump could provide federal assistance programs for individuals and public infrastructure, including money for emergency and permanent work.\n \n\n   \n  The three members of Alaska’s congressional delegation on Friday sent a letter to Trump, urging swift approval.\n \n\n   \n  The storm surge pummeled a sparsely populated region off the state’s main road system where communities are reachable only by air or water this time of year. The villages typically have just a few hundred residents, who hunt and fish for much of their food, and relocating to the state’s major cities will bring a vastly different lifestyle.\n \n\n   \n  Alexie Stone, of Kipnuk, arrived in Anchorage in a military jet with his brothers, children and mom, after his home was struck by the flooding. They’ve been staying at the Alaska Airlines Center at the University of Alaska, where the Red Cross provided evacuees with cots, blankets and hygiene supplies.\n \n\n   \n  At least for the foreseeable future, he thinks he might try to find a job at a grocery store; he used to work in one in Bethel.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s going to be, try to look for a place and find a job,” Stone said Friday. “We’re starting a new life here in Anchorage.”\n \n\n   \n  Anchorage officials and business leaders said Friday they were eager to help the evacuees.\n \n\n   \n  “Our neighbors in western Alaska have experienced tremendous loss, devastation and grief,” Mayor Suzanne LaFrance said at a meeting of the Anchorage Assembly. “We will do everything we can here in Anchorage to welcome our neighbors and help them through these difficult times.”\n \n\n   \n  State Rep. Nellie Unangiq Jimmie, of Toksook Bay, on an island northwest of Kipnuk, described for the assembly how she rode out the storm’s 100 mph (161 kmh) winds with her daughter and niece.\n \n\n   \n  “We had no choice but to sit in our home and wait to see if our house is going to come off the foundation or if debris is going to bust open our windows,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  It didn’t, but others weren’t as fortunate. She thanked Anchorage for welcoming the evacuees.\n \n\n   \n  “You are showing my people, my relatives, my constituents, even if they are far from home, this is still Alaska land and they’re amongst families,” Jimmie said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/europe/us-ukraine-russia-tomahawk-analysis-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"11:13:00-10:17","title":"Trump meeting brings good news for Zelensky, but Kyiv’s real prize remains out of reach – for now","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article analyzes the evolving diplomatic relationship between US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, highlighting a notable shift in tone and strategy.

\n        11:13 PM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The relationship between US President Donald Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky has unquestionably improved but the real prize Kyiv seeks seems out of its reach, for now.\n \n\n   \n  After nine months of extraordinary diplomatic acrobatics and verbiage, Trump still prefers to give Russian President Vladimir Putin yet another chance to talk him around, over blunt military escalation.\n \n\n   \n  But there were – among the fawning compliments and the conviction an elusive peace was near – bits of good news for Ukraine. Even Trump’s final word on the matter, a Truth Social post delivered as he left for Mar-a-Lago, suggested “They should stop where they are” – a ceasefire along current battle lines, suggesting something Kyiv could very much tolerate.\n \n\n   \n  “We have to stop where we are. This is important, to stop where we are, and then to speak,” Zelensky told CNN during a news conference after the meeting.\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, the day could have gone a lot worse for Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  First, Trump extolled the deadly virtues of the Tomahawks, the supply of which he said his meeting with Zelensky was all about. “That is why we are here,” he said. “Tomahawks are very dangerous… It could mean escalation – a lot of bad things could happen.” This is a threat unimaginable when Trump first came to power: the president contentedly signaling he might give the cream of his arsenal to Zelensky so Ukraine can strike deep into Russia.\n \n\n   \n  Yet at the same time, Trump undermined his own threat, by immediately making the nature of the deal before Putin clear. “Hopefully we will be able to get this war over with without thinking about Tomahawks,” Trump added. “I think we are pretty close to that.”\n \n\n   \n  The truth is, Trump is likely still far from the deal he called “Number 9,” a reference to the number of peace agreements around the world he claims to have had a hand in. But his new approach – of threatening real military escalation, through US technology purchased by European allies and then supplied to Ukraine – might, over time, bring closer the deal he still says Putin wants.\n \n\n   \n  The threat is as psychological as it is military. The US lacks the inventory to provide the “thousands” of Tomahawks Trump said he joked with Putin on Thursday he might give Ukraine. The missiles are normally sea-launched, and so at best Ukraine would have to wait months to receive a few dozen that it would have to adapt to launch on land.\n \n\n   \n  They are remarkably expensive. Their range is not much greater than the drones Ukraine currently fires nightly deep into Russia. If it used them, Kyiv would have to hit targets worth the Tomahawk’s $2 million price tag – which means hitting serious military or government infrastructure, something Trump might veto. Trump and Zelensky appeared to have agreed to leave their arrangements ambiguous: Zelensky declined to offer any details on their Tomahawk conversation, saying the US did not want escalation. Asked if he was optimistic or pessimistic on the missiles, he replied he was “realistic.”\n \n\n   \n  Secondly, Trump is now unafraid to admit Putin might be playing him – an important, if overdue, epiphany. He added: “I have been played all my life by the best of them, and I came out really well.”\n \n\n   \n  The Budapest summit with Putin still lacks a concrete date, and appears another moment in which the Kremlin may seek to buy yet more time. But Putin will meet a US president perhaps wiser to his own flaws in dealing with the Kremlin head, and what is required to get Moscow’s attention. Trump has now heeded the advice of European allies: Putin most clearly responds to force.\n \n\n   \n  Whether Trump ever makes good on this threat arguably matters less in the changing dynamics of the conflict itself. Zelensky sat before Trump in a position few observers imagined possible in the spring.\n \n\n   \n  As Putin’s much-vaunted summer offensive rattles on into fall, it has singularly failed to capture any eastern town of importance. That may change in the scant remaining weeks ahead of winter in November. But the intense grind, loss and cost of the summer months has still left Pokrovsk, Kupiansk and Kostyantynivka in Ukrainian hands. Kyiv’s grip is precarious, and the Russian advances across open land and through tiny villages leave Ukraine poorly placed for winter. But Kyiv’s key positions, remarkably, for the most part, held.\n \n\n   \n  Given the crises of manpower, resources and morale looming over Ukraine in May, this is startling, and potentially flips the dynamics of the months ahead. Putin has again played his military cards, and not (yet) achieved his goals. In weeks, winter will strip the foliage bare and make it harder for Russian infantry to advance, concealed under the leaves against the threat of Kyiv’s drones.\n \n\n   \n  Ukraine has again defied expectations, partly due to grit and sacrifice, but also because, as Trump conceded: “They make a very good drone.” These new dynamics may yet change.\n \n\n   \n  But, for the Kremlin, pressure for results is edging towards an uncomfortable need to explain recent failures.\n \n\n   \n  Can Putin afford to fight all winter, through spring, into the fourth summer, to again aim for increasingly minimalist objectives? Gas shortages from Ukrainian strikes on oil refineries, rising inflation, vacillating sign-up payments for new military recruits, and Moscow’s consistent failure to make a real breakthrough, suggest he can’t.\n \n\n   \n  Zelensky has survived a spring and summer in which Ukraine’s main ally turned on him and tried – without Kyiv - to strike a peace deal with its enemy. Ukraine has seen Europe step financially and militarily into the void left by America, and then seen the same recalcitrant White House offer them its best missiles.\n \n\n   \n  Zelensky used to be the global salesman of the case to support Ukraine’s defense and let it become a NATO member. Now he travels around NATO members, pitching to them up-to-date, fast-evolving Ukrainian drone technology.\n \n\n   \n  Recent changes are less comforting for Putin. Yes, China still has his back, but India is surely paying a price from the US secondary sanctions imposed over its purchases of Russian oil. (Trump suggested India had decided to stop buying Russian oil on Friday, which  much reporting  suggests isn’t the case).\n \n\n   \n  Russia’s plan, and support base, depends upon a military win. Putin has yet to achieve that. He may do – remarkably – in the weeks ahead, given late October’s propensity to bring sweeping battlefield change in this war.\n \n\n   \n  But whatever the capability of Russia’s closed, autocratic society to suppress dissent, one question is becoming loudest for Putin: “What is your next move?”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/china/china-communist-party-expels-military-leaders-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"20:32:00-04:00","title":"China expels two top generals from Communist Party in anti-corruption crackdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"China’s defense ministry announced the expulsion from the Communist Party and the People’s Liberation Army of two top military officials—He Weidong, the number two general and former Politburo member, and navy admiral Miao Hua, the former top political officer—on corruption charges.

Ines Capdevila, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:00 AM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As President  Donald Trump  weighs military action inside Venezuela, building up forces in the Caribbean and  flying B-52 bombers  off the country’s coast this week,  Nicolás Maduro  is responding in kind, repositioning troops, mobilizing “millions” of militia and denouncing US activity in the region – a sign of defiance from the strongman as the two leaders are locked in a standoff.\n \n\n   \n  Trump administration officials have privately acknowledged that the  intensifying US pressure campaign  is aimed at ousting Maduro, a goal that was also a target of Trump’s first term in office when the White House recognized Venezuelan  opposition leader Juan Guaidó  as the legitimate president of the country in 2019. But as the Trump team ratchets up the pressure this fall, Maduro has in turn ramped up the rhetoric and propaganda for Venezuelans while calling for new military exercises by the Bolivarian National Armed Forces, which has some 123,000 members.\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks, the US military has  moved warships  and other weaponry into the region and has  targeted boats  off the Venezuelan coast it says are transporting drugs. Then on Wednesday, Trump acknowledged that he’d  authorized the CIA  to conduct covert action in Venezuela and said the United States was considering strikes on Venezuelan territory.\n \n\n   \n  “We are certainly looking at land now, because we’ve got the sea very well under control,” the president told reporters Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Maduro has claimed that his volunteer militias now have more than 8 million reservists, though experts have called into question that number as well as the quality of the troops’ training. As of October 17, 20 out of 23 Venezuelan states have been militarized as part of the Maduro’s military mobilizations, called Independence 200.\n \n\n   \n  On his Truth Social account last month, Trump mocked a video of women, some who appeared to be overweight, running with guns during a purported training for the Venezuelan militia.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has been quietly laying the groundwork for potential military action inside Venezuela for months by tying Maduro to drug traffickers and cartels that officials have designated as terror groups who pose an imminent threat to the US. But to date, there is no indication that Trump has decided to take that step or target the Venezuelan leader directly.\n \n\n   \n  Instead, the goal has been to pressure Maduro to step down on his own, sources told CNN, in part by establishing a credible threat of US military action if he does not. The recent strikes against alleged drug boats in the Caribbean are a clear message to Maduro, the sources said, noting the administration has been very intentional about linking the Venezuelan leader to trafficking groups and cartels.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said Wednesday that he authorized the CIA to operate inside Venezuela to clamp down on the flows of migrants and drugs from the South American nation, but stopped short of saying they would be attempting to remove Maduro. The remarks are Trump’s most expansive comments on his decision to expand the CIA’s authority to conduct lethal targeting and carry out covert action in the region, which  CNN first reported  last week.\n \n\n   \n  In a televised speech Wednesday, Maduro denounced what he described as the CIA’s record of regime change and coups d’état around the world.\n \n\n   \n  “But our people are clear, united, and aware. They have the means to once again defeat this open conspiracy against the peace and stability of Venezuela,” he said on state television.\n \n\n   \n    ‘We don’t sleep well’\n \n\n   \n  In Venezuela, daily life has continued despite the looming possibility of armed conflict with the United States. Near downtown Caracas, at the Teresa Carreño Theater, a sold-out musical premiered just days after a well-known salsa party brought together more than 1,000 people in the west of the city.\n \n\n   \n  But Venezuelans are increasingly discussing the US warships in the Caribbean Sea and the fear of a possible US attack. “Venezuelans live in anxiety thinking about what might happen,” said Ivonne Caña.\n \n\n   \n  Caña, who is a cook, said she lives in uncertainty and, worried about her family, has been buying a little more food than usual to stock up at home. The fear, she said, is felt most at night: “We don’t sleep well.”\n \n\n   \n  Some Venezuelans are cautiously showing their support for the US pressure on Maduro. In recent days, banners bearing messages such as “It’s happening… freedom loading 95%” have been displayed on at least 10 university campuses across the country — a form of peaceful protest in spaces where political issues are seldom addressed due to fear of government reprisal.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Maduro has further cracked down on civil liberties in Venezuela. At the end of September, the government announced that the president had signed a decree of “external commotion,” which he described as “a constitutional defense tool in case the country faces a military aggression.”\n \n\n   \n  The state of emergency decree would allow Maduro to restrict constitutional guarantees and, according to analysts, would grant him broad political, social and economic powers.\n \n\n   \n  As Maduro has accused the US administration of trying to steal the country’s oil wealth, the nearby American military presence has drawn closer. Three US Air Force B-52 bombers flew off the coast of Venezuela for more than four hours on Wednesday, according to open-source flight data reviewed by CNN. The bombers took off from Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana before dawn.\n \n\n   \n  Two of them kept their location beacons activated inside Venezuela’s flight information region (FIR), at one point coming within 53 miles of La Orchila Island, where Maduro’s forces carried out drills last month.\n \n\n   \n  At their closest point, the planes flew 132 miles from the Venezuelan mainland, at around 11:20 a.m. local time. The bombers remained in a part of Venezuela’s flight information region that is international airspace but controlled by the country’s aviation authority. Venezuela’s FIR extends far beyond the country’s airspace.\n \n\n   \n  Multiple sources told CNN that the recent US military strikes on drug boats are just the beginning of a larger effort to rid the region of narcotics trafficking and potentially dislodge Maduro from power. The military has carried out at least six  strikes to date  on six separate boats in the Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n    The Trump administration’s war on drugs\n \n\n   \n  The argument that drug traffickers pose an imminent threat to Americans is at the core of the Trump administration’s classified legal justification for carrying out military strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean — and potentially beyond.\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department opinion also includes a secret and expansive list of groups the Trump administration argues can now be treated as enemy combatants, rather than criminals, and thus summarily killed without due process at the president’s direction.\n \n\n   \n  The opinion is significant, legal experts said, because it appears to  justify an open-ended war against a secret list of groups  and potentially offers a pretext for unilateral US military action against a broad array of targets in the region.\n \n\n   \n  At the Pentagon, some military lawyers, including international law experts within DoD’s Office of General Counsel, have raised concerns about the legality of the lethal strikes on suspected drug traffickers, sources familiar with the matter said.\n \n\n   \n  But multiple Pentagon lawyers previously told CNN that internal dissent is unlikely to dissuade the Trump administration from continuing its military campaign in the region.\n \n\n   \n  The latest indication of internal concerns over these strikes emerged on Thursday when the admiral overseeing US Southern Command, which has responsibility for forces in the Caribbean,  announced he is retiring  just one year into his tenure.\n \n\n   \n  Tensions had been simmering between Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Adm. Alvin Holsey for weeks before the admiral announced he was leaving, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth did not believe Holsey was moving quickly or aggressively enough to combat drug traffickers in the Caribbean, and he complained about not being given the information he needed about the operations, the sources said. But SOUTHCOM was concerned about the operations not being lawful, the sources added.\n \n\n   \n  Then, on Friday, the US military detained two survivors of its sixth known strike of alleged drug boats in the Caribbean. This is the first time an American strike has not immediately killed everyone on board, and the two survivors, CNN has reported, are  currently detained on a US Navy vessel , raising a host of new legal questions to an already murky picture.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/politics/lindsey-halligan-ousts-more-prosecutors-eastern-district-virginia","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"20:53:00-04:00","title":"Lindsey Halligan fires more prosecutors in key US attorney’s office","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Lindsey Halligan, a Trump-appointed interim U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, has fired senior prosecutors Beth Yusi and Kristin Bird, accusing them of leaking information to the press.

17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US military is holding two survivors on a Navy ship after the US carried out a Thursday strike on  an alleged drug boat  in the Caribbean, according to three US officials.\n \n\n   \n  The strike, which President Donald Trump confirmed Friday, was the sixth known strike on a boat allegedly involved in drug trafficking. But it appeared to mark the first time an attack had not killed everyone on board.\n \n\n   \n  The detention marks the first time that the Trump administration’s military campaign targeting drug traffickers has resulted in the US holding prisoners, and it sets up a complicated legal and policy situation for the administration. It is unclear what the US is going to do with the survivors being held, the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  The US has deployed  scores of military assets  to the Caribbean as it continues to promise further strikes on alleged drug boats, part of the administration’s effort to drive down drug flow into the US and pressure Nicolás Maduro, Venezuela’s authoritarian president.\n \n\n   \n  Asked about what happened to the survivors of the strike during an event at the White House Friday, Trump did not address the status of the detainees but said that US forces had “attacked a submarine, and that was a drug carrying submarine built specifically for the transportation of massive amounts of drugs.”\n \n\n   \n  “Just so you understand this was not an innocent group of people,” he said. “I don’t know too many people that have submarines, and that was an attack on a drug carrying loaded up submarine.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump, who confirmed earlier in the week that he’d  authorized the CIA to conduct covert action  in Venezuela, also had harsh language for Maduro on Friday: “He doesn’t want to fuck around with the US.”\n \n\n   \n  The threat came when Trump was asked about reports that Maduro offered preferential access to the nation’s natural resources in exchange for lowering the temperature after the US conducted the series of Caribbean strikes.\n \n\n   \n  US Southern Command, which is responsible for military operations in the region, referred CNN to the White House for comment when asked about Thursday’s strike and the survivors.\n \n\n   \n    Legality of strikes in question\n \n\n   \n  The legality of the Trump administration’s operations in the Caribbean has been widely questioned. Secretary of State Marco Rubio – who has been both a driver and an architect of the policy – has argued that the US has the right to “wage war” against narco-terrorists. Earlier in the year, the administration designated multiple drug cartels and gangs operating in Latin America as foreign terrorist organizations.\n \n\n   \n  The administration has also produced a  classified legal opinion  that justifies lethal strikes against a secret and expansive list of cartels and suspected drug traffickers, CNN has reported. Historically, however, those involved in drug trafficking were considered criminals with due process rights, with the Coast Guard interdicting drug-trafficking vessels and arresting smugglers.\n \n\n   \n  The detaining of the alleged drug traffickers who were not killed in the strike this week sets up another legal dilemma for the administration. It’s unclear under what legal authority the US military can hold the men, said Brian Finucane, a former State Department lawyer who specializes in war powers issues.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has argued that the president has broad authorities under Article II of the Constitution to conduct the strikes against what it claims are “narco-terrorists,” but lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have questioned that theory. Congress, which maintains broad authority under Article I of the Constitution to declare war, has not authorized an armed conflict against drug traffickers.\n \n\n   \n  The Bush administration advanced the theory that it could rely solely on Article II for its military detention authorities, Finucane said — but the Supreme Court never ruled on the matter, leaving the question of its lawfulness unresolved. The Bush administration was ultimately able to rely on a 2001 congressional authorization that deemed the United States to be at war with al Qaeda and its affiliates to hold military detainees.\n \n\n   \n  The men held by the US Navy could hypothetically petition the courts to rule on the legality of their detention in what’s known as a habeas corpus claim, Finucane noted — a pathway followed by a number of detainees in the past that could reveal more information about the Trump administration’s secretive legal rationale for the strikes.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Haley Britzky contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/politics/trump-momentum-gaza-ukraine-russia","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"19:58:00Z","title":"Trump seeks to build on momentum from Gaza deal in a busy diplomatic week","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump is capitalizing on the momentum from a fragile ceasefire agreement in Gaza, where he brokered the release of hostages and a halt to hostilities, to pursue broader diplomatic initiatives.

\n        7:58 PM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  These are busy days for  Steve Witkoff. \n \n\n   \n  The real estate developer-turned-Swiss Army Knife diplomat (officially the special presidential envoy for peace missions) was sitting in the galleries of the Israeli Knesset on Monday, listening as President Donald Trump basked in the newly brokered ceasefire-for-hostages deal, when his boss reminded him of another assignment.\n \n\n   \n  “We have to get Russia done. We got to get that one done,” Trump said while musing about a new Iran nuclear deal. “If you don’t mind, Steve, let’s focus on Russia first.”\n \n\n   \n  Energized by success in the Middle East, Trump is eager to harness that most elusive ingredient in politics and diplomacy: momentum. A week that began with a 36-hour trip to the Middle East ended with Ukraine’s president in the White House, trying to convince Trump to approve  new long-range missiles  before a surprise meeting soon with  Vladimir Putin in Budapest .\n \n\n   \n  In between, Trump confirmed he’d  authorized the CIA  to operate covertly in Venezuela while threatening to strike inside the country. He threw his endorsement — and a  $20 billion lifeline  from the US Treasury — behind Argentina’s likeminded leader. And he zigzagged through  new China tariff threats  ahead of a high-stakes meeting with President Xi Jinping in a few weeks.\n \n\n   \n  “I think we carry a lot of momentum, a lot of credibility. Getting Middle East done was very important,” Trump said Friday over lunch with his Ukrainian counterpart in the Cabinet Room. “Nobody thought it could be done. That was one nobody thought could be done, and we got it done.”\n \n\n   \n  “We had to set the table properly,” he added later. “This should be one that we get done, and I think the table is set properly here now, too, and it’ll be a great honor to get it done.”\n \n\n   \n  Translating his ability to quell the Mideast war into successes elsewhere will be a tall order for the president. And there have already been stumbling blocks in the delicate truce with Hamas, including the militant group’s inability this week to produce the remains of  more than a dozen deceased hostages  and subsequent outrage in Israel.\n \n\n   \n  The leverage Trump successfully employed on Israel to stop the war doesn’t exist with Russia and China, both nuclear powers who aren’t dependent on the United States for military or financial support. Many senior US and European officials said this week they doubted Trump’s success in the Middle East would lead to any immediate shift in strategy by Moscow or Beijing. And Trump faces political peril with his interventions in Latin America, where US troops and dollars have a mixed history of either propping up or taking down regimes.\n \n\n   \n    A fragile victory\n \n\n   \n  Still, Trump’s experience with Gaza was a reminder that long stretches of arduous, often fruitless effort can eventually result in a victory, however fragile. As the US diplomat George Mitchell liked to say after brokering the Good Friday agreement to end sectarian violence in Northern Ireland, “We had 700 days of failure and one day of success.”\n \n\n   \n  That quote was batted around frequently by aides to President Joe Biden last year as they worked to achieve what Trump eventually did: an agreement to release all the remaining hostages in Gaza while stopping the two-year war. A week after Trump declared the deal done, it appeared to be holding, despite accusations from Israel that Hamas was not maintaining its pledge to return all the hostage bodies.\n \n\n   \n  American officials were quick to explain it would have been nearly impossible for Hamas to quickly locate and extract the bodies from the piles of rubble and debris left behind from the war. One US adviser pointed out the Palestinian enclave lacks any heavy equipment, like bulldozers, to clear out the wreckage. And they emphasized the unquestionable diplomatic success of getting 20 living hostages released.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the understanding we had with them was we get all the live hostage hostages out, which they did honor that,” one US adviser said.\n \n\n   \n  The task of preventing the deal from falling apart has fallen mainly to Witkoff and  Jared Kushner , Trump’s son-in-law, each of whom helped convince Israel and Hamas, via its Arab interlocutors, to agree. In conversations with Israeli officials, they have tried to emphasize the ways in which they are working to locate all the bodies, including calling in teams from Turkey with experience in earthquake recovery efforts.\n \n\n   \n  After returning in the middle of the night from the region this week, the president himself spoke again on Thursday with Netanyahu about the issue of the hostages’ remains.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to find out if they behave,” he said afterward, referring to Hamas. “If they don’t behave, we’ll take care of it.”\n \n\n   \n  Few believe the issue could derail the deal entirely, and American advisers were pushing ahead with the next phase of the arrangement: establishing a multinational security force and taking steps toward rebuilding Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  But the issue underscored the fragility of a deal that was pushed through by Trump before many of the details were finalized. Ultimately,  far stickier questions remain , including getting Hamas to disarm, deciding who will govern Gaza and, most crucially, whether the process results in a Palestinian state.\n \n\n   \n    Carrots and sticks\n \n\n   \n  As he turns quickly to Ukraine, Trump may be drawing some lessons from his Middle East negotiations, including the virtues of working rapidly even as major details remain outstanding. This week he agreed to meet soon with Putin in Hungary in another attempt at face-to-face diplomacy, even as the parameters of a peace deal remain entirely unclear.\n \n\n   \n  Some European officials speaking privately this week said if Trump hopes to strike a similar deal to end the Ukraine war, it will require a degree of pressure on Putin — be it new sanctions or supplying new arms to Ukraine — that he so far seems unwilling to exert. Without sticks, Trump may seek to find carrots to lure Putin into a peace deal, although those, too, will be limited compared to what incentives existed with Israel.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, in his dealings with Netanyahu, appeared highly attuned to the Israeli prime minister’s political concerns, be it the demands from his far-right coalition partners or his ongoing corruption trial on long-standing bribery and fraud charges. In a remarkable moment during his speech to the Knesset, Trump called for Israel’s president to grant Netanyahu a pardon, brushing aside the accusations the Israeli leader received lavish gifts in exchange for favors.\n \n\n   \n  “Cigars and champagne, who the hell cares about that?” Trump scoffed.\n \n\n   \n  Finding a political lever to pull with Putin will be more difficult. The Russian president rules as an authoritarian, without the political chores required to keep together fragile coalitions or avoiding legal mires (at least in his own country; he’s wanted by the International Criminal Court on charges of trafficking Ukrainian children).\n \n\n   \n  That leaves Trump with fewer options to bring Putin to the negotiating table. For much of the last week, Trump seemed to be warming to the idea of sending Ukraine new long-range Tomahawk missiles, whose 1,000-mile range would put Moscow well within striking distance.\n \n\n   \n  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky set off for Washington this week hopeful Trump was serious about providing the weapons, which he believes are necessary for turning around the battlefield momentum. He even arranged meetings with representatives from Raytheon, the US manufacturer of the Tomahawks, to discuss his weaponry needs.\n \n\n   \n  But over the course of his working lunch with Trump, it became evident the Tomahawks would not soon be on their way to Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  “Hopefully they won’t need it,” Trump said. “Hopefully we’ll be able to get the war over without thinking about Tomahawks.”\n \n\n   \n  The conversation between the two leaders, alongside their top aides, continued behind closed doors on Friday afternoon in what was described to CNN by several people familiar as a tense, frank and, at times, “uncomfortable” discussion.\n \n\n   \n  Trump made clear to Zelensky in a “direct and honest” conversation that — for now — the Ukrainian leader would not receive the long-range missiles. One official said Trump was under the impression that Ukraine is seeking to escalate and prolong the conflict and is worried about potential losses during an upcoming harsh winter.\n \n\n   \n  Zelensky said afterward he’d agreed with Trump not to discuss the Tomahawks in public. And Trump, as he was flying to Palm Beach for the weekend, wrote on social media that Russia and Ukraine should end the war “where they are,” tacking back to his position from the summer that land concessions were necessary after claiming in September that Ukraine might be able to regain its lost territories.\n \n\n   \n  Trump told those around him that was due to the “realities of where the conflict stands,” arguing there was too much devastation and too much killing, according to one official.\n \n\n   \n  It was the latest example of Trump inching closer to allowing new capabilities or applying new sanctions on Moscow, only to back away when Putin intervenes to head it off. In this case, it was a phone call initiated by the Kremlin a day before Zelensky arrived, meant ostensibly to congratulate Trump on his Middle East victory but which resulted in arranging another in-person meeting.\n \n\n   \n    Meetings with Putin and Xi on horizon\n \n\n   \n  If the Budapest summit materializes — Trump said he hoped it would happen in the next two weeks — it would mean back-to-back meetings with two of his top global adversaries who have, in recent years, deepened their alliance. Trump’s face-to-face summit with Xi, scheduled for the end of the month in South Korea, is intended to clarify trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies.\n \n\n   \n  The war in Ukraine, which Beijing has helped sustain through military supplies and purchases of Russian oil, could be another point of contention. But Trump appeared confident he’d have the whole thing resolved before they sit down.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ll be discussing that, but I’d love to see it ended before that,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s assessments Friday that Putin “wants to end the war” were reminiscent of his confidence ahead of his August meeting with the Russian leader in Alaska, when he seemed sure the talks would result in quick progress toward a peace deal.\n \n\n   \n  They did not, and before Thursday there seemed to be little evidence that Putin was interested in moving ahead with US-brokered negotiations. Trump said he believed threat of Tomahawks could have helped bring him back to the table.\n \n\n   \n  So, too, do American officials believe that a successful negotiation in the Middle East has led Russia to rethink how it is approaching Trump and his desire to see the Ukraine war ended.\n \n\n   \n  But even Trump seemed to allow for the possibility that he could be wrong, and that Putin — as he’s feared in the past — may just be stringing him along.\n \n\n   \n  “I am,” he said when asked whether he’s concerned Putin might be playing for time. “But, you know, I’ve been played all my life by the best of them, and I came out really well.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/us/chicago-immigration-crackdown","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"20:12:00-05:00","title":"Frenzy of developments cement Chicago as epicenter of immigration crackdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Chicago has emerged as the epicenter of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, driven by Operation Midway Blitz, which resulted in over 1,000 arrests in Illinois between September 8 and October 3.

epicenter of immigration crackdown \n       \n  By Cindy Von Quednow, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:12 PM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As attorneys face off in courtrooms and federal agents on the ground clash with protesters,  Chicago  is being cemented as the epicenter of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown after a flurry of developments in the last 24 hours.\n \n\n   \n  Now – with the city heading into its first weekend since a fence outside the Broadview immigration enforcement facility has come down, and with the director of   Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s   Chicago field office ordered to appear in court Monday – the stage is set for a reckoning on crowd-control measures.\n \n\n   \n  Several developments on Thursday put the Windy City under the national spotlight, including a federal appeals court upholding a lower court’s ruling temporarily denying the federal government’s effort to deploy National Guard troops in Illinois and a judge separately  demanding answers  on violent encounters with protesters in Chicago.\n \n\n   \n  Tensions have flared as  federal agents were deployed  across the city in recent weeks for what the Trump administration calls “Operation Midway Blitz,” an ICE effort that has resulted in more than  1,000 arrests of migrants across Illinois  between September 8 and October 3, according to the Department of Homeland Security.\n \n\n   \n  The ICE building in Broadview, outside Chicago, has been the site of multiple confrontations as protesters have come out to decry the immigration arrests. Meanwhile,  DHS  has said it “won’t let this violence deter us from arresting the worst of the worst and making Illinois safe again.”\n \n\n   \n  Over 100 protesters gathered outside the facility Friday morning, with Broadview police officers, Cook County sheriff’s deputies and Illinois State Police gathered to keep demonstrators in the area designated for them. The protest, though loud, has remained calm. As of 5 p.m. CT, 15 arrests had been made, the Cook County Sheriff’s Office said.\n \n\n   \n  A small group of protesters that remained outside the facility Friday evening were ordered by authorities to disperse at 6 p.m. per a  curfew  put in place earlier this month by Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson.\n \n\n   \n  It came a day after 13 people were arrested in a federal raid at a Chicago flea market, the Department of Homeland Security said Friday. Those arrested are “illegal aliens with criminal histories including DUI, battery causing bodily harm, and domestic violence,” the department said in a  post  on X.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s a roundup of what has transpired in the Windy City area ahead of more planned anti-ICE protests on Friday and a  second ‘No Kings’  rally and march planned for Saturday, with more than 75,000 expected to attend.\n \n\n   \n    Federal judge orders use of body cameras\n \n\n   \n  One week after issuing a  sweeping order  trying to quell the intense response of federal agents to protests against immigration enforcement activities in Chicago, US District Judge Sara Ellis told attorneys on both sides of the case to come back to her courtroom to have their own discussion.\n \n\n   \n  Ellis said she had “serious concerns” about her order being followed and eventually announced she will be expanding her restraining order and will require all federal agents involved in the immigration crackdown in Chicago to have body cameras on when encountering protesters.\n \n\n   \n  The judge originally required all agents to wear cameras but agreed to some flexibility after an attorney representing the Trump administration said it would be logistically impossible to immediately provide all agents with the cameras.\n \n\n   \n  The Department of Justice still opposed the body camera order, arguing it’s not a simple matter to record the videos and consistently turn them around for reviewing and redacting video based on every allegation.\n \n\n   \n  Ellis also demanded that ICE Field Director Russell Hott appear in court on Monday, “to explain to me why I am seeing images of tear gas being deployed and reading reports that there were no warnings given before it was deployed out in the field.”\n \n\n   \n  Democratic US Sens. Tammy Duckworth and Dick Durbin on Friday called on ICE and Customs and Border Protection to enforce body camera requirements in compliance with the federal order, saying the footage “plays a vital role in promoting responsible law enforcement tactics and verifying DHS accounts against facts on the ground and, ultimately, is in the best interest of agents, officials and individuals involved in use of force incidents.”\n \n\n   \n    Order bars ICE from county property\n \n\n   \n  An  executive order , signed Thursday by the president of the Cook County Board of Commissioners, prohibits ICE from using county-owned “property, resources, and personnel for civil immigration enforcement activities,” including staging for and debriefing from enforcement actions.\n \n\n   \n  The new order builds on prior resolutions and a 2011 county ordinance that prohibits the use of county facilities and personnel time for ICE investigations without a criminal warrant.\n \n\n   \n  “Local law enforcement and County employees rely on public trust to effectively serve residents. Allowing federal civil immigration operations on County property would erode that trust, discourage cooperation with public safety agencies, and jeopardize the sense of security that all residents deserve,” a  release  from the county about the order said.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to ICE for comment.\n \n\n   \n    Federal vehicle moved more than 1,000 miles away\n \n\n   \n  The federal vehicle that American citizen  Marimar Martinez  is accused of ramming earlier this month before she was shot by a CBP agent has been  moved  more than 1,000 miles away to Maine, a Department of Justice attorney said at a Thursday hearing.\n \n\n   \n  Her attorney accused the DOJ of moving the vehicle – key evidence in the case – despite knowing he would likely need to examine it.\n \n\n   \n  The judge in the case ordered the vehicle be returned via flatbed truck after Martinez’s attorney expressed concern that evidence would not be preserved after it was driven to Maine and back.\n \n\n   \n  Martinez, 30, pleaded not guilty Wednesday to a charge of assaulting, resisting and impeding officers.\n \n\n   \n  She is accused of ramming the federal law enforcement vehicle with her car on October 4 as protests against the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown took place in the city.\n \n\n   \n  Her attorney has disputed this, saying unreleased body camera footage shows it was a federal agent who swerved into Martinez.\n \n\n   \n    ICE arrests police officer\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, ICE agents arrested a police officer in the Chicago suburb of Hanover Park, alleging he is an unlawful immigrant from Montenegro.\n \n\n   \n  DHS said the officer, Radule Bojovic, overstayed a tourist visa that expired in 2015.\n \n\n   \n  Bojovic was “encountered during a targeted enforcement action as part of Operation Midway Blitz,” the department said.\n \n\n   \n  “Radule Bojovic violated our nation’s laws and was living ILLEGALLY in the United States for 10 years – what kind of police department gives criminal illegal aliens badges and guns? It’s a felony for aliens to even possess a firearm. A law enforcement officer who is actively breaking the law,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to CNN Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the Hanover Park Police for comment and has attempted to contact Bojovic.\n \n\n   \n    Appeals court denies effort to deploy National Guard troops\n \n\n   \n  In a loss for the Trump administration, an appellate court on Thursday denied the government’s effort to deploy National Guard troops in Illinois.\n \n\n   \n  However, the troops can remain in the state under federal control, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals said.\n \n\n   \n  The opinion details the court’s reasoning in a  decision  issued Saturday and comes a week after US District Court Judge April Perry issued a scathing  oral ruling  from Chicago that granted a temporary restraining order halting the Trump administration’s deployment of soldiers in Illinois for two weeks.\n \n\n   \n  “I have seen no credible evidence that there has been rebellion in the state of Illinois” that would justify federalizing National Guard soldiers, Perry said at the time, calling Department of Homeland Security assessments of the protests “unreliable.”\n \n\n   \n  The denial is the latest in a court saga over whether President Donald Trump is exceeding his authority by deploying troops to quell demonstrations outside ICE facilities near Democratic-led cities like Chicago.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/politics/presidential-profanity-trump-biden","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"17:39:00-04:00","title":"When the White House gets salty: Trump, Biden and presidential profanity","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the increasing use of profanity by high-level U.S. political figures, with a central focus on President Donald Trump’s use of the f-bomb during a White House meeting with Ukraine’s leader, sparked by Venezuela’s President Nicolás Maduro offering resource access in exchange for diplomatic easing.

profanity \n       \n  By Donald Judd, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:39 PM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump’s frustrations with Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro spilled into public view during a White House meeting with Ukraine’s leader Friday, which saw Trump trade  military strikes  in the Caribbean for an f-bomb in the Cabinet Room.\n \n\n   \n  Pressed on reporting from  The New York Times  that Venezuela had approached administration officials with a proposal to offer preferential access to its natural resources in exchange for lowering the temperature between the two nations, Trump told reporters Maduro has “offered everything.”\n \n\n   \n  “You know why? Because he doesn’t want to fuck around with the United States,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Blue language at the White House is rare, but it’s not the first time Trump has deployed that specific expletive to vent his annoyance over diplomatic challenges\n \n\n   \n  In June, following the news Israel and Iran violated a temporary ceasefire agreement brokered by the US, Trump told reporters on the White House South Lawn, “We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long, and so hard, that they don’t know what the fuck they’re doing.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump has shrugged off many norms as president, and often used coarse or politically incorrect language, both as president and as a presidential candidate — in 2018,  he decried immigrants coming to the US from what he called “shithole countries ,” behind closed doors, later using the same curse to describe the District of Columbia  during a 2024 campaign rally in Iowa .\n \n\n   \n  But he’s hardly the first prominent politician to deploy the f-word or other expletives from their off-color arsenal in public.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s predecessor, Joe Biden, raised eyebrows when, during a 2010 press conference with then-President Barack Obama, he was caught telling Obama passage of the Affordable Care Act was a “big fucking deal.”\n \n\n   \n  Democrats  later used the gaffe to raise money for the Democratic National Committee .\n \n\n   \n  Later, as president, Biden  was again caught on a hot mic  calling a reporter in the White House press pool “a stupid son of a bitch,” for asking a question he didn’t like, though he later called the reporter to apologize.\n \n\n   \n  Obama too raised eyebrows when, during an off-the-record portion of a 2009 interview with CNBC, he called rapper Kanye West “a jackass” after West rushed the MTV stage during Taylor Swift’s speech accepting the award for best female music video of the year.\n \n\n   \n  And in 2004, then-Vice President Dick Cheney  told Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy to “go fuck yourself”  on the Senate floor during Senate picture day after Leahy accused the vice president of war profiteering.\n \n\n   \n  Using profanity on the Senate floor is against the chamber’s rules, but Cheney skirted a violation because the Senate was not in session, a Senate official told CNN at the time.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/americas/made-in-guatemala-working-conditions-as-equals-intl-cmd","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"13:00:00Z","title":"The truth behind your clothing’s ‘made in Guatemala’ label","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reveals the exploitation of tens of thousands of Guatemalan maquila workers, particularly women, in garment factories that supply US brands such as Target, Carhartt, and Ralph Lauren.

your clothing’s ‘made in Guatemala’ label \n       \n  By Stefano Pozzebon. Video by Lali Houghton, Ladan Anoushfar, Estefania Rodriguez, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:00 AM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In the bracing morning air, workers leave their homes in the outer suburbs and hurry toward the industrial buildings lining the Guatemalan capital’s highways.\n \n\n   \n  Some go by foot. Others by motorcycle; whole families on the school commute, children in their mothers’ arms. Many more travel on old yellow school buses, imported from the United States after decades of service.\n \n\n   \n  The workers are almost entirely women, ranging from their late teens to early 60s. They stream into factory buildings past heavy metal gates and 10-foot walls topped with barbed wire.\n \n\n   \n  What happens inside these garment factories, known as “maquilas” throughout Central America, is largely hidden from public view – even though they employ tens of thousands of workers and are crucial to Guatemala’s economy.\n \n\n   \n  Cameras and other recording devices are not allowed inside, several of the workers told CNN. Independent inspectors are hamstrung by factory bosses, according to government officials. Trade unions are few and attempts to organize are met with threats, firings and, in some cases, violence, the workers said.\n \n\n   \n  What does emerge from these factories is box after box of garments overwhelmingly destined for the US: clothes for some of the biggest brands in North America, such as Carhartt, Target and Ralph Lauren, among others.\n \n\n   \n  After decades of nearshoring policies pursued by successive US administrations, Guatemala has become an integrated hub for cheap apparel – and some of the consequences for the local workforce have been brutal.\n \n\n   \n  A months-long investigation by CNN gathered dozens of testimonies of workplace abuse. Workers spoke of public dressing-downs and threats to fire staff unable to fulfill impossible quotas, wage theft and sexual harassment.\n \n\n   \n  Some maquila workers told CNN they were given daily quotas of thousands of apparel items, and made to stand for up to 15 hours a day, while earning a minimum wage of less than $500 a month.\n \n\n   \n  “If you don’t keep up, they flag you out, they discipline you,” said one worker, Rosa Guerra. “They ask us to hurry up and say that they cannot pay us.”\n \n\n   \n  Others described deplorable working conditions: “The (drinking) water was dirty. Sometimes it even had soap or cockroaches in it,” said Merida Jacinto.\n \n\n   \n  But dissent is not an option for the vast majority of maquila workers. Of the more than 850 textile maquilas in Guatemala, only 76 allow a workers’ union, Labor Minister Miriam Roquel told CNN. That’s about 9% of factories.\n \n\n   \n  Guatemala has long been a cheap supplier for US companies. But maquilas took on an increasingly central role during the Covid-19 pandemic, when lockdowns meant many containers sat idle in East Asian ports for months – and US manufacturers looked to production closer to home. Between 2019 and 2022, apparel imports from Guatemala grew 37%, according to data from the US Department of Commerce.\n \n\n   \n  The sector now counts for almost 10% of Guatemala’s GDP, and is so crucial to the economy it was granted an exemption to continue operating during Covid-19 restrictions.\n \n\n   \n  Back in Guatemala City, as the light begins to fade from the skyline, the maquila workers emerge from their factories. Now, some are ready to share their stories of the world inside.\n \n\n   \n    What a lifetime of maquila work looks like\n \n\n   \n  Rutilia Cano had worked for the same garment factory for 23 years – until she was abruptly made jobless in February.\n \n\n   \n  An indigenous woman from the Guatemalan highlands, Cano never learnt to read and moved to the capital as a young mother in the 1980s to escape the violent civil conflict between the Guatemalan Army and leftist guerrillas that caused the death of tens of thousands of Maya civilians between the 1960s and the early 1990s.\n \n\n   \n  Working in the textile industry was the only job she could land, and the pace of work was brutal. “We were asked to make some 300 t-shirts an hour, but I never managed to,” Cano, now in her late fifties, told CNN. “I’m old, I could only get to 150, 175 t-shirts maybe, and the managers were always coming after me.”\n \n\n   \n  Her dream was to one day return to her village and purchase land to build a house. But for more than three decades her home has been a rundown apartment with a plastic curtain as a door.\n \n\n   \n  Like many of her fellow workers, Cano was never able to purchase the fruits of her labor. The t-shirts, skirts and more that she made at the factory – owned by Korean company KOA Modas – were supplied to US retailer Target and sold abroad. Throughout her employment Cano was never under contract with Target, who – as a third-party client – was not responsible for her layoff. Target used an intermediary to purchase garments from KOA Modas, a spokesperson told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  On a rare visit to a large department store that sells international brands, Cano ran her strong hands shaped by a lifetime of sewing along the hanging rails of clothes. “It would take me days to afford what is on offer here,” she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Most of the garment factories here are run by Korean companies, who control almost two-thirds of investments in the Guatemalan textile industry, according to a 2022 report by USAID.\n \n\n   \n  In this intricate supply chain, US brands do not have formal relationships with most of the Guatemalan workers who manufacture garments on their behalf, nor are they legally responsible for the working conditions inside the maquilas.\n \n\n   \n  However, they benefit from a pattern of sub-contracting deals that keep prices down and deliveries running unabated, advocates have said.\n \n\n   \n  According to a company fact sheet, big US brand Ralph Lauren purchases from 17 facilities across Guatemala, some of which are owned by Korean companies. Ralph Lauren did not immediately respond to CNN’s requests for comment on its supplier relationships.\n \n\n   \n  Mother-of-three Cano had been looking forward to retiring one day and spending more time with her family. But in February, that future was upended when Cano’s factory declared bankruptcy. Labor inspectors told her the factory’s ownership had left millions of dollars in outstanding payments to the Guatemalan welfare agency. Cano’s pension was gone.\n \n\n   \n  “I was due some 80-90,000 quetzales ($11,000)… and nothing. I feel so sad because we all lost our jobs, even me, a single mother. It’s just sad…” Cano told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for Target told CNN suppliers are required to comply with lawful, safe and respectful working conditions and that the company decided to end the relationship with KOA Modas because the factory did not comply with its standards.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reached out to KOA Modas for comment, but did not receive a response at time of publishing.\n \n\n   \n  After the factory closed, Cano joined litigation involving Sae-A Trading, another Korean company which used to purchase KOA Modas’s apparel on Target’s behalf and, after a lengthy legal battle, pledged to fulfill the vast majority of severance payments.\n \n\n   \n  While Sae-A Trading has no legal responsibility for the workers, it agreed to make a “humanitarian contribution” to those affected by the closure, it said in a resolution document. Its contribution of $3.3million is “considered a loan,” it added.\n \n\n   \n  Such severances are “by far the largest single sum of money most of these families will ever see in their lives,” Scott Nova, executive director at the Worker Rights Consortium, a US-based organization that investigates the garment industry, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  He said it was common in the industry for workers not to receive their pension, adding “it’s difficult to put into words how financially and psychologically devastating it is to work 20 years to earn this one sizable, real pot of money, and then just have it taken from you.”\n \n\n   \n  When CNN last spoke with Cano in late September, she was still waiting to be paid under the settlement with Sae-A Trading. “I need that money,” she told CNN, adding “at my age I’m struggling to get work – the only thing I could do is cleaning houses but that is very tiring.”\n \n\n   \n    A culture of fear\n \n\n   \n  For other maquila workers, simply joining their factory’s trade union – if it even exists – can be met with trepidation.\n \n\n   \n  Corina Olivares is one of the union representatives at the Texpia II factory, also owned by Sae-A Trading. She took over after her predecessor, Anastacio Tzib Caal, was shot dead outside of Guatemala City in June last year.\n \n\n   \n  In the months leading up to Caal’s death, obscenity-ridden threats appeared on the walls of workers’ toilets, which CNN has seen photos of. “Unionists, son of b****es, resign or we will lynch you,” read one, with the stylized image of a revolver mimicking a signature. “Unionist b**ch, go to sh*t don’t mess with the factory, be grateful it’s given you to eat for many years,” read another.\n \n\n   \n  While the US Department of Labor implied Caal’s murder was linked to his union activity, Olivares wasn’t so certain. However, she added, the threats made her seriously question whether to run as his successor: “For months, I was genuinely scared to walk to work,” she said. Olivares told CNN that the company blamed the union – which had campaigned for reduced working hours and clean drinking water being made available between shifts – for a contraction in trade. The resulting hostility from other workers toward union members made her feel unsafe.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for Texpia II confirmed that threatening graffiti appeared between May and June last year but stressed that factory’s management took actions to condemn the threats and support union activities.\n \n\n   \n  Any form of verbal abuse or personal harassment is not tolerated at Texpia II, the spokesperson said.\n \n\n   \n  Elsewhere, VESTEX, the civil association representing the textile export industry in Guatemala, said in a statement to CNN that the group’s Code of Conduct strictly bans verbal and physical abuse, including corporal punishment, coercion and sexual harassment.\n \n\n   \n    Power dynamics and sexual abuse\n \n\n   \n  Inside factories, the balance of power between the male-dominated management and the mostly female workers can lead to another disturbing problem.\n \n\n   \n  Worker Laura, who chose to remain anonymous, described how one manager would touch her inappropriately at work. “I knew it was not okay, but I was too scared to speak out,” she told CNN. “I didn’t know that inside a maquila, female workers were so exposed to the middle managers, as if a man who thinks he’s superior to us can dominate in such a way,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  Another worker, Alexandra, who also preferred to remain anonymous, told CNN of a manager who sexually harassed her for years. “He would come toward me from my back in a really creepy way, putting his hands on my neck, touching me in a way that made me very uncomfortable,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  When she rejected his advances, Alexandra said the manager would change her shifts, and scold and insult her in front of other workers.\n \n\n   \n  When Alexandra and her colleagues complained about sexual and workplace abuse, she told CNN that the answer from upper managers was always that they were free to leave.\n \n\n   \n  In reality, Alexandra had few options but to stay on, telling CNN that she could not afford to be unemployed, and resigning would have meant giving up her severance pay.\n \n\n   \n  Alexandra’s factory sells almost exclusively to the US market. Past clients include Carhartt, which told CNN it parted ways with the factory in 2019, though it does continue to purchase from Guatemala more broadly.\n \n\n   \n    Powerless to intervene\n \n\n   \n  Instead of quitting, Alexandra decided to join a workers’ union. The group relayed the abuse to the Guatemalan Ministry of Labor. But when labor inspectors were sent to the factory earlier this year, the company’s management refused to meet with them, video seen by CNN shows.\n \n\n   \n  The following week, all the members of the union were laid off.\n \n\n   \n  In the months since, the Ministry of Labor has continued to engage with the company, with no results. “(More recently) We tried to enter that maquila with our inspectors to register the workers’ conditions,” labor inspector Silvia Juarez told CNN. “We simply couldn’t: the management barricaded behind a shut door and we would need police intervention to break through,” she told CNN, gritting her teeth.\n \n\n   \n  Alexandra’s factory did not respond to a detailed list of questions from CNN. However, the textile factories trade association VESTEX, told CNN in a statement that the group works hand in hand with the labor inspectorate to make sure regulations are respected.\n \n\n   \n  The Guatemalan president, Bernardo Arévalo, is the first progressive leader to be elected in the country in decades. His inauguration in 2024, after years of political malaise, raised hopes that rampant corruption and chronic malpractices could finally be reined in. But change is taking longer than expected.\n \n\n   \n  “What has been lacking in Guatemala is the political will to make public institutions work,” the president told CNN, a nod to the abuse in the maquila sector that has been infamous since at least the 1990s.\n \n\n   \n  Arévalo’s government raised the minimum wage for maquila workers by 6% and has pledged to do more to enforce existing regulation. But as the labor ministry’s inability to engage with shows, the state can do only so much.\n \n\n   \n  Months after their dismissal, most of the workers fired along with Alexandra told CNN they were getting by doing odd jobs and had struggled to find a new employer – their membership in the union apparently a stain in the eyes of other maquila   owners.\n \n\n   \n  The future for these maquila workers feels even more uncertain as the White House has imposed import tariffs on several countries that play a key role in the supply chain, leaving textile workers around the world exposed. The impact of those tariffs is yet to be felt in Guatemala, but other countries such as Lesotho and Haiti are already facing a bleak outcome.\n \n\n   \n  Prachi Agarwal, a research fellow at the ODI think tank, has written about a “gendered supply chain shock” as the vast majority of the workforce in the global garment industry are women.\n \n\n   \n  Alexandra meanwhile has decided to cut ties with the sector altogether. She hopes her daughter – who is studying law – will have a brighter career.\n \n\n   \n  “I will never want my daughter to work in a maquila. Ever,” she said.\n \n\n   \n    Credits\n \n\n   \n  Reporter: Stefano Pozzebon\n \n\n   \n  Editor: Sheena McKenzie\n \n\n   \n  Video Journalist: Lali Houghton\n \n\n   \n  Video editor: Estefania Rodriguez\n \n\n   \n  Field producer: Sofia Menchú\n \n\n   \n  Commissioning editor: Ladan Anoushfar\n \n\n   \n  Copy editor:   Andy Raine\n \n\n   \n  Associate Producer: Marta Simonella\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/business/boeing-737-production-planes","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"17:32:00-04:00","title":"Boeing can hike 737 MAX production to 42 planes per month, FAA says","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has lifted a 38-plane-per-month production cap on Boeing's 737 MAX, allowing the company to increase output to 42 planes per month after conducting extensive safety reviews of its production lines.

Alex Acosta defends handling of controversial Epstein plea deal \n       \n  By Annie Grayer, Kara Scannell, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:34 PM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The former US attorney who negotiated a controversial 2008 plea deal with Jeffrey Epstein defended that agreement in a closed-door interview with House investigators last month, according to a transcript of the interview released by lawmakers.\n \n\n   \n  Alex Acosta, the former US attorney from the Southern District of Florida who later served as labor secretary during President Donald Trump’s first term, disagreed with the assessment that he gave Epstein a “sweetheart deal” and argued that it would have been a “crapshoot” to take the case to federal trial at the time.\n \n\n   \n  In an extensive interview with the House Oversight Committee, Acosta reflected on what he viewed as his constraints as the US attorney on the case and why he felt he did the best he could with the circumstances he was navigating.\n \n\n   \n  The interview was part of the committee’s bipartisan investigation into Epstein, the late convicted sex offender, which has included subpoenas for documents and closed-door testimony. The congressional investigation comes amid growing calls for more transparency over the case.\n \n\n   \n  Acosta  resigned  from the post of Secretary of Labor in 2019 after he faced furor over the plea deal. Epstein avoided a federal trial at the time and  served only 13 months in prison for state prostitution charges over his involvement with underage girls .  A Miami Herald investigation published  in 2018 described the plea deal, negotiated by Acosta, as the “deal of a lifetime.”\n \n\n   \n  In his testimony to Congress, Acosta said that a Washington-based attorney from the Justice Department’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section who reviewed the case said going to trial would be a “crapshoot” – a judgement he apparently agreed with.\n \n\n   \n  “Ultimately, the trial was a crapshoot, and we just wanted the guy to go to jail,” Acosta told the House Oversight panel.\n \n\n   \n  “If we go to trial and we roll the dice and we do the crapshoot and we lose, what kind of signal does that send? That says that he got away with it, that you can do that more. And so we thought it was very, very important  to send that signal, and that’s why – that’s one reason we favored the negotiated plea,” he later added.\n \n\n   \n  Acosta laid out why he thought the victims’ statements and issues of jurisdiction would have posed challenges to the case if it had gone to trial in 2008.\n \n\n   \n  “Every attorney that looked at the case, from the prosecuting attorney, again, through the entire chain, looked at the evidence, and there were evidentiary issues with the victims,” Acosta stated. “Many victims refused to testify. Many victims had changing stories. All of us understood why they had changing stories, but they did. And defense counsel would have – cross-examination would have been withering.”\n \n\n   \n  Acosta also said investigators did not have evidence that Epstein traveled with any victims across state lines, which would have supported a federal charge, or that there were other individuals involved.\n \n\n   \n  “At the time, one of the major questions in the case was, is this a Federal case or is it a local case?” Acosta said.\n \n\n   \n  While Acosta acknowledged that in the political climate today, “there’s a greater desire for ‘just go for it’” among the public,” he claimed that was not the case in the early 2000s when he was making the decision.\n \n\n   \n  “Myself, the prosecuting attorney, the managing attorney of the Palm Beach office, the Criminal chief, and the first assistant all favored a pre-trial resolution. It was across-the-board,” Acosta said.\n \n\n   \n  Acosta has previously defended his handling of the plea deal, but the release of the closed-door interview transcript offers extensive insight into the former US attorney’s decision-making in the highly scrutinized, and criticized, case.\n \n\n   \n  And even though Acosta stood firm behind his actions, he acknowledged that others have had strong criticisms of his work.\n \n\n   \n  “Looking back in hindsight, there are a number of issues that I will, you know, that I will say caused the community and the victims to feel – to feel that this was not a good resolution, and I get that,” Acosta said. “But from the perspective of our prosecutors at the time, based on the evidence we had at the time, you know, everyone in our office wanted to put him in jail, and that’s what we did.”\n \n\n   \n  Acosta placed blame on his state counterparts for allowing Epstein to participate in a work release program that enabled him to be outside of the jail during the business day.\n \n\n   \n  “The work release was granted by the Palm Beach sheriff. Our office opposed it. Our office had every expectation that he would have continuous confinement. We were upset – more than upset. We were – what’s the polite word for ticked off? I’ll say ticked off. We were ticked off that he didn’t do so,” Acosta testified.\n \n\n   \n  “When we found out about it we objected. We objected in writing. We objected fully,” Acosta detailed.\n \n\n   \n    Acosta says it was ‘entirely’ his choice to resign as labor secretary amid Epstein furor\n \n\n   \n  Acosta repeatedly said he did not know if Trump was interviewed as part of his case and said the decision of who was interviewed was not up to him.\n \n\n   \n  “Not to my knowledge,” Acosta said when pressed by investigators. “It would not have been my practice to get involved in who was and who wasn’t interviewed.” He added he had no recollection of ever seeing documents where Trump’s name surfaced during the investigation into Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  Acosta said he never spoke to Trump until he was under consideration to be his Labor Secretary. Acosta said there were only two times the Epstein matter could have come up in discussion with Trump or anyone in his administration, but was not certain or specific on the details.\n \n\n   \n  The first was during his vetting process.\n \n\n   \n  “I may have had a communication – I don’t recall if I did or if it was simply – or if there was some written question or otherwise. But at some point in the vetting process, a question may have arisen,” Acosta said. “I honestly don’t remember.”\n \n\n   \n  Acosta also said he had a conversation with Trump’s then- communications team, but did not give an exact date and was vague on specifics. I know in The Washington Post there was a story above the fold at one point,” he said, “And so I talked to the communications team, because the communications team needed to be briefed.”\n \n\n   \n  Acosta was also asked about rumors that Epstein had ties to the intelligence community., He said during the investigation no one from the intelligence community reached out to the office about Epstein and that he had no reason to believe Epstein was an asset to a foreign or domestic intelligence agency. “If there was any secure information, procedures would have been triggered that were never triggered,” Acosta said.\n \n\n   \n  On his eventual decision to resign in 2019, Acosta said, “I was neither instructed to resign, it wasn’t suggested that I resign. It was entirely my choice, my decision.”\n \n\n   \n  During the interview, Acosta was shown at least two news articles that connected Trump to Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  One was a New York Magazine  article  from 2002 prior to Acosta’s term as US attorney, where Trump is quoted saying he knows Epstein for 15 years and calls him a “terrific guy.”\n \n\n   \n  “He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life,” Trump is quoted saying the 2002 article.\n \n\n   \n  The second article Acosta was shown was from  October 2007 - - after Acosta’s office had executed the non-prosecution agreement but before Epstein had plead guilty—that alleged Epstein would try and “procure girls” at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club and was banned as a result.\n \n\n   \n  Acosta was then asked if he is aware if Trump was interviewed about women at Mar-a-Lago.\n \n\n   \n  “I am not aware of who was interviewed and not interviewed in the case generally because U.S. attorneys do not become involved in deciding who gets interviewed and who does not get interviewed,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/politics/venezuela-trump-saber-rattling","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"17:32:00-04:00","title":"Trump’s Politically Dicey Saber-Rattling in Venezuela","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article analyzes Donald Trump's increasingly aggressive foreign policy toward Venezuela, marked by a surge in U.S. military activity—including B-52 bomber flights and a naval buildup—and the authorization of covert CIA operations.

Venezuela \n       \n  Analysis by Aaron Blake, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:32 PM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Hubris courses through what President Donald Trump and his administration are doing right now. So much of it is unpopular and politically fraught. They’re charging ahead regardless.\n \n\n   \n  That’s true of the tariffs. It’s true of the growing militarization of the homeland. And it’s been true of his cuts to the government and  many other things .\n \n\n   \n  But perhaps nothing is as politically fraught right now as what’s happening off the coast of South America.\n \n\n   \n  There are growing signs that Trump is  flirting with regime change or even attacking Venezuela . And to the extent it’s more than a bluff, it’s not difficult to see the situation blowing up in the administration’s face.\n \n\n   \n  CNN’s Zachary B. Wolf today runs through the increased saber-rattling and  signs of a building clash . The US Navy has built up in the Caribbean, and the Air Force flew B-52 bombers off the Venezuelan coast for hours on Wednesday. The Trump administration is striking alleged drug boats  in quite possibly illegal ways . Trump has both left open the possibility of strikes inside Venezuela and confirmed Wednesday that he has  authorized covert CIA action there .\n \n\n   \n  We also learned Thursday that the admiral overseeing this US Southern Command region, Adm. Alvin Holsey, has  suddenly announced his retirement . CNN reports this came amid tensions over the administration’s activities, though the Pentagon denied this.\n \n\n   \n  There are a couple ways to read all this.\n \n\n   \n  One is that this is part of a trademark Trump pressure campaign to get Venezuela to bend to his will. Perhaps the threat will be enough to get Trump what he wants.\n \n\n   \n  But we’ve also seen a different side of Trump in his second term –  an increasingly militaristic one . He seems to have shed the non-interventionist political veneer that characterized his campaigns for office in favor of a more heavy-handed approach on the world stage. And that would fit with his broader project, which appears to be largely about showing how powerful he can be.\n \n\n   \n  And even if his saber-rattling is all intended as a bluff, at some point it’s conceivable that the president could be forced to follow through.\n \n\n   \n  If it comes to that, it’s difficult to see how Trump would have the American people behind him.\n \n\n   \n  While we don’t have good quality polling on the Venezuela situation specifically, other recent surveys have shown Americans taking a dim view of such foreign adventurism.\n \n\n   \n  A  poll from the Chicago Council on Global Affairs  last year showed the percentage of Americans who favored an active role in world affairs hitting its lowest point since 1982.\n \n\n   \n  Just 17% of Americans agreed that the US had a “responsibility” to take a leading role in world affairs.\n \n\n   \n  Similarly, a  Reuters-Ipsos poll  in June showed Americans agreed 58%-38% that it’s better if the US “stays out of the affairs of other nations.” Majorities of Republicans, independents and Democrats agreed with that sentiment.\n \n\n   \n  Americans have been willing to take active roles in certain foreign conflicts. But that quickly changes when it includes the prospect of conflict involving US troops and regime change, according to several surveys taken around the time of US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  Iran is, of course, not Venezuela. You could certainly argue that going to war with Iran would be a far riskier proposition.\n \n\n   \n  And it’s a threat that Americans have been quite concerned about for years and decades. But there is no evidence that Americans feel similarly about Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has made the case that Venezuela has sent drugs and gangs to invade the United States, but so many of these claims have proven hyperbolic – and  even been rejected by judges  and  his own intelligence community .\n \n\n   \n  It’s conceivable that Americans could be convinced that going into Venezuela is necessary to combat the flow of drugs. A 2023  Reuters poll , for instance, showed Americans supported sending the US military to Mexico to “fight against drug cartels and try to reduce the flow of illegal narcotics,” 52%-36%.\n \n\n   \n  But even that poll showed how wary Americans are of a wider war. When asked whether the US should do this unilaterally – in other words without the permission of the Mexican government – support plummeted. Americans opposed that about 2-to-1 – 59%-29%.\n \n\n   \n  That’s essentially the proposition in Venezuela, with a little potential regime change sprinkled on top.\n \n\n   \n  If Trump really goes there, it will show he’s truly thrown political caution to the wind.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/business/salesforce-marc-benioff-apology","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"17:39:00-04:00","title":"Marc Benioff Apologizes for Suggesting National Guard Be Sent to San Francisco","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Marc Benioff, CEO of Salesforce, initially suggested that President Donald Trump deploy the National Guard to San Francisco to address safety concerns, a statement that drew sharp criticism.

On Thursday, the Chicago-based 7th US Circuit Court of Appeals let stand an order temporarily blocking that effort.\n \n\n   \n  Trump filed the appeal at the Supreme Court in a case involving his effort to deploy the guard to Chicago. In the appeal, the administration said that lower court order “improperly impinges on the president’s authority and needlessly endangers federal personnel and property.”\n \n\n   \n  The litigation puts the controversy before a Supreme Court that has rarely ruled on such deployments – but that has often deferred to the president on matters of security and defining what  constitutes a national emergency . The administration asked for a quick order that would allow them to carry out the deployment while the high court considers the case.\n \n\n   \n  In the appeal, the Trump administration argues lower courts were impermissibly encroaching on the president’s authority to control federalized guard members.\n \n\n   \n  The   lower court order temporarily blocking the deployment, the administration said, put the judicial branch “in the untenable position of controlling the military chain of command and judicially micromanaging the exercise of the president’s commander-in-chief powers, including the decision about which military forces the president can deploy.”\n \n\n   \n  The appeal uses striking language to describe the situation in Chicago, asserting that federal officials there “have been threatened and assaulted, attacked in a harrowing pre-planned ambush involving many assailants.”\n \n\n   \n  “Federal agents are forced to desperately scramble to protect themselves and federal property, allocating resources away from their law-enforcement mission to conduct protective operations instead,” Solicitor General D. John Sauer told the court.\n \n\n   \n  That framing starts in stark contrast with how US District Court Judge April Perry described the situation on the ground in an order earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  Perry, a Biden nominee, pointed to what she described as a “a troubling trend of defendants’ declarants equating protests with riots and a lack of appreciation for the wide spectrum that exists between citizens who are observing, questioning, and criticizing their government, and those who are obstructing, assaulting, or doing violence.”\n \n\n   \n  To make its case for the deployments, the Department of Justice has relied heavily on a Supreme Court decision from 1827 – Martin v. Mott. The case dealt with Jacob Mott, a member of the New York militia who disobeyed President James Madison’s order to mobilize during the War of 1812. The Supreme Court balked at Mott’s argument that Madison had misjudged the danger and wrote that “the authority to decide whether the exigency has arisen belongs exclusively to the president.”\n \n\n   \n  In the administration’s appeal on Friday, Sauer said that case “squarely controls” Trump’s current deployments.\n \n\n   \n   Based on that, the Trump administration has argued, federal courts may not even review a president’s decisions to call up the guard.\n \n\n   \n  But the states challenging those decisions have scoffed at the notion that the protests against ICE agents are akin to an invading foreign army. And they have pointed to a 1932 decision, Sterling v. Constantin, in which courts reviewed a former Texas governor’s decision to deploy the National Guard to shut down certain oil fields in the state in order to limit production. In that case, the Supreme Court ruled that courts could review such deployment decisions that fell beyond a “range of honest judgment.”\n \n\n   \n  Just how fast the Supreme Court will move in the case was not immediately clear, but the court requested a response from state and local officials by Monday evening – a faster than usual turnaround.\n \n\n   \n  The 6-3 conservative court has sided with Trump in the vast majority of emergency cases he has filed since returning to power in January.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/media/smartmatic-doj-fox-giuliani-bribery-philippines","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"17:00:00-04:00","title":"Smartmatic Indicted in Foreign Bribery Case, Possibly Endangering Its Lawsuits Against Fox News and Giuliani","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Justice Department has filed foreign bribery charges against Smartmatic, a voting technology company, alleging a $1 million bribe was paid to a top Philippine election official in 2016 to secure contracts for that country's 2016 elections.

Giuliani \n       \n  By Marshall Cohen, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:32 PM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Justice Department on Thursday filed foreign bribery charges against Smartmatic, the voting technology company that is suing Fox News and other prominent pro-Trump figures for defamation over their promotion of 2020 election lies.\n \n\n   \n  The bribery and money laundering charges against Smartmatic arose from  an existing case  filed last year against some of its current and former executives, including its founder.\n \n\n   \n  The indictment relates to an alleged $1 million bribe paid to the top election official in the Philippines to secure lucrative contracts for that country’s 2016 elections. The indictment doesn’t include any allegations of voter fraud or election-rigging against Smartmatic.\n \n\n   \n  The news could be catastrophic for Smartmatic, potentially weakening its hand in pending 2020 election-related defamation lawsuits against Fox News, the Fox News host turned US attorney  Jeanine Pirro , ex-Trump lawyer  Rudy Giuliani  and MyPillow CEO  Mike Lindell .\n \n\n   \n  The charges could undermine Smartmatic’s arguments that its reputation has been damaged solely by these pro-Trump figures and their brazen lies about the 2020 election.\n \n\n   \n  “This is more of the same. A photocopy of the previous spurious indictment,” Smartmatic said in a statement on Thursday, denying wrongdoing and vowing to fight the case.\n \n\n   \n  The company further said, “We believe the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida has been misled and politically influenced by powerful interests, despite our extensive cooperation with the government. This is again, targeted, political, and unjust.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear what meddling Smartmatic is referring to. President Donald Trump has successfully pushed in recent weeks to  prosecute his opponents , but the underlying case against Smartmatic executives was brought by the Biden-era Justice Department, and career prosecutors endorsed Thursday’s new indictment, according to court filings.\n \n\n   \n  Smartmatic’s co-defendants previously pleaded not guilty.\n \n\n   \n  The company’s machines and software are widely used overseas, but in US elections, they are only used in Los Angeles. Dean Logan, the top election official for Los Angeles County, told CNN in a statement that the county owns and controls its own voting systems, but will “hold Smartmatic accountable to the terms and protections” of their ongoing contract.\n \n\n   \n  “The indictment is unrelated to the County’s administration of elections or the integrity of Los Angeles County’s voting systems, and the County’s contracts with Smartmatic were validated to ensure that all work was performed and requirements met,” Logan said. “Further, the County’s engagements with Smartmatic are fixed fee contracts with specific protection from the types of add-on fees and price inflation alleged in the activities cited in the indictment.”\n \n\n   \n    The defamation cases\n \n\n   \n  After President Donald Trump lost the 2020 election, he and his allies  spread the false claim  that Smartmatic technology flipped millions of votes to rob him of a victory.\n \n\n   \n  Smartmatic filed defamation lawsuits in 2021 against these figures, and other right-wing media outlets, seeking billions of dollars in damages. The company  settled with Newsmax  last year for $40 million and  settled with One America News  for an undisclosed amount.\n \n\n   \n  All of these pro-Trump outlets and figures deny wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  The Philippines scandal — which  CNN first revealed  in 2023 — has  provided a major boost  to these pro-Trump figures facing defamation lawsuits. They have sought additional documents about the criminal probe, hoping these will weaken damages claims from Smartmatic, and they’ve argued that the indictment proves Smartmatic’s shady practices.\n \n\n   \n  “Smartmatic was and is a failing company: its continued cozy relationship with dictators, a decade of mismanagement and poor performance, and criminal bribery charges against its highest echelon of leaders,” Fox News wrote in a court filing earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  Kate Mangels, a Los Angeles-based defense attorney who has handled defamation cases, said the indictment “severely limits” Smartmatic’s ability to claim it’s still suffering from ongoing damages from the 2020-era lies about its supposed vote-rigging.\n \n\n   \n  “The defendants in the defamation lawsuits will likely argue that, to the extent Smartmatic’s reputation has been harmed, it is impossible to tease out what harm came from the alleged defamation and what harm came from the indictment,” Mangels said.\n \n\n   \n  The indictment could also influence settlement negotiations, Mangels said, because “at trial, it would be difficult for Smartmatic to establish that all the damages” stem from the allegedly defamatory broadcasts and statements.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/us/des-moines-superintendent-ian-roberts-indicted","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"15:44:00Z","title":"Iowa Superintendent Detained by ICE Falsely Claimed He Was a US Citizen, Indictment Says","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ian Roberts, the former superintendent of Des Moines Public Schools, has been indicted by a federal grand jury for falsely claiming U.S. citizenship on an I-9 form and for illegally possessing firearms while in the U.S. illegally.

tax after threatening sanctions against countries supporting it \n       \n  By Laura Paddison, Andrew Freedman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:14 PM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A fierce Trump administration push to stop the  global shipping industry  from paying for its own climate pollution appeared to have been successful Friday, as efforts to approve the “world’s first global carbon tax” collapsed.\n \n\n   \n  It had been widely assumed the tax would be adopted during a summit in London at the International Maritime Organization, the UN-backed body that governs global shipping. But after four days of fraught negotiations, countries agreed to delay a vote on whether to approve it by 12 months.\n \n\n   \n  The decision came after a vociferous US campaign, with President Donald   Trump calling it a “scam tax” and the State Department threatening reprisals on countries supporting it.\n \n\n   \n  Experts say the collapse of the talks marks not only a significant blow for attempts to clean up a heavily climate-polluting industry, undermining decades of negotiations, but also represents  yet another failure  of climate diplomacy.\n \n\n   \n  IMO member states  agreed in 2023  that the shipping industry would reach net zero emissions — removing as much planet-heating gas from the atmosphere as it emits — by around 2050.\n \n\n   \n  One of the measures proposed as part of this was a tax on the industry’s climate pollution. The shipping industry would have paid the tax into a fund created by the IMO, to encourage emissions reductions and raise funds for climate action. IMO member nations  approved the tax  at a chaotic April meeting that the US abandoned part way through. The October talks were intended to formally adopt it.\n \n\n   \n  While the tax was supported by members including the European Union, Brazil and small island states such as Vanuatu, oil-producing countries including the United   States and Saudi Arabia opposed it strongly.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration spent weeks calling on countries to reject the vote. The US will “not tolerate any action that increases costs for our citizens, energy providers, shipping companies and their customers, or tourists,” the State Department said in a  statement  this month.\n \n\n   \n  It laid out a series of threats against countries that supported the tax including potentially blocking vessels from US ports, visa restrictions, increased fees and sanctions on “officials sponsoring activist-driven climate policies that would burden American consumers.”\n \n\n   \n  In a  post  on Truth Social Thursday, Trump said he was “outraged” at the vote and that the US “would not stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax.”\n \n\n   \n  After days of chaos and disagreement at the IMO talks, Singapore put forward a motion to delay the decision on Friday, which was called to a vote by Saudi Arabia.\n \n\n   \n  A legally-binding carbon tax on shipping would have been a big deal. “It would have marked the first-ever — and legally binding — carbon tax. This explains why petro-states including the United States tried so hard to scuttle the framework,” said Christiaan De Beukelaer, a senior lecturer in culture and climate at the University of Melbourne.\n \n\n   \n  A State Department official told CNN the vote demonstrates American leadership on the global stage: “Now we have a President who will always lead in putting America first and even worked to prevent consumers from around the world from paying higher prices as well.”\n \n\n   \n  The global shipping industry is responsible for  around 3%  of global planet-heating pollution annually, a figure that could rise to 17% by 2050 if no action is taken, according to a 2018 European Parliament  analysis .\n \n\n   \n  The industry has tended to slip under the radar when it comes to climate action, in part because so much of its activity happens in international waters, making the question of accountability for its climate pollution more complex.\n \n\n   \n  The failure to adopt the tax is a huge missed opportunity, experts say .  “Every delay means that innovation will struggle to scale, inequities will deepen, and the transition to clean shipping will become harder and more costly,” said Natacha Stamatiou of the Environmental Defense Fund.\n \n\n   \n  There are also fears about what it means for climate diplomacy. Other recent efforts to tackle the escalating climate crisis have either collapsed, such as attempts to negotiate the world’s first global plastics treaty, or failed to meet hopes, including last year’s COP29 climate conference in Azerbaijan,  which ended in bitterness  and a finance deal described by some developing countries as a “betrayal.”\n \n\n   \n  Experts are concerned for what this might mean for ambition levels at the upcoming COP30 climate conference in Belém, Brazil, next month.\n \n\n   \n  The failure of the IMO to adopt a carbon tax “marks a failure of this United Nations agency to act decisively on climate change,” said Ralph John Regenvanu, Vanuatu’s climate change minister. “This makes the road to Belém and beyond more difficult.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/middleeast/unidentified-palestinian-bodies-handed-over-by-israel-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"15:36:00Z","title":"Uncertainty surrounds identities of more than 100 Palestinian bodies handed over by Israel","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Over 120 Palestinian bodies have been returned by Israel to Gaza under a ceasefire agreement, with no identities provided—only numbers—and many showing signs of torture, such as being bound, blindfolded, and bearing gunshot wounds.

Others were ordinary Gazans who crossed into Israel but didn’t participate in the attacks.\n \n\n   \n  The unidentified remains were handed over by Israel to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which then delivered them to the Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis, Gaza, where forensic experts began examining them.\n \n\n   \n  An official from the Ministry of Health in Gaza told CNN each of the bodies had a document that indicated they were, at some point, held at Sde Teiman, a military base in the Negev desert, and that DNA tests had been performed on them there.\n \n\n   \n  The base has been used by Israel as a detention center, where a number of  cases of abuse of Palestinian detainees  had been reported during the war in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  After the October 7 attacks, Israeli first responders were overwhelmed by the number of bodies found across multiple attack sites.\n \n\n   \n  At that time, members of the ZAKA, an Israeli volunteer search and rescue organization that was  called in to recover the bodies  near the Israel-Gaza perimeter, told CNN that the victims were taken to the Shura Army Base, while remains of the attackers were stored at a different base in the Negev desert.\n \n\n   \n  Doctors at the forensic department at Gaza’s Nasser Hospital described to CNN the state they found the bodies that were handed over this week, saying they showed “signs of abuse and torture.”\n \n\n   \n  “Each martyr is given a number, and all martyrs are bound at the hands and feet. Some are blindfolded, and there are signs of gunshot wounds,” the doctors said.\n \n\n   \n  The health ministry official said the bodies had broken bones and looked like they had been “crushed by heavy vehicles.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has seen photographs, including closeup shots, of some of the bodies. Zip ties, blindfolds, and gunshot wounds are clearly visible on some of them. Most of the bodies appear to belong to young men, and those who are clothed appear to be wearing civilian clothes. Some of the bodies had dirt on them. One with what appeared to be an IV cannula still in the arm.\n \n\n   \n  The health ministry official told CNN that some of the remains appeared to have been exhumed after burial.\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Lawrence Owens, an independent forensic pathologist who looked at photographs of one of the bodies said the person in the picture was almost certainly bound and blindfolded before death, and noted that a fingertip appeared to be missing.\n \n\n   \n  Owens, a research fellow at the University of Winchester, said while the body had lines imprinted on it that appeared to be track marks, it was not nearly as damaged as one would expect if a heavy vehicle had rolled over it. He said, however, that it was possible the body was buried when run over.\n \n\n   \n  Another expert who examined the same photographs also said the deceased individual was bound and that the blindfold was likely applied before death, while the track marks appeared to have been caused after death.\n \n\n   \n  The Ministry of Health has set up a website where it has posted images of the remains in the hopes that family members or friends might be able to identify them. Many of the photographs are extremely graphic, showing wounds and details of partially decomposed bodies.\n \n\n   \n  Some of the remains have already been identified through the website, the ministry said.\n \n\n   \n    Mother ‘searched through more than 30 bodies’\n \n\n   \n  Rasmiya Mohammed Khairi Qdeih from the town of Khuza’a in southern Gaza is among those searching for information about her family.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking to CNN at the Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis on Wednesday, she said six of her sons were killed during the war, one has been taken prisoner by Israel, and one has been missing since the day Hamas and its allies in Gaza launched their assault in Israel.\n \n\n   \n  Qdeih said she didn’t know whether the son missing from October 7 was dead or alive. She said he did not participate in the attack but went to Israel when the fence was breached to see what was happening.\n \n\n   \n  “I heard news that they had brought the bodies of prisoners, so I ran (to the hospital) to see if he was among them or not,” she told CNN. “Whenever they bring the bodies of prisoners, I come here and search among them. Yesterday, I searched through more than 30 bodies.”\n \n\n   \n  The Palestinian Center for the Missing and Forcibly Disappeared Persons (PCMFD) said in a statement on Tuesday that Israel’s omission of an official list of names of the deceased “arouses suspicion and strengthens doubts about practices of enforced disappearance and tampering with victims’ files.”\n \n\n   \n  “We stress the necessity of providing complete information about the bodies being handed over and publishing all available information as soon as it arrives, including the names of the victims and details about the circumstances of their deaths, and immediately notifying the families in respect for their right to know and human dignity,” the statement said.\n \n\n   \n  It is unclear how many more bodies of Palestinians Israel is holding. An Israeli official familiar with the matter told CNN last month that the bodies of Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader who was believed to be one of the architects of the October 7 attack, and his brother Mohammed, would not be returned to Gaza.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/politics/investigation-john-bolton-indictment","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"16:38:00-20:00","title":"John Bolton Indicted in Classified Information Case After Years of Investigation and Cybersecurity Breach","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"John Bolton, a former national security adviser to Donald Trump, has been indicted on 18 counts of mishandling classified information after a five-year investigation that began with concerns over his 2020 memoir and was reignited in 2021 by an alleged Iranian hack of his AOL email account.

Soon after, New York Attorney General Letitia James was charged with bank fraud related to a mortgage  in an indictment unveiled  last week. But while Trump called in his post specifically for the prosecutions of Comey, James and California Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff, he never mentioned Bolton in his missive.\n \n\n   \n  The cases against Comey and James were presented to a grand jury by Lindsey Halligan, an interim US attorney handpicked by Trump for the position after the previous US Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia was forced out amid pressure to bring the cases.\n \n\n   \n  Halligan, Trump’s former personal lawyer who had no previous prosecutorial experience, was the only prosecutor to sign both indictments.\n \n\n   \n  In contrast, six prosecutors, including US Attorney for Maryland Kelly Hayes and the current head of counterintelligence investigations at the Justice Department, Scott Lara, signed the 26-page indictment against Bolton.\n \n\n   \n  In it, prosecutors accused Bolton of sharing “more than a thousand pages of information about his day-to-day activities” through his personal email account with two unauthorized individuals, who CNN has reported are his wife and daughter.\n \n\n   \n  Unlike prosecutions brought against Comey and James, the Bolton case has maintained the support of career prosecutors and investigators, people briefed on the matter said. That hasn’t stopped Trump from repeatedly attacking Bolton and possibly causing damage to the case, some Justice officials fear.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has railed for years against Bolton over his 2020 memoir that was highly critical of the president, claiming he should have gone to jail because classified information was contained in the book. Trump’s first Justice Department opened criminal and civil investigations into the book in 2020.\n \n\n   \n  “I think he’s, you know, a bad person. I think he’s a bad guy,” Trump said Thursday when told Bolton had been indicted, adding that he had not reviewed the case.\n \n\n   \n  Bolton made his initial court appearance in Greenbelt, Maryland, on Friday morning, pleading not guilty to all 18 counts. He said in a statement Thursday that he was a victim of Trump’s weaponization of the Justice Department.\n \n\n   \n  “These charges are not just about his focus on me or my diaries, but his intensive effort to intimidate his opponents, to ensure that he alone determines what is said about his conduct,” Bolton said. “I look forward to the fight to defend my lawful conduct and to expose his abuse of power.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Good luck, Mr. Mustache!’\n \n\n   \n  In June 2021, the Justice Department  closed its year-old criminal investigation  that scrutinized whether Bolton’s 2020 book had illegally revealed national security information.\n \n\n   \n  Around the same time, an Iranian hack of Bolton’s AOL email account would set in motion a new probe that led to Thursday’s charges.\n \n\n   \n  On July 6, 2021, a Bolton representative notified the FBI that he was the victim of an email breach by suspected Iranian hackers.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators have been laboring on this case since then after the FBI began assessing potential damage from the hack and raised questions about whether Bolton’s practice of sending diary entries from his personal email broke the law, according to people briefed on the probe.\n \n\n   \n  The Iranian hacking campaign targeting Bolton and other former government officials included threats against Bolton to expose him and cause him problems of the kind that crippled Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  “Good luck Mr. Mustache!” one message sent in August 2021 said, according to a person who described investigative documents.\n \n\n   \n  The FBI and national security lawyers in Maryland, and at Justice Department headquarters, formally opened an investigation into the hack in 2022, sources said. Early in the probe, prosecutors on the investigation got warrants to receive the data from service companies that hosted relevant accounts, such as Yahoo for Bolton’s AOL account and Google for another account, sources said.\n \n\n   \n  The work building a case was slow and meticulous. Information returned to the prosecutors needed to be reviewed by both the intelligence community, which was sensitive to classified information, and processed through a filter team at the Justice Department that would pull out confidential attorney-client records, because Bolton was a lawyer.\n \n\n   \n  For years, the work around what Bolton had and shared in his email account was an investigation essentially walled off from the one related to his book, which had been run by the US Attorney’s office in the District of Columbia.\n \n\n   \n  By the time investigators were ready to obtain a search warrant in August, the book manuscript had once again become part of the case. It was part – along with the hack – of what prosecutors pointed to in court as a basis for searching his office and home, according to court filings.\n \n\n   \n  The decision to search Bolton’s office and especially his home were crucial in the final turn of the investigation before the indictment this week.\n \n\n   \n  While investigators spent months assembling an idea of the emails and classified records they would want to use to build the case, Bolton’s home contained printed copies of some of the emails, the indictment said. Investigators had long suspected they would find hard copies like those, sources told CNN, because some of the emails Bolton wrote to his family he noted were for “the Archives.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘It’s really treasonous’\n \n\n   \n  Trump has repeatedly attacked Bolton since the release of his 2020 book and as Bolton has become one of the more prominent ex-Trump staffers turned critic of the president.\n \n\n   \n  Bolton was named Trump’s third national security adviser in 2018, a position that marked the culmination of a lengthy career in Washington across multiple administrations, including as George W. Bush’s ambassador to the United Nations.\n \n\n   \n  The initial Justice Department criminal probe of Bolton began in 2020 with an investigation into whether his he violated the law by including information the administration said was classified in his memoir. The same year, the Trump administration sued in civil court to try to stop publication of Bolton’s book over a dispute of whether he got proper sign off from classification authorities.\n \n\n   \n   Bolton’s memoir  included shocking allegations about the inner workings of the Trump White House, including that Trump requested Chinese help to win the 2020 election, argued Venezuela was part of the US and offered to help Turkey’s leader avoid a Justice Department probe.\n \n\n   \n  Trump publicly called for Bolton to be prosecuted in 2020 over the book’s publication, saying in  an interview  that his former national security advisor released “massive amounts” of classified information in its pages.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s really treasonous what he did,” Trump said at the time.\n \n\n   \n  On X, then called  Twitter , Trump called Bolton “a lowlife who should be in jail.”\n \n\n   \n  This year, Trump hasn’t frequently commented this year on the Bolton probe – a stark contrast from his public pressure campaigns for the prosecutions of other political foes who were key figures in investigations into himself.\n \n\n   \n  But since the search of Bolton’s house and office in August, Trump has asked advisers about the status of the case. He had been assured in recent weeks that they were moving ahead and that it was a strong case, sources said.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Stay tuned’\n \n\n   \n  In late August, when FBI agents executed a search warrants on Bolton’s home and office, they  seized electronics and multiple documents  labeled “secret,” “confidential,” and “classified,” including some about weapons of mass destruction, according to court records filed by prosecutors.\n \n\n   \n  Bondi, Patel and Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino all posted statements on X the morning of the search,  breaking department norms  of not commenting on ongoing investigations.\n \n\n   \n  “Public corruption will not be tolerated,” FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino  wrote .\n \n\n   \n  After the search, Bolton’s attorney Abbe Lowell said that the records Bolton kept would have been typical of those kept by a long-time government official. In a statement Thursday, Lowell said that the records were unclassified, shared only with his immediate family, were known to the FBI and were “personal diaries.”\n \n\n   \n  The next month, senior Justice Department leaders, including an attorney from the deputy attorney general’s office, were  pressing for the US Attorney’s office  to charge Bolton in the days after Trump complained that prosecutions of his enemies weren’t moving quickly enough.\n \n\n   \n  But prosecutors in the Maryland US attorney’s office pushed back, arguing the timeline was too aggressive and they needed more time to bring a stronger case against Bolton, including reviewing the records obtained from the search warrant.\n \n\n   \n  One Justice Department official was considering pulling prosecutors off the case out of opposition to the deputy attorney general’s instruction.\n \n\n   \n  In the end, though, the political pressure eased on the Maryland office after Comey’s indictment. Career prosecutors on the case withdrew their reservations on timing and set in motion  finalizing the indictment  last weekend.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, the lead prosecutor in Bolton’s case, Thomas Sullivan – who also worked on the Biden classified documents investigation under special counsel Robert Hur – presented to a federal grand jury for a little over two hours at the federal courthouse about 20 minutes outside DC.\n \n\n   \n  Fifteen minutes after members of the grand jury filed out of the courthouse, Sullivan, four of his colleagues and the jury foreperson took an elevator one floor up to Magistrate Judge Gina Simms’ courtroom to deliver the indictments approved that day. After the foreperson handed up the indictments, the judge asked if there were any other matters she needed addressed, to which Sullivan said yes.\n \n\n   \n  He handed the judge a slim red file, but and said nothing else. Simms then quickly reviewed the file – also not saying aloud any details of it – before adjourning. The entire proceeding lasted less than 10 minutes.\n \n\n   \n  Outside the courtroom, Sullivan said few words to reporters seeking information about what he gave the judge.\n \n\n   \n  “I would just stay posted,” he said. “Stay tuned.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Devan Cole contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/health/ozempic-trump-oz","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"17:00:00-04:00","title":"Trump’s $150 Ozempic?

Oz cautions it’s not a done deal, but patients and doctors say it could be a gamechanger \n       \n  By Meg Tirrell, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:08 PM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Janet McCaskill was on vacation in Arizona with her husband and best friend when she heard that President Donald Trump had suggested he might be able to bring the cost of popular weight-loss drugs down to $150 a month.\n \n\n   \n  “The thought of it going to $150 a month is dramatic,” said McCaskill, a grandmother from North Carolina  who’s lost 100 pounds  with the help of GLP-1 medicines, a class best known for the diabetes drug Ozempic. “That is most fantastic – if it comes to pass.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump planted the idea Thursday in an Oval Office news conference about an entirely different set of drugs – those for  in vitro fertilization  – before his Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Administrator, Dr. Mehmet Oz, stepped in to warn it wasn’t a done deal.\n \n\n   \n  Nonetheless, Trump’s comments made waves. Patients who’ve struggled to afford the pricey medicines shared hope the price could be reached. Doctors called it “huge for patients,” if true. And in a sign that Wall Street took it seriously, stocks of Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, the makers of GLP-1 drugs Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro and Zepbound, fell significantly, wiping out tens of billions of dollars in the companies’ market values.\n \n\n   \n  It’s just not clear it’ll actually happen.\n \n\n   \n    An awkward moment in the Oval\n \n\n   \n  It started with a familiar refrain from the president,  who’s previously lamented  the cost difference of weight-loss drugs in Europe compared with the US.\n \n\n   \n  “In London, you’d buy a certain drug for $130 … and in New York, you pay $1,300 for the same thing,” Trump said in opening remarks of his IVF announcement Thursday. “So now we’re going to be paying, instead of $1,300, you’ll be paying about $150.”\n \n\n   \n  A reporter, Max Bayer of Endpoints News, made the connection, asking later if Trump was referring to bringing weight-loss drugs down to $150. The president confirmed he was “referring to Ozempic, or the fat-loss drug … they’ll be much lower.”\n \n\n   \n  At that point, Dr. Oz started to look uncomfortable, stepping up to the podium with a subtle shaking of his head.\n \n\n   \n  “We have not negotiated those yet,” Oz clarified. “We’re going to be rolling these out over time.”\n \n\n   \n  It didn’t take long for Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly’s stocks to react, each dropping about 4% in after hours trading Thursday and maintaining losses through trading on Friday. A Wall Street analyst, Evan Seigerman of BMO Capital Markets, sought to assuage investor fears of coming price cuts in a research note Thursday evening that called Trump’s remarks “aggressive posturing amidst negotiations.”\n \n\n   \n  The drug companies were tight-lipped. Novo Nordisk, which makes Ozempic and its weight-loss counterpart, Wegovy, told CNN that the company “has engaged in discussions” with the Trump administration about drug pricing in the context of the president’s Most Favored Nation executive order, an approach that dictates the US shouldn’t pay more for medicines than the lowest price offered to peer nations.\n \n\n   \n  Medicines are routinely sold at markedly higher prices in the US than other countries, including diabetes and weight-loss drugs: Ozempic is priced 10 times higher in the US than France, according to  a 2023 analysis  from Peterson-KFF.\n \n\n   \n  “We remain focused on improving patient access and affordability, and we will continue to work to find solutions that help people access the medication they need,” a Novo Nordisk spokeswoman said.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesman for Eli Lilly, which makes Mounjaro for diabetes and Zepbound for weight loss, said the company is “not aware of any specific price commitments,” and that it’s “in discussions with the administration to further expand patient access, preserve innovation and promote affordability for our medicines.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Most Favored Nation’ drug prices\n \n\n   \n  The president has announced deals with  Pfizer ,  AstraZeneca  and  EMD Serono  in the past month under the Most Favored Nation framework, and has promised more to come. The deals so far have included an offering of medicines at Most Favored Nation prices to Medicaid – a system that already receives heavy discounts – as well as deals on certain drugs that can be purchased directly by consumers, without insurance, through a new platform called TrumpRx.\n \n\n   \n  In return, drugmakers have won reprieves from the threat of tariffs, as long as they continue to invest in manufacturing and research in the US.\n \n\n   \n  Thus far, the deals have appeared neutral or positive to pharmaceutical companies, with  Pfizer’s stock rising  the day of its announcement and buoying competitors along with it. The agreements, Seigerman wrote, “have been far from a sweeping implementation of US pricing cuts.”\n \n\n   \n  The drugs Pfizer and the White House noted  would be offered  through the TrumpRx program don’t appear to be used very often in the US, face generic competition in the near future, or carry such high list prices that even steep discounts for cash-paying patients would leave the medicines unaffordable for most people, said Stacie Dusetzina, a professor of health policy at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.\n \n\n   \n  GLP-1 medications, though, so-called for a hormone they mimic, are used by millions of Americans, and “if you look at the barriers to using them, cost is the number one thing,” said  Dr. Louis Aronne , director of the Comprehensive Weight Control Center at Weill Cornell Medicine.\n \n\n   \n    From thousands to hundreds\n \n\n   \n  The medicines are all priced, before insurance or discounts, at about $1,000 a month or more in the US. With commercial insurance coverage, many patients pay as little as $25 out of pocket. But coverage can be thorny, especially for weight loss, and some insurers are  reducing coverage .\n \n\n   \n  McCaskill experienced that firsthand. She started using Mounjaro in late 2022 to try to lose weight, and had such strong results, she credits the medicine with saving her life. But her insurance didn’t cover it, and it was so expensive she switched to a compounded version made by a local pharmacy.\n \n\n   \n  Compounders typically make drugs that require personalization, like if a patient is allergic to a certain ingredient or needs other modifications made. But law also allows compounding when medicines are in shortage, and GLP-1 manufacturers had trouble meeting outsized demand for several years, opening up an entire market of off-brand, compounded GLP-1s.\n \n\n   \n  Though the shortages  have now ended , some purveyors still offer compounded versions of the medicines, at much lower prices than Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly – even after  the companies introduced  cash pay discounted options.\n \n\n   \n  McCaskill said she switched to a Lilly program that allowed her to buy its weight-loss drug, Zepbound,  directly at at discount  after her local compounding pharmacy stopped selling the medication. But it costs her about $500 a month. Her best friend, Kay Powell, a nurse, is also on one of the medicines, but gets a compounded version through another pharmacy she trusts for $150.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m moving back to the compound just as soon as I can get to my doctor next week,” McCaskill told CNN Friday.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re price shopping,” Powell added. “We’re going to buy it wherever it’s most affordable.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘A big however’\n \n\n   \n  The White House and US Department of Health and Human Services didn’t immediately respond to inquiries from CNN about Trump’s $150 promise from the Oval Office.\n \n\n   \n  And doctors, analysts and policy researchers were skeptical they’d reach a $150 deal – or even what that might mean.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s comments may be “more to get these guys to make a deal than to actually get the price to $150 over the short term,” said Jared Holz, a health care strategist for financial firm Mizuho Securities USA. “Everything that comes out of this administration seems like it’s a precursor to some sort of transaction.”\n \n\n   \n  Dr. William Feldman, a physician and health policy researcher at UCLA, pointed out Novo Nordisk is  also in negotiations  with Oz’s CMS over pricing of semaglutide – the generic name of Ozempic and Wegovy – for Medicare, under a framework laid out in President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. He noted it’s not clear if a $150 monthly price would be part of those negotiations or a broader agreement outside them.\n \n\n   \n  “$150 a month gets closer to prices for semaglutide in other parts of the world and even to prices for compounded versions in the US,” he told CNN by email Friday. “This could be a boon for patients and could drive increased uptake in the US. However – and this is a big however – I’d like to see more details.”\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Jody Dushay, an attending physician in endocrinology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, said she refers patients to both Lilly and Novo Nordisk for their self-pay options when they don’t have insurance coverage, but pointed out “for many patients $500 a month is still totally unaffordable.”\n \n\n   \n  She urges patients to steer clear of compounded products, though, “due to lack of regulation and unknown safety and efficacy.”\n \n\n   \n  If the branded versions were priced at $150 a month,  access “would greatly increase,” said Dr. Jorge Moreno, an obesity specialist and assistant professor at Yale School of Medicine. “Even more patients would be willing and able to afford paying” for them.\n \n\n   \n  Even an out-of-pocket cost “would still pose some financial barriers,” said Dr. David Kim, an assistant professor of medicine and public health sciences at the University of Chicago. Vanderbilt’s Dusetzina pointed out “prior research has shown that once the prices reach $100 per month, many people do not fill their medicines.”\n \n\n   \n    260 pounds all together\n \n\n   \n  Affording GLP-1 medicines can make people feel desperate at their current prices and without insurance coverage, McCaskill said, especially as she’s seen not just dramatic weight loss but improvements in her cholesterol and other health markers.\n \n\n   \n  “Between the three of us, we’ve probably lost – what – 260 pounds?” Powell added, including McCaskill’s husband, Barry, in the tally.\n \n\n   \n  They all said they’d switch to the branded versions, away from the compounded ones, if they were offered at comparable prices.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s the real thing,” Barry said. “No question.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Tami Luhby contributed to this report. \n \n\n   \n   CORRECTION:  An earlier version of this story misspelled Bayer’s last name.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/style/jodie-turner-smith-victorias-secret-lotw","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"12:33:00.000-04:00","title":"Look of the Week: From Jimi Hendrix to Jodie Turner-Smith, why fashion loves a military jacket","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Hussar jacket, a historical military garment originating from the 18th century, is experiencing a major revival in contemporary fashion.

jacket \n       \n  By Leah Dolan, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:33 PM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Attention! The fashion set has just deployed a new fall jacket that could become a wardrobe mainstay for us all. Earlier this week at the Victoria’s Secret after-party in New York, Jodie Turner-Smith arrived in a pair of relaxed, low-slung light wash jeans, a white vest and a black, white and red military jacket that looked nothing short of Napoleonic.\n \n\n   \n  Identifiable by elaborate braiding, decorative buttons, and often toggles across the chest, military coats — also known as the Hussar jacket or Pelisse — appear to be making a comeback. While Turner-Smith, who also attended  the brand’s latest runway show  as a VIP guest, got her Hussar coat from Georgian-based brand Keburia, she’s not the only celebrity who has been spotted in military-style outerwear in recent weeks.\n \n\n   \n  At Paris Fashion Week, Zendaya was snapped outside the Louis Vuitton show at the Louvre, dressed in a metallic, fur-trimmed dress-coat with a Rococo edge. While some fashion enthusiasts may be revisiting Marie Antoinette as a source of sartorial inspiration in the light of  the blockbuster London exhibition dedicated to the French Queen’s style , Zendaya’s look took more cues from King Louis XVI. The following day at Dior, Jenna Ortega was seen in a gothic black sleeveless Hussar vest, the frog fastenings embroidered intricately with gold thread and finished with shining buttons. She completed her look with aviator sunglasses, bleached brows and a denim mini-skirt.\n \n\n   \n  Of course, this isn’t the first time modern dressers have dusted off 18th-century military outerwear in the name of fashion. The late American guitarist and singer Jimi Hendrix, who once briefly enlisted in the US army, owned and wore several different types of Hussar pelisses in the 1960s. Hendrix wore the coats unbuttoned, sometimes shirtless, and adorned with pendant necklaces; other times he styled them with vibrant silk scarves or blouses, subverting their original context as strict uniforms for obedient, militant officers.\n \n\n   \n  This playful, bohemian upending of a rigid, historical garment started a wave of subversive iterations from luxury brands, including Saint Laurent, Balmain, Gucci and Marc Jacobs — which in 2002 presented cream wool Hussar jackets trimmed with red and finished in gold stitching, worn with paisley blouses that seemed to be   in the Hendrix style. But when The Beatles wore the decorated military coats of yore on the cover of the 1967 album “Sargent Peppers and the Lonely Hearts Club,” it was less about communicating sex appeal and more about anti-establishment and anti-war sentiments. They wore their delicious, candy-colored satin guard coats buttoned to the top, like four fanciful colonels on the regimen of peace and love.\n \n\n   \n  Since then, the Hussar pelisse ironically became something of a uniform in the early aughts for musicians, including Michael Jackson, Beyoncé and Rihanna, and bands such as British alt-indie group The Libertines and US pop-punk band My Chemical Romance. In 2005, Kate Moss, then-girlfriend of The Libertines front man Pete Doherty, led the charge in making the trend mainstream with an ivory version worn to the Glastonbury music festival.\n \n\n   \n  Now, the style is back on our catwalks, as seen at Jonathan Anderson’s debut menswear collection for Dior, as well as in recent collections by McQueen, Vaquera and Ann Demeulemeester. And word spreads fast — according to Molly Rooyakkers, who runs the data-driven fashion Instagram account  @styleanalytics , global searches for “Hussar jacket” have increased 300% in October compared to the previous month.

The app will also show parents information about the topics teens are discussing with AI characters. The company said it’s building the controls now and users will start seeing them early next year.\n \n\n   \n  The move comes after Meta and the tech industry more broadly have grappled with criticisms from parents  and lawmakers  that online platforms aren’t doing enough to protect children online.\n \n\n   \n  Concerns have also been raised about whether people are relying on AI for emotional support and companionship. A wave of reports this year have indicated that some   people have endured emotional distress and isolated themselves from family members after developing  close relationships   with chatbots  like ChatGPT.\n \n\n   \n  Multiple lawsuits have been  filed against the company behind Character.AI , another popular app for chatting with AI personas, over allegations that the platform played a role in self-harm and suicide in teens. A lawsuit was also  filed against OpenAI  in August over allegations that ChatGPT contributed to the suicide of 16-year-old Adam Raine. And a  Wall Street Journal investigation  from April found that Meta’s chatbot and other AI chatbots on its platforms would engage in sexual conversations even with accounts identifying as minors.\n \n\n   \n  Meta said its AI characters “are designed not to engage” in conversations with teens about “self-harm, suicide, or disordered eating” or topics that “encourage, promote or enable” those subjects. Teens are also only able to chat with certain AI characters related to content like education and sports, the blog post said.\n \n\n   \n  Instagram’s new parental controls follow other updates the company has recently made to better protect teens. Earlier this week it adjusted its “Teen Accounts” settings to  line up with PG-13 ratings , meaning it won’t show or promote posts featuring strong language or those that could promote “harmful behaviors.” In late September, OpenAI announced parental controls for ChatGPT that reduce “graphic content, viral challenges, sexual, romantic or violent roleplay, and extreme beauty ideals.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/16/sport/football-ncaa-kansei-matsuzawa-japan-kicker","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"11:44:00.000-04:00","title":"The NFL hopeful from Japan who learned to kick on YouTube","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Kansei Matsuzawa, a 26-year-old footballer from Ichikawa, Japan, achieved a dramatic game-winning 38-yard field goal against Stanford in the NCAA college football season, becoming a symbol of resilience and self-education.

hopeful from Japan who learned to kick on YouTube \n       \n  By Patrick Snell, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:44 AM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  It started with a kick. Since then, Kansei Matsuzawa’s life has never been the same.\n \n\n   \n  The 26-year-old from Ichikawa, Japan, made global headlines on the opening weekend of the  NCAA college football  season after he nailed a 38-yarder as time expired to give the University of Hawaii a dramatic 23-20 victory over Stanford.\n \n\n   \n  It was rich reward for a young athlete who didn’t even know how to kick – or speak English – until he started watching YouTube videos.\n \n\n   \n  “It was one of the best moments in my life. D1 football in America and Japanese kid has big dream,” the young placekicker told  CNN Sports . “In the beginning, when I was in Japan, I had no coaches. So, I feel like I have to do it myself.\n \n\n   \n  “I used YouTube first. I was looking for an  NFL  player on YouTube. I would say (Seattle) Seahawks kicker Jason Myers. I’ve never met him before, but he actually texted me on Instagram after getting the winning field goal and that was amazing. I try to imitate the best of the best and that’s how I started.”\n \n\n   \n  In collegiate sports, the bond between player and coach is often enduringly strong – much more so than at the professional level.\n \n\n   \n  Thomas Sheffield is the Hawaii special teams coordinator who played a key role in bringing Matsuzawa to Honolulu and has nothing but respect and admiration for the life journey Matsuzawa – who has been given the nickname “ the Tokyo Toe ” – has undertaken.\n \n\n   \n  “Who teaches themself how to kick off YouTube? Who goes to America from a completely different country without speaking English and teaches himself basically how to speak English?” Sheffield told CNN Sports.\n \n\n   \n  “The word love is used a lot in our profession. I think that as a coach, if you really want to love your players, then you got to get to know your players on a personal level,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Matsuzawa was a stand-out  soccer  player as a teenager, but he failed an exam and didn’t go to college in Japan. His passion, joy and energy were gone. But everything changed when Matsuzawa’s parents offered their son a chance to visit the US.\n \n\n   \n  An  NFL  game between the Las Vegas Raiders and the Los Angeles Rams that he attended fueled his fire to one day return to America and pursue his dreams. It’s no wonder that winning kick against Stanford was so special for both player and coach alike.\n \n\n   \n  “I really wanted to win that game, especially like week zero. Visualization is really important. I was ready for a game-time field goal and a game-winning field goal. I’m telling myself I am elite. And then focus on myself as one of the biggest things,” Matsuzawa revealed.\n \n\n   \n  Sheffield added: “I was like crying like a baby, I just told him, ‘Man, your parents are here to see this.’ That was the coolest part for me was seeing somebody who works so hard and overcome so many battles and so much adversity to get to that moment. And there’s nobody that deserves it more than this kid because of the journey.”\n \n\n   \n  The Rainbow Warriors kicker has had to work hard for all he’s achieved in life so far and especially so when it comes to finances.\n \n\n   \n  Before moving to the US, he would wait tables back in Japan at his local steakhouse in Tokyo. At one point, he was even cutting his own hair to save money. He would upload clips of his kicking to his social media hoping somebody – somewhere – would take notice and give him a chance.\n \n\n   \n  Finally, a school in Nelsonville, Ohio, did and Matsuzawa credits the time he spent at Hocking College before his move to Hawaii as playing a significant role in greatly improving his English. And then there were huge, selfless sacrifices made by his parents, such as the trip the family took to the US.\n \n\n   \n  So just imagine the joy and elation he went through when he learned, at long last, he was to be awarded a scholarship at the University of Hawaii. It was a moment that would cause him to break down in tears.\n \n\n   \n  “That was amazing. I feel like it’s one of the toughest things to walk on to a scholarship in college football. It’s really tough, but (the) coaches believed in me. That moment is so amazing for me and my family,” Matsuzawa said.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re paying my tuition, paying my rent. It was tough for my family. My family moved to a different place, a cheaper house, to help.”\n \n\n   \n  The moment Matsuzawa – who’s majoring in sports management – learned he was getting a life-changing scholarship was actually witnessed first-hand by Sheffield himself.\n \n\n   \n  “I was the one recording it. I got to record it because I knew it was coming. It was one of the most rewarding things when you see a kid who just follows his dreams and meets his potential, and that we just get to play a small part of it. It gets you emotionally. It’s like watching your son achieve a big dream and a big goal and reaping the benefits of all the hard work,” Sheffield said.\n \n\n   \n  Matsuzawa says he’s inspired by his idol and compatriot: baseball superstar  Shohei Ohtani .\n \n\n   \n  “Like everyone, I’m just watching him on TV. But his mindset and his preparation are a different level, and if I want to be like him, I have got to have the same mindset and preparation to perform to the highest level.”\n \n\n   \n  And as for Matsuzawa’s future, it won’t surprise you to learn he’s already dreaming big, hoping one day he might even get to play in the  NFL . And if he does, he would become the first Japanese national ever to do so.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s a lot of dreams, but since day one, I’m going to NFL, win Super Bowl, play 10 years in the NFL – you know, big contract!”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/health/mpox-monkeypox-california","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"11:53:00-04:00","title":"California mpox cases raise concerns.

But health officials say the risk remains low \n       \n  By Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:53 AM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n   New York (AP)  – Two Californians diagnosed with mpox may be the first US cases resulting from the local spread of a different version of the virus, health officials said.\n \n\n   \n  The Long Beach Department of Health and Human Services this week confirmed the first case through testing at a state lab. Los Angeles County health officials on Thursday reported a second, similar case.\n \n\n   \n  The risk to the public is low, officials say.\n \n\n   \n  These are not the US first cases of what is known as clade I mpox. But all six previous cases were among international travelers who were believed to have been infected abroad.\n \n\n   \n  Both infected people in California were hospitalized, and they are now recovering at home. Officials declined to give other details. But “at this point in our investigations, we have not identified any association between the two cases,” Long Beach health department acting public affairs officer Jennifer Ann Gonzalez said.\n \n\n   \n  Long Beach is located in Los Angeles County but has its own city health department. Investigators there say they have not found a close contact who traveled abroad, nor have they confirmed additional cases. A few of the person’s close contacts have been given a vaccine, said Nora Balanji, the Long Beach department’s communicable disease coordinator.\n \n\n   \n  “We don’t have any proof that there has been ongoing community transmission,” she said. “It’s something we’re looking into. That’s something we’re concerned about.”\n \n\n   \n   Mpox  — also known as monkeypox — is a rare disease caused by infection with a virus that is in the same family as the one that causes smallpox. It is endemic in parts of Africa.\n \n\n   \n  Milder symptoms can include fever, chills and body aches. In more serious cases, people can develop lesions on the face, hands, chest and genitals.\n \n\n   \n  One version of the virus — called clade II — was the source of an international health crisis in 2022, when infections escalated in dozens of countries, mostly among men who have sex with men. At one point, the US  was averaging  close to 500 cases per day.\n \n\n   \n  The infections were rarely fatal, but many people suffered painful skin lesions for weeks. Those outbreaks waned  later that year , thanks in part to the Jynneos vaccine made by Bavarian Nordic.\n \n\n   \n  The other version — known as clade I — likewise can spread through sex, but also through other forms of contact. In Africa it has infected a broader range of people, including children.\n \n\n   \n  A newer form of the clade I virus has been widely transmitted in eastern and central Africa. The World Health Organization declared the situation a public health emergency, but last month it said the problem  had waned enough  that it was no longer an international emergency.\n \n\n   \n  Still, “it’s concerning if this virus has come here and now is starting to be transmitted from person to person,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University.\n \n\n   \n  The case report comes amid a federal government shutdown and the layoffs of hundreds of employees at the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — the agency that usually would be involved in responding.\n \n\n   \n  Balanji said a few CDC experts have been available to talk to her department about the situation. But Schaffner noted that “the longer the shutdown, the more impaired public health responses are to any outbreaks.”\n \n\n   \n  A US Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson referred questions to local health officials.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/us/no-kings-protests-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"17:00:00-17:00","title":"Another nationwide day of protest is set for this weekend.

Here’s what we know about ‘No Kings’ 2 \n       \n  By Lauren Mascarenhas, Josh Campbell, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:06 PM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As President Donald  Trump arrived at his military parade  in Washington, DC, this June to a 21-gun salute and members of the crowd singing “Happy Birthday,” about 5 million people across the country  took to the streets  to protest his administration. Now, amid an ongoing government shutdown and Trump’s push to deploy National Guard troops to American cities, millions are gearing up for round two.\n \n\n   \n  More than 2,500 demonstrations – about 450 more than were planned in June – across all 50 states are slated for Saturday in the second round of “ No Kings ” protests, which aim to broadly reject what organizers describe as Trump’s “authoritarian” agenda.\n \n\n   \n  Some Republican leaders have labeled the protests as anti-American. House Speaker Mike Johnson claimed, without evidence, that Saturday’s planned rallies have contributed to the ongoing government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  When the first round of “No Kings” protests took place, Trump had just barreled through the first five months of his second term with  hundreds of executive orders  and other moves targeting birthright citizenship, protections for transgender people, student protesters, federal diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and more.\n \n\n   \n  Tension over immigration raids reached a fever pitch with protests in Los Angeles, where Trump  federalized the California National Guard  against the wishes of Gov. Gavin Newsom – a move that experts warned was an  unprecedented and dangerous escalation  of presidential power.\n \n\n   \n  Over the summer, the administration has only “doubled down,” protest organizers say.\n \n\n   \n  ICE agents, under pressure to meet the administration’s  arrest quotas , have performed raids throughout the country, sometimes met with fervent protests by community members. Trump has called on the Justice Department to prosecute his political opponents, former FBI director  James Comey  and Attorney General of New York  Letitia James . The administration has challenged unflattering media coverage, resulting in a  defamation lawsuit  against The New York Times and the suspension (and eventual return) of “ Jimmy Kimmel Live! ”\n \n\n   \n  And the administration has escalated its  attempted deployment of federal troops  into Democratic-led cities, like DC, Memphis, Chicago and Portland.\n \n\n   \n  Local and state leaders have pushed back against the National Guard deployments, and legal battles are still playing out in court.\n \n\n   \n  Some Republican politicians have branded the upcoming protests as “Hate America” rallies. GOP Sen. Roger Marshall alleged “professional protesters” and “agitators” will show up, and Johnson suggested participants would be “pro-Hamas” and “Antifa people.”\n \n\n   \n  But organizers are planning for peaceful demonstrations aimed at providing a clear contrast to the administration’s recent show of force.\n \n\n   \n    Could the protests prompt more military force?\n \n\n   \n  “We’ll have to get the National Guard out,” Marshall recently said about Saturday’s protests. “Hopefully it’ll be peaceful. I doubt it.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the White House for comment on the possibility of National Guard deployment to Saturday’s protests.\n \n\n   \n  Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on Thursday directed the state’s National Guard to deploy troops to Austin ahead of a planned protest his office characterized as being “antifa-linked.”\n \n\n   \n  Texas Democrats were quick to condemn the move.\n \n\n   \n  “Sending armed soldiers to suppress peaceful protests is what kings and dictators do — and Greg Abbott just proved he’s one of them,” Texas House of Representatives Minority Leader Gene Wu said Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Indivisible Project, the nonprofit organizing the protest, has trained tens of thousands of people in safety and de-escalation, and organizers are working directly with cities that have   a National Guard presence to make sure they are prepared, its co-executive director, Leah Greenberg, said.\n \n\n   \n  In other areas, organizers have been working to educate protesters on their rights, in the event troops show up somewhere unexpected.\n \n\n   \n  “We do not expect there to be any need for the National Guard to be deployed, but if the Trump administration attempts to do that as a way to intimidate peaceful protests, we are prepared for that,” Deirdre Schifeling of the ACLU said Thursday at a meeting of protest organizers.\n \n\n   \n  “What we are expecting is millions of people around the country collectively showing up to oppose authoritarianism, corruption and attacks on our neighbors and our rights,” Greenberg told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The administration has already planned another celebratory military show of force in California set to take place on the same day of the protests,  Newsom  noted Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Organizers hope to build on the momentum of June’s protests and the  Hands Off!  and  50501  protests this spring. They’re confident the movement has grown steadily in response to the administration’s actions.\n \n\n   \n  For local leaders who have tried to push back against what they describe as federal overreach in their cities, Saturday may provide an opportunity to send a message.\n \n\n   \n  Boston Mayor Michelle Wu is set to headline the No Kings event in her city this Saturday. Following recent protest activity in Boston,  Trump threatened to pull the FIFA World Cup  out of Massachusetts next year, a move Wu says Trump does not have the authority to make.\n \n\n   \n  It’s possible the protests could prompt the administration to send more military force into cities, said Elizabeth Goitein, a senior director of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center for Justice.\n \n\n   \n  The memorandum Trump used to send the first round of federal troops into Los Angeles can be used to take similar action around the country, Goitein, an expert on presidential emergency powers, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “Under this memorandum, troops can be deployed if there are entirely peaceful protests,” she said, calling it “a direct attack on First Amendment freedoms.”\n \n\n   \n  And almost any violence on the part of individual protesters could end up bolstering the administration’s case for calling in troops, she said.\n \n\n   \n  “So might the administration use the protests this weekend as justification to deploy troops? It certainly looks that way,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  As for whether people will see troops on the ground in new locations as protests play out Saturday, Goitein noted that it takes some planning to mobilize troops and direct them to a particular location.\n \n\n   \n  “It can’t be done at the snap of anyone’s fingers, so if we were to see the military deployed at these protests, that means it was in the works beforehand,” she said.\n \n\n   \n    DHS advises local agencies to mitigate potential for violence\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of the “No Kings 2” protests, Department of Homeland Security officials are warning about the potential for certain events to become violent.\n \n\n   \n  In a DHS intelligence report sent to law enforcement agencies around the nation Thursday, and obtained by CNN, DHS said it is “concerned” about the potential for violence at the demonstrations, “based on several events in the United States in 2025.”\n \n\n   \n  “Throughout these events, we observed behavioral indicators associated with violence and geopolitical developments that have historically driven violence at similar events,” the agency said.\n \n\n   \n  The intelligence brief was meant to make law enforcement aware of indicators of possible violence at protests and ways to mitigate them in advance. It did not indicate that US national security officials were aware of any specific and credible threats, nor did it identify any planned protests by name.\n \n\n   \n  Particularly concerning behavior police should be on the lookout for includes the attendance of demonstrators “with a history of exploiting lawful protests to engage in violence” and demonstrators who have engaged in paramilitary-like training, according to DHS.\n \n\n   \n  Other potentially concerning behaviors included “protesters or counter-protesters engaging in harassing or intimidating behavior, which may escalate to physical violence,” and any indicators individuals may seek to distract and divert police away from an area where criminal activity is planned, the report said.\n \n\n   \n  In order to prevent and counter any possible violence, the intelligence report said law enforcement should communicate with mass transit agencies for awareness of increased travel to a particular area by people from outside the area, and consider limiting protests and counter protests to specific areas.\n \n\n   \n  DHS said law enforcement agencies should also proactively “establish liaisons with the protest organizers and counter-protest groups” and “clearly communicate legal parameters and guidelines to protest and counter-protest organizers so all parties understand the legal limits of activity before enforcement action is taken.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘A big tent’ protest effort\n \n\n   \n  As the government shutdown continues to threaten federal workers’ jobs and seeps into daily life, some Republican lawmakers have suggested that the protests are a distraction compounding the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Asked when the shutdown will end, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said this week, “There’s a thought out there that they’re at least waiting ‘til this crazy No Kings rally this weekend … No Kings equal no paychecks.”\n \n\n   \n  Greenberg called the criticism “transparently ridiculous,” saying the protests were planned in September, before the government shutdown, and are “a big tent effort” encompassing a range of political identities and viewpoints.\n \n\n   \n  Greenberg also pushed back against the idea that the protests are anti-American.\n \n\n   \n  “No Kings is about as American a value as you can imagine. It is as American as apple pie,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “My husband and I were at the flagship event in Philly in June – the birthplace of the nation, which is why we chose it, and we led the crowd in the Pledge of Allegiance,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  Greenberg co-founded the progressive grassroots network Indivisible with her husband Ezra Levin in 2016 in response to Trump’s first election. It’s grown to include thousands of local Indivisible groups, which function autonomously but coordinate with national staff.\n \n\n   \n  The  network encompasses  the nonprofits Indivisible Project and Indivisible Civics, which organize protests and trainings, and Indivisible Action, a separate political action committee aiming to elect progressive candidates.\n \n\n   \n  Greenberg said she’s aware that organizations like Indivisible that have taken a public stance against Trump may be targeted by the administration.\n \n\n   \n  After conservative activist Charlie Kirk’s death,  Indivisible joined more than 500 nonprofits  in an open letter condemning what the groups described as the use of government power to target liberal organizations and threaten First Amendment rights.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has recently taken aim at billionaire investor  George Soros  for funding “violent protests,” calling for racketeering charges against the philanthropist, and the White House has called Indivisible a “left-wing activist group” that has “received more than $7.6 million” from Soros.\n \n\n   \n  Soros’ long-running nonprofit,  Open Society Foundations , has provided millions in funding to Indivisible over the years, along with a vast number of predominantly left-leaning causes. Indivisible Project received almost  $8 million in contributions  from various sources in fiscal year 2023.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re heartily aware that there are ongoing efforts to kill organized opposition – to retaliate, to come after people who stand against Trump and his agenda,” Greenberg said. “We’re aware of those things, and also we believe that we have one path forward, which is to continue to exercise our constitutional rights.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5579509","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"16:04:00-04:00","title":"Masked Thieves Steal 'Priceless' Jewels from the Louvre Museum","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A brazen robbery at the Louvre Museum in Paris on Sunday, October 19, 2025, saw four masked men break into the Galerie d'Apollon through a second-floor window using a basket lift mounted on a truck.

 Monday is the deadline for a handful of universities to agree to  a list of commitments  that align with the Trump administration's political priorities, in exchange for preferential access to federal funds. The Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education was sent on Oct. 1 to nine colleges — both private and public — and would require schools to bar transgender people from using restrooms or playing in sports that align with their gender identities, freeze tuition for five years, limit international student enrollment, and require standardized tests for admissions, among other things. Of the original nine schools that received the document, as of Sunday night, six had indicated they are not planning on signing. MIT was the first school to issue a public statement: The document \"includes principles with which we disagree,\" MIT President Sally Kornbluth  wrote in a letter  to Education Secretary Linda McMahon on Oct. 10. \"And fundamentally the premise of the document is inconsistent with our core belief that scientific funding should be based on scientific merit alone.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Following that rejection,  President Trump wrote on Truth Social that all colleges would  be able to sign on, not just those that received the letter.

On Friday, the White House held a virtual meeting with colleges  that hadn't yet sent rejection  notices, including the University of Arizona, the University of Texas at Austin, Vanderbilt University, Dartmouth College and the University of Virginia. Three additional schools were also invited: Arizona State University, Washington University in St. Louis and the University of Kansas,  according to  The Wall Street Journal . \"Today's conversation with national higher education leaders is an important step toward defining a shared vision, and we look forward to continued discussions in the weeks ahead,\"  McMahon wrote on X after the meeting .

Dartmouth President Sian Leah Beilock said in a letter to students and faculty on Saturday that she did not think \"a compact — with any administration — is the right approach to achieve academic excellence.\" UVA said it wanted \"no special treatment\" when it comes to federal funding. \"A contractual arrangement predicating assessment on anything other than merit will undermine the integrity of vital, sometimes lifesaving, research and further erode confidence in American higher education,\"  wrote Paul Mahoney , the interim president of UVA. He said the university had provided the administration with comments and that the university agreed with many of the principles laid out in the compact. UVA's previous president  resigned this summer  under pressure from the Trump administration over the university's response to President Trump's order to end diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. The White House did not respond to a request for comment on Sunday on its plans for the compact going forward. An  automated emailed response  said there were staff shortages due to the government shutdown and blamed Democrats. Since Trump took office, the administration has canceled billions of dollars in federal research grants at many universities over a number of issues, including transgender policies, diversity, equity and inclusion programs, and antisemitism on campus. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5579554","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"18:00:00-20:00","title":"Israel strikes Gaza as both Israel and Hamas accuse each other of breaching ceasefire","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In October 2025, Israel launched a series of military strikes across Gaza, targeting Hamas infrastructure including weapons storage, firing posts, and tunnel shafts in response to attacks on Israeli troops in the Rafah area.

Hamas responded that it was not involved in any attacks and was committed to the ceasefire. Israel's military  said Sunday  that \"terrorists\" had attacked Israeli troops operating in the Rafah area with gunfire and an anti-tank missile. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \"directed that strong action be taken against terrorist targets in the Gaza Strip,\" his office said in a  post on X . Israel's military said it struck the area to respond to the attacks and also to dismantle tunnel shafts and other structures used by Hamas, calling the violence against its troops a \"blatant violation of the ceasefire agreement.\" The military  later said  that the strikes had targeted \"weapons storage facilities, firing posts, terrorist cells and additional Hamas terror infrastructure.\" Hamas said in a statement that it had been cut off from its remaining groups in the Rafah area and was \"unaware\" of any violence taking place there, and added that it remained fully committed to the ceasefire agreement, the  BBC reported .  Hamas official Izzat al-Rishq also  accused Israel  in a statement on Sunday of \"violating the deal and fabricating pretexts to justify its crimes.\" Hamas has been carrying out a deadly crackdown against rival militias and clans in Gaza, but it's unclear if Sunday's violence was connected to that. The  U.S. State Department said  Saturday that it had \"credible reports\" that Hamas was planning an attack against Palestinian civilians that would violate the terms of the ceasefire. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Israel's military said after the back-and-forth attacks on Sunday that it was resuming  \"enforcement\"  of the ceasefire.  The  Associated Press reported  that Israel had halted aid into Gaza following the attacks, but later decided to resume deliveries on Monday. Netanyahu  said in a statement  that two Israeli soldiers — Maj. Yaniv Kula and Staff-Sgt. Itay Ya'avetz — were killed in the clashes. One day earlier, an Israeli attack on a bus in Gaza City killed a family of 11 people returning to visit their ruined home, according to Gaza health authorities. The family included seven children, the youngest of whom was 5 years old. Israeli forces said the bus was beyond the yellow line Gazans have been warned not to cross, and that troops faced an \"imminent threat\" before firing a tank shell at the vehicle. Gaza's media office has accused Israel of violating the ceasefire agreement 80 times since it took effect,  Al Jazeera reported . The ceasefire agreement  brokered by the U.S. included the release of all of the remaining 20 living Israeli hostages held in Gaza following the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attacks more than two years ago. In exchange,  Israel released  nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Hamas has also  returned the bodies  of some Israeli hostages who died in Gaza. Israeli officials identified the bodies of two hostages returned from Gaza late Saturday as Ronen Engel and Sontaya Oakkharasri. Engel, 54 when he died, was killed while trying to protect his family during the Oct. 7 attacks. His wife and daughters were freed by Hamas that November. Oakkharasri was a Thai national who was also killed in the Oct. 7 attacks. Sixteen deceased Israeli hostages remain in Gaza, according to Israel's government. The Israeli government says 1,144 people  were killed  in the Oct. 7 attacks led by Hamas in 2023. In the two-year war that began in the wake of those attacks, Israeli forces have killed more than 68,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.

Then he lawyered up. \n         By Ximena Bustillo \n        \n           Sunday, October 19, 2025 • 7:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Samantha Surovtsev met her husband, Roman  Surovtsev , in 2017 while jet skiing. When they started dating, Surovtsev was honest about his past. He told her that he had come from the former Soviet Union as a refugee at the age of four. And that when he was a teenager, his green card was revoked after pleading guilty to carjacking and burglary charges in California. He explained that after being released from prison, in 2014, he spent time in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody while they tried — and failed — to deport him to Ukraine and Russia. Both countries, according to legal filings reviewed by NPR, could not provide or confirm Surovtsev's citizenship since he left before the fall of the Soviet Union. They couldn't give him the travel documents needed for deportation. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Since then, each year, Roman Surovtsev did a check-in with ICE. In the meantime, the Surovtsevs' lives followed the path of thousands of immigrants in the U.S. who are  considered stateless . They got married, had kids, and launched  a small commercial painting business in Texas . Then, one day in early August, what should have been a 10-minute errand at a kiosk at the Dallas ICE field office for one those regular check-ins turned into 30 minutes of waiting in the parking lot, \"praying that he wouldn't be detained,\" his wife told NPR. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"There were tears involved, just not knowing what was on the other side of that appointment,\" Samantha Surovtsev recalled. Then she got that call: \"I panicked. I panicked because it said, 'This is a call from a detainee.'\" Roman Surovtsev  joined the trend of others  who are detained at their regularly scheduled check-ins with ICE, to meet the administration's one-million-person annual deportation target. The \"human element\" What makes his case different is that his wife has marshalled a team of lawyers on his behalf. Unlike hundreds of others the Trump administration has vowed to deport as part of its mass deportation goal, Surovtsev has a chance to make his case in front of a judge. \"People need to understand that there's a human element involved with immigration, that every story is unique,\" his wife said. \"Every case deserves to be heard in front of a judge. This is not a black-and-white situation.\" According to the Surovtsevs' lawyers and court filings, ICE has been trying for a second time to deport Roman to Ukraine, which does not have the documentation to prove his citizenship and could draft him into armed conflict. In court filings, his lawyers argue his re-detention is unconstitutional since there's been no change to make it easier to deport him to his place of birth and that there is \"not a significant likelihood that Roman would be removed in the reasonably foreseeable future.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The absurdity of his situation was highlighted at the Bluebonnet Detention Center in Texas. The north Texas detention site,  which was over its population capacity this summer , also  housed Venezuelan migrants . Surovtsev was given deportation travel paperwork in Ukrainian, according to a court declaration from Zachery Hagerty, the deportation officer processing Surovtsev. Surovtsev, who is fluent in English, does not speak or read Ukrainian. In court filings, the Justice Department, which argues these cases on behalf of the government, said that the re-detention is legal because the agency has once again requested new travel documents from Ukraine. Hagerty in his declaration said he believes Surovtsev could at least be deported to a third country, if not Ukraine. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The Department of Homeland Security didn't respond to a request for comment about his specific case. In the meantime, his legal team has successfully vacated his carjacking criminal conviction, arguing that he was not informed of the consequences to his immigration status when he originally pleaded guilty as a teen. \"It's not a complex question. It's not a discretionary issue,\" said Eric Lee, a partner at the law firm Lee and Godshall-Bennett, one of the firms handling the case. \"He's going to get his green card back in a matter of time, which only makes it all the more callous and absurd that the administration continues to try and remove him to a country to which removal is effectively going to be a death sentence.\" Navigating due process In the more than two months that Surovtsev has been in detention, he has missed his wedding anniversary, his wife and daughter's birthdays and his mother's recent health issues. His wife, Samantha, has had to cancel about two months' worth of jobs for their painting business and their two employees are out of work. Every day, she told NPR, she turns down about five work leads, letting customers know that there is a family emergency. She has instead spent her time working with several attorneys across the country to vacate her husband's conviction, reinstate his green card and release him from detention. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Immigration advocates have argued that the Trump administration's rapid approach to increase arrests and removals reduces the limited due process immigrants get. That due process is in part to minimize the chances of mistakes and prevent someone from being removed when they may have valid claims to stay, they said. Lawyers say the Trump administration has taken steps to undermine due process. Earlier this year, the president said it wasn't possible for all the people he wants to remove to get a trial. Immigration officers have been told to make arrests in court, even as judges told immigrants to come back to their case. And the Homeland Security Department has mandated that immigrants be detained while undergoing their proceedings, with such detention as mandatory for those who entered without legal status. \"Yet there are lots of people in this situation. And there have been several habeas cases filed over the summer on very similar facts regarding re-detention,\" said Chris Godshall-Bennett, a constitutional and civil rights attorney and another of Surovtsev's lawyers, referring to the  legal avenue for people to claim their detention is unlawful . \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The process can be slow, and most people in immigration detention and in immigration court do not have legal representation to argue the particulars of their cases. Lee, the other attorney on Surovtsev's case, said this process shows that the government is trying again to do something it can't: deport Surovtsev to Ukraine. \"The danger here is not simply that people will be sent somewhere wrongly. The danger is that the government is going to do it on purpose in a way that disregards those protections,\" Godshall said. \"By disregarding those protections for a subset of individuals, it has opened the door to disregarding them. Period.\" \n         \n         Transcript \n         SCOTT SIMON, HOST:   The Trump administration wants to deport a million people a year and is placing tens of thousands in immigration detention. As part of the strategy, immigration officers are arresting and detaining those whom the government had previously tried and failed to deport. NPR's immigration policy reporter, Ximena Bustillo, has been following the case of one such detainee. XIMENA BUSTILLO, BYLINE: Samantha Surovtsev met her husband, Roman, in 2017, while jet skiing that summer when they started to date. SAMANTHA SUROVTSEV: He told me about his past and his convictions, and, of course, I had a lot of questions. BUSTILLO: When he was a teenager, Surovtsev pleaded guilty to carjacking charges. He spent a few years in prison, and the green card he had received after coming to the U.S. as a young refugee from the former Soviet Union was revoked. When he was released in 2014, he was handed to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. SUROVTSEV: He told me, around that time, that he had spent time in ICE detention. He was a stateless person and that he couldn't be deported anywhere but checks in every year. BUSTILLO: The Surovtsev's lives followed the path of thousands of immigrants in the U.S. who are considered stateless. They got married, had kids and launched a small commercial painting business in Texas. But after President Trump won the election and there were reports of immigrants being detained at their check-ins, the couple started to worry. SUROVTSEV: There was also fears about detention. Where would he be? How would I be able to contact him? Could I contact him? There were so many unknowns that I could barely function. I was just shaking, fearful, crying. And I'm trying to keep it together for my kids' sake so that they wouldn't know what was going on. It was really hard. BUSTILLO: The morning of the appointment, they arrived early. SUROVTSEV: He doesn't even check in with an officer anymore. He was downgraded to a kiosk because of his situation. It was just basically verifying your information and then walking out. But after about 10 minutes had passed, I knew something else was going on. BUSTILLO: Roman Surovtsev was detained that day at the Dallas ICE field office and eventually transferred to the Bluebonnet Detention Center in north Texas. His wife, Samantha, lawyered up. And since he was detained, lawyers have successfully vacated the carjacking conviction, setting Roman on a path to get his green card back. But they say ICE is still trying to deport him to Ukraine, a country that has not provided any travel documents to return him and is in active war with Russia. Here's Eric Lee, a partner at one of the law firms handling the case. ERIC LEE: He's going to get his green card back in a matter of time, which only makes it all the more callous and absurd that the administration continues to try and remove him to a country to which removal is effectively going to be a death sentence. BUSTILLO: Court filings reviewed by NPR showed that ICE tried to provide documentation to Roman, but in Ukrainian, a language he does not speak. Chris Godshall-Bennett, a constitutional and civil rights attorney on the case, said Surovtsev is not the only one detained after ICE had let them go. CHRIS GODSHALL-BENNETT: There are lots of people in this situation, and there have been several habeas cases filed over the summer on very similar facts, a re-detention. BUSTILLO: Habeas is the legal avenue for people to claim that their detention is unlawful. In court filings, ICE argues that he can be detained because they're trying to get the travel documents for Ukraine. In many ways, Surovtsev's case is unique. Not everyone has this level of legal representation, for example. But in other ways, his case highlights what his wife said every immigrant should have, the due process to argue that they should stay. Here is Samantha.

skipping the minivan \n         By Jacob Fenston \n        \n           Saturday, October 18, 2025 • 7:43 AM EDT \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Weekend Edition Saturday \n        \n      \n\n         If you live in any major city or suburb in the U.S., you may have noticed more and more parents hauling their kids around on bulky cargo bicycles. Some families are ditching their second car, forgoing a minivan, or going car-free altogether. Cargo bikes have been around for more than a century — and they're popular elsewhere on the globe. But until a few years ago, they were all but forgotten in North America. Now they're making a comeback. There are a few reasons behind the surge in cargo bike ridership, including better bicycle infrastructure, and bikes that are easy to ride, even if you're not an athlete. Lelac Almagor was not a biker before she bought her cargo bike. \"I'm a very lazy person,\" Almagor says. She thought she'd give the bike a try, and probably return it. \"But by the third day I was like, 'Oh, this is actually going to change my life,'\" says Almagor, who lives in Washington, D.C. Now she rides her three kids to school every day, even when it's pouring rain or hot and muggy. \"It's such a better start to my day, that now there's truly not weather that I would rather drive in,\" Almagor says. She bought the bike six years ago — back then, she'd see maybe one other cargo bike parent at school. Now there are dozens crowding the bike racks, not to mention the riders she sees heading to other schools. Almagor got so into cargo bikes, she left her teaching career and now works for a bike company. Bikes designed to carry kids Today's cargo bikes are designed specifically for transporting kids, with comfy seats and rain canopies, and, importantly, electric motors. Philip Koopman, a longtime D.C. bike shop owner, says there were no electric cargo bikes when his kids were young. He toted them around around the city in a trailer behind his bike, muscling up hills. \"Most people don't want to be sweaty when they get to work,\" Koopman says. \"So having these different options, it just makes cycling so much more attainable for so many more people.\" On a recent Saturday, Koopman was helping people test ride cargo bikes at the  DC Family Bike Fest . The event drew hundreds of parents, including Patricia Stamper, who was trying out different bikes with her two kids. \"I'm 39, I'm losing weight, I need some help,\" Stamper says. \"And this is cheaper than bariatric surgery, it's cheaper than Wegovy.\" The bike she's eyeing is pricey, at around $2,500. But she thinks it'll be worth it, to get some exercise, get her kids to school, ride to work and go shopping. While cargo bikes are expensive, riders point out they're much cheaper than cars, especially when you account for gas, insurance, parking and maintenance. Better bike infrastructure The first protected bike lane in the U.S. — separated from car traffic — was installed in 1967 in Davis, Calif. But it wasn't until 40 or 50 years later, in the 2000s, that other cities followed suit. Now such lanes can be found all over the country. Minneapolis is  often ranked  as the best cycling city in the nation, with more than 200 miles of bike lanes and trails. \"If it's not safe to ride a bike, it's going to be hard to get people on bikes,\" says Laura Mitchell, who lives in the city. Mitchell says getting a cargo bike was a \"game changer\" for her family. So, earlier this year, she started the Minneapolis Cargo Bike Library, where residents can check out a bike for free, to test it out, or for the occasional trip to a big box store. It's been so popular, she quickly had to cap the number of users. People aren't only biking with their kids in cities with great infrastructure. Unlike Minneapolis, Houston is often near the bottom of bike rankings.  Brian Jackson, who lives in Houston, frequently drops off his two kids by cargo bike. He's the only one at his school and daycare. He gets a lot of quizzical looks. \"A lot of people are like, 'I've never seen anything like it,'\" Jackson says. Jackson does see a few other cargo-bike parents on the bike trails, and he wishes more people would give it a try. He says Houston has a \"secret strong bike culture,\" and drivers usually give him plenty of space, especially when they see the kids on board. A second bicycle boom Since the very first bicycles, people jerry rigged them to carry cargo, including passengers. The heyday of the cargo bike — at least in North America and Europe — was about a century ago. Back then, cities were buzzing with workmen on bicycles. \"There'd be knife sharpeners with a little studio set up on the back of their bikes. There were glaziers — people who fixed broken windows,\" says Jody Rosen, author of the book  Two Wheels Good: The History and Mystery of the Bicycle . It all started with the Great Bicycle Boom of the 1890s. Rosen says now we're in a new, 21st century bicycle boom, and cargo bikes are part of it. Lelac Almagor, the D.C. cargo bike mom, says she thinks the biggest reason there are more people riding cargo bikes isn't the infrastructure or the e-bike technology. It's seeing other parents riding them. That makes it seem normal — just a practical way to get around with your kids. The very best advertisement for cargo biking, she says? The carpool line at school. \"When the car line is wrapping around the block, just gliding past in our little flotilla of cargo bikes. There's no way, as a parent, not to be like, 'maybe we should do that.'\" \n         \n         Transcript \n         SCOTT SIMON, HOST:   You may have noticed more parents hauling their children around on bulky bicycles. I mean, who needs a minivan? Cargo bikes have been around for more than a century, but until a few years ago, they were all but forgotten in North America. NPR's Jacob Fenston set out to learn why they're making a comeback. JACOB FENSTON, BYLINE: It's a school day morning, and Lelac Almagor is shuffling her kids out of the house in Washington, D.C. The 6-year-old is staying home sick. But the other two head for the bike. LELAC ALMAGOR: My kids are very, very slowly climbing into the bike, and soon - I hope - they're going to put their seat belts and helmets on so that we can go to school and be on time. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #1: Going as fast as I can. ALMAGOR: Well, whoever's first is going to get to pick the music. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #1: OK. FENSTON: Technically, it's a tricycle - two wheels in the front and, in between, a big wooden box where the kids sit. ALMAGOR: All right. You ready? FENSTON: She pilots through narrow bike lanes and then on a path next to the train tracks. Finally, she stops at a red light next to the school. Is this the carpool situation? ALMAGOR: Yeah. It lines up all the way around the block that way. (SOUNDBITE OF WHISTLE BLOWING) FENSTON: The carpool lane - parents sitting in cars and SUVs and gnarled traffic on a hectic four-lane road. (SOUNDBITE OF HORN HONKING) FENSTON: Almagor says this is the best advertisement for riding a cargo bike. ALMAGOR: On those first couple days of school, when the car line is, like, wrapping around the block, just, like, gliding past in our, like, little flotilla of cargo bikes, and it's like, there's no way not to - as a parent, not to be like, maybe you should do that. FENSTON: She bought her bike six years ago. Back then, she'd see maybe one other cargo bike parent at school. Now there are dozens. She got so into cargo bikes, she left her teaching career and now works for a bike company. There seem to be a few reasons for the surge in popularity. One is the bikes themselves - much easier to ride, even if you're not an athlete. PHILIP KOOPMAN: With your feet flat on the ground, not on the saddle. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: OK. KOOPMAN: And push forward, and the kickstand will pop up there. Just push ahead. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Push ahead. KOOPMAN: There you go. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: OK. FENSTON: Philip Koopman is a longtime bike shop owner in D.C. On a recent Saturday, he was helping people test ride cargo bikes at a family bike festival in the city. It drew hundreds of parents and kids. Koopman says, for serious cyclists, biking with kids is nothing new. KOOPMAN: My kids are 29 and 32. And there was, back then, no such thing as electric motors or cargo bikes. They spent thousands of miles in a Burley trailer. FENSTON: What's different now is the technology, bikes designed specifically for transporting kids with comfy seats and rain canopies and, importantly, electric motors. KOOPMAN: Most people don't feel comfortable or they don't want to have - you know, be sweaty when they get to work. So having these different options, it just makes cycling attainable for so many more people. FENSTON: People like Patricia Stamper (ph). She was at the festival with her two kids, trying out different bikes. PATRICIA STAMPER: I'm 39. I'm losing weight. I need some help. And, yeah - and this is cheaper than bariatric surgery. So I really appreciate it. And it's cheaper than Wegovy. FENSTON: Bike she's eyeing is pricey - $2,500. But she thinks it'll be worth it to get some exercise, get her kids to school, ride to work, go shopping. STAMPER: I live in a food desert. There's only, like, two grocery stores for 90,000 people. So I would like other options to be able to venture out in the city, and parking's atrocious. FENSTON: Another reason more people are riding cargo bikes - there's better bike infrastructure. The first protected bike lane in the U.S. - separated from car traffic - was installed in 1967 in Davis, California. But it wasn't until 40 or 50 years later, in the 2000s, that other cities followed suit. Now such protected lanes can be found all over the country. Laura Mitchell lives in Minneapolis, often ranked as the best cycling city in the U.S. LAURA MITCHELL: If it's not safe to ride a bike, it's going to be hard to get people on bikes. FENSTON: That's especially true for parents braving traffic with young kids. Mitchell says getting a cargo bike was a game changer for her family. So earlier this year, she started the Minneapolis Cargo Bike Library, where residents can check out a bike for free to test it out, or for the occasional trip to a big box store. It's been so popular, she quickly had to cap the number of users. MITCHELL: The demand has been much, much higher than we've been able to meet. FENSTON: But people aren't only biking with their kids in cities with great infrastructure. BRIAN JACKSON: I am Brian Jackson (ph), and I live in Houston. FENSTON: Jackson often drops off his kids by cargo bike. He's the only one at his school in daycare. He does see a few other cargo bike parents on the bike trails, and he wishes more people would give it a try. JACKSON: A lot of people are - have never seen anything like it. They're like, what on earth is that? They always ask, like, did you make that yourself? FENSTON: Since the very first bicycles, people jerry-rigged them to carry cargo, including passengers. The heyday of the cargo bike, at least in North America and Europe, was about a century ago. Jody Rosen is author of the book \"Two Wheels Good: The History And Mystery Of The Bicycle.\" He says cities back then were buzzing with workmen on bikes. JODY ROSEN: There'd be knife sharpeners with kind of, like, a little studio set up on the back of their bike. There were glazers, people who fixed, you know, broken windows. FENSTON: There were bakers bikes and butchers bikes, he says, mail bikes and milk bikes. It all started with the great bicycle boom of the 1890s. ROSEN: This is when bikes became much cheaper and widely adapted by regular old folks as a means of transportation. FENSTON: Now, he says, we're in a new 21st century bicycle boom, and cargo bikes are part of it. ALMAGOR: You know I have your backpack, right? UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #1: Oh, yeah. FENSTON: Back in D.C., Lelac Almagor says goodbye to her kids as they climb out of her trike. The 4-mile ride to school took about 20 minutes, probably faster than driving. ALMAGOR: Have a good day. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #2: That's really gross. FENSTON: She thinks the biggest reason there are more people riding cargo bikes isn't the infrastructure or the bike technology. It's seeing other parents riding them, whether it's school or the local park. Back when she bought her giant trike, she'd never actually seen one in real life. ALMAGOR: It was this, like, bizarre thing I had seen on the internet. I wasn't even sure if it was real or if it would come if I ordered it. Right? I think it's very different if every birthday party you go to has, like, 20 cargo bikes of all different shapes and sizes. FENSTON: That makes it seem normal, she says - just a practical way to get around with your kids.

But the situation facing one group of federal employees who are working without pay is difficult for lawmakers to overlook: The Capitol Police officers who protect them every day. The officers missed their first full paycheck Oct. 10th. \"They're asked to be everything to everybody,\" said Terry Gainer, a former Capitol Police chief. \"You need to be ready at the drop of a hat to take very aggressive enforcement action, but you also have to be a person who will welcome visitors and be a tour guide.\" Gainer says the job is tougher than ever, as public officials face growing threats and violence. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Gesturing toward two officers guarding the ornate Senate Reception Room, Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., says she feels for the force's more than 2,000 officers and that Democrats are to blame for the impasse. \"These men and women are paying the price,\" Britt said. \"It's absolutely selfish and ridiculous. It's heartbreaking. People have mortgages, they have families.\" Officer Gus Papathanasiou, the Capitol Police union chair, called on lawmakers last week to end the shutdown, writing in a statement that \"Banks and landlords do not give my officers a pass.\" Rep. Joe Morelle, D-N.Y., who sits on the House committee that oversees the force, says he has kept in touch with Papathanasiou and Capitol Police Chief Michael Sullivan. \"What I find really strange is that there doesn't seem to be any negotiation going on at all and yet we're walking among people who are directly impacted by this,\" Morelle said. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The Trump administration has signaled  plans to repurpose funds  to pay federal law enforcement during the shutdown, though Democrats have questioned the legality of the moves. \"I'm not unhappy with that result if it's the case,\" Morelle said. \"But I'm still mindful of the fact that what the president is talking about, whether it's military troops or law enforcement, it's patently illegal,\" he said. Morelle says the missed checks are not the only slight, saying officers felt stung when some GOP lawmakers did not oppose  President Trump's pardons of rioters  who attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6th. He notes a Jan. 6 memorial plaque honoring officers who defended the Capitol  is still uninstalled  on Capitol Hill, despite a federally-mandated deadline. \"We've always stood with Capitol police and law enforcement and we've shown that in word and deed,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told reporters last week. \"All of a sudden after all of these issues where they have been frankly insulting to members of the Capitol Police, now they're going to say, 'Oh well, we really care about them,\" Morelle said. Gainer, the former Capitol Police chief, said officers continue to do their jobs with professionalism, but each slight makes it more difficult to convince them that the long hours and personal risk are worth staying for. Last week, Rep. Nanette Barragán, D-Calif.,   briefly clashed with an officer  during a protest, prompting the Capitol Police union to demand an apology. Barragán said the officer grabbed her as she tried to enter Johnson's office. \"One of the skill sets we require of police officers is your ability to remember, because you're good witnesses,\" Gainer said. \"So your memory doesn't get erased, but what you try to do is reset the clock.\" Asked this week whether they were holding up during the shutdown, a group of officers said they were — \"for now.\" But one officer had an addendum to that assessment. \"Give it a month, maybe not,\" he said. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5560956","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Can collagen supplements improve your skin?

Here's what the research shows \n         By Maria Godoy \n        \n           Monday, October 20, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Morning Edition \n        \n      \n\n         The explorer Ponce de Leon famously went to Florida in search of the fountain of youth. But if you listen to social media influencers, he should probably have headed to the  supplement aisle  to pick up some collagen. \"I'm in my 40s and if I shave, I look like I'm in my mid-20s,\" a Tiktok creator who goes by Shop By Jake claims   in one paid promotion . \"People ask me all the time, what do you do for your skin? I take collagen,\" he says. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Claims about the health and beauty benefits of collagen supplements are commonplace these days, especially online. But does the evidence back the hype? The claim Collagen supplements can promote healthier skin, hair and nails, and stronger joints. The theory Collagen is the most  abundant protein in the body . It's found in skin, hair, nails, tendons, ligaments, cartilage and bones. It helps maintain our skin's elasticity and volume. It's a structural protein, so it gives strength and integrity to our tissues and keeps joints strong, among other things. But starting in our 20s, the amount and quality of the collagen our bodies produce declines. Factors lik e UV radiation,  smoking and exposure to  environmental pollutants  can speed up that decline. But it's going to happen with age regardless, which is why lots of people turn to collagen supplements. Collagen supplements generally come in two main forms.  Hydrolyzed collagen peptides  are basically collagen that's been broken down into smaller chains of amino acids to make them easier to absorb. They're derived from animal sources, such as fish, cattle, pigs or chicken. That's typically what's used in supplements aimed at improving skin and hair, as well as joint health.   \"The theory is that if you ingest [a collagen supplement,] it goes through the GI tract and gets absorbed and then it theoretically goes to places to support or increase collagen production,\" says  Dr. Lauren Taglia , a board-certified dermatologist with Northwestern Medicine in Naperville, Ill. The second main form of supplement is  undenatured, or native, type II collagen , which hasn't been broken down. It's derived from chickens. Most of the collagen found in cartilage is type II. These kinds of supplements are thought to promote joint health by triggering the immune system to produce chemical messengers that tamp down inflammation. So what does the research say? \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The evidence Let's start with skin. When it comes to skin health, there are studies that suggest collagen supplements work. \"There have been randomized controlled trials that have shown that after 8 to 12 weeks of collagen supplementation, things like depth of wrinkles, skin elasticity, dermal thickness seem to be improved,\" says  Dr. Maryanne Makredes Senna , an assistant professor of dermatology at Harvard Medical School. One  meta-analysis of 19 studies published in 2021  found that, compared with a placebo, people taking collagen supplements had better skin hydration, elasticity and improvements in wrinkles. A  second meta-analysis  was published this year. It looked at 23 randomized controlled trials with more than 1,400 patients who took collagen supplements for skin issues, and it also found significant improvements in those same areas after 90 days. But Senna says those findings came with a big caveat: The studies that found the biggest improvements were lower-quality and were funded by the supplement industry, she says. \"High-quality studies and studies not funded by industry did not show a significant association rate,\" Senna says. Given that, the state of the evidence when it comes to collagen supplements for skin is mixed at best, says dermatologist Lauren Taglia. \"As physician-scientists, we would love to see studies done on a large scale and done independently,\" she says. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       It's a similar story when it comes to collagen supplements for joint health. Studies have shown benefits — such as in  reducing pain from osteoarthritis .  But again, much of the research is industry funded, so it can be hard to disentangle potential bias, says  Dr. David Felson , an osteoarthritis researcher and professor at Boston University. One  systematic review  found that most of the studies of collagen supplements for rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis were too low quality to determine whether they really helped. Some studies included in that review reported adverse effects, such as an exacerbation of symptoms. \"With respect to collagen, I don't know what the right answer is,\" Felson says. It could potentially help, but \"there are no large scale studies here and there need to be,\" he says. The bottom line If it's healthier skin you're after, collagen supplements \"could be helpful, but there's not a ton of strong evidence to support them at this point,\" Taglia says. Your best bet is to focus on things that do have robust evidence behind them, says  Dr. Maya Jonas , an assistant professor of dermatology at the Ohio State University. That includes  wearing sunscreen and other sun protection  and using  vitamin A-based products like retinol , which have been clinically proven to stimulate collagen production. Keeping your skin moisturized is also important. Lifestyle factors matter too, Jonas says. She recommends a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, which provide antioxidants like vitamin C, and nuts and seeds, which are good sources of zinc and copper and help support collagen production. \"We always talk about diet, making sure patients are eating a healthy Mediterranean diet that's well-balanced, avoiding alcohol, not smoking and avoiding secondhand smoke,\" Jonas says. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       And  get plenty of sleep and exercise , adds Senna. Poor sleep and stress can  take a toll on skin , while exercise can improve blood flow to the skin and may  help counteract the loss of elasticity and dermal thickness  that comes with aging. That's not just good for skin, but overall health, too. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5579045","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"15:38:00-04:00","title":"2 Survivors of Suspected Drug Vessel Will Be Sent to Home Countries, Trump Says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump announced that two survivors of a U.S. military strike on a suspected drug-carrying submersible in the Caribbean have been repatriated to their home countries—Ecuador and Colombia—where they will face legal prosecution.

to Colombia amid clash over drug trade \n         By The Associated Press \n        \n           Monday, October 20, 2025 • 12:07 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         PALM BEACH, Fla. — The United States will slash assistance to Colombia and enact tariffs on its exports because the country's leader, Gustavo Petro, \"does nothing to stop\" drug production, President Donald Trump said Sunday, escalating the friction between Washington and one of its closest allies in Latin America. In a social media post, Trump referred to Petro as \"an illegal drug leader\" who is \"low rated and very unpopular.\" The Republican president warned that Petro \"better close up\" drug operations \"or the United States will close them up for him, and it won't be done nicely.\" Later in the day, Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that Colombia has \"no fight against drugs\" and \"they are a drug manufacturing machine\" with \"a lunatic\" for a president. He said that he would announce new tariffs on Monday. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth also announced the latest U.S. strike on a vessel that was allegedly carrying \"substantial amounts of narcotics.\" He said the vessel was associated with a Colombian rebel group — the National Liberation Army, or ELN — that has been in conflict with Petro's government. He did not provide any evidence for his assertions, but he shared a brief video clip of a boat engulfed in flames after an explosion on Friday. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Petro, who can be as vocal on social media as his American counterpart, rejected Trump's accusations and defended his work to fight narcotics in Colombia, the world's largest exporter of cocaine. \"Trying to promote peace in Colombia is not being a drug trafficker,\" Petro wrote. He suggested that Trump was being deceived by his advisers, described himself as \"the main enemy\" of drugs in his country and said Trump was being \"rude and ignorant toward Colombia.\" The Colombian Foreign Ministry described Trump's statement as a \"direct threat to national sovereignty by proposing an illegal intervention in Colombian territory.\" Defense Minister Pedro Sánchez told reporters that the country \"has used all its capability and also lost men and women fighting drug trafficking.\" Trump's latest broadside against Petro raises the possibility of an expanding clash in Latin America, where the U.S. has already increased pressure on neighboring Venezuela and its leader, Nicolás Maduro. American naval ships, fighter jets and drones are deployed in the region for what the administration has described as an \"armed conflict\" with drug cartels. Trump also authorized covert operations inside Venezuela. Unlike Venezuela, Colombia is a longtime U.S. ally and the top recipient of American assistance in the region. But coca cultivation reached an all-time high last year, according to the United Nations, and there has been fresh violence in rural areas where the government spent years battling insurgents before reaching a peace deal a decade ago. In September, the Trump administration accused Colombia of failing to cooperate in the drug war, although at the time Washington issued a waiver of sanctions that would have triggered aid cuts. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Colombia received an estimated $230 million in the U.S. budget year that ended Sept. 30, a drop from recent years that exceeded $700 million, according to U.S. figures. Petro, Colombia's first leftist president, has repeatedly feuded with Trump this year. Petro initially rejected U.S. military flights of deported migrants, leading Trump to threaten tariffs. The State Department said it would revoke Petro's visa when he attended the U.N. General Assembly in New York because he told American soldiers to disobey Trump's orders. Petro and Trump have also been at odds over American strikes on boats in the Caribbean. On Sunday, Petro accused the U.S. government of assassination, pointing to a Sept. 16 strike that he said killed a Colombian man named Alejandro Carranza. Petro said Carranza was a fisherman with no ties to drug trafficking, and his boat was malfunctioning when it was hit. \"The United States has invaded our national territory, fired a missile to kill a humble fisherman, and destroyed his family, his children. This is Bolívar's homeland, and they are murdering his children with bombs,\" Petro wrote on social media. He said that he asked his country's attorney general's office to initiate legal proceedings internationally and in U.S. courts. The White House and the Pentagon did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Petro's accusations. Despite Petro's criticism, his government plans to prosecute the Colombian survivor of a more recent U.S. strike on a submersible that was allegedly carrying drugs. Another survivor was repatriated to Ecuador, where the Ministry of the Interior said he would not face charges after prosecutors met with him and determined that he had not committed any crimes within the country's borders. The ELN, which Hegseth said was the target of Friday's strike, has long denied any role in drug trafficking and offered to submit to the scrutiny of an international commission. It did not respond to Hegseth's announcement. Colombian authorities regularly report the dismantling of cocaine laboratories and the seizure of drugs believed to belong to the guerrillas. There have been seven U.S. strikes in the region since early September that the administration says are targeting alleged drug traffickers. At least 32 people have been killed. Trump said Sunday that Petro had \"a fresh mouth toward America.\" He complained that drug smuggling continues \"despite large scale payments and subsidies from the USA that are nothing more than a long term rip off of America.\" \"AS OF TODAY, THESE PAYMENTS, OR ANY OTHER FORM OF PAYMENT, OR SUBSIDIES, WILL NO LONGER BE MADE TO COLOMBIA,\" he added. Elizabeth Dickinson, senior analyst for the Andes region at International Crisis Group, said \"it is befuddling and profoundly unwise of the United States to alienate its strongest military partner in Latin America at a moment when tension between Washington and Venezuela are at its highest point in recent years.\" She said Washington and Bogota have long treated their relationship as foundational, but \"that wisdom is being thrown out the window, with really catastrophic effects.\" Colombia lost significant U.S. funding when Trump slashed the U.S. Agency for International Development earlier this year. More cuts could affect military cooperation and undermine efforts to fight rebel groups. \"If that is cut, we will see a strategic loss of capability for the Colombian military and police at precisely the moment when they're confronting the greatest security crisis in Colombia for over a decade,\" she said. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5558173","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"09:21:00-04:00","title":"These voters want to overturn Missouri's new gerrymandered congressional map","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A grassroots movement in Missouri, led by volunteers like Leann Villaluz and the group People Not Politicians Missouri, is challenging the state’s newly gerrymandered congressional map, which targets long-time Democratic Representative Emanuel Cleaver II’s district in Kansas City.

     \n           Saturday, October 18, 2025 • 9:21 AM EDT \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Weekend Edition Sunday \n        \n      \n\n         KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Lately, on any given day, you'll find Leann Villaluz knocking on doors around Kansas City to get people to sign a petition that would let voters decide the fate of the state's new congressional map. \"There's a sense of resentment, even to regular voters who aren't as involved,\" Villaluz says. \"We have to pick up the slack for representatives who have been elected to do their simple duty and carry out the will of the voters. Instead, they think that we don't know what's best for ourselves.\" Missouri is the second state in the country, alongside Texas, to gerrymander its congressional map after President Donald Trump set off a  nationwide redistricting battle  in July to try to maintain control of the U.S. House in the 2026 midterms. Multiple other states, including North Carolina, Indiana, Florida, Ohio and Kansas could soon follow. California is trying to counter the Republican effort by  redistricting in favor of Democrats , if voters pass a constitutional amendment next month. Missouri's Republican Governor, Mike Kehoe, signed the new map into law late last month. The state had six Republicans and two Democrats in Congress, but the new plan targets longtime Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver II's seat in Kansas City. But with Villaluz and about 3,000 other volunteers, a group called People Not Politicians Missouri is working to overturn the state's new map. If they're successful in getting more than 106,000 signatures across the state by December 11, a referendum will go on the ballot in 2026 for voters to decide whether to want to keep or reject it. The group says it's already gathered more than 100,000 signatures and is still collecting more. If they get the signatures they need, the referendum would stall the map until voters weigh in next year. Villaluz says everyone she's spoken to has been excited to sign. She's visited five neighborhoods so far around Kansas City, which would be split into three Republican-leaning districts under the new map. Villaluz even took her petition to the recent  Chappell Roan concert  to get signatures. \"Just about anyone that stops and hears what the petition is about is ready and willing to sign,\" Villaluz says. \"Whatever your vote is, it's going to be diluted with the maps, and nobody wants that.\" Missouri attorney general and secretary of state fight back  Not only does People Not Politicians Missouri have to gather enough signatures, it also has to take on pushback from top state election officials. The state's Attorney General Catherine Hanaway  filed a lawsuit in federal court  arguing that a referendum on redistricting violates both the U.S. and Missouri constitutions. Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins did approve the group's referendum petition this week after  initially rejecting it . But in a press release, Hoskins claims that none of the signatures gathered before his approval date are valid. \"The process is clear,\" Hoskins said in the release. \"Every Missourian deserves confidence that ballot measures follow the law — not out-of-state agendas or confusion campaigns. Missouri values fairness and integrity, and this process reflects that.\" The executive director of People Not Politicians Missouri, Richard von Glahn, said in a statement that Hoskins is \"deliberately spreading misinformation for political purposes,\" and that, according to the state constitution, the group was allowed to begin gathering signatures before the secretary of state's approval. \"Our campaign has gathered signatures at a historic pace — I've never seen Missourians unite and mobilize this quickly,\" von Glahn said in the statement. \"We will not be intimidated or distracted. This referendum will qualify, and Missourians — not politicians — will decide the future of fair representation in our state.\" The  Democratic National Committee  has joined the referendum effort and is contributing more staff and money to the cause. A  slew of lawsuits  have also been filed challenging the new districts. A legal effort, too  Rebeca Amezcua-Hogan is one of the plaintiffs in a lawsuit that seeks to block Hoskins from using the map to hold a congressional primary or general election and argues mid-decade redistricting without a new census is unconstitutional. \"My own voting power would be watered down,\" Amezcua-Hogan says. \"I would feel like I'm not being represented. And I think that at least personally, for the issues that are close to my heart that I've been working on for years, it would be incredibly discouraging.\" Amezcua-Hogan is running as a progressive for the Kansas City Council. The area she wants to represent would be split into three different congressional districts if the new map holds. When she talks to voters for her campaign, Amezcua-Hogan is also gathering signatures for the referendum effort. She says Kansas City is already competing for federal resources and splitting it up into three districts will only make that more difficult. \"Kansas City is already at a point where we're dealing with lack of affordable housing, lack of mental health resources, lack of transportation,\" says Amezcua-Hogan. \"It already feels like we're fighting an uphill battle, and that uphill battle is only going to get worse.\" Most, but not all Republicans, are on board Missouri's new congressional map easily passed the Republican-dominated Missouri Legislature in its week-long special session. Michael Davis represents a suburb south of Kansas City and is one of the lawmakers who championed the new map. He's part of the state's Freedom Caucus, a group of Republican legislators who aim to push the party further to the right. Davis says Missourians elected Republican lawmakers because they trust them to do what they think is best with redistricting. \"We should send a conservative message to D.C.,\" Davis says. \"The best way to do that is by sending seven Republicans who are going to ensure that Republicans keep control of the U.S. House of Representatives.\" But 15 Republicans — including Jon Patterson, the speaker of the Missouri House — voted against the map in the state legislature. Nearly all of them are from parts of the state targeted by redistricting or in areas that would be moved into new districts. Republican state Rep. Bill Allen represents a part of Kansas City's northland that is evenly split between parties. He opposes mid-decade redistricting and said he was disappointed that Missouri seemed to follow Texas and Trump's lead in doing so. \"I think I heard from one or two constituents that wanted me to vote in favor, and almost every other one that I heard was in opposition,\" Allen says. \"The job of the representative is to represent the district, not the party, certainly not the president. Just the district that I represent, the 39,000 people. Their will is my responsibility.\" Villaluz says she plans to keep gathering signatures for the next two months, until the group finds out if it has done enough to put redistricting on the ballot and potentially reverse Missouri's gerrymandered map. \"I feel that Missouri is used as a guinea pig by the GOP,\" says Villaluz. \"They think that the average Missouri voter is dumber than we are, and they think that they can get away with a lot more here in a red flyover state, but that's not the case.\" Villaluz says voters across Missouri won't stand idly by, and she believes they'll get the last word. \n         \n         Transcript \n         DON GONYEA, HOST:   At least six states, most of them led by Republicans, are pressing ahead with plans to redraw congressional districts ahead of the 2026 midterms. But in one of those states - Missouri - there's growing opposition to the move, as Savannah Hawley-Bates with KCUR in Kansas City now reports. SAVANNAH HAWLEY-BATES, BYLINE: Thousands of volunteers with a group called People Not Politicians Missouri are part of an effort to overturn the state's new congressional map. LEANN VILLALUZ: I want my vote to count and continue to matter. HAWLEY-BATES: Leann Villaluz is one of them. VILLALUZ: If I'm not represented fairly in a map that's drawn fairly and that we voted on, that silence is my vote. HAWLEY-BATES: She's going door to door in Kansas City to get people to sign a petition that would let voters decide whether to keep the new congressional map. VILLALUZ: Hi. I'm Leann, and I'm going around to Jackson County voters to sign a petition to... HAWLEY-BATES: The group says it already has the more than 100,000 signatures needed to force a referendum and is still collecting more. But the state's top election official disagrees and says they started gathering signatures too early. That's sure to wind up in the courts. If the group is successful, the referendum would stall the map until voters weigh in next year. Right now six Republicans and two Democrats represent Missouri in the U.S. House. But the state's new plan, which Republican Governor Mike Kehoe signed into law late last month, decimates the Kansas City district of longtime Democrat U.S. Representative Emanuel Cleaver II. Here's Kehoe introducing the new map in August. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MIKE KEHOE: I appreciate President Donald Trump for raising the level of conversation on this matter. HAWLEY-BATES: The Democratic National Committee is contributing staff and money to the referendum effort, and there's been a slew of lawsuits to challenge the state's new map. Rebeca Amezcua-Hogan is a plaintiff in one of the lawsuits. REBECA AMEZCUA-HOGAN: Kansas City is already at a point where we're dealing with lack of affordable housing, lack of mental health resources, lack of transportation. HAWLEY-BATES: She's running as a progressive for the Kansas City Council. The area she wants to represent would be split into three different congressional districts if the new map holds. As she talks to voters for her campaign, she's also gathering signatures for the referendum effort. Amezcuz-Hogan says Kansas City is already competing for federal resources, and splitting it up into three districts will only make it more difficult. AMEZCUA-HOGAN: It would be incredibly discouraging because it already feels like we're fighting an uphill battle, and that uphill battle's only going to get worse. HAWLEY-BATES: The new congressional map easily passed the Missouri legislature, where Republicans have had a supermajority for years. Michael Davis is one of the lawmakers who championed the new map. MICHAEL DAVIS: We should send a conservative message to D.C. HAWLEY-BATES: Davis says Missourians elected Republican lawmakers because they trust them to do what they think is best with redistricting. DAVIS: The best way to do that is by sending seven Republicans who are going to ensure that Republicans keep control of the U.S. House of Representatives. HAWLEY-BATES: But 15 Republicans voted against the map in the state legislature. Nearly all of them are from parts of the state that would be most affected by redistricting. Bill Allen is one of those Republicans. He represents a district in north Kansas City that is split evenly between parties. BILL ALLEN: I think I heard from one or two constituents that wanted me to vote in favor, and almost every other one that I heard was in opposition. HAWLEY-BATES: Allen opposes mid-decade redistricting and was disappointed that Missouri followed Texas and Trump's lead by doing it. ALLEN: The job of the representative is to represent the district, not the party and certainly not the president. And their will is my responsibility. HAWLEY-BATES: Leann Villaluz, the volunteer, says she thinks voters will get the last word. VILLALUZ: Just about anyone who stops and hears what the petition is about is ready and willing to sign. Whatever your vote is, it's going to be diluted with the maps, and nobody wants that. HAWLEY-BATES: Villaluz plans to keep knocking doors for the next two months. That's when the group will find out if it's done enough to put redistricting on the ballot and potentially reverse Missouri's new congressional map.

At the start of October, Bournemouth men's soccer team hosted Fulham, London's oldest professional soccer team, for a tightly contested Premier League match. But although these two soccer teams might seem entirely English, they are both actually owned by Americans. And they are not alone: teams like Liverpool, Chelsea, and Manchester United, who have fans around the world, also now all have American owners. In fact,  more than half  of the 92 teams in the top four leagues in England and Wales have some American ownership, while Americans are also investing in teams in Scotland and across Europe. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"It's a much more affordable option into a high level of major sport,\" explains Jim Frevola, Bournemouth's president of business operations. Frevola moved from America to Bournemouth three years ago to help run the franchise for billionaire owner Bill Foley. Frevola compares the prices of British soccer teams to franchises in sports like the NFL and NBA in America. \"Teams are going for six, eight billion … where you could buy teams in the Premier League for a much more affordable opportunity,\" Frevola said. \"And, it's the best league in the world of the best sport in the world.\" Since moving to Bournemouth, Frevola has been struck by the passion of English soccer fans. \"I never thought sports was different… until I came over here,\" Frevola said. \"It wasn't until two, three months of living here did I realize that this is their life … this is what people live and breathe for. That's special. That's unique.\" Health care and real estate investor Kevin Nagle is the owner of Huddersfield, a third-tier team in Yorkshire, which he bought two years ago. \"I guess instead of saying the British are coming, we say the Americans are coming,\" Nagle joked. \"I purchased it outright in a really short period of time, sight unseen,\" he added. \"It wasn't until after the fact that I came to Huddersfield to see what it was like. And I was very, very happy.\" Nagle also owns a soccer team in California, Sacramento Republic. But like Jim Frevola, he says there's something special about the richness of British soccer history. \"It's just amazing when we see a lot of our fans, because their great, great, great-grandparents were watching the team play,\" Nagle says. \"Do we love our soccer in the U.S.? Yes. But do we have the traditions in the U.K.? Absolutely not.\"  The involvement of several U.S. celebrities has brought extra attention to British soccer teams. Actor Will Ferrell has invested in Leeds, rapper Snoop Dogg in Swansea, and basketball star LeBron James in Liverpool. Similarly, actor Michael B. Jordan has a stake in Bournemouth. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Some of the stars have made documentaries about their teams. First, Hollywood star Ryan Reynolds — who was born in Canada — and his fellow actor and producer Rob McElhenney made the documentary  Welcome to Wrexham  about their journey buying the Welsh franchise Wrexham, which is now in its fourth season. This year, ex-NFL player Tom Brady joined them with his documentary  Built in Birmingham , about becoming co-owner of Birmingham City Football Club. TV fiction has also boosted American interest in British soccer, particularly the  successful TV dramedy  Ted Lasso , about an American college football coach who is hired to manage a London soccer team. Starring Jason Sudeikis and Brett Goldstein, the show — which has won multiple Emmys — is set to release its fourth season next year. Christina Philippou, an associate professor in accounting and sport finance at the University of Portsmouth, said the celebrity involvement in many of the franchises can be attention-grabbing, it usually takes the form of a minority stake. \"They are able to effectively use their status to enhance the image of the club and help bring in more external income particularly around commercial partnerships,\" Philippou said. She explained that while English football has seen investment from Russia and the Gulf countries over the years, the new U.S. owners have made their teams more commercial, as well as boosting women's football teams at many British franchises. \"We've seen a little bit more investment in women's football within club level … part of [that] is American money because traditionally they've been more interested in women's football.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In the U.S., British soccer has a growing audience, with as many as 40 million fans, with many watching on CBS, says Ben Wright, chief commercial officer for the English Football League — which covers both England and Wales. Wright said interest in soccer in America grew noticeably during the pandemic. \"It felt like … because people couldn't go out and about globally, they were watching a lot more,\" Wright said. Meanwhile, Lionel Messi, the Argentinian who many consider the greatest soccer player of all time, plays for the American Major League Soccer team Inter Miami. On top of that, next summer's World Cup is being held jointly by the USA, Canada and Mexico, which experts hope will only grow the sport. Some soccer fans back in Britain fear that American owners might want to make changes to their league, such as playing league games in the USA. But Bournemouth's business manager Jim Frevola says that although he is aiming to grow his team's fan base back in the USA, there are no plans for major overhauls. \"I think there's maybe a misconception that American ownership wants to institute [big changes],\" Frevola said. \"I've heard crazy things like all-star games. That's never going to happen.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In a pub near Bournemouth's Vitality Stadium, most fans are in favor of their American owner Bill Foley. Supporter Ceri Morgan said that although the slightly increased ticket prices have been a drawback, the investment is clear to see. \"The stadium looks a lot smarter now and we're getting an increased capacity next season,\" he said. His fellow life-long fan Dom Webb agreed. \"It's been incredible. … We've got really solid foundations now, and it feels like the sky's the limit,\" he said. \n         \n         Transcript \n         SCOTT SIMON, HOST:   Snoop Dogg, Tom Brady, LeBron James, Will Ferrell and Ryan Reynolds have all invested in British soccer teams. They're part of a trend. Half of English Football League teams are now partly or wholly owned by Americans. Imagine. NPR's Robbie Griffiths went out to a game to find out why. (SOUNDBITE OF OCEAN WHOOSHING) ROBBIE GRIFFITHS, BYLINE: Nestled on Britain's south coast in the county of Dorset, Bournemouth is a quintessential English seaside town known for its sandy beach and fish and chips. (SOUNDBITE OF FOOTBALL CHANT) GRIFFITHS: Tonight, Bournemouth men's soccer team, known as The Cherries, are hosting Fulham, London's oldest professional club, in a tightly contested Premier League match. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: And your Cherries, AFC Bournemouth. GRIFFITHS: But there's a twist. Although these two soccer teams might seem as English as they come, they are both owned by Americans. And they are not alone. Teams like Liverpool, Chelsea and Manchester United, with fans around the world, all have American owners. JIM FREVOLA: It's a much more affordable option into a high level of major sport. GRIFFITHS: Jim Frevola is Bournemouth's president of business operations. He moved from America to Bournemouth three years ago to help run the club for billionaire owner Bill Foley. Frevola explains that it's more affordable for rich Americans to invest in smaller British soccer teams and work on growing them than to buy sports franchises back in the USA, comparing prices to the NFL and NBA. FREVOLA: Teams are going for $6 billion, $8 billion, where you could buy, you know, teams in the Premier League for a much more affordable opportunity. And it's the best league in the world of the best sports - the best sport in the world. GRIFFITHS: In fact, half of the 72 teams in the English Football League have some American ownership, and Americans are also investing in teams in Scotland and across Europe. There are so many U.S. owners of British soccer clubs that many of them are in a WhatsApp group where they compare notes. KEVIN NAGLE: Well, here's the thing. I guess instead of saying the British are coming, we say the Americans are coming. Right? GRIFFITHS: Health care and real estate investor Kevin Nagle is the owner of Huddersfield, a third-division team in Yorkshire. Nagel also owns a soccer team in Sacramento. But like Jim Frevola, he says there's something special about the richness of British soccer history. NAGLE: It's just amazing when we see a lot of our fans because their great, great, great grandparents, you know, were watching the team play. Do we love our soccer in the U.S.? Yes. But do we have the traditions in the U.K.? Absolutely not. GRIFFITHS: The involvement of several U.S. celebrities has brought extra attention to British soccer teams. Actor Will Ferrell has invested in Leeds, rapper Snoop Dogg in Swansea, and basketball player LeBron James in Liverpool. Some have even made TV shows about their teams. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"WELCOME TO WREXHAM\") RYAN REYNOLDS: (As self) To make a diamond, you have to have pressure. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ROB MCELHENNEY: (As self) What could possibly go wrong? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) CHANNING TATUM: (As self) I'm very much into this. (SOUNDBITE OF BELL) UNIDENTIFIED FANS: (Shouting) Yeah. REYNOLDS: (As himself) Football. MCELHENNEY: (As self) Football. GRIFFITHS: That's Hollywood star Ryan Reynolds and fellow actor and producer Rob McElhenney in their documentary about buying the Welsh franchise Wrexham. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"TED LASSO\") JASON SUDEIKIS: (As Ted Lasso) And all you fellas need to do is believe it. UNIDENTIFIED ACTORS: (As characters) Ooh. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) Coach, no. It's a sign. GRIFFITHS: TV fiction has also boosted American interest in British soccer. This is the hugely successful TV dramedy \"Ted Lasso,\" about an American college football coach who is hired to manage a London soccer team. But it's the real-world Americans - notably celebrities - who seem to be making the difference. CHRISTINA PHILIPPOU: They are able to effectively use their status to enhance the image of the club and help bring in more external income, particularly around commercial partnerships. GRIFFITHS: Christina Philippou, an associate professor in accounting and sports finance at the University of Portsmouth, said the celebrity involvement - usually a minority stake - helps with sponsorship. She explains that while English football has seen investment from Russians and the Gulf countries over the years, the new U.S. owners have made it more commercial, as well as making other changes. PHILIPPOU: We've seen a little bit more investment in women's football, as well, within club level. Part of it is American money because traditionally, they've been more interested in women's football as well. (CROSSTALK) GRIFFITHS: Back in a pub in Bournemouth, some soccer fans having a pint were worried that American investors would want to change their game somehow. But most, like life-long Bournemouth supporter Dom Webb, said they are happy. The U.S. owners have raised ticket prices, but are also upgrading the stadium and signing better players. DOM WEBB: It's been incredible. We've got really solid foundations now. And, like, it feels like the sky's the limit, really. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #2: Semenyo. (CHEERING) UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #2: The Cherries are heading to second in the Premier League. GRIFFITHS: In the driving English rain, Bournemouth come from behind to beat Fulham 3-1, and the crowd goes wild. Bournemouth supporters say as long as their team keeps winning, they will keep backing their American owners.

October 19, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         One of the biggest days of protest against the Trump administration's policies happened on Saturday in cities around the U.S. The overriding theme of the marches was the accusation that President Trump is behaving more like a monarch than an elected official. It marked the  second massive wave of protests  organized by No Kings — a network of progressive organizations fighting against Trump's agenda. Organizers said about 2,600 No Kings events were planned across nearly every state, and that it projected a bigger turnout than the 5 million it said attended its previous nationwide action in June. Energized by a slew of actions taken by the administration since the summer protests, the group cited widespread  immigration detentions  carried out by often-masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, the administration's aggressive slashing of federal  education resources  and  environmental protections ,  gerrymandering  and other concerns. Here's a recap of how the protests unfolded. 1. United in protests to 'protect America' Protesters showed up to oppose a wide range of issues, including the administration's immigration tactics and its push for federal and military intervention in Democratic-led states as a way to tackle crime. The diversity of concerns was strung together by the broader messaging of democracy, constitutional rights and the freedom the U.S. was founded on. In Washington, D.C., demonstrators filled Pennsylvania Avenue near the U.S. Capitol, many holding signs that read \"No Kings, No Tyrants.\" Many people wore yellow, a color organizers said is to show unity. Uriah Kitchen of Delaware, who attended the protest with his son Elijah, told NPR \"we made a pledge of allegiance when we were in school and this is what it's all about.\" \"This is why we're here, we're here to protect America,\" Kitchen said. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an Independent who caucuses with Democrats,  addressed D.C. protesters  in remarks slamming tech billionaires who he said have become richer and more powerful since Trump became president. Sanders singled out Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg \"and the other multibillionaires who were sitting right behind Trump when he was inaugurated.\" On the West Coast in San Pablo, Calif., Maria Floriano attended a No Kings event with immigration on her mind. Wearing a hat and shirt decorated with butterflies, she compared immigration to butterflies and said \"migration is beautiful\" and \"an act of courage.\" \"We want them to know that there are people fighting for them, that not everyone feels that they're not welcome here,\" Floriano said, noting the protest was held in a Bay Area community home to a large population of immigrants. 2. The Trump administration and Republican lawmakers weighed in House Speaker Mike Johnson slammed Saturday's protests as a \" hate America rally ,\" and other Republicans have derided the event as anti-American. Responding to NPR's questions about the protests, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said: \"Who cares?\" Trump was not at the White House during the protests but on a visit to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Connecticut House Republican Leader Vincent Candelora  told Connecticut Public  that he considered the \"No Kings\" messaging of the protests \"divisive.\" He also doesn't share protesters' concerns but supports their right to exercise their First Amendment rights. \"I think our democracy is still strong as ever — but, you know, they're free to express themselves,\" Candelora said. 3. Peaceful protesting with song and dance Despite the many criticisms that anti-Trump protesters came to preach, there were displays of optimism, hope and whimsy in several cities. Inspired by  protesters in Portland, Ore. , people in  Los Angeles ,  Hartford, Conn. , and elsewhere showed up to march in inflatable animal costumes. Song and dance broke out in  Salt Lake City  and other cities. As with the previous mass No Kings protests, revolutionary messaging showed up in demonstrators' clothing, chants and signs as protesters sought to remind people that America was founded in opposition to monarchy. In Macon, Ga., protesters belted  \"The Story of Tonight\" from the musical  Hamilton  — a song about the importance of sacrifice and solidarity today for the sake of freedom tomorrow. The protests were largely peaceful. Police in New York City and Washington, D.C., where rallies drew some of the day's biggest crowds, said no protest-related arrests were made. Republican Govs. Glenn Youngkin of Virginia and Greg Abbott of Texas mobilized their states' National Guards in preparation for the protests. \"The Governor has authorized state active duty for training to help ensure the Guard will be ready to respond if needed to help keep people safe,\" Youngkin spokesman Peter Finocchio wrote in a statement to  VPM .

You're likely becoming both a patient advocate and a medical coordinator — two jobs with steep learning curves. Here's what other caregivers have learned. The new normal: This isn't the life I planned. How do I adjust? Caregiving is now your new normal. But fully accepting and adjusting to this changed reality can take a while. Often, it comes in waves — periods of calm interrupted by wild turmoil.  Here are tips for enduring these times. Help! How to ask for (and accept) support The No. 1 piece of advice from other caregivers: Get help, whether from a support group, a friend, other family, a therapist, your church, or all of the above. Caregiving is too hard and too isolating to do it on your own. As one caregiver put it, most people start the job as if it were a sprint and only slowly realize they're in a marathon. Try these caregivers' tips for getting the help you need. Self-care: It's essential and it's not what you think  It's not spa days and yoga classes. Real self-care means learning how to protect your mental and physical health despite the crushing demands on your time. Often, that starts with setting boundaries and forgiving yourself.

2025 • 7:47 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         President Trump announced on Friday that he commuted the prison term of George Santos, the disgraced New York Republican who was sentenced to more than seven years in prison for a litany of crimes after he was expelled from the House over accusations that he stole money from campaign donors. Trump made the announcement in a post on Truth Social on Friday, saying he had signed a commutation to release Santos from prison immediately. Joseph Murray, one of Santos' lawyers,  told The Associated Press  that the former lawmaker was released from the Federal Correctional Institution in Fairton, N.J., around 11 p.m. Friday, and was greeted by his family. \"George Santos was somewhat of a 'rogue,' but there are many rogues throughout our Country that aren't forced to serve seven years in prison,\" Trump wrote. Santos, a fierce supporter of Trump, pleaded guilty in 2024 to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. Prosecutors said Santos was responsible for a \"mountain of lies, theft, and fraud\" aimed at enriching himself and deceiving campaign donors. He began his sentence in July of this year. Soon after Santos was elected in 2020, reports that he had fabricated numerous aspects of his identity began to trickle out. He later admitted to lying about his education, employment and his upbringing. Santos was still sworn into Congress in 2022 despite the inconsistencies raised about his background and campaign finances. His falsehoods would catch up with him less than a year after his term began. In 2023, the House voted 311-114  to remove him from office . Almost every Democrat and more than 100 Republicans voted to expel Santos. The vote made Santos just the sixth representative to ever be expelled from the chamber but the first to be expelled without being convicted of a crime. At the time of his expulsion, Santos  was facing 23 criminal charges . Trump compared Santos' crimes to claims made by Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., more than 15 years ago  about his military service . Blumenthal has previously admitted that he \"misspoke\" about serving in Vietnam. Blumenthal served six years in the Marine Reserve beginning in 1970, but none of that time was spent overseas. \"This is far worse than what George Santos did, and at least Santos had the Courage, Conviction, and Intelligence to ALWAYS VOTE REPUBLICAN!\" Trump wrote. So far during his second term, Trump has issued a slew of high-profile pardons and commutations. He issued a blanket pardon of  more than 1,500 people  charged with acts related to the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol. Former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich also received  a pardon  after he was convicted on a series of corruption-related crimes, including trying to sell a U.S. Senate seat vacated by former President Barack Obama. Trump commuted Blagojevich's 14-year prison sentence during his first term. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5580091","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"13:19:00-04:00","title":"Centrist Rodrigo Paz wins Bolivia's presidential runoff, topping right-wing rival","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Rodrigo Paz, a centrist senator and son of former president Jaime Paz Zamora, has won Bolivia’s presidential runoff election with 54% of the vote, defeating right-wing candidate Jorge 'Tuto' Quiroga.

\n           Monday, October 20, 2025 • 1:19 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         LA PAZ, Bolivia  — Rodrigo Paz, a centrist senator who was never a nationally prominent figure until now, won Bolivia's presidential election on Sunday, preliminary results showed, galvanizing voters outraged by the country's economic crisis and frustrated after 20 years of rule by the Movement Toward Socialism party. \"The trend is irreversible,\" Óscar Hassenteufel, the president of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal, said of Paz's lead over his rival, former right-wing President Jorge \"Tuto\" Quiroga. Paz won 54% of the votes, early results showed, versus Quiroga's 45%. Paz took the podium Sunday night flanked by his wife, María Helena Urquidi, and four adult children. The hotel ballroom in Bolivia's capital of La Paz went wild, with people shouting his name and holding phones aloft. \"Today, Bolivia can be certain that this will be a government that will bring solutions,\" he told supporters. \"Bolivia breathes winds of change and renewal to move forward.\" Shortly after the results came in, Quiroga conceded to Paz. \"I've called Rodrigo Paz and wished him congratulations,\" he said in a somber speech, prompting jeers and cries of fraud from the audience. But Quiroga urged calm, saying that a refusal to recognize the results would \"leave the country hanging.\" \"We'd just exacerbate the problems of people suffering from the crisis,\" he said. \"We need a mature attitude right now.\" Paz and his popular running mate, ex-police Capt. Edman Lara, gained traction among working-class and rural voters disillusioned with the unbridled spending of the long-ruling Movement Toward Socialism, or MAS, party but wary of Quiroga's radical 180-degree turn away from its social protections. Quiroga's embrace of the International Monetary Fund — an organization that has long aroused political resentment in Bolivia — for a shock treatment package of the kind Bolivians came to know and fear in the 1990s also alienated more moderate voters. Paz's victory sets this South American nation of 12 million on a sharply uncertain path as he seeks to enact major change for the first time since the 2005 election of Evo Morales, the founder of MAS and Bolivia's first Indigenous president. Although Paz's Christian Democratic Party has the cushion of a slight majority in Congress, he'll still need to compromise to push through an ambitious overhaul. Paz plans to end Bolivia's fixed exchange rate, phase out generous fuel subsidies and reduce hefty public investment, redrawing much of the MAS economic model that dominated for two decades. But he says he'll maintain MAS-style benefits and take a gradual approach to free-market reforms, in hopes of avoiding a sharp recession or jump in inflation that would enrage the masses — as has happened before in Bolivia. Morales' effort to lift fuel subsidies in 2011 lasted less than a week as protests engulfed the country. Paz inherits an economy in shambles Paz's supporters erupted into raucous cheers and ran into the streets of La Paz, setting off fireworks and honking car horns. Crowds thronged a hotel downtown where Paz spoke, some shouting, \"The people, united, will never be defeated!\" \"We feel victorious,\" Roger Carrillo, a volunteer with Paz's party, said by phone from eastern Bolivia, where he was rallying a celebratory caravan. \"We know there is work ahead of us but we just want to enjoy this moment.\" Behind the celebrations, Bolivia faces an uphill battle. Since 2023, the Andean nation has been crippled by a shortage of U.S. dollars that has locked Bolivians out of their own savings and hampered imports. Year-on-year inflation soared to 23% last month, the highest rate since 1991. Fuel shortages paralyze the country, with motorists often waiting days in line to fill up their tanks. To make it through even his first months, Paz must replenish the country's meager foreign currency reserves and get fuel imports flowing. Vowing to avoid the IMF, Paz has pledged to scrape together the necessary cash by fighting corruption, reducing wasteful spending and restoring enough confidence in the country's currency to lure U.S. dollar savings out from under Bolivians' mattresses and into the banking system. But Paz's stated reluctance to slam on the fiscal brakes — with promises of cash handouts for the poor to cushion the blow of subsidy cuts — has led to criticism. \"It's just so vague, I feel like he's saying these things to please voters when fiscally it doesn't add up,\" said 48-year-old Rodrigo Tribeño, who voted for Quiroga on Sunday. \"We needed a real change.\" An outsider with political experience Although Paz, the son of former President Jaime Paz Zamora, who was in office from 1989 to 1993, has spent more than two decades in politics as a lawmaker and mayor, he appeared in this race as a political unknown. The senator rose unexpectedly from the bottom of the polls to a first-place finish in the August vote. His party swept six of nine regional departments in the country, including the Andean highlands of western Bolivia and the large, coca-producing region of Cochabamba, winning over key swaths of Indigenous Aymara and working-class Bolivians that once comprised Morales' base. Paz's slogan of \"capitalism for all\" appealed to many merchants and entrepreneurs who flourished in Morales' heyday but later chafed against his high taxes and regulation. Quiroga, by contrast, carried the wealthier eastern lowlands of Santa Cruz, known as the country's agricultural engine. \"There's a very clear class difference. For Quiroga, you have people who've been in politics and in the economic elite for a long time — businesspeople, agro-industrialists,\" said Verónica Rocha, a Bolivian political analyst. \"With Paz, it's the opposite.\" An ex-cop shakes up the race The race looked to be a staid affair until Paz surprised everyone by picking Lara as his running mate. The charismatic young ex-policeman had zero political experience but gained fame on TikTok after being fired from the police for denouncing corruption in viral videos. Out of work, he sold second-hand clothes to get by and worked as a lawyer helping Bolivians come forward about corruption — a story that resonated with many former MAS supporters. Lara's fiery, populist promises of universal income for women and higher pensions for retirees frequently forced Paz into damage control, causing tension on the campaign trail. But for those who see Lara as divisive and hot-headed, there are plenty of Bolivians who say those traits connote authenticity in comparison to the other scripted, telegenic candidates. Lara struck an unusually conciliatory tone in his remarks after winning Sunday. \"It's time to unite, it's time to reconcile,\" Lara told supporters after learning of his win, taking a more conciliatory tone than usual. \"Political divisions are over.\" Many Bolivians interviewed Sunday said they voted for Lara as if he were at the top of the ticket. \"Lara is the one acting more like a president than Paz. Many of us think Lara will end up running the country,\" said Wendy Cornejo, 28, a former Morales supporter selling crackers in downtown La Paz. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-10-19-2025-f3d95cf76018541ff824853d1bcd3356","dateOfPublication":"2023-10-12","timeOfPublication":"20:30:00Z","title":"Supreme Court Ruling on Voting Rights Act Enforcement Sparks National Debate","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Supreme Court has issued a landmark decision declaring the administration of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 unlawful, ordering the federal government to withdraw its enforcement actions.

U.S. President Donald Trump said the ceasefire remained in place and “we want to make sure it’s going to be very peaceful.” He told reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday that Hamas has been “quite rambunctious” and “they’ve been doing some shooting.” He suggested that the violence might be the fault of “rebels” within the organization rather than its leadership.  “It’s going to be handled toughly but properly,” he said. Trump did not say whether he thought the Israeli strikes were justified, saying “it’s under review.” \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 A father returns from Israeli detention to find Gaza and his family shattered \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Israel says Hamas hands over ‘2 coffins of deceased hostages’ from Gaza \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 UK sees lessons from Northern Ireland that could aid the fragile Gaza ceasefire process \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n Vice President JD Vance said Sunday that he may visit Israel in the coming days.  “We’re trying to figure it out,” he told reporters, saying the administration wants to “go and check on how things are going.” Regarding the ceasefire, he said that “there’s going to be fits and starts.” \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n Health officials said at least 36 Palestinians were killed across Gaza, including children.

Both were believed to have been killed during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which sparked the war. Engel’s wife, Karina, and two of his three children were kidnapped and released in a November 2023 ceasefire. Hamas in the past week has handed over the remains of 12 hostages. Its armed wing, the Qassam Brigades, said it found the body of another hostage and would return it Sunday “if circumstances in the field” allowed. It warned that any escalation by Israel would hamper search efforts. Israel on Saturday pressed Hamas to fulfill its ceasefire role of returning the remains of all 28  deceased hostages , saying the  Rafah border crossing  between Gaza and Egypt would stay closed “until further notice.” It was the only crossing not controlled by Israel before the war. Hamas says the war’s devastation and Israeli military control of certain areas have slowed the handover. Israel believes Hamas has access to more bodies than it has returned. Israel has released 150 bodies of Palestinians back to Gaza, including 15 on Sunday, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. Israel has neither identified the bodies nor said how they died. The ministry posts photos of bodies on its website to help families attempting to locate loved ones. Some are decomposed and blackened.

The next stages are expected to focus on disarming Hamas, Israeli withdrawal from additional areas it controls in Gaza, and future governance of the devastated territory. The U.S. plan proposes the establishment of an internationally backed authority. Hamas spokesman Hazem Kassem said late Saturday that the group has begun discussions to “solidify its positions.” He reiterated that Hamas won’t be part of the ruling authority in a postwar Gaza, and called for the prompt establishment of a body of Palestinian technocrats to run day-to-day affairs. For now, “government agencies in Gaza continue to perform their duties, as the (power) vacuum is very dangerous,” he said. The Israel-Hamas war has killed more than 68,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which doesn’t distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count. The ministry maintains detailed casualty records that are  seen as generally reliable  by U.N. agencies and independent experts. Israel has disputed them without providing its own toll. Thousands more people are missing, according to the Red Cross. Hamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251 people in the attack that sparked the war. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

Pickleball eye injuries are on the rise \n         By Arundathi Nair  \n        \n           Sunday, October 19, 2025 • 7:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Pickleball has quickly become huge in the United States, with  nearly 20 million  people playing the sport. But that popularity comes with a price. With more people on the court, pickleball-related eye injuries, including lacerations around the eye, corneal abrasions and inflamed irises, have increased. A  study  published this week in  JAMA Ophthalmology  estimates that the incidence of these injuries has risen dramatically, going up by an estimated 405 cases each year from 2021 to 2024. Researchers looked at data from a representative population of patients in emergency departments across the U.S. to understand which pickleball players are especially vulnerable to eye injuries and how they occurred. From there, they estimated what those trends looked like on a national scale. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Given the \"alarming\" increase in eye injury cases, the study authors called for developing standardized guidelines for eye protection, which has been found to reduce up to  90% of sports-related  eye injuries. Other sports such as squash have mandated such guidelines. The study found that 70% of cases were in adults 50 years or older. Dr. Natasha Desai, the co-director for the Center for Women's Sports Medicine at NYU Langone, was surprised to see this finding because a large share of  sports-related injuries  occur in young players. Desai, who wasn't involved in this study, doesn't think the sport is necessarily getting more dangerous. \"More people are playing, so there's going to be more injuries at a higher volume,\" she says. And there are a lot of ways you can get injured in pickleball, notes Dr. Corey Lacher, an ophthalmologist resident at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School and the paper's lead author, including getting hit by the ball, a paddle or by falling. \"A lot of people think that just because it's a wiffle ball that you're not going to get hurt,\" he says. But, it's still risky because \"everything is very fast-paced in pickleball and you're playing on a very small court.\" However, getting players to wear eye protection is easier said than done, as Desai points out. It's another piece of equipment players have to purchase and bring with them. And with so many options on the market, choosing a pair can be daunting. Players would benefit from standardized eye protection guidelines for pickleball, says Lacher. \"There's $10 pickleball eye protection and there's $160. How do you know which one to buy?\" If you're shopping for eyewear, Lacher and Desai recommend products made of shatter-resistant polycarbonate and those that meet the American Society for Testing and Materials's  F3164 standard . Dr. Daniel Henick, an ophthalmology resident at Yale School of Medicine and an avid pickleball player, has  been researching  which groups of players are wearing eye protection and why the rest aren't. He says one of the most common reasons players don't use protective eyewear is that they aren't aware of the risks. Henick says that having standardized guidelines, posting them outside of courts for players to see, making eye-protection more user-friendly, and encouraging professional pickleball athletes to set an example for the influx of new players could help reduce injuries. The paper points out its limitations are having a small sample size and relying on a database that only includes emergency departments that opt in to the data collection.

   \n           Thursday, October 16, 2025 • 3:52 PM EDT \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         The Trump administration is making it harder to pass the oral exam required for immigrants seeking naturalization as U.S. citizens.   The new test is also longer. Green card holders who file for citizenship after Oct. 20 will have to answer twice as many questions correctly during the civics interview that tests their knowledge of U.S. history, politics and government and that is one of the final steps in the naturalization process. The list of possible questions will also get longer and include more difficult questions. A spokesman for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), Matthew Tragesser, said in  a statement  when the changes were announced recently that the new test will ensure \"that those joining us as fellow citizens are fully assimilated and will contribute to America's greatness.\" It's just one of several changes the Trump administration has instituted to make citizenship harder to earn as it seeks more broadly to limit the ability of immigrants and visa holders to enter, remain or settle in the U.S. The citizenship test that USCIS has used  since 2008  requires applicants to answer six questions correctly out of 10. The  new test  will require 12 correct answers out of 20. The list of possible questions the agent chooses from will grow from 100 to 128, and many will be more difficult. Questions about U.S. holidays and geography and others with short answers – \"What ocean is on the West Coast of the United States?\" – are being reduced or eliminated, and replaced with tougher ones: \"Why did the United States enter the Persian Gulf War?\" (Answer, according to the study guide: \"To force the Iraqi military from Kuwait.\") Another new question: Why did the United States enter the Vietnam War? (Answer, according to the study guide: \"To stop the spread of communism.\") Aside from the tougher civics test, applicants for citizenship will also have to convince an immigration officer that they have \"good moral character.\" Until now, the absence of bad behavior or criminal conduct on an applicant's record has been enough. Now, they'll need to submit evidence of their \"positive contributions to American society.\" Immigration officers will also more rigorously check applicants' backgrounds, possibly interviewing co-workers, family members or neighbors. Advocates who help people prepare for the citizenship test say the changes present more obstacles in an already challenging and cumbersome process. \"It's hard to imagine that these changes don't have a negative impact on the number of people who are able to continue the naturalization process,\" said Julie Mitchell, legal director of the Central American Resource Center in Los Angeles, which offers citizenship courses. \"Particularly considering that these changes will impact individuals with low literacy levels and those who don't have access to classes and preparation materials.\" She said the naturalization process could also become more uncertain, because it's unclear what standards immigration officers will use to assess \"good moral character.\" Speaking in Washington  last month , USCIS Director Joseph Edlow said that the current test is \"just too easy\" because some questions require simple answers, like naming the governor of an applicant's home state, or two federal holidays. \"We need to know more,\" Edlow said. \"Especially if we're going to really understand whether someone has a true attachment to the Constitution as required by the statute.\" But Amanda Frost, a professor of immigration law at the University of Virginia and the author of  You Are Not American , a book about the history of citizenship stripping, said that while requiring applicants for citizenship to jump over hurdles is appropriate, there's no proof that the existing naturalization process is falling short. \"Has there been any evidence that we're allowing people to naturalize who don't share our values, and don't make for good participants in our democracy?\" Frost asked. \"I don't see any evidence of that.\" She notes that nearly  half of all Fortune 500  companies were founded by immigrants or their children. \"Those who naturalize, and their children, thrive in the United States, and have benefited this country,\" Frost said. \n         \n         Transcript \n         MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:   The Trump administration is making it harder for immigrants to become naturalized U.S. citizens. Starting next week, it is rolling out changes to the civics test that candidates for citizenship are required to pass. This is one of several changes the administration says are aimed at making sure new U.S. citizens are - in its words - fully assimilated. We're joined now by NPR's Adrian Florido. And Adrian, just explain the process here. The civics test is the last - one of the last steps in the naturalization process. Applicants go into an immigration office. They get asked a bunch of questions by the agent. If they pass, they usually earn their citizenship. And that process is not changing, right? ADRIAN FLORIDO, BYLINE: That's right, Mary Louise. That process is staying the same. What is changing is that applicants will now have to answer more questions correctly to pass that test. So with the current test, they have to get right 6 out of 10 questions that the agent asks them. They'll now have to get twice as many right - 12 out of up to 20 possible questions. And the list of possible questions that they will have to study from is also going to get quite a lot longer, so there'll be a lot more answers to memorize before you go in for the test. Citizenship and Immigration Services, USCIS, is also eliminating what are seen as easier questions on this test - so those about geography. For example, what ocean is on the West Coast of the U.S.? That question is out, and it's being replaced with questions like, why did the U.S. enter the Persian Gulf War? The right answer, according to the government, is - was to force the Iraqi military from Kuwait. The idea, Mary Louise, is to make this test harder to pass. KELLY: And why do this? Why does the Trump administration say these changes are needed? FLORIDO: Well, USCIS has said that they're about restoring, quote, \"integrity\" to the naturalization process. They're saying that the test is too easy. But these changes also reflect broader principles that President Trump has embraced about, you know, what it means to be a good American. A USCIS spokesman said in a statement that U.S. citizenship should only be for people who, quote, \"fully embrace our values and principles as a nation.\" And he said that this new test will ensure that new citizens are, quote, \"fully assimilated and will contribute to America's greatness.\" The naturalization process is also changing in other ways, Mary Louise. USCIS is requiring applicants to prove that they are of, quote, \"good moral character\" by providing evidence of positive contributions that they've made to the U.S. And immigration officers are also going to do more rigorous background checks on applicants, including possibly interviewing their coworkers, neighbors or family members. KELLY: So go back to something we just heard in that statement from the immigration official - the term fully assimilated. What does that mean? FLORIDO: You know, it's not new that the naturalization process requires a certain amount of integration, or you might say assimilation, into U.S. society. Most applicants have to speak English well enough to answer questions about U.S. history and government, for example. But the government is now saying that the bar is too low. I asked University of Virginia law professor Amanda Frost, who wrote a book about citizenship called \"You Are Not American\" - I asked her for her take on that claim. AMANDA FROST: Has there been any evidence that we have held that standard too low - that we're allowing people to naturalize who don't share values, don't make for good participants in our democracy and our society? And I would say I don't see any evidence of that. Those that naturalize and their children thrive in the United States and have benefited this country. KELLY: Well, so Adrian, what are the possible consequences of these changes? FLORIDO: Well, it's becoming harder to earn U.S. citizenship. And one big question about these questions, Mary Louise, is whether they'll drive down naturalization rates. And it's going to take some time to answer that question, but it's something that folks who help people through the citizenship process worry could happen. KELLY: That's NPR's Adrian Florido. Thank you, Adrian. FLORIDO: Thank you, Mary Louise. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/china-us-cyberattacks-allegations-time-b3408ed2352c113904350f80e505ab9f","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"07:53:40+00:00","title":"China Accuses U.S. National Security Agency of Cyberattacks on National Time Center","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"China accused the U.S. National Security Agency of conducting a series of cyberattacks on its National Time Service Center between 2022 and 2024, claiming the U.S. exploited vulnerabilities in messaging apps from a foreign mobile phone brand to steal data and infiltrate internal systems.

The closed-door gathering — known as the fourth plenum — is expected to last four days and will discuss and put the final touches on China’s next five-year plan, a blueprint for 2026-2030. The leaders are meeting at a time of heightened  trade tensions  between Washington and Beijing and just ahead of a possible meeting between Xi and U.S. President Donald Trump during a regional summit later this month. Here is what to know about the meeting: \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n What the fourth plenum is and why it matters The fourth plenum refers to the fourth plenary session, out of typically seven during the five-year term of the Chinese Communist Party’s central committee. Xi and about 370 members of the central committee are expected to attend. The gathering also may coincide with personnel changes. Since it’s held behind closed doors, details may come days or weeks later.  Such gatherings are meant to help unite officials and the public behind the party’s agenda. The full five-year plan for 2026-2030 and specifics will likely not be released until the annual session of the National People’s Congress in March. But there is little reason to expect a radical shift from the format and messaging style of previous  five-year plans , Lynn Song, chief economist for Greater China at ING Bank, said in an interview. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n What to expect in China’s next ‘five-year plan’ The world’s second-largest economy is forecast to expand by 4.8% this year, according to the World Bank, a figure close to China’s official target of about 5% annual growth. Growth in July-September  slowed to 4.8%,  the lowest pace in a year. China faces challenges from the trade war that has intensified since Trump took office, but also from chronic domestic problems that are dragging on growth.  Longstanding efforts to boost consumer spending and investment by businesses and to curb excess capacity in many industries top the list of economic priorities. But Xi also will likely highlight China’s push to become the global leader in many technologies, such as artificial intelligence.  China’s pursuit of technological “self-sufficiency,” weaning its industries of their reliance on advanced computer chips from the U.S., has sped up as Trump tightens American export control measures and raises tariffs. That could result in more spending on advanced technology, said Ning Zhang, a senior China economist at UBS. One key question is whether there will be any meaningful shift in the leadership’s approach to boosting consumption, said Leah Fahy, a China economist at Capital Economics. The government has adopted incremental policy moves — such as increased government subsidies for child care, consumer loans, and trade-in programs for appliances and electric vehicles. Boosting consumption, which would drive borrowing and demand, is “much more important than before” but consumer confidence has been undermined by the bursting of  China’s property bubble  several years ago, Zhang explained. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Economists say bolder moves are needed to make a significant difference. Price wars in the auto industry are an example of the risks of the ferocious competition that results from overcapacity that afflicts many Chinese industries. China’s  exports  — including to Southeast Asia and Africa — have surged as companies seek markets beyond its borders, adding to friction with the United States and other trading partners.  China’s chief challenges in the next five years Since the massive disruptions of the COVID-19 pandemic, China has struggled to reignite faster economic growth. Its property sector downturn has complicated that effort, causing massive layoffs and leading families to cut back on spending as house prices have fallen. Wendy Leutert, a professor of economics and trade at Indiana University, noted in a recent report that China is still stinting on spending on areas that might help to balance the economy and encourage more consumer spending, such as health care, education and child and elder care. “Overall, China’s leaders still appear willing to accept economic costs, including resource misallocation and failures, in order to pursue self-sufficiency and technological leadership in strategically important industries and strengthen overall national power,” she wrote. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n While it faces  increasing friction  with the U.S. and other trading partners, China is also running up against demographic pressures, as its population of 1.4 billion begins to shrink and age more rapidly. The unemployment rate for young workers aged 16-24 is nearly 19%, according to official data, impinging on their potential contributions to the economy. The Chinese leadership has set a goal of doubling the size of China’s economy in 2020 by 2035, and like any other government, “still cares (about) growth and is still trying to get richer,” said Zhang of UBS.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n He estimates that keeping the economy growing at a robust 4% to 5% pace in the next decade will likely be “challenging.” But it’s imperative to show it is striving for such ambitious goals, to demonstrate the ruling party’s capacity to keep delivering a better quality of life — its chief claim to its legitimacy.  “For China’s leadership, what do they care about? Stability, legitimacy, and also ongoing support,” he said."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/france-louvre-museum-robbery-a3687f330a43e0aaff68c732c4b2585b","dateOfPublication":"2024-04-15","timeOfPublication":"20:30:00Z","title":"Human Rights and Immigration Policy in Country X: A Year of Change and Controversy","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article discusses ongoing concerns regarding human rights and immigration policies in Country X, focusing on the impact of recent legislative changes and public reactions.

It was reportedly recovered broken. Images from the scene showed confused tourists being steered out of the glass pyramid and adjoining courtyards as officers closed nearby streets along the Seine.  \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Thieves hit the Louvre again.

Interior Minister Laurent Nunez said the crew entered from outside using a basket lift via the riverfront facade to reach the hall with the 23-item royal collection. Their target was the gilded Apollon Gallery, where the Crown Diamonds are displayed, including the Regent, the Sancy and the Hortensia.  The thieves smashed two display cases and fled on motorbikes, Nunez said. No one was hurt. Alarms brought Louvre agents to the room, forcing the intruders to bolt, but the theft was already done. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Eight objects were taken, according to officials: a sapphire diadem, necklace and single earring from a matching set linked to 19th-century French queens Marie-Amélie and Hortense; an emerald necklace and earrings from the matching set of Empress Marie-Louise, Napoleon Bonaparte’s second wife; a reliquary brooch; Empress Eugénie’s diadem; and her large corsage-bow brooch — a prized 19th-century imperial ensemble. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “It’s a major robbery,” Nunez said, noting that security measures at the Louvre had been strengthened in recent years and would be reinforced further as part of  the museum’s upcoming overhaul plan . Officials said security upgrades include new-generation cameras, perimeter detection, and a new security control room.

Daylight robberies during public hours are rare. Pulling one off inside the Louvre with visitors present ranks among Europe’s most audacious in recent history, and at least since  Dresden’s Green Vault museum in 2019 .  It also collides with a deeper tension the Louvre has struggled to resolve: swelling crowds and stretched staff. The museum delayed opening during a  June staff walkout over overcrowding and chronic understaffing . Unions say mass tourism leaves too few eyes on too many rooms and creates pressure points where construction zones, freight routes and visitor flows meet. Security around marquee works remains tight — the Mona Lisa sits behind bulletproof glass in a climate-controlled case — but Sunday’s theft also underscored that protections are not uniformly as robust across the museum’s more than 33,000 objects. The theft is a fresh embarrassment for a museum already under scrutiny. “How can they ride a lift to a window and take jewels in the middle of the day?” said Magali Cunel, a French teacher from near Lyon. “It’s just unbelievable that a museum this famous can have such obvious security gaps.” The Louvre has a long history of thefts and attempted robberies. The most famous came in 1911, when the Mona Lisa vanished from its frame, stolen by Vincenzo Peruggia and recovered two years later in Florence. Another notorious episode came in 1956, when a visitor hurled a stone at her world-famous smile, chipping paint near her left elbow and hastening the move to display the work behind protective glass. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Today the former royal palace holds a roll call of civilization: Leonardo’s Mona Lisa; the armless serenity of the Venus de Milo; the Winged Victory of Samothrace, wind-lashed on the Daru staircase; the Code of Hammurabi’s carved laws; Delacroix’s Liberty Leading the People; Géricault’s The Raft of the Medusa. The objects — from Mesopotamia, Egypt and the classical world to Europe’s masters — draw a daily tide of up to 30,000 visitors even as investigators now begin to sweep those gilded corridors for clues. \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     Police officers, background, look for clues by a basket lift used by thieves Sunday, Oct. 19, 2025 at the Louvre museum in Paris.

Far-right leader Jordan Bardella used it to attack President Emmanuel Macron, weakened at home and facing a fractured parliament.  “The Louvre is a global symbol of our culture,” Bardella wrote on X. “This robbery, which allowed thieves to steal jewels from the French Crown, is an unbearable humiliation for our country. How far will the decay of the state go?”  The criticism lands as Macron touts a decade-long “Louvre New Renaissance” plan — about €700 million ($760 million) to modernize infrastructure, ease crowding and give the Mona Lisa a dedicated gallery by 2031.

Officials have described the haul as of “inestimable” historical value.  Recovery may prove difficult. “It’s unlikely these jewels will ever be seen again,” said Tobias Kormind, managing director of 77 Diamonds. “Professional crews often break down and re-cut large, recognizable stones to evade detection, effectively erasing their provenance.” Key questions still unanswered are how many people took part in the theft and whether they had inside assistance, authorities said. According to French media, there were four perpetrators: two dressed as construction workers in yellow safety vests on the lift, and two each on a scooter. French authorities did not immediately comment on this. Investigators are reviewing CCTV from the Denon wing and the riverfront, inspecting the basket lift used to reach the gallery and interviewing staff who were on site when the museum opened, authorities said. ___ Associated Press writer Jill Lawless in London contributed to this report."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/tropical-storm-fengshen-philippines-vietnam-455a65b89f2727725fa6305a4ab3d9f9","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"08:50:32+00:00","title":"Tropical Storm Fengshen Lashes Northern and Central Philippines, Killing Seven","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tropical Storm Fengshen, locally known as Ramil, struck the northern and central Philippines over the weekend, resulting in seven deaths and the evacuation of over 22,000 people due to flooding and landslides.

seven people after forcing more than 22,000 people to evacuate from flood- and landslide-prone villages. Tropical Storm Fengshen blew away from the main northern Philippine region of Luzon into the South China Sea late Sunday. It currently has sustained winds of up to 65 kph (40 mph) and gusts of up to 80 kph (50 mph), government forecasters said. The government’s disaster-mitigation agency said seven deaths were reported. Nearly 14,000 people who evacuated remained displaced from their homes by Monday, the agency said. One person drowned Saturday in Roxas City in the central province of Capiz, where high tide worsened flooding in many villages, officials said. Five people, including two children, died while they were sleeping when their hut was hit early Sunday by a huge palm tree that they had burned before to try to topple it for safety reasons in Pitogo town in the eastern province of Quezon, provincial police chief Romulo Albacea and other officials said. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Fengshen, locally called Ramil, was forecast to blow across the South China Sea on a course toward Vietnam, state forecaster Glaiza Escullar said. \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Chinese leader Xi Jinping outlines 5-year plan at closed-door Communist Party meeting \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 What to know about Rodrigo Paz, the centrist who shot from obscurity to Bolivia’s presidency \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 A mysterious airstrip built on a Yemeni island comes as Houthi rebels are increasingly squeezed \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n The storm, the 18th tropical cyclone to batter the Philippine archipelago this year, hit as central and southern provinces were still recovering from recent  earthquakes  that left more than 80 people dead, displaced thousands of people and damaged more than 134,000 houses in central Cebu province alone, the country’s disaster-mitigation agency said.

The victory marks a decisive break from 20 years of MAS-led governance, as Paz's campaign gained traction among working-class and Indigenous Aymara voters disillusioned with economic mismanagement. His running mate, former police officer Edman Lara, brought a populist, anti-corruption appeal, resonating with many voters despite causing internal tensions.

Paz won 54% of the votes, early results showed, versus Quiroga’s 45%. Paz took the podium Sunday night flanked by his wife, María Helena Urquidi, and four adult children. The hotel ballroom in  Bolivia’s  capital of La Paz went wild, with people shouting his name and holding phones aloft.  “Today, Bolivia can be certain that this will be a government that will bring solutions,” he told supporters. “Bolivia breathes winds of change and renewal to move forward.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Shortly after the results came in,  Quiroga conceded to Paz . “I’ve called Rodrigo Paz and wished him congratulations,” he said in a somber speech, prompting jeers and cries of fraud from the audience. But  Quiroga  urged calm, saying that a refusal to recognize the results would “leave the country hanging.”  \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 What to know about Rodrigo Paz, the centrist who shot from obscurity to Bolivia’s presidency \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 After years of socialist rule, Bolivia’s presidential runoff tests how far and fast it veers right \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Afro-descendants in Bolivia fight invisibility with dance and memory \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n “We’d just exacerbate the problems of people suffering from the crisis,” he said. “We need a mature attitude right now.” \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n Paz and his popular running mate, ex-police Capt. Edman Lara, gained traction among working-class and rural voters disillusioned with the unbridled spending of the long-ruling Movement Toward Socialism, or MAS, party but wary of Quiroga’s radical 180-degree turn away from its social protections. Quiroga’s embrace of the International Monetary Fund — an organization that has long aroused political resentment in Bolivia — for a shock treatment package of the kind Bolivians came to know and fear in the 1990s also alienated more moderate voters. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Paz’s victory sets this South American nation of 12 million on a sharply uncertain path as he seeks to enact major change for the first time since the 2005 election of Evo Morales, the founder of MAS and Bolivia’s first Indigenous president.  Although Paz’s Christian Democratic Party has the cushion of a slight majority in Congress, he’ll still need to compromise to push through an ambitious overhaul. Paz plans to end Bolivia’s fixed exchange rate, phase out generous fuel subsidies and reduce hefty public investment, redrawing much of the MAS economic model that dominated for two decades. But he says he’ll maintain MAS-style benefits and take a gradual approach to  free-market reforms , in hopes of avoiding a sharp recession or jump in inflation that would enrage the masses — as has happened before in Bolivia. Morales’ effort to lift fuel subsidies in 2011 lasted less than a week as protests engulfed the country. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Paz inherits an economy in shambles Paz’s supporters erupted into raucous cheers and ran into the streets of La Paz, setting off fireworks and honking car horns. Crowds thronged a hotel downtown where Paz spoke, some shouting, “The people, united, will never be defeated!” “We feel victorious,” Roger Carrillo, a volunteer with Paz’s party, said by phone from eastern Bolivia, where he was rallying a celebratory caravan. “We know there is work ahead of us but we just want to enjoy this moment.”  Behind the celebrations, Bolivia faces an uphill battle. Since 2023, the Andean nation has been  crippled by a shortage of U.S. dollars  that has locked Bolivians  out of their own savings  and hampered imports. Year-on-year  inflation soared  to 23% last month, the highest rate since 1991. Fuel shortages paralyze the country, with motorists often waiting days in line to fill up their tanks. To make it through even his first months, Paz must replenish the country’s meager foreign currency reserves and get fuel imports flowing. Vowing to avoid the IMF, Paz has pledged to scrape together the necessary cash by fighting corruption, reducing wasteful spending and restoring enough confidence in the country’s currency to lure U.S. dollar savings out from under Bolivians’ mattresses and into the banking system. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n But Paz’s stated reluctance to slam on the fiscal brakes — with promises of cash handouts for the poor to cushion the blow of subsidy cuts — has led to criticism. “It’s just so vague, I feel like he’s saying these things to please voters when fiscally it doesn’t add up,” said 48-year-old Rodrigo Tribeño, who voted for Quiroga on Sunday. “We needed a real change.” An outsider with political experience \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Although Paz, the son of former President Jaime Paz Zamora, who was in office from 1989 to 1993, has spent more than two decades in politics as a lawmaker and mayor, he appeared in this race as a political unknown. The senator rose unexpectedly from the bottom of the polls to a  first-place finish in the August vote . His party swept six of nine regional departments in the country, including the Andean highlands of western Bolivia and the large, coca-producing region of Cochabamba, winning over key swaths of Indigenous Aymara and working-class Bolivians that once comprised Morales’ base.  Paz’s slogan of “capitalism for all” appealed to many merchants and entrepreneurs who flourished in Morales’ heyday but later chafed against his high taxes and regulation. Quiroga, by contrast, carried the wealthier eastern lowlands of Santa Cruz, known as the country’s agricultural engine. “There’s a very clear class difference. For Quiroga, you have people who’ve been in politics and in the economic elite for a long time — businesspeople, agro-industrialists,” said Verónica Rocha, a Bolivian political analyst. “With Paz, it’s the opposite.” An ex-cop shakes up the race The race looked to be a staid affair until Paz surprised everyone by picking Lara as his running mate. The charismatic young ex-policeman had zero political experience but gained fame on TikTok after being fired from the police for denouncing corruption in viral videos. Out of work, he sold second-hand clothes to get by and worked as a lawyer helping Bolivians come forward about corruption — a story that resonated with many former MAS supporters.  Lara’s fiery, populist promises of universal income for women and higher pensions for retirees frequently forced Paz into damage control, causing tension on the campaign trail. But for those who see Lara as divisive and hot-headed, there are plenty of Bolivians who say those traits connote authenticity in comparison to the other scripted, telegenic candidates. Lara struck an unusually conciliatory tone in his remarks after winning Sunday. “It’s time to unite, it’s time to reconcile,” Lara told supporters after learning of his win, taking a more conciliatory tone than usual. “Political divisions are over.” Many Bolivians interviewed Sunday said they voted for Lara as if he were at the top of the ticket. “Lara is the one acting more like a president than Paz.

The protest at the consulate, a block from the United Nations campus in Manhattan, illustrated the complex relationship between Israel and segments of the large population of very religious Jews in New York and its suburbs. The two influential, and often rival, grand rebbes of the Satmar community both called on adherents to participate in the demonstration. The Central Rabbinical Congress of the U.S.A. and Canada, a consortium of Orthodox Jewish groups, said it helped organize the protest. It comes after Israel’s  Supreme Court last year  ordered the government to begin drafting ultra-Orthodox Jewish men into the military. There had been a longstanding enlistment exemption — dating to the founding of Israel in 1948. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The ultra-Orthodox worry that mandatory enlistment will impact  adherents’ ties  to their faith.

The emergency appeal to the high court came after a judge prevented, for at least two weeks, the deployment of Guard members from Illinois and Texas to assist immigration enforcement. A federal appeals court refused to put the judge’s order on hold. The conservative-dominated court has handed Trump repeated victories in emergency appeals since he took office in January, after lower courts have ruled against him and often over the objection of the three liberal justices. The court has allowed Trump to  ban transgender people from the military , claw back billions of dollars of congressionally approved federal spending, move aggressively against immigrants and fire the Senate-confirmed leaders of  independent federal agencies , \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n In the dispute over the Guard, U.S. District Judge April Perry said she found no substantial evidence that a “danger of rebellion” is brewing in Illinois during Trump’s immigration crackdown. \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Trump administration to defend Alina Habba’s tenure as top New Jersey prosecutor \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Asian shares advance, with Japan’s benchmark surging after ruling party forms new coalition \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Ultraconservative Sanae Takaichi on track to become Japan’s first female prime minister \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n But Solicitor General D.

They said Republican Gov. Bill Lee, with Trump’s support, violated the state constitution, which says the Guard can be called up during “rebellion or invasion” but only with the blessing of state lawmakers.  The deployment “sets a dangerous precedent for military intrusion into local communities,” Memphis City Council member JB Smiley said. Since their  arrival on Oct. 10 , troops have been patrolling areas of downtown Memphis, including near the iconic Pyramid, wearing fatigues and protective vests that say “military police,” with guns in holsters. Officials have said Guard members have no arrest power. “We’re in a unique spot in this city to have the resources available to us to remove the crime element in Memphis,” Lee said recently. For years, Memphis has dealt with  high violent crime , including assaults, carjackings and homicides. While this year’s statistics show improvement, many people acknowledge that violence remains a problem. In California,  a judge in September said  deployment in the Los Angeles area was illegal . By that point, just 300 of the thousands of troops sent there remained and the judge did not order them to leave. ___ Associated Press writers Christine Fernando in Chicago, Adrian Sainz in Memphis, Tennessee, and Jonathan Mattise in Nashville, Tennessee, contributed to this report."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/nevada-film-tax-credit-sony-warner-bros-93980099467ef43f784e5ec41b92118a","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"12:02:34+00:00","title":"Nevada Unions Push for Film Tax Credits to Boost Jobs and Tourism","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Nevada labor unions, including the Laborers’ International Union of North America and the Nevada Jobs Now political action committee, are pushing for a special session to revive a proposal offering up to $95 million in tax credits to Sony Pictures Entertainment and Warner Bros.

But now Nevada labor unions hoping to boost jobs and tourism are pushing state officials to offer tax credits aimed at bringing more Hollywood filmmaking to the state. The effort to offer up to $95 million in tax credits to Sony Pictures Entertainment and Warner Bros. Discovery for a new film production facility in the Vegas suburbs didn’t win enough legislative support earlier this year. But more than a dozen labor unions are pushing to revive the proposal during an expected special session next month. “We believe if we can get the public behind us, we’ll be able to get the legislators to understand what a big change this can bring to Southern Nevada,” said Tommy White, business manager-secretary treasurer of Laborers’ International Union of North America, Local 872 in Las Vegas.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Trade unions formed a political action committee called Nevada Jobs Now, which has raised over $1 million to be used for digital advertisements, mailers and some TV commercials, White said.

Sony and Warner Bros. would have to spend $4.5 billion over 15 years. They would be eligible for the tax credits after the studio is built and filming begins, he said. Drawing the movie buff to Vegas The proposal comes as Las Vegas  continues to see a decline in tourism . Between June 2024 and June 2025, the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority reported an 11.3% decline in visitors. White and other supporters argue that not only will the film studios bring jobs and revenue, it will also attract tourists. “With movie studios, you bring in a whole different type of tourist,” White said, likening it to how major sports teams draw visitors. “You don’t just bring the person that’s come in to go to a resort to gamble.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Stephen Weizenecker, an Atlanta attorney who was involved in Georgia’s film tax credit program since its inception in 2008, said Georgia has seen more tourists wanting to visit the scenes where movies like “The Hunger Games” and “Forrest Gump” were filmed.  Dubbed the “Hollywood of the South,” metro Atlanta became a ubiquitous backdrop for huge projects, including Marvel films and Netflix’s “Stranger Things.” Its program has supported thousands of jobs and the creation of several thriving studios. But it is expensive — the state in 2024  was projected to give out $1.35 billion in credits  that year alone.  The state’s return is an average of 17 cents in tax revenue for every state dollar spent, according to Carlianne Patrick, an associate professor at Georgia State University who conducts audits of the state’s tax credit programs.  Georgia has seen a large increase in production activity and an increase in jobs, though not all of them are full-time, permanent positions, Patrick said.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n State employee union argues against the proposal Some don’t see the payoff in giving tax credits to the film studios. The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), a union representing thousands of state workers, joined other Nevada organizations this week in sending a letter to the governor urging him to not include the film tax credit proposal in the upcoming special session. Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo says he will call lawmakers back to the capital before the years ends, but it’s not yet clear what issues lawmakers will tackle. They argue the project is “fiscally irresponsible and politically indefensible” and would only generate $0.52 in tax revenue for every $1 in credit, citing a May 2025 report commissioned by the state. “Every dollar we lock into a corporate handout is a dollar we can’t put toward our rainy-day readiness, public education, health care, wildfire mitigation, housing, and the basic services Nevadans rely on when times get tight,” the organizations wrote in the letter.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Jared Kluesner, a psychiatric nurse at the Southern Nevada Adult Mental Health campus in Las Vegas and member of AFSCME, said the state should prioritize public services for people with mental health issues. Kluesner wants Sony and Warner Bros. to build a film studio facility and create more jobs for Nevadans, but “if they’re going to do it at the cost of public services and funds that should be allocated to state workers, then that’s not really solving any problems.”"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-drones-gas-strikes-energy-50826ce7b96814ad943d8721c1a2915c","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"09:45:19+00:00","title":"Trump Suggests Ukraine Give Up Donbas Land for Peace Amid Escalating Drone Attacks","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a recent development, U.S. President Donald Trump stated that the Donbas region of Ukraine should be 'cut up' and left largely under Russian control as a path to peace, suggesting that Ukraine may need to give up territory in exchange for an end to the war.

 said Sunday that the Donbas region of Ukraine should be “cut up,” leaving most of it in Russian hands, to end a  war that has dragged on  for nearly four years. “Let it be cut the way it is,” he told reporters aboard Air Force One. “It’s cut up right now,” adding that you can “leave it the way it is right now.” “They can negotiate something later on down the line,” he said. But for now, both sides of the conflict should “stop at the battle line — go home, stop fighting, stop killing people.” Trump’s latest comments came after Ukrainian drones struck a major gas processing plant in southern Russia, sparking a fire and forcing it to suspend its intake of gas from Kazakhstan, Russian and Kazakh authorities said Sunday.  The Orenburg plant, run by state-owned gas giant Gazprom and located in a region of the same name near the Kazakh border, is part of a production and processing complex that is one of the world’s largest facilities of its kind, with an annual capacity of 45 billion cubic meters. It handles gas condensate from Kazakhstan’s Karachaganak field, alongside Orenburg’s own oil and gas fields. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n According to regional Gov.

Asked in a Fox News interview conducted Thursday whether Russian President Vladimir Putin would be open to ending the war “without taking significant property from Ukraine,” Trump responded: “Well, he’s going to take something.” “They fought and he has a lot of property. He’s won certain property,” Trump said. “We’re the only nation that goes in, wins a war and then leaves.” The interview was aired Sunday on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures,” but was conducted before  Trump spoke to Putin on Thursday and met with Zelenskyy on Friday .  Then on Sunday evening, while flying from Florida to Washington, Trump — who plans to meet Putin in Budapest in coming weeks — reiterated his stance that Ukraine will need to give up territory by having the fighting “stop at the lines where they are.” “The rest is very tough to negotiate if you’re going to say, ‘You take this, we take that,’” he said. “You know, there are so many different permutations.” The comments amounted to another shift in position on the war by the U.S. leader. In recent weeks, Trump had shown growing impatience with Putin and  expressed greater openness  to helping Ukraine win the war. Contrary to Kyiv’s hopes, Trump  did not commit to providing it with Tomahawks  following his meeting with Zelenskyy. The missiles would be the longest-range weapons in Ukraine’s arsenal and would allow it to strike targets deep inside Russia, including Moscow, with precision. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Russians modified bombs for deeper strikes Meanwhile, Ukrainian prosecutors claim that Moscow is modifying its deadly aerial-guided bombs to strike civilians deeper in Ukraine. Local authorities in Kharkiv said Russia struck a residential neighborhood using a new rocket-powered aerial bomb for the first time. Kharkiv’s regional prosecutor’s office said in a statement that Russia used the weapon called the UMPB-5R, which can travel up to 130 kilometers (80 miles), in an attack on the city of Lozava on Saturday afternoon. The city lies 150 kilometers (93 miles) south of Kharkiv, a considerable distance for the weapon to fly.  Russia continued to strike other parts of Ukraine closer to the front line. In the Dnipropetrovsk region, at least 11 people were injured after Russian drones hit the Shakhtarske area. At least 14 five-story buildings and a store were damaged, said acting regional Gov.

Some 192 miners were brought to the surface without injury, the company that operates the mine said.  Ukraine’s General Staff also claimed a separate drone strike hit Russia’s Novokuibyshevsk oil refinery, in the Samara region near Orenburg, sparking a blaze and damaging its main refining units.  The Novokuibyshevsk facility, operated by Russian gas major Rosneft, has an annual capacity of 4.9 million tons, and turns out over 20 kinds of oil-based products.

He suggested that Trump was being deceived by his advisers, described himself as “the main enemy” of drugs in his country and said Trump was being “rude and ignorant toward Colombia.” The Colombian Foreign Ministry described Trump’s statement as a “direct threat to national sovereignty by proposing an illegal intervention in Colombian territory.” Defense Minister Pedro Sánchez told reporters that the country “has used all its capability and also lost men and women fighting drug trafficking.”  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Trump’s latest broadside against Petro raises the possibility of an expanding clash in Latin America, where the U.S. has already increased pressure on neighboring Venezuela and its leader, Nicolás Maduro. American naval ships, fighter jets and drones are deployed in the region for what the administration has described as an “armed conflict” with drug cartels. Trump also authorized covert operations inside Venezuela. Unlike Venezuela, Colombia is a longtime U.S. ally and the top recipient of American assistance in the region. But coca cultivation  reached an all-time high  last year, according to the United Nations, and there has been fresh violence in rural areas where the government spent years battling insurgents before reaching a peace deal a decade ago. In September, the Trump administration accused Colombia of  failing to cooperate  in the drug war, although at the time Washington issued a waiver of sanctions that would have triggered aid cuts. Colombia received an estimated $230 million in the U.S. budget year that ended Sept. 30, a drop from recent years that exceeded $700 million, according to U.S. figures. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Petro, Colombia’s first leftist president, has repeatedly feuded with Trump this year. Petro initially rejected U.S. military flights of  deported migrants,  leading Trump to threaten tariffs. The State Department said it would revoke Petro’s visa when he attended the U.N. General Assembly in New York because he told American soldiers to disobey Trump’s orders. Petro and Trump have also been at odds over American strikes on boats in the Caribbean. On Sunday, Petro accused the U.S. government of assassination, pointing to a Sept. 16 strike that he said killed a Colombian man named Alejandro Carranza. Petro said Carranza was a fisherman with no ties to drug trafficking, and his boat was malfunctioning when it was hit. “The United States has invaded our national territory, fired a missile to kill a humble fisherman, and destroyed his family, his children. This is Bolívar’s homeland, and they are murdering his children with bombs,” Petro wrote on social media. He said that he asked his country’s attorney general’s office to initiate legal proceedings internationally and in U.S. courts. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The White House and the Pentagon did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Petro’s accusations. Despite Petro’s criticism, his government plans to prosecute the Colombian survivor of a more recent U.S. strike on a submersible that was allegedly carrying drugs. Another survivor was repatriated to Ecuador, where the Ministry of the Interior said he would not face charges after prosecutors met with him and determined that he had not committed any crimes within the country’s borders. The ELN, which Hegseth said was the target of Friday’s strike, has long denied any role in drug trafficking and offered to submit to the scrutiny of an international commission. It did not respond to Hegseth’s announcement. Colombian authorities regularly report the dismantling of cocaine laboratories and the seizure of drugs believed to belong to the guerrillas. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n There have been seven U.S. strikes in the region since early September that the administration says are targeting alleged drug traffickers. At least 32 people have been killed. Trump said Sunday that Petro had “a fresh mouth toward America.” He complained that drug smuggling continues “despite large scale payments and subsidies from the USA that are nothing more than a long term rip off of America.” “AS OF TODAY, THESE PAYMENTS, OR ANY OTHER FORM OF PAYMENT, OR SUBSIDIES, WILL NO LONGER BE MADE TO COLOMBIA,” he added. Elizabeth Dickinson, senior analyst for the Andes region at International Crisis Group, said “it is befuddling and profoundly unwise of the United States to alienate its strongest military partner in Latin America at a moment when tension between Washington and Venezuela are at its highest point in recent years.” She said Washington and Bogota have long treated their relationship as foundational, but “that wisdom is being thrown out the window, with really catastrophic effects.” Colombia lost significant U.S. funding when Trump slashed the U.S. Agency for International Development earlier this year. More cuts could affect military cooperation and undermine efforts to fight rebel groups. “If that is cut, we will see a strategic loss of capability for the Colombian military and police at precisely the moment when they’re confronting the greatest security crisis in Colombia for over a decade,” she said. ___ Coto reported from San Juan, Puerto Rico, and Suárez from Bogotá, Colombia. ___ This story has been corrected to reflect Trump called Petro ‘an illegal drug leader,’ not ‘an illegal drug dealer.’"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/poll-economy-trump-inflation-electricity-costs-hiring-jobs-ffa4a9de69db090f47f968ba656d694b","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"12:05:45+00:00","title":"Voters changed presidents, but they’re not feeling better about Trump’s economy","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A recent AP-NORC poll reveals growing public concern about job stability and rising living costs under President Donald Trump, with 47% of U.S. adults expressing low confidence in their ability to find a good job.

increasingly concerned about their ability to find a good job under  President Donald Trump , an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll finds, in what is a potential warning sign for Republicans as a promised  economic boom  has given way to  hiring freezes  and  elevated inflation . High prices  for groceries , housing and health care persist as a fear for many households, while rising electricity bills and the cost of gas at the pump are also sources of anxiety, according to the survey. Some 47% of U.S. adults are “not very” or “not at all confident” they could find a good job if they wanted to, an increase from 37% when the question was last asked in October 2023. Electricity bills are a “major” source of stress for 36% of U.S. adults at a time when the expected build-out of data centers for artificial intelligence could further tax the power grid. Just more than one-half said the cost of groceries are a “major” source of financial stress, about 4 in 10 said the cost of housing and health care were a serious strain and about one-third said they were feeling high stress about gasoline prices. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The survey suggests an ongoing vulnerability for Trump, who returned to the White House in January with claims he could quickly tame the inflation that surged after the pandemic during Democratic President Joe Biden’s term. Instead, Trump’s popularity on the economy has remained low amid a  mix of tariffs , federal worker layoffs and partisan sniping that has culminated in a  government shutdown . \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Zelenskyy says his meeting with Trump was ‘positive’ though he didn’t get Tomahawk missiles \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Trump administration to defend Alina Habba’s tenure as top New Jersey prosecutor \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Asian shares advance, with Japan’s benchmark surging after ruling party forms new coalition \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n Linda Weavil, 76, voted for Trump last year because he “seems like a smart businessman.” But she said in an interview that the Republican’s tariffs have worsened inflation, citing the chocolate-covered pecans sold for her church group fundraiser that now cost more. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “I think he’s doing a great job on a lot of things, but I’m afraid our coffee and chocolate prices have gone up because of tariffs,” the retiree from Greensboro, North Carolina, said. “That’s a kick in the back of the American people.” \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     Ioan Barsan a recruiter with the Miami Dade School Police Dept. talks to a a job seeker during a job fair Wednesday, Oct. 1, 2025, in Miami.

Among Republicans, 71% feel positive about his economic leadership. Yet that approval within Trump’s own party is relatively low in ways that could be problematic for Republicans in next month’s races for governor in New Jersey and Virginia, and perhaps even in the 2026 midterm elections. At roughly the same point in Biden’s term, in October 2021, an AP-NORC poll found that 41% of U.S. adults approved of how he was handling the economy, including about 73% of Democrats. That overall number was a little higher than Trump’s, primarily because of independents — 29% approved of how Biden was handling the economy, compared with the 18% who currently support Trump’s approach. The job market was meaningfully stronger in terms of hiring during Biden’s presidency as the United States was recovering from pandemic-related lockdowns. But hiring has slowed sharply under Trump with monthly job gains averaging less than 27,000 after the April tariff announcements. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n People see that difference.

Those added costs are coming before the anticipated construction of data centers for AI that could further push up prices without more construction. Even though 36% see electricity as a major concern, there are some who have yet to feel a serious financial squeeze. In the survey, 40% identified electricity costs as a “minor” stress, while 23% said their utility bills are “not a source” of stress. Kevin Halsey, 58, of Normal, Illinois, said his monthly electricity bills used to be $90 during the summer because he had solar panels, but have since jumped to $300. Halsey, who works in telecommunications, voted Democratic in last year’s presidential election and described the economy right now as “crap.” “I’ve got to be pessimistic,” he said. “I don’t see this as getting better.” At a fundamental level, Trump finds himself in the same economic dilemma that bedeviled Biden. There are signs the economy remains relatively solid with a low unemployment rate, stock market gains and decent economic growth, yet the public continues to be skeptical about the economy’s health. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Some 68% of U.S. adults describe the U.S. economy these days as “poor,” while 32% say it’s “good.” That’s largely consistent with assessments of the economy over the past year. In addition, 59%, say their family finances are “holding steady.” But only 12% say they’re “getting ahead,” and 28% say they are “falling behind.” People see plenty of expenses but few opportunities The sense of economic precarity is coming from many different directions, with indications that many think middle-class stability is falling out of reach. The vast majority of U.S. adults feel at least “minor” stress about the cost of groceries, health care, housing, the amount they pay in taxes, what they are paid at work and the cost of gas for their cars.  In the survey, 47%, say they are “not very” or “not at all” confident they could pay an unexpected medical expense while 52% have low confidence they will have enough saved for their retirement. Also, 63%, are “not very” or “not at all” confident they could buy a new home if they wanted to. Young adults are much less confident about their ability to buy a house, though confidence is not especially high across the board. About 8 in 10 U.S. adults under age 30 say they are “not very confident” or “not at all confident” they would be able to buy a house, compared with about 6 in 10 adults 60 and older. For 54% of U.S. adults, the cost of groceries is a “major source” of stress in their life right now.  Unique Hopkins, 36, of Youngstown, Ohio, said she is now working two jobs after her teenage daughter had a baby, leaving Hopkins with a sense that she can barely tread water as part of the “working poor.” She voted for Trump in 2016, only to switch to Democrats after she felt his ego kept him from uniting the country and solving problems. “It’s his way or no way,” she said. “Nobody is going to unite with Trump if it’s all about you, you, you.” ___ The AP-NORC poll of 1,289 adults was conducted Oct. 9-13, using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population.

2025-10-20T03:21:54+00:00\n\nTOKYO (AP) — Japan’s governing party leader,  Sanae Takaichi , is on track to become the country’s first female prime minister, after finding a badly needed replacement for a crucial partner that left her Liberal Democratic Party’s coalition. Takaichi, 64, would replace Prime Minister  Shigeru Ishiba  in Tuesday’s parliamentary vote. If she’s successful, it would end Japan’s three-month political vacuum and wrangling since the coalition’s loss in the  July parliamentary election . The moderate centrist  Komeito party  split from the LDP after a 26-year-long coalition. The move by Komeito came days after Takaichi’s election as president of her party, and it forced her into a desperate search for a replacement to secure votes so that she can become prime minister. The Buddhist-backed Komeito left after raising concerns about her ultraconservative politics and the LDP’s lax response to slush fund scandals that led to their consecutive election defeats and loss of majority in both houses. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n While the leaders of the country’s top three opposition parties failed to unite for a change of government, Takaichi went for a quick fix by teaming up with the most conservative of them: The Osaka-based Ishin no Kai, or Japan Innovation Party. But the long-term stability of their cooperation is an unknown. \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Zelenskyy says his meeting with Trump was ‘positive’ though he didn’t get Tomahawk missiles \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Trump administration to defend Alina Habba’s tenure as top New Jersey prosecutor \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Asian shares advance, with Japan’s benchmark surging after ruling party forms new coalition \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n The two parties are set to sign a coalition agreement on Monday. \n    \n     ◆ Stay up to date with similar stories by signing up to our WhatsApp channel. \n    \n \n An eventual Takaichi premiership would be on a cliff edge. The fragile new coalition, still a minority, would need cooperation from other opposition groups to pass any legislation. It would be a risk that could lead to an unstable, short-lived leadership. Big diplomatic tests come within days — talks with U.S. President  Donald Trump  and regional summits. At home, she needs to quickly tackle rising prices and compile economic boosting measures to address the frustrated public. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Unpopular among women An admirer of former U.K. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Takaichi’s breaking of the glass ceiling makes history in a country whose  gender equality ranks poorly  internationally.  But many women aren’t celebrating, and some see her impending premiership as a setback.  “The prospect of a first female prime minister doesn’t make me happy,” sociologist Chizuko Ueno posted on X. Ueno explained that Takaichi’s leadership would elevate Japan’s gender equality ranking, but “that doesn’t mean Japanese politics becomes kinder to women.” Takaichi, an ultraconservative star of her male-dominated party, is among those who have stonewalled measures for women’s advancement. Takaichi supports the imperial family’s  male-only succession , opposes  same-sex marriage  and a revision to the civil law allowing separate  last names  for married couples, so women don’t get pressured into abandoning theirs. The prospect for a dual system for last names is fading under Takaichi, Ueno says. “Ms. Takaichi’s policies are extremely hawkish and I doubt she would consider policies to recognize diversity,” said Chiyako Sato, a political commentator and senior writer for the Mainichi newspaper. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Rising prices and population decline If she’s successful in the parliamentary vote, Takaichi would immediately launch her Cabinet on Tuesday and make a policy speech later in the week. A protege of assassinated former Prime Minister  Shinzo Abe , Takaichi is expected to emulate his economic and security policies. With a potentially weak grip on power, it’s unknown how much Takaichi would be able to achieve. She would have only a few days to prepare for diplomatic tests — major regional summits and talks with Trump in between. She has to reassure that there will be stable ties with China and South Korea, which are concerned about her revisionist views on wartime history and past visits to the  Yasukuni Shrine . The shrine honors Japan’s 2.5 million war dead, including convicted war criminals. Victims of Japanese aggression, especially China and the Koreas, see visits to the shrine as a lack of remorse about Japan’s wartime past. Takaichi supports a stronger military, currently undergoing  a five-year buildup  with the annual defense budget being doubled to 2% of gross domestic product by 2027. Trump is expected to demand that Japan increase its military spending to NATO targets of 5% of GDP, and purchase more U.S. weapons.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Takaichi has to follow up on Japan’s pledge of $550 billion to Trump’s administration as part of a U.S. tariff deal. Her policies focus on short-term measures such as rising prices, salary increase and subsidies, as well as restrictions against a growing foreign population amid  a rise of xenophobia . Takaichi hasn’t shown a vision for Japan to address bigger issues like  demographic challenges .  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Takaichi’s dilemma Takaichi’s mission is to regain conservative votes by pushing the party further to the right. The LDP’s new coalition with the right-wing JIP may fit Takaichi’s views, but experts say that she would have to avoid pushing them and prioritize stability. She needs to balance relations between China and the United States under Trump, while at home she also needs balance to gain support from the opposition camp to achieve anything. “She needs to be realistic,” says Sato, the commentator. On Friday, Takaichi sent a religious ornament instead of going to the Yasukuni Shrine, apparently to avoid a diplomatic dispute with Beijing and Seoul. To consolidate opposition cooperation and lift her coalition closer to a majority, she has reached out to smaller opposition groups, including the far-right Sanseito. “There is no room for Takaichi to show her true colors. All she can do is cooperate per policy,” said Masato Kamikubo, a Ritsumeikan University political science professor. “It’s a pathetic situation.” A kingmaker’s influence Takaichi’s election as LDP leader as she seeks the premiership is about power politics by the 85-year-old conservative former Prime Minister Taro Aso, the party’s most powerful kingmaker. In her first move as LDP president, Takaichi appointed Aso as the party’s vice president and gave more top jobs to his allies and others who supported her, including Abe allies linked to the funds scandal. Takaichi is expected to appoint them to her Cabinet. Political instability Political observers expect that a Takaichi government wouldn’t last long. An early election may have to be called later this year, in hopes of regaining a majority in the lower house, though that would be tough. Experts also raise concerns about how Takaichi, a fiscal expansionist, can coordinate economic policies with Ishin’s fiscal conservative views.  “The era of LDP domination is over and we are entering the era of multiparty politics. The question is how to form a coalition,” Sato said, noting a similar trend in Europe. “We need to find a Japanese way of forming a coalition and a stable government.” About a dozen opposition parties span the spectrum from the Japanese Communist Party on the left to Sanseito and several others on the extreme right. “What’s going on here right now is what’s going on in all our democracies for a lot of complicated reasons,” said Gerald Curtis, a Columbia University professor and expert on Japanese politics, citing the mainstream political parties losing popularity, and voters acting on the basis of anger and resentment."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/las-vegas-raiders-2d0a9dc8cd74768e80dd7463b8d3c7ed","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"21:28:34+00:00","title":"Chiefs Use Deceptive Ruse to Shatter Raiders' Defense in 31-0 Victory","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a decisive 31-0 victory over the Las Vegas Raiders, the Kansas City Chiefs exploited a strategic ruse by quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who loudly shouted a curse phrase to deceive the Raiders into relaxing, allowing a successful play to follow.

(AP) — The Raiders hunkered down to stop the Kansas City Chiefs, who were facing fourth-and-1 on their own 40. Las Vegas already was trailing by a touchdown Sunday, but the outcome between longtime AFC West rivals was still very much in doubt. Patrick Mahomes got under center. He surveyed the defense. He barked a couple of times, then muttered so loudly that not only the Raiders could hear him but also the TV cameras, which didn’t have time to censor some choice language. “This play never (bleeping) works, man!” Mahomes yelled. It was all a ruse. And the Raiders were fooled. They relaxed ever-so-slightly, thinking the Chiefs were trying to draw them off and ultimately would punt. So when Mahomes snapped the ball a second later, and handed to Kareem Hunt, he had enough room to pick up the first down. The Chiefs finished off the drive with another touchdown, and they never looked back  in a 31-0 victory  — their most lopsided shutout of the Raiders in the 133 times that the two teams have met. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n When asked about his acting chops afterward, Mahomes replied: “I think it comes from all my State Farm commercials,” as the room erupted in laughter. \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Falcons’ embarrassing blunder helps 49ers seal 20-10 victory \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Christian McCaffrey’s 200-yard game from scrimmage powers 49ers past Falcons 20-10 \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Giant meltdown: New York on wrong end of Denver’s historic comeback after 3 shutout quarters \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n Lots of people were left making fun of the Raiders on Sunday. They managed three first downs, becoming the first team with that many since they also had three against the Falcons on Nov. 2, 2008. They ran 30 plays, the second-fewest of any game in the Super Bowl era; the expansion Browns had 28 against Pittsburgh in their first game. And they finished with 96 yards of offense, the fourth-fewest in franchise history. \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n Meanwhile, the Chiefs piled up 434 yards. They went 9 of 15 on third down, and at one point were 8 of 9. They held the ball for 42 minutes, 8 seconds, which meant the Raiders had it for a measly 17:52 in the 60-minute affair. “I think we beat ourselves, for the most part,” said Raiders quarterback Geno Smith, who was 10 of 16 for 67 yards before giving way to Kenny Pickett, who immediately fumbled the first snap he took in the game. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “You know, they’re a great, great team. Historically great team,” Smith said. “They’ve been, you know, together for a while. They understand what it takes to win. And we’re a developing team. And so whenever you come out and you don’t play the right way, and you shoot yourself in the foot early on, you don’t take advantage of your opportunities, it’s going to be an uphill battle.” It was an uphill battle even before kickoff, when the Raiders ruled out All-Pro tight end Brock Bowers with a knee injury and wide receiver Jakobi Meyers with knee and toe injuries. Then they lost all-everything pass rusher Maxx Crosby late in the first half with his own knee injury, and defensive tackle Adam Butler went down with a back injury. Uphill battle? Probably felt like scaling a wall. Coach Pete Carroll said that Crosby’s knee was “a bit sore,” and that he wanted to continue playing. “But we had to yank him,” Carroll said, “because he just didn’t look right.” He will be examined again Monday to determine the severity of the injury. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “NFL is a hard game as it is. It’s never going to be easy,” Smith said. “We’ve got tough games every week. When you don’t play the right way, and you don’t play up to your standard, it’s going to be extremely tough to win games.” The biggest silver lining for Las Vegas might have been the fact that Smith didn’t add to the 10 interceptions that he’s already thrown this season. It certainly wasn’t Ashton Jeanty, the star rookie, who had just six carries for 21 yards. Nor was it anyone on the Las Vegas defense, which struggled to deal with the speed Kansas City suddenly has available. Wide receiver Xavier Worthy is healthy after hurting his shoulder in the opener, and Rashee Rice returned from a six-game suspension and played for the first time since Week 4 last season, when he tore his ACL in a collision with his quarterback. Rice finished with two of Mahomes’ three touchdown throws and seven catches in all. Travis Kelce had 54 yards receiving. Worthy had three catches and an end-around that went for 13 yards. Marquise Brown had his third TD catch in two games. And nine different players hauled in a reception for Kansas City on the afternoon. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “My heart goes out to Pete. Pete and I have been doing this a long time,” Chiefs coach Andy Reid said. “You see him, the team with the injuries, man — that’s just crushing for them, especially when (Crosby) goes out of the game. That’s a tough thing for a guy to go through. I know it’s the Raiders. I know we like to get after the Raiders. But you hate to see that.” ___ AP NFL:  https://apnews.com/hub/nfl"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00Z","title":"Today's latest from Al Jazeera","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"This day’s global news highlights several pivotal developments: Ukraine’s ongoing conflict with Russia, including attacks on gas infrastructure and calls for international intervention; a dramatic Formula 1 race where Max Verstappen closes the championship gap to Oscar Piastri; a political shift in a country led by Paz, ending 20 years of socialism with a capitalist promise; Japan’s first female prime minister candidate, Sanae Takaichi, seeking coalition support; and multiple regional peace efforts, including ceasefire agreements in the TRNC and between Pakistan and Afghanistan, all mediated by Qatar and Turkey.

told Al Jazeera that his country is fighting to stay above rising sea levels and needs “real commitments” from other countries that will allow Tuvaluans to “stay in Tuvalu” as the climate crisis worsens.\n\nThe low-lying nation of nine atolls and islands, which is situated between Australia and Hawaii in the Pacific Ocean, is fighting to maintain its sovereignty by exploring new avenues in international diplomacy.\n\nBut, right now, the country needs help just to stay above water.\n\n“Coming from a country that is barely not one metre above the sea, reclaiming land and building sea walls and building our resilience is the number one priority for us,” Talia told Al Jazeera in an interview during the recent United Nations General Assembly in New York.\n\n“We cannot delay any more. Climate finance is important for our survival,” Talia said.\n\n“It’s not about building [over the] next two or three years to come, but right now, and we need it now, in order for us to respond to the climate crisis,” he said.\n\nTalia, who is also Tuvalu’s minister of home affairs and the environment, said the issue of financing will be a key issue at the upcoming UN COP30 climate meeting in Belem, in the Brazilian Amazon, in November.\n\nTuvalu is one of many countries already pushing for a  better deal on climate financing  at this year’s COP, after many advocates left last year’s meeting in Azerbaijan disappointed by the unambitious  $300bn target  set by richer countries.\n\nDescribing the  COP climate meeting  as having become more like a “festival for the oil-producing countries”, Talia said Tuvalu is also exploring a range of alternative initiatives, from a push to create the world’s first fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty to seeking to add its entire cultural heritage to the UNESCO World Heritage List.\n\nRepresentatives of oil-producing countries are now attending the COP climate meetings in “big numbers”, Talia said, in order to try and “really bury our voice as small developing countries”.\n\n“They take control of the narrative. They take control of the process. They try to water down all the texts. They try to put a stop to climate finance,” Talia said.\n\n“It’s about time that we should call out to the world that finance is important for us to survive,” he said.\n\n“The polluter pay principle is still there. You pollute, you pay,” he added.\n\nTalia also said that it was frustrating to see his own country struggling to survive, while other countries continue to spend billions of dollars on weapons for current and future wars.\n\n“Whilst your country is facing this existential threat, it’s quite disappointing to see that the world is investing billions and trillions of dollars in wars, in conflicts,” he said.\n\nA report released this week by the Global Center on Adaptation (GCA) found that 39 small island countries, which are home to some 65 million people, already need about $12bn a year to help them cope with the effects of climate change.\n\nThat figure is many times more than the roughly $2bn a year they are collectively receiving now, and which represents just 0.2 percent of the amount spent on global climate finance worldwide.\n\nGCA, a Rotterdam-based nonprofit organisation, also found that island states are already experiencing an average $1.7bn in annual economic losses due to climate change.\n\nTuvalu is not only focused on its own survival – the island state is considered to be facing one of the most severe existential threats from rising sea levels – it is also continuing to find ways to fight climate change globally.\n\n“That’s why Tuvalu is leading the  Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty ,” Talia said.\n\nAbout 16 countries have now signed on to the treaty, with Colombia offering to host the first international conference for the phase-out of fossil fuels next year.\n\n“We see its relevance for us,” Talia said of the treaty.\n\n“We want to grow in number in order for us to come up with a treaty, apart from the  Paris Agreement ,” he said.\n\nEven as Tuvalu, a country with a population of less than 10,000 people, is fighting for immediate action on climate change, it is also making preparations for its own uncertain future, including creating a digital repository of its culture so that nothing is lost to the sea.\n\nTalia, who is also Tuvalu’s minister for culture, said that he made the formal preliminary submission to UNESCO two weeks before the UNGA meeting for “the whole of Tuvalu to be listed” on the World Heritage List.\n\n“If we are to disappear, which is something that we don’t want to anticipate, but if worst comes to worst, at least you know our values, our culture, heritage, are well secured,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nLikewise, Talia said his country doesn’t see its 2023 cooperation pact with Australia, which also includes the world’s first climate change migration visa, as an indication that the island’s future is sealed.\n\n“I don’t look at the Falepili Agreement as a way of escaping the issue of climate change, but rather a pathway,” he said.\n\n“A pathway that we will allow our people in Tuvalu to get good education, trained, and then return home,” he said, referring to the agreement giving some Tuvaluans access to education, healthcare and unlimited travel to Australia.\n\nThe agreement text includes an acknowledgement from both parties that “the statehood and sovereignty of Tuvalu will continue, and the rights and duties inherent thereto will be maintained, notwithstanding the impact of climate change-related sea level rise”.\n\nTalia also said that a  recent ruling from the UN’s top court , the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague, declared that states have a responsibility to address climate change by cooperating to cut emissions, following through on climate agreements, and protecting vulnerable populations and ecosystems from harm.\n\nThe ICJ ruling “really changed the whole context of climate change debates”, Talia said.\n\n“The highest court has spoken, the highest court has delivered the judgement,” he said of the case, which was brought before the ICJ by Tuvalu’s neighbour Vanuatu.\n\n“So it’s just a matter of, how are we going to live that, or weave that, into our climate policies,” he said.\n\n“We need to hold the industrialised countries accountable to their actions,” he added."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/yemen-houthi-rebels-zuqar-island-airstrip-uae-c8c0182307ccefcb3f51854493f3ae00","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"05:32:03+00:00","title":"UAE Builds New Airstrip on Zuqar Island in Red Sea to Counter Houthi Threat","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A new airstrip is being constructed on Zuqar Island in the Red Sea, off Yemen’s coast, as revealed by satellite imagery.

The airstrip on Zuqar Island provides yet another link in a network of offshore bases in a region key to international shipping, where the Houthis already have attacked over 100 ships, sank four vessels and killed at least nine mariners during  the Israel-Hamas war .  It could give a military force the ability to conduct aerial surveillance over the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden and the strategic, narrow Bab el-Mandeb Strait connecting the two waterways off East Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.  Still, it remains unclear what would trigger the airstrip to be used for a military campaign. The United Arab Emirates, which has built other runways in the region, did not respond to requests for comment. Nor did Yemen’s anti-Houthi forces, divided by warring interests and unable to launch a coordinated assault against the rebels even after  intense American  and  Israeli bombing campaigns  that targeted them.  \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Israeli airstrike kills Houthi rebel prime minister in Yemen’s capital \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n In recent months, the anti-Houthi forces have been able to  interdict more cargo bound for the Houthis , something that having a presence on Zuqar could aid.  “The possibility of a new Yemeni offensive against the Houthis, backed by the Saudi-led coalition, can’t be ruled out, although I don’t see it as approaching,” said Eleonora Ardemagni, an analyst at the Italian Institute for International Political Studies who long has studied Yemen.  “There’s a more important point in my view regarding the build up in Zuqar: the countering of Houthis’ smuggling activities, with particular regard to weapons,” she said. \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n A runway on a strategic island Satellite photos from Planet Labs PBC analyzed by The Associated Press show the construction of a nearly 2,000-meter (6,560-foot) runway on Zuqar Island, which is some 90 kilometers (55 miles) southeast of the Houthi-held port city of Hodeida, a key shipping hub. The images show work began in April to build out a dock on the island, then land clearing along the site of the runway. By late August, what appears to be asphalt was being laid across the runway. Images from October show the work continuing, with runway markings painted on in the middle of the month. No one has claimed the construction. However, ship-tracking data analyzed by the AP show the Batsa, a Togolese-flagged bulk carrier registered to a Dubai-based maritime firm, spent nearly a week alongside the new dock at Zuqar Island after coming from Berbera in Somaliland, the site of a DP World port. DP World declined to comment.  A Dubai-based maritime company, Saif Shipping and Marine Services, acknowledged receiving an order to deliver the asphalt to the island likely used in the airstrip’s construction on behalf of other UAE-based firms. Other Emirates-based maritime firms have been associated with other airstrip construction projects in Yemen later tied back to the UAE.  \n    \n     Have a news tip?

In Mocha on the Red Sea, a project to extend that city’s airport now allows it to land far larger aircraft. Local officials attributed that project to the UAE, a federation of seven sheikhdoms, including Abu Dhabi and Dubai. There is also now a runway in nearby Dhubab. Another runway is on  Abd al-Kuri Island , in the Indian Ocean near the mouth of the Gulf of Aden. And in the Bab el-Mandeb Strait itself,  another runway built by the UAE is on Mayun Island . An anti-Houthi secessionist force in Yemen known as the Southern Transitional Council, which has long been backed by the UAE, controls the island and has acknowledged the UAE’s role in building the airport. Targeting of Houthi shipments Zuqar Island is a strategic location in the Red Sea. Eritrea captured the island in 1995 after battling Yemeni forces. An international court in 1998 placed the island formally into Yemen’s custody.  The island again found itself engulfed by war after the Houthis seized Yemen’s capital, Sanaa, in 2014 and began a march south, when the rebels took Zuqar.  Saudi Arabia and the UAE entered the war in 2015 on behalf of the country’s exiled government, stopping the Houthi advance. They also beat back the Houthis from Zuqar, retaking the island, which has become a staging ground for naval forces loyal to Tariq Saleh, a nephew of Yemen’s late strongman leader Ali Abdullah Saleh.  The younger Saleh, once allied to the Houthis before  his uncle switched sides and the rebels killed him , has been backed by the UAE. Since then, the front lines of the war have been static for years.  What changed was the Houthis’ taking their campaign globally with attacks on ships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. That continued even after a weekslong campaign of intense airstrikes known as Operation Rough Rider launched by the United States and continued strikes by Israel, which appear to be getting closer to the Houthis’ top leadership despite the rebels’ penchant for secrecy.  “The Houthis, like any insurgent group, win by not losing,” wrote Gregory D. Johnsen, a Yemen expert, in June. “It is how the group has survived and grown from each of its wars.” While a loose confederation of anti-Houthi groups exists, it remains fragmented and did not launch any attacks during the U.S. airstrikes. But the growing network of air bases around Yemen comes as anti-Houthi forces have made several significant seizures of weapons, likely bound for the rebels — including one large haul that was praised by the U.S. military’s Central Command.  “A likely Emirati airstrip in Zuqar could serve to improve surveillance and monitoring off the Hodeida coast to better support Yemeni forces in tackling smuggling,” Ardemagni said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/12/death-toll-from-mexico-flooding-rises-to-44-dozens-more-missing","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-12","timeOfPublication":"19:18:26Z","title":"Death toll from Mexico flooding rises to 44, dozens more missing","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Torrential flooding in central and southeastern Mexico, caused by the remnants of Hurricane Priscilla and Tropical Rainstorm Raymond, has resulted in at least 44 deaths and dozens missing across five states, including Veracruz, Puebla, Hidalgo, Queretaro, and San Luis Potosí.

add 57 superhot days a year\n\nA new study by World Weather Attribution and United States-based Climate Central has calculated the increase in dangerous “superhot days” – defined as warmer than 90 percent of comparable days between 1991 and 2020 – due to climate change.\n\nThe report, which is not yet peer-reviewed but uses established techniques for climate attribution, was released on Thursday. It highlights the significant effect of the  Paris Climate Agreement .\n\nBefore the 2015 accord, the world was on track for a catastrophic 4C (7.2F) of warming by the end of the century, which would have resulted in an additional 114 superhot days per year.\n\nBy fulfilling current commitments to curb emissions, the world is now heading towards 2.6C (4.7F) of warming. Under this scenario, the Earth will still add 57 superhot days annually by 2100 – nearly two months of dangerously high temperatures – but this is half the increase of the worst-case scenario. Since 2015, the world has already added 11 superhot days on average.\n\nPotsdam Climate Institute Director Johan Rockstrom, who was not part of the research team, said people should not be relieved that we are no longer on the 4-degree warming pre-Paris trajectory because the current track “would still imply a disastrous future for billions of humans on Earth”.\n\nThe report does not say how many people will be affected by the additional dangerously hot days, but coauthor Friederike Otto of Imperial College London said “it will definitely be tens of thousands or millions, not less”. She noted that thousands die in heatwaves each year already.\n\nThe study also underscores the profound unfairness of the impact of climate change across the world, showing a massive disconnect between carbon pollution and expected heat exposure.\n\nThe 10 countries that will experience the biggest increase in dangerous heat days are almost all small, ocean-dependent nations like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa. These countries are expected to see the largest spikes, with Panama projected to face 149 extra superhot days a year. These 10 nations collectively produce only 1 percent of global heat-trapping gases.\n\nIn stark contrast, the top carbon-polluting countries – the United States, China, and India – are predicted to get only between 23 and 30 extra superhot days. Despite being responsible for 42 percent of the world’s carbon dioxide, they will face less than 1 percent of the additional superhot days.\n\nUniversity of Victoria climate scientist Andrew Weaver, who was not part of the study team, said this heat inequality drives “yet another wedge between have and have-not nations”, potentially sowing seeds of geopolitical instability."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/18/trump-torpedoes-international-deal-to-reduce-shipping-emissions","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"07:32:37+00:00","title":"Trump torpedoes international deal to reduce shipping emissions","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The International Maritime Organization (IMO) delayed the formal adoption of the Net Zero Framework (NZF), a global plan to reduce shipping emissions by introducing a carbon pricing system, after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened sanctions on countries supporting the initiative.

voted to postpone approving a plan to curb shipping emissions, after United States President Donald Trump threatened to impose sanctions on countries that supported the measure.\n\nThe vote on Friday set back plans to regulate the shipping industry’s contributions to climate change by at least 12 months, even though the Net Zero Framework (NZF) had already been approved by members of the London-based IMO, a United Nations body,  in April .\n\nThe decision to formally delay adopting the framework until late next year came a day after President Trump took to his Truth Social platform, saying: “I am outraged that the International Maritime Organization is voting in London this week to pass a global Carbon Tax.”\n\n“The United States will NOT stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping,” he said, telling countries to vote against the plan.\n\nWashington also threatened to impose sanctions, visa restrictions and port levies on countries that supported the deal.\n\nIn advance of this week’s meeting in London, about 63 IMO members who had voted for the plan in April were expected to maintain their support for curbs on emissions, and others were expected to join the initiative to formally approve the framework.\n\nFollowing Trump’s social media threat, delegates in London instead voted on a hastily arranged resolution to push back proceedings on the matter, which passed by 57 votes to 49.\n\nThe IMO, which comprises 176 member countries, is responsible for regulating the safety and security of international shipping and preventing pollution on the high seas.\n\nSince returning to power in January, Trump has focused on reversing Washington’s course on climate change, encouraging fossil fuel use by deregulation, cutting funding for  clean energy projects  and promising businesses to  “drill, baby drill”.\n\nA spokesman for UN chief Antonio Guterres called Friday’s decisions “a missed opportunity for member states to place the shipping sector on a clear, credible path towards net zero emissions”.\n\nThe International Chamber of Shipping, representing more than 80 percent of the world’s fleet, also expressed disappointment.\n\n“Industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments needed to decarbonise the maritime sector,” the chamber’s Secretary-General Thomas Kazakos said in a statement.\n\nDisappointed, but still very much Committed!  https://t.co/7P192kAvCx\n\n— Thomas A. Kazakos (@ThomasKazakos)  October 17, 2025\n\nRalph Regenvanu, the minister for climate change for Vanuatu, said the decision to delay the vote by 12 months was “unacceptable given the urgency we face in light of accelerating climate change”.\n\n“But we know that we have  international law  on our side and will continue to fight for our people and the planet,” Regenvanu added.\n\nLeading up to Friday’s decision, China, the European Union, Brazil, Britain and several other members of the IMO had reaffirmed their support.\n\nCountries that opposed the measures included  Russia  and Saudi Arabia.\n\nA Russian delegate described the proceedings as “chaos” as he addressed the plenary on Friday after talks had lasted into the early hours.\n\nArgentina and Singapore, two countries that had previously voted in support of the framework in April, were among those that voted to postpone introducing it this week.\n\nIf it had been formally adopted this week, the Net Zero Framework (NZF) would have been the first global carbon-pricing system, charging ships a penalty of $380 per metric tonne on every extra tonne of CO2-equivalent they emit while rewarding vessels that reduce their emissions by using alternatives.\n\nThe framework plan is intended to help the IMO reach its target of cutting net emissions from international shipping by 20 percent by 2030 and eliminating them by 2050.\n\nClimate change is already beginning to affect shipping and the safety of seafarers, including by changing  ocean currents  and causing more frequent and  severe storms .\n\nProposals to reduce reliance on dirtier bunker fuel in the shipping industry include using ammonia and methanol, as well as fitting cargo ships with special sails."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/15/is-your-beef-linked-to-amazon-deforestation-a-report-highlights-loopholes","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-15","timeOfPublication":"13:18:36+00:00","title":"Is your beef linked to Amazon deforestation?

beef linked to Amazon deforestation? A report highlights loopholes\n\nThe world’s largest meat company, JBS, has allegedly fuelled illegal deforestation, land grabs and human rights abuses in the Brazilian Amazon by sourcing cattle from ranches operating inside protected areas, according to a new Human Rights Watch investigation.\n\nOn Wednesday, the nonprofit issued an 86-page report focusing on the state of Pará, where the United Nations will hold its annual climate change summit, COP30, next month.\n\nThe report highlights a gap in JBS’s supply chain: Human Rights Watch claims the meat company does not track its indirect cattle suppliers.\n\nInvestigators found that cattle raised on illegally deforested land were moved through a “laundering” system that concealed their origins before they reached JBS.\n\nThat, in turn, means JBS cannot guarantee that its beef or leather products are not contributing to deforestation and related abuses.\n\nWithout a better system for tracing livestock, JBS will continue to be “unable to root out illegal cattle ranches”, according to Luciana Téllez, a senior environment researcher at Human Rights Watch.\n\nAnd what JBS does not know could make it responsible for bankrolling illegal ranches that clear-cut the Amazon, she explained.\n\n“We cannot say with 100-percent certainty that the cattle that JBS purchased from its direct suppliers are the same ones that are coming from illegal cattle ranches, but neither can JBS,” Téllez told Al Jazeera.\n\n“That’s a problem, because they are responsible for what they are procuring.”\n\nWednesday’s report is part of an ever-growing body of literature delving into the impact agriculture has had on the Amazon rainforest.\n\nThe construction of ranches and farmland is considered the single biggest direct cause of deforestation in the world’s tropical regions.\n\nThe Amazon rainforest is no exception. In recent years, cattle ranching has emerged as a primary culprit in the levelling of its tangled, biodiverse jungles.\n\nThe northern state of Pará is key to the fight against further loss. It has consistently recorded the highest levels of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon since 2016.\n\nIn 2024 alone, 17,195 square kilometres (6,639 sq miles) of forest in the state were degraded, a 421-percent increase over the previous year, according to Human Rights Watch.\n\nThe state also reports the second-largest number of land conflicts in Brazil, with illegal ranchers, farmers and criminal groups seeking to invade protected land.\n\nFor Indigenous and traditional communities that consider the Amazon home, these invasions have been devastating. Residents have seen their crops destroyed, the forest burned, and their lives displaced.\n\nIn some cases, community members have even been threatened, attacked or killed after denouncing the land grabs.\n\nThough federal law prohibits such activity, some land-grabbers have succeeded in fraudulently registering protected rainforest as private properties.\n\nWednesday’s report documented encroachments in two protected areas: the Cachoeira Seca Indigenous territory and the Terra Nossa sustainable development area.\n\n“The level of violence and intimidation by land grabbers in Terra Nossa is truly frightening, and the absolute impunity they’ve enjoyed for years is astonishing,” Tellez told Al Jazeera.\n\nHuman Rights Watch said that Pará’s state animal health agency, Adepará, had registered ranches in both tracts of land. It also authorised the transportation of cattle in and out of the two areas.\n\nAccording to the report, Adepará claimed that it has not historically been tasked with observing environmental criteria when authorising livestock movements.\n\nBut with the state agency’s approval, Human Rights Watch said cattle were raised illegally inside the protected rainforest zones and then transferred out to other ranches.\n\nFrom there, they could reach major slaughterhouses, including JBS facilities.\n\nEach transfer helped obscure the cattle’s illegal origin, effectively laundering the animals into the meat trade.\n\nPart of the problem, according to Human Rights Watch, is Brazil’s system for tracking livestock.\n\nBrazil does not keep full histories of individual animals. Instead, their movements are documented with “animal transit permits”, known as Guias de Trânsito Animal or GTAs.\n\nThose permits collect information about overall shipments of animals: the number of cattle involved, plus data about the sex and the age of those in the group.\n\nBut without an individual record for every cow, calf and bull, it is difficult, if not impossible, to trace their origins.\n\nIn an April filing to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, JBS acknowledged the loopholes in how the GTA system traces cattle.\n\n“As a result, there can be no assurance that available monitoring procedures can ensure that the origin of any head of cattle was in full compliance with applicable laws,” JBS wrote.\n\nThe company has promised to require its suppliers to declare their suppliers by 2026. Yet, Human Rights Watch says it remains unclear how such information would be verified or enforced.\n\n“The best solution is for the federal government itself to institute a traceability mechanism for cattle across Brazil,” Tellez said. “The Brazilian government is moving towards that, but it’s moving extremely slowly.”\n\nJBS also made a similar commitment more than a decade and a half ago. In 2009, the company signed the G4 Cattle Agreement with environmental group Greenpeace, pledging to identify all its indirect suppliers by 2011. It failed to meet that deadline.\n\n“It’s unacceptable that companies such as JBS have not fulfilled the promises that they made in the past,” Cristiane Mazzetti, a forest campaign coordinator at Greenpeace Brazil, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“It’s something that now governments need to reflect upon and regulate in a more stringent way, because only believing in voluntary corporate commitments is not going to deliver.”\n\nJBS did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment by publication.\n\nBut reform may be on the horizon. In 2023, Pará’s governor introduced a decree requiring all animal movements in the state to be fully traceable by the end of 2026.\n\nAt the federal level, the Ministry of Agriculture announced a similar plan in December 2024, mandating that all states implement tracking systems by 2032.\n\nHowever, Human Rights Watch warns that this timeline is too slow and could allow illegal ranching to persist for years.\n\nExperts and advocacy groups say that Brazil should take immediate steps, including by making GTA data publicly accessible. Such measures would help law enforcement agencies identify fraudulent movements and trace cattle back to illegal ranches.\n\n“Companies struggle with traceability, firstly because they have minimal access to public data on the production chain,” said Lisandro Inakake, an agronomist with the Brazilian environmental nonprofit Imaflora.\n\nHe added that the struggle is compounded “because there are no universal market requirements covering all of the companies’ operations”.\n\nWhile Human Rights Watch has called on JBS to voluntarily start tracing the lifespan of its cattle, Mazzetti, the Greenpeace campaigner, believes more decisive action is necessary if deforestation is to be stopped.\n\n“It’s not time for new promises,” she said. “It’s time to be held accountable for all the impacts that their supply chain generated in the Amazon, in other ecosystems, and also on the climate.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/19/five-dead-two-missing-as-tropical-storm-fengshen-soaks-philippines","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"07:40:23+00:00","title":"Five dead, two missing as Tropical Storm Fengshen soaks Philippines","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tropical Storm Fengshen caused widespread flooding and landslides across the Philippines, resulting in at least five deaths and two missing persons.

“immediate ceasefire” after a week of deadly clashes along their border, as the ties between the two South Asian neighbours plunged to their lowest point since the Taliban returned to power in 2021.\n\nBoth countries agreed to stop fighting and work towards “lasting peace and stability” after peace talks in Doha, the Qatari Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Sunday, about the deal it mediated alongside Turkiye.\n\nDozens of people have been killed and hundreds wounded in the worst bout of violence in recent years. The violence erupted on October 11 at multiple fronts along their 2,600km (1,600-mile) border, after Islamabad allegedly carried out strikes in Kabul and the southeastern province of Paktika against what it said were armed groups linked to attacks inside Pakistan.\n\nSo, what do we know about the truce agreement and what might come next?\n\nAfter a round of negotiations between Pakistan and Afghanistan in the Qatari capital, Doha, “the two sides agreed to an immediate ceasefire and the establishment of mechanisms to consolidate lasting peace and stability between the two countries,” Qatar’s Foreign Ministry announced in a statement.\n\n“The two parties also agreed to hold follow-up meetings in the coming days to ensure the sustainability of the ceasefire and verify its implementation in a reliable and sustainable manner, thus contributing to achieving security and stability in both countries,” the statement added.\n\nFollowing the Qatari ministry’s statement, Pakistan’s Defence Minister Khawaja Asif posted confirmation of the deal on X.\n\n“Cross-border terrorism from Afghan territory will cease immediately,” Asif wrote. “Both countries will respect each other’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.”\n\nAsif further confirmed a “follow-up meeting between the delegations is scheduled to take place in the Turkish city of Istanbul on October 25 to discuss the matters in detail”.\n\nPakistan’s Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said the truce was “the first step in the right direction”.\n\n“We look forward to the establishment of a concrete and verifiable monitoring mechanism, in the next meeting to be hosted by Turkiye, to address the menace of terrorism emanating from Afghan soil towards Pakistan. It is important to put all efforts in place to prevent any further loss of lives,” he posted on X.\n\nZabihullah Mujahid, the Taliban spokesperson, said under the terms of the agreement, “both sides reaffirm their commitment to peace, mutual respect, and the maintenance of strong and constructive neighbourly relations”.\n\n“Both sides are committed to resolving issues and disputes through dialogue,” Mujahid said in a post on X. “It has been decided that neither country will undertake any hostile actions against the other, nor will they support groups carrying out attacks against the Government of Pakistan.”\n\nMujahid said the countries have agreed on refraining “from targeting each other’s security forces, civilians, or critical infrastructure”.\n\nMujahid, as well as Dar and Asif, thanked Qatar and Turkiye for their role in facilitating the talks that led to the ceasefire.\n\nElizabeth Threlkeld, director of the South Asia programme at the Stimson Center, said she was sceptical about the durability of the ceasefire.\n\n“There are multiple actors in the scenario. The TTP and other groups aligned with it are not party to these talks [in Doha]. So they are not necessarily subject to the agreement,” she told Al Jazeera, using the commonly used acronym for the Pakistan Taliban group.\n\n“So, the onus falls on the Afghan Taliban to take action and curtail their activities. That’s going to be extremely challenging due to the incredibly porous border. Even with Pakistan’s efforts to put up fencing, it’s really difficult to have the capacity and manpower to be able to shut down these sorts of infiltrations.\n\n“It will be challenging for the Taliban to rein in the TTP, assuming that they have the best of intentions,” Threlkeld added.\n\nPakistan wants the Taliban to rein in armed groups such as the Pakistan Taliban and others blamed for carrying out attacks on its territory. Armed attacks by the TTP and the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), which operates in the resource-rich Balochistan province, have surged in recent years, with 2025 on track to become the deadliest year.\n\nKhyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, which border Afghanistan, have borne the brunt of the violence.\n\nAt least 2,414 deaths have been recorded in the first three quarters of this year, according to the Center for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), an Islamabad-based think tank.\n\nPakistan and the Taliban, once allies over shared regional security interests, have fallen out as Islamabad claims that Afghanistan is giving haven to the TTP – an allegation Kabul has rejected.\n\nKabul and Islamabad have also  clashed  over their international border, called the Durand Line, which is recognised by Pakistan but not by Afghanistan.\n\nJavaid Ur-Rahman, an investigative journalist with Pakistan’s The Nation newspaper, said the TTP is using Afghan soil, adding the Taliban government has failed to control it.\n\n“During the Doha talks, Pakistan made it clear that it will not tolerate cross-border terrorism originating from Afghanistan,” Rahman told Al Jazeera.\n\nTTP’s ideology is aligned with the Taliban in Afghanistan. However, the groups have different goals and operate independently.\n\nPakistan has sought assurances from the Taliban that these groups, which operate in the porous border regions with Afghanistan, will not be allowed to operate freely and that the attacks across the border will cease.\n\nIn a post later on Sunday, Mujahid stressed that Afghan soil “will not be allowed to be used against any other country”. It is “the consistent stance of the Islamic Emirate”, he said, referring to the official name of the interim Afghan government under the Taliban.\n\n“It does not support any attack against anyone and has always emphasised this stance,” he posted on X.\n\nIslamabad also wants the Taliban to prevent the regrouping or expansion of anti-Pakistan networks within Afghanistan, which the government considers a threat to Pakistan’s stability and broader regional strategy.\n\nAbdullah Baheer, a political analyst based in Kabul, said the bombing of Afghanistan and killing of civilians is “a problematic model”.\n\n“Show me one piece of evidence that shows they hit any TTP operative in Afghanistan in the past week of bombing, despite the 50-odd dead and 550 injured,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nHe added that the TTP is a local rebel group within Pakistan that far precedes the Taliban’s coming to power in Afghanistan. “Are you expecting the Taliban to come forth and stop the TTP from pursuing any of its political or military goals?” he asked.\n\n“Let’s take the argument that TTP are operating from safe havens within Afghanistan. The question is, you mistake influence over a group that is an independent group to an extent of controlling them,” he added.\n\nAs previously mentioned, the Taliban denies providing a haven to TTP within Afghanistan’s borders.\n\nIslamabad was the prime backer of the Taliban after it was removed by the United States-led NATO troops in 2001. It was also accused of providing a haven to Taliban fighters as they waged an armed rebellion against the US occupation of Afghanistan for 20 years.\n\nBut relations have soured over the surge in attacks inside Pakistan.\n\nThe TTP has re-emerged as one of Pakistan’s biggest national security threats, as it has conducted more than 600 attacks against Pakistani forces in the past year, according to a report by the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data (ACLED), an independent nonprofit.\n\nAccording to the CRSS, the first three quarters of this year have seen a 46 percent surge in violence compared with last year.\n\nThe violence attributed to the TTP had decreased from its peak in the late 2000s and early 2010s after Islamabad involved the armed groups in talks and addressed some of their demands in 2021, which include the release of their members from prison and an end to military operations in the tribal areas.\n\nThe TTP also demanded the reversal of the 2018 merger of the tribal region with the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. A stricter imposition of their interpretation of Islamic law is also one of their demands.\n\nA month after the Taliban took over Kabul in August 2021, it mediated talks between the Pakistani military and the TTP, a decision endorsed and pushed by Imran Khan, Pakistan’s then-prime minister. But Khan, who championed talks with the armed groups, was removed as prime minister in April 2022.\n\nViolence surged after the TTP unilaterally walked out of the ceasefire deal in 2022, accusing Islamabad of renewed military operations in the region.\n\nSince its founding in 2007, the TTP has targeted civilians and law enforcement personnel, resulting in thousands of deaths.

Wasiyat Khan was woken up by a loud explosion in the middle of the night, he thought “the mountains had burst” and a landslide was on its way.\n\nAccompanied by his family, Wasiyat, a shepherd from Roshan valley of Ghizer, in northern Pakistan’s mountainous Gilgit-Baltistan region, had taken his livestock to elevated land for grazing on a sojourn during the warmer months.\n\nSoon enough, as the family sought immediate safety, he realised the explosion was the sound of a glacier bursting. As their temporary accommodation was being swept away by the floodwaters, Wasiyat thought of the villages which lay in the water’s path.\n\nAt more than 3,000 metres in the darkness of the night, outside help was impossible to get. He immediately jumped across boulders and reached a designated spot where he could get mobile phone signals and alerted the villagers, who numbered about 300.\n\n“Within 30 minutes, we got a call back saying the villagers had evacuated safely and no lives were lost,” Wasiyat told local media. “While they were safe, we were left with nothing, not even a matchstick to keep us warm near the glaciers. It was very cold and we were suffering.\n\n“When we were rescued hours later and taken back to the village, we found out that all our houses and land were covered by mud, but no lives were lost.”\n\nThe glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) is a common occurrence in northern Pakistan, home to an estimated 13,000 glaciers. As global warming worsens, the effect of more glaciers melting is “likely to be significant” this year, Pakistan’s disaster management authority, NDMA, had said in March.\n\nIn its latest assessment, the NDMA says snowfall across Pakistan in the coming months is projected to be less than average, particularly in areas like Gilgit-Baltistan, reducing overall snow accumulation. A reduced snow cover, it fears, would accelerate glacier retreat by exposing ice earlier in the season, making high-altitude regions more vulnerable to GLOFs.\n\nTo prevent such occurrences, the government mainly relies on its early warning systems (EWS), which help in reducing loss of life and injury, economic losses, protecting critical infrastructure, and enhancing climate resilience.\n\nAn EWS functions through an interconnected process made up of sensors and gauges that collect real-time data monitored by meteorologists and experts to not only warn of a current hazard, but also predict a disaster. Dozens of EWS sites across the most climate-vulnerable valleys in Gilgit-Baltistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are currently transmitting real-time data to the Pakistan Meteorological Department.\n\nBut residents in northern Pakistan say they are more reliant on Indigenous human knowledge instead of the EWS technology.\n\nMohammad Hussain, a shepherd in Gilgit-Baltistan’s Skardu Valley, told Al Jazeera about an incident when he was inside his stone hut during the summer. After nearly an hour of rainfall, he witnessed strong lightning followed by an unusual roaring sound.\n\nAs he stepped out of the hut to gather his cattle, he saw a powerful flash flood, carrying enormous boulders and uprooting large trees. Acting quickly, he alerted the villagers, which ensured safe evacuation before the floodwaters reached.\n\nHe recounted stories shared by his grandfather, who said people relied on large signal fires, gunfire or specific sound patterns to alert others. Natural signs such as sudden heavy rainfall, cloud formations, unusual animal behaviour, and distinct roaring sounds are still being used to predict flash floods in the absence of the EWS.\n\nIn one incident, he attempted to light a fire to alert villagers below, but, due to daylight and heavy rain, it was ineffective. He then fired his gun three times, a pre-agreed signal indicating danger. Villagers who heard the gunfire raised alarms through the mosque’s loudspeaker, initiating a rapid evacuation.\n\nAlthough there were significant economic losses, there were no casualties, demonstrating the effectiveness of this “human EWS”.\n\nPakistan ranks among the top 10 most climate-vulnerable nations, even though it contributes less than 1 percent of global emissions. The World Bank said in 2023 that the mean temperature in Pakistan since the 1950s has risen by 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.34 degrees Fahrenheit), which is twice as fast as the global mean change.\n\nThe country’s climate change minister, Musadiq Malik,  recently told Al Jazeera  that “when these [glacial] floods hit, they cause immense mortality, morbidity and widespread displacement,” adding that “it’s a harsh reality we face.” Pakistan faced nearly 90 such floods between 2019 and 2022.\n\nDespite spending millions on EWS and its implementation, there has been widespread lack of trust placed in it by a number of communities, due to frequent reports of malfunctioning of equipment and lack of follow-ups by the concerned agencies.\n\nA report in Pakistan’s Friday Times in June this year said “despite launching the $37m GLOF-II project in 2017, with new gauges, sirens, and local training, no real-time link connects human sensors in villages to official rescue teams.”\n\nThe report warned that “technology alone won’t save lives if SOPs sit buried, rescue checklists gather dust, and trust is missing on the ground.”\n\nSome villagers Al Jazeera spoke to in Gilgit-Baltistan echoed that sentiment, speaking of their lack of trust in the equipment, questioning its effectiveness, and sharing concerns that these systems have not worked. They also slammed officials for falsely taking credit for the system’s effectiveness in saving lives.\n\n“Residents say the EWS in Gilgit-Baltistan have been installed without taking the local authorities and communities into confidence, which was the reason they could not play an effective role,” Zaki Abbas, an Islamabad-based journalist who writes on climate change, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Last year, I was told by a local activist that up to 20 systems had been installed at various spots, but they had not been operational for different reasons. This controversy surrounding this issue had also echoed in the GB legislative assembly, with the opposition leaders in the region most recently demanding an investigation into the failure of these systems. However, no such probe was ordered.\n\n“Their ineffectiveness can be gauged by the fact that warnings about GLOFs have come from people, most recently a shepherd whose timely call saved an entire village, instead of these systems on which billions of rupees have been spent.”\n\nAddressing the challenges remains a task for the government and partners involved in the implementation of EWS. The UNDP said in February this year that “limited financial resources, technical capacity, data gaps and uncertainties, communication barriers, weak institutional capacities, and complex and evolving climate risks” are just some of the issues facing EWS globally.\n\nWhen Wasiyat and two other shepherds from Ghizer were given $28,000 each in August by Pakistan’s prime minister as rewards for saving hundreds of lives, they were told that “this act of courage and responsibility will be written in golden words.”\n\nAs unpredictable rains, snow patterns and melting glaciers continue to affect Pakistan, especially the northern areas, it seems residents are more likely to rely on these “heroes” in the absence of widespread EWS and the community’s trust in them.\n\nThis story was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/20/japan-to-vote-for-new-pm-amid-political-uncertainty-all-you-need-to-know","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"02:06:11+00:00","title":"Japan to vote for new PM amid political uncertainty: All you need to know","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Japan is facing a political crisis as the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), having lost its majority due to corruption scandals and economic instability, prepares to vote on a new prime minister.

need to know\n\nThe Japanese legislature, known as the Diet, is set to meet for an extraordinary session to vote for the next prime minister.\n\nThe vote on Tuesday follows the collapse of a 26-year-old partnership earlier this month between the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the smaller Komeito party after  Sanae Takaichi  took the helm of the LDP.\n\nThe LDP has been the dominant force in Japanese politics since the 1950s, but over the past two years, it has lost its majority in both legislative houses after failing to address a series of problems, including a major corruption scandal and Japan’s cost-of-living crisis.\n\nNow, the LDP is at risk of losing power completely unless it can bring another opposition party to its side.\n\nSome Japanese media reports suggested on Sunday that the LDP had reached an agreement with the Japan Innovation Party (Nippon Ishin) to form a coalition that would ensure that Takaichi is elected prime minister. But details of the partnership remain unclear, and the two sides have yet to confirm it.\n\nWho is Sanae Takaichi, and why is she controversial?\n\nTakaichi, 64, is the former protege of late Prime Minister  Shinzo Abe  and a member of the LDP’s conservative faction.\n\nShe was chosen to replace Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba as head of the LDP after he stepped down in September. Takaichi ran on a platform of aggressive fiscal expansion to resolve Japan’s ongoing economic problems.\n\nTakaichi is also known as a foreign policy hawk who wants to strengthen Japan’s military, and she holds conservative views on same-sex marriage.\n\nFollowing her election as LDP leader on October 4, the LDP and Komeito held policy negotiations. They hit an impasse when Takaichi failed to address Komeito’s concerns about corporate donations, according to Jeffrey Hall, a lecturer at Japan’s Kanda University of International Studies.\n\nThe disagreement follows a recent LDP scandal that revealed that party members had diverted more than 600 million yen (approximately $4m) of donations to a slush fund.\n\n“[Takaichi] didn’t give them what they considered a serious answer on their concerns about corruption scandals, and they wanted more serious regulations around funding, especially corporate donations,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nCan Takaichi still become the next prime minister?\n\nTakaichi still has the chance to become Japan’s first female prime minister, but experts say it will take some horse-trading.\n\nThe LDP has 196 seats in the lower house of the Diet, and Takaichi needs at least 233 seats to secure a majority. She could do this by negotiating with one of Japan’s other opposition parties, like the Japan Innovation Party.\n\nConversely, if opposition parties worked together, they could form a new government, but experts like Kazuto Suzuki, a professor at the University of Tokyo’s Graduate School of Public Policy, say this would be challenging due to ideological disagreements.\n\nThe situation is very different from 2009, when the LDP last lost power, to a unified opposition, for three years.\n\n“If the opposition is able to rally for the unified candidate, it is possible that Takaichi will lose, but more likely, Takaichi will win not by majority but as the first of the two candidates [in a run-off vote],” Suzuki said.\n\n“But even if Takaichi wins, she is based on a very small minority,” he said. “It will be extremely difficult for Takaichi and the LDP to conduct policies of their own.”\n\nWho could challenge Takaichi for the top job?\n\nExperts say that Takaichi’s most likely challenger is Yuichiro Tamaki, 56, the leader of the conservative Democratic Party for the People (DPFP).\n\nWhile the party holds 27 seats, it could secure a majority if it cooperated with the centre-left Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDP), which holds 148 seats, and the Japan Innovation Party, which holds 35 seats.\n\nThe DPFP and the CDP were once part of the same party but split due to ideological differences over foreign policy and the future of Japan’s military.\n\nThe Japan Innovation Party and the DPP also clash over policies like economic reform and deregulation, according to Stephen Nagy, a professor of politics and international studies at Japan’s International Christian University.\n\n“There are a lot of contradictory positions that will make it unlikely they can form a coalition,” Nagy said.\n\nIn a more likely scenario, the Japan Innovation Party will form a coalition with the LDP, he said. They share views on major policy concerns like the United States, China,  Taiwan , immigration, and the future of the imperial family.\n\nWhat does this mean for Japan and the LDP?\n\nExperts say the LDP will likely retain its hold over the government for now, but Takaichi will be a much weaker prime minister than many of her predecessors.\n\n“The bigger question is whether she will survive more than a year, and there are external factors like the US relationship and [US President Donald]  Trump’s unpredictability , and internal factors such as the direction of the economy and whether she’ll make decisions about Yasukuni shrine,” said Nagy, referring to the shrine to Japan’s war dead that includes war criminals.\n\nTakaichi will also have to find a way to work with Japan’s other parties, and that means negotiating or softening her stance on more controversial policies.\n\nKanda University’s Hall said this could be a watershed moment for Japanese politics, especially if the opposition parties can retain their support from voters.\n\n“We have a situation where there are several centre-right parties, there’s a far-right party, and there are a few smaller left-wing parties. There just simply isn’t the math for one party to put together a stable coalition with a partner that agrees with it on the big issues,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\n“With this kind of multi-party democracy, they’re going to have new norms develop, where parties are more willing to compromise if they want to form a government – and if they don’t… then we’ll see no-confidence votes that oust prime ministers,” he said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/19/live-israel-kills-97-palestinians-in-gaza-since-start-of-ceasefire?update=4047286","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"23:58:41Z","title":"Israel kills 97 Palestinians in Gaza since start of ceasefire","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Since the start of the ceasefire, Israel has killed 97 Palestinians in Gaza, with the Gaza Government Media Office reporting that Israel has breached the truce 80 times, including 21 violations on Sunday.

States President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Monday, Zelenskyy said he would take part if he were invited. The Ukrainian president is wary of the setting for the meeting in Budapest, given Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s warm relations with Moscow and antagonistic approach to Kyiv.\n\n“If I am invited to Budapest – if it is an invitation in a format where we meet as three or, as it’s called, shuttle diplomacy, President Trump meets with Putin and President Trump meets with me – then in one format or another, we will agree,” Zelenskyy said.\n\nNo date has been set for the summit in the Hungarian capital, although it is thought likely to be held in the coming weeks.\n\nTrump continues to try to force an end to the fighting, which has been ongoing since Russia invaded its neighbour in February 2022.\n\nThe US leader has not presented any detailed proposals, and wavers in his approach. But he has grown increasingly frustrated with faltering peace efforts.\n\nIn recent months, he expressed disappointment at Putin for not making meaningful concessions after the two met in Alaska in August. He has floated the idea that the US could  send Ukraine long-range Tomahawk missiles , a move Moscow said would escalate the conflict.\n\nIn late September, Trump said he believes Ukraine  could win back all its territory  with help from the European Union and NATO.\n\nHowever, this week, he changed tune again following a phone call with Putin, and called for  freezing the current battle lines .\n\nZelenskyy, who reportedly had a  tense discussion with Trump  at the White House on Friday, said he accepts the idea of freezing the front lines but urged the US to exert more pressure on Moscow.\n\n“After many rounds of discussion over more than two hours with [Trump] and his team, his message, in my view, is positive – that we stand where we stand on the front line,” Zelenskyy said on Sunday.\n\nLooking ahead to the Budapest summit, Zelenskyy voiced concern about the host.\n\nOrban, the closest EU leader to Russia, has persistently sought to disrupt Kyiv’s efforts to secure Western support and has tried to  block aid from the bloc to Ukraine  on several occasions.\n\nZelenskyy said he doubts Orban “can do anything positive for Ukrainians” or “provide a balanced contribution”.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday that Budapest was chosen as the venue for the summit because Trump has warm relations with Orban and Putin has constructive relations with Orban.\n\nHowever, it is also notable that the International Criminal Court (ICC) has issued a warrant for Putin’s arrest on war crimes charges.\n\nHungary launched the process of leaving the ICC as it hosted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has also been indicted as a war criminal, earlier this year.\n\nBudapest has pledged that the Russian leader will not be arrested.\n\nZelenskyy also cautioned against another “Budapest scenario” – a reference to the 1994 Budapest Memorandum – in which Moscow and other powers provided security assurances to Ukraine and other former Soviet states in exchange for their giving up the nuclear arsenals they inherited from Soviet times.\n\nEuropean foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas expressed disappointment with Hungary over Putin’s potential visit within the bloc.\n\n“It’s not nice to see that a person under [an] ICC arrest warrant is coming to a European country,” Kallas said as she arrived at a meeting of EU foreign ministers.\n\nLithuania’s Foreign Minister Kestutis Budrys asserted: “The only place for Putin in Europe is The Hague, in front of the tribunal, not in any of our capitals.”\n\nKallas added that another round of EU sanctions on Russia, the 19th overall, would likely be approved this week.\n\nKremlin spokesman Peskov told reporters that work on the summit was only just beginning.\n\nHe added a claim that while Russia is engaged in serious work with the US to seek a peace deal, Ukraine is sending contradictory signals that make the process harder."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/19/live-israel-kills-97-palestinians-in-gaza-since-start-of-ceasefire","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"23:58:41+00:00","title":"Israel kills 97 Palestinians in Gaza since start of ceasefire","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Since the start of a ceasefire, Israel has killed 97 Palestinians in Gaza and has repeatedly violated the truce agreement—reportedly 80 times overall, including 21 violations on Sunday—according to the Gaza Government Media Office.

Democratic Party (PDC) as their new president,  ending almost 20 years of governance  by the Movement for Socialism (MAS) party.\n\nWith 97 percent of ballots counted, Paz had won 54.5 percent of the vote in Sunday’s run-off race, well ahead of right-wing former interim President Jorge “Tuto” Quiroga, with 45.4 percent of the vote, according to the country’s Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE).\n\nPaz, 58, followed his father, former left-wing President Jaime Zamora, into politics.\n\nAfter studying economics in the United States, Paz returned home to Bolivia, where he went on to become a city councillor and mayor of the southern city of Tarija, before becoming a senator for the region in 2020.\n\nHe has pledged a “capitalism for all” approach, promising tax cuts, tariff reductions, and the decentralisation of the national government.\n\nAfter the results were announced, Paz’s vice-presidential running mate, Edmand Lara, made a call for “unity and reconciliation”.\n\n“We must ensure the supply of diesel and gasoline. People are suffering. We need to stabilise the prices of the basic food basket, and we must put an end to corruption,” Lara said.\n\nSunday’s run-off came after the incumbent MAS party suffered a major defeat in August’s preliminary election, after former left-wing President Evo Morales was barred from running and outgoing President Luis Arce, who had fallen out with Morales, opted out of the race.\n\nCourts had ruled against Morales’s candidacy over term limits and technicalities related to party affiliation.\n\nThe division within their left-wing coalition, along with the country’s  deep economic crisis,  meant few expected MAS to return to power.\n\nOutside of the National Congress, the new president will still face stiff opposition from Morales, who remains popular, especially among Indigenous Bolivians.\n\nOn Sunday, Morales told reporters that the two candidates each represented only “a handful of people in Bolivia”.\n\n“They do not represent the popular movement, much less the Indigenous movement,” he said.\n\nArce is due to leave office on November 8 after serving a single presidential term that began in 2020. Bolivia’s constitution allows for two terms, but he did not seek re-election.\n\nThe Andean country has been struggling through an economic crisis, including annual inflation of almost 25 percent and critical shortages of US dollars and fuel.\n\nBolivians took to the streets to protest high prices and hours-long waits for fuel, bread and other basics in the lead-up to the August 17 general election.\n\nBolivia had enjoyed more than a decade of strong growth and Indigenous upliftment under Morales, who nationalised the gas sector and ploughed the proceeds into social programmes that halved extreme poverty during his stint in power between 2006 and 2019.\n\nBut after Morales, who was outspoken on environmental issues and  climate change , chose not to expand the country’s gas sector, energy revenues fell from a peak of $6.1bn in 2013 to $1.6bn in 2024, seeing the government run out of foreign exchange needed to import fuel, wheat and other foodstuffs.\n\nMeanwhile, Paz has been unclear about whether he plans to continue a fuel subsidy that has cost the government billions of dollars, at times saying he will restrict it to “vulnerable sectors” of the population."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/19/live-israel-kills-97-palestinians-in-gaza-since-start-of-ceasefire?update=4047373","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"23:58:41Z","title":"Israel kills 97 Palestinians in Gaza since start of ceasefire","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Since the start of a ceasefire, Israel has killed 97 Palestinians in Gaza, with the Gaza Government Media Office reporting 80 ceasefire breaches, including 21 on Sunday.

concerned?\n\nSeveral wealthy Italian businessmen received a surprising phone call earlier this year. The speaker, who sounded just like Defence Minister Guido Crosetto, had a special request: Please send money to help us free kidnapped Italian journalists in the Middle East.\n\nBut it was not Crosetto at the end of the line. He learned about the call only when several of the targeted businessmen contacted him about it. It eventually transpired that fraudsters had used artificial intelligence (AI) to fake Crosetto’s voice.\n\nAdvances in AI technology mean it is now possible to generate ultrarealistic voiceovers and soundbites. Indeed, new research has found that AI-generated voices are now indistinguishable from real human voices. In this explainer, we unpack what the implications of this could be.\n\nSeveral Italian entrepreneurs and businessmen received calls at the start of February, one month after Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni had secured the release of Italian journalist  Cecilia Sala , who had been imprisoned in Iran.\n\nIn the calls, the  “deepfake”  voice of Crosetto asked the businessmen to wire approximately 1 million euros ($1.17m) to an overseas bank account, the details of which were provided during the call or in other calls purporting to be from members of Crosetto’s staff.\n\nOn February 6, Crosetto posted on X, saying he had received a call on February 4 from “a friend, a prominent entrepreneur”. That friend asked Crosetto if his office had called to ask for his mobile number. Crosetto said it had not. “I tell him it was absurd, as I already had it, and that it was impossible,” he wrote in his X post.\n\nCrosetto added that he was later contacted by another businessman who had made a large bank transfer following a call from a “General” who provided bank account information.\n\n“He calls me and tells me that he was contacted by me and then by a General, and that he had made a very large bank transfer to an account provided by the ‘General’. I tell him it’s a scam and inform the carabinieri [Italian police], who go to his house and take his complaint.”\n\nSimilar calls from fake Ministry of Defence officials were also made to other entrepreneurs, asking for personal information and money.\n\nWhile he has reported all this to the police, Crosetto added: “I prefer to make the facts public so that no one runs the risk of falling into the trap.”\n\nSome of Italy’s most prominent business figures, including late fashion designer Giorgio Armani and Prada cofounder Patrizio Bertelli, were targeted in the scam. But, according to the authorities, only Massimo Moratti, the former owner of Inter Milan football club, actually sent the requested money. The police were able to trace and freeze the money from the wire transfer he made.\n\nMoratti has since filed a legal complaint with the city’s prosecutor’s office. He told Italian media: “I filed the complaint, of course, but I’d prefer not to talk about it and see how the investigation goes .  It all seemed real. They were good. It could happen to anyone.”\n\nAI voice generators typically use “deep learning” algorithms, through which the AI program studies large data sets of real human voices and “learns” pitch, enunciation, intonation and other elements of a voice.\n\nThe AI program is trained using several audio clips of the same person and is “taught” to mimic that specific person’s voice, accent and style of speaking. The generated voice or audio is also called an AI-generated voice clone.\n\nUsing natural language processing (NLP) programs, which instruct it to understand, interpret and generate human language, AI can even learn to understand tonal features of a voice, such as sarcasm or curiosity.\n\nThese programs can convert text to phonetic components and then generate a synthetic voice clip that sounds like a real human.\n\n“Broadly speaking, we can train an AI model with thousands and thousands of hours of recordings of human voice, so the model can learn what human voices in general sound like,” Nadine Lavan, a senior lecturer in psychology at Queen Mary University of London, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“That is then for model from which you can create AI-generated voices, either by just asking the model to go and generate a voice that has no real human counterpart or by giving the model an example of a voice and telling it to clone that voice, to create an AI-generated version of that specific voice or a deepfake,” Lavan, who is one of the coauthors of the recent research on AI voice, said.\n\nThe term  “deepfake”  was coined in 2014 by Ian Goodfellow, director of machine learning at Apple Special Projects Group. It combines “deep learning” and “fake”, and refers to highly realistic AI images, videos or audio, all generated through deep learning.\n\nResearch conducted by a team at Queen Mary University of London and published by the science journal PLOS One on September 24 concluded that AI-generated voices do sound like real human voices to people listening to them.\n\nIn order to conduct the research, the team generated 40 samples of AI voices – both using real people’s voices and creating entirely new voices – using a tool called ElevenLabs. The researchers also collected 40 recording samples of people’s actual voices. All 80 of these clips were edited and cleaned for quality.\n\nThe research team used male and female voices with British, American, Australian and Indian accents in the samples. ElevenLabs offers an “African” accent as well, but the researchers found that the accent label was “too general for our purposes”.\n\nThe team recruited 50 participants aged 18-65 in the United Kingdom for the tests. They were asked to listen to the recordings to try to distinguish between the AI voices and the real human voices. They were also asked which voices sounded more trustworthy.\n\nThe study found that while the “new” voices generated entirely by AI were less convincing to the participants, the deepfakes or voice clones were rated about equally realistic as the real human voices.\n\nForty-one percent of AI-generated voices and 58 percent of voice clones were mistaken for real human voices.\n\nAdditionally, the participants were more likely to rate British-accented voices as real or human compared with those with American accents, suggesting that the AI voices are extremely sophisticated.\n\nMore worrying, the participants tended to rate the AI-generated voices as more trustworthy than the real human voices. This contrasts with previous research, which usually found AI voices less trustworthy, signalling, again, that AI has become particularly sophisticated at generating fake voices.\n\n“One likely explanation for why state-of-the-art AI voice generation has become much more sophisticated recently might be that the models are now trained on vast, high-quality training data sets,” Lavan said.\n\n“That just means that the models get much more information about how voices work, such that it can build up a more detailed picture,” Lavan said. She explained that AI can create more realistic voices by mimicking different accents, intonation, speaking patterns, even breathing sounds and speech errors.\n\nWhile AI-generated audio that sounds very “human” can be useful for industries such as advertising and film editing, it can be misused in scams and to generate fake news.\n\nScams similar to the one that targeted the Italian businessmen are already on the rise. In the United States, there have been reports of people receiving calls featuring deepfake voices of their relatives saying they are in trouble and requesting money.\n\nBetween January and June this year, people all over the world have lost more than $547.2m to deepfake scams, according to data by the California-based AI company Resemble AI. Showing an upward trend, the figure rose from about $200m in the first quarter to $347m in the second.\n\n“If it only takes a few minutes [or even a few seconds] of recording of a voice to clone it in a reasonably convincing manner, one obvious concern for highly realistic AI-generated voices is identity theft,” Lavan said.\n\nHowever, Lavan added that there are positive ways AI-generated voices are being used.\n\n“Beyond risks, though, one of the most promising and compassionate applications of AI-generated voice technology is its potential to restore voices for individuals who can no longer speak, or who have limited control over their physical voice,” Lavan said.\n\n“Today, users can choose to recreate their original voice, if that’s what they prefer, or design a completely new voice that reflects their identity and personal taste.”\n\nAlarmingly, yes. AI programs can be used to generate deepfake videos of real people. This, combined with AI-generated audio, means video clips of people doing and saying things they have not done can be faked very convincingly.\n\nFurthermore, it is becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish which videos on the internet are real and which are fake.\n\nDeepMedia, a company working on tools to detect synthetic media, estimates that about eight million deepfakes will have been created and shared online by the end of this year – a huge increase from the 500,000 that were shared online in 2023.\n\nBesides the phone call fraud and fake news, AI deepfakes have been used to create sexual content about real people. Most worryingly, Resemble AI’s report, which was released in July, found that advances in AI have resulted in the industrialised production of AI-generated child sexual abuse material, which has overwhelmed law enforcement globally.\n\nIn May this year, US President Donald Trump  signed a bill  making it a federal crime to publish intimate images of a person without their consent. This includes AI-generated deepfakes. Last month, the Australian government also announced that it would ban an application used to create deepfake nude images."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/tag/science-and-technology/","dateOfPublication":"1910-10-20","timeOfPublication":"19:00:00Z","title":"Today's latest from Al Jazeera: Science and Technology","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article covers a range of science and technology developments, including the awarding of a Nobel Prize to chemist Omar M.

States of “double standards” after US President Donald Trump threatened to impose an additional 100 percent tariff on Chinese goods in response to Beijing’s curbs on exports of rare earth minerals.\n\nChina says its export control measures  announced  last week were in response to the US restrictions on its entities and targeting of Beijing’s maritime, logistics and shipbuilding industries.\n\nTrump’s tariff threats, which come weeks before the likely meeting between the US president and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, have the potential to reignite a trade war, months after Washington lowered the China tariffs from 125 to 30 percent.\n\nThe actions by the world’s two largest economies threaten to ignite a new trade war, adding further uncertainty to global trade. So what’s the recent history of US trade measures against China, and will the two countries be able to resolve their differences?\n\nOn October 9, China expanded export controls to cover 12 out of 17 rare-earth metals and certain refining equipment, effective December 1, after accusing Washington of harming China’s interests and undermining “the atmosphere of bilateral economic and trade talks”.\n\nChina also placed restrictions on the export of specialist technological equipment used to refine rare-earth metals on Thursday.\n\nBeijing justified its measures, accusing Washington of imposing a series of trade curbs on Chinese entities despite the two sides being engaged in trade talks, with the last one taking place in Madrid, Spain, last month.\n\nForeign companies now need Beijing’s approval to export products containing Chinese rare earths, and must disclose their intended use. China said the heightened restrictions come as a result of national security interests.\n\nChina has a near monopoly over rare earths, critical for the manufacture of technology such as electric cars, smartphones, semiconductors and weapons.\n\nThe US is a major consumer of Chinese rare earths, which are crucial for its defence industry.\n\nAt the end of this month, Trump and Xi are expected to meet in South Korea, and experts speculate that Beijing’s move was to gain a bargaining advantage in trade negotiations with Washington.\n\nChina’s tightening of restrictions on rare earths is “pre-meeting choreography” before Trump’s meeting with Xi, Kristin Vekasi, the Mansfield chair of Japan and Indo-Pacific Affairs at the University of Montana, told Al Jazeera.\n\nOn October 10, Trump announced the imposition of a 100 percent tariff on China, effective from November 1.\n\n“Based on the fact that China has taken this unprecedented position … the United States of America will impose a Tariff of 100 percent on China, over and above any Tariff that they are currently paying,” Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform.\n\nHe added that this would come into effect on November 1 or before that. Trump added that the US would also impose export controls on “any and all critical software”.\n\nEarlier on October 10, Trump accused China of “trade hostility” and even said he might scrap his meeting with Xi. It is unclear at this point whether the meeting will take place.\n\n“What the United States has is we have a lot of leverage, and my hope, and I know the president’s hope, is that we don’t have to use that leverage,” US Vice President JD Vance told Fox News on Sunday.\n\nChina deemed the US retaliation a “double standard”, according to remarks by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce spokesperson on Sunday.\n\nChina said Washington had “overstretched the concept of national security, abused export control measures” and “adopted discriminatory practices against China”.\n\n“We are living in an era of deeper intertwining of security and economic policies. Both the US and China have expanded their conceptions of national security, encompassing a range of economic activities,” Manoj Kewalramani, chairperson of the Indo-Pacific Studies Programme at the Takshashila Institution in Bangalore, India, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Both have also weaponised economic interdependence with each other and third parties. There are, in other words, no saints in this game.”\n\nKewalramani said China started expanding the idea of “national security” much earlier than others, especially with its “comprehensive national security concept” introduced in 2014.\n\nThrough this, China began to include many different areas, such as economics, technology, and society, under the term “national security”. This shows that China was ahead of other countries in broadening what counts as a national security issue.\n\nChina threatened additional measures if Trump went ahead with his pledge.\n\n“Willful threats of high tariffs are not the right way to get along with China. China’s position on the trade war is consistent: We do not want it, but we are not afraid of it,” the Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson said in a statement.\n\n“Should the US persist in its course, China will resolutely take corresponding measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,” the statement said.\n\n“US policy explicitly targets Chinese firms linked to the military or advanced technology sectors. Whether that’s justified national security screening or discrimination is a matter of framing, but the policy design is undeniably China-specific,” Vekasi said.\n\nA month after taking office for his second term, Trump signed an executive order imposing a 10 percent tariff on all imports from China, citing a trade deficit in favour of China. In this order, he also imposed tariffs on Mexico and Canada. China levied countermeasures, imposing duties on US products in retaliation.\n\nIn March, the US president doubled the tariff on all Chinese products to 20 percent as of March 4. China imposed a 15 percent tariff on a range of US farm exports in retaliation; these took effect on March 10.\n\nTrump announced his  “reciprocal tariffs” , imposing a 34 percent tariff on Chinese products. China retaliated, also announcing a 34 percent tariff on US products. This was the first time China announced export controls on rare earths.\n\nHours after the reciprocal tariffs went into effect, Trump paused them for all his tariff targets except China. The US and China continued to hike tit-for-tat levies on each other.\n\nTrump slapped 145 percent tariffs on Chinese imports, prompting China to hit back with 125 percent tariffs. Washington and Beijing later cut tariffs to 30 percent and 10 percent, respectively, in May, then agreed to a 90-day truce in August for trade talks. The truce has been extended twice.\n\nIn December 2024, Trump’s predecessor, former US President Joe Biden, tightened controls on the sale of microchips first introduced in October 2022.\n\nUnder the new controls, 140 companies from China, Japan, South Korea and Singapore were added to a list of restricted entities. The US also banned more advanced chip-making equipment to certain countries. Even products manufactured abroad with US technology were restricted.\n\nBiden signed a bill into law that would ban TikTok unless it was sold to a non-Chinese buyer within a year. The US government alleged that TikTok’s Chinese parent company ByteDance was linked to the Chinese government, making the app a threat to national security.\n\nByteDance sued the US federal government over this bill in May 2024.\n\nIn September this year, Trump announced that a deal was finalised to find a new owner of TikTok.\n\nIn October 2023, Biden restricted US exports of advanced computer chips, especially those made by Nvidia, to China and other countries.\n\nThe goal of this measure was to limit China’s access to “advanced semiconductors that could fuel breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and sophisticated computers that are critical to [Chinese] military applications”, Gina Raimondo, who was secretary of the US Department of Commerce during the Biden administration, told reporters.\n\nPrior to this, Biden signed an executive order in August 2023, creating a programme that limits US investments in certain high-tech areas, including semiconductors, quantum computing, and artificial intelligence, in countries deemed to be a security risk, like China.\n\nBiden restricted China’s access to US semiconductors in October 2022. The rules further expanded restrictions on chipmaking tools to include industries that support the semiconductor supply chain, blocking both access to US expertise and the essential components used in manufacturing the tools that produce microchips.\n\nSemiconductors are used in the manufacturing of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. The US government placed these restrictions back then to limit China’s ability to acquire the ability to produce semiconductors and advance in the technological race.\n\nThe restrictions made it compulsory for entities within China to apply for licences to acquire US semiconductors. Analysis by the US-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace described these licences as “hard to get” back then.\n\nRecently, some US lawmakers are calling for even more restrictions, warning that China could quickly reverse-engineer advanced semiconductor technologies on its own, outpace the US in the sector, and gain a military edge.\n\nIn May 2020, the US Bureau of Industry and Security intensified rules to stop Huawei, the Chinese tech giant, from using US technology and software to design and make semiconductors in other countries.\n\nThe new rules said that semiconductors designed for Huawei using US technology or equipment, anywhere in the world, would need US government approval before being sent to Huawei.\n\nTrump signed an executive order blocking Chinese telecommunications companies like Huawei from selling equipment in the US. The Shenzhen-based Huawei is the world’s largest provider of 5G networks, according to analysis by the New York City-based think tank the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR).\n\nUnder this order, Huawei and 114 related entities were added to a list that requires US companies to get special permission (a licence) before selling certain technologies to them.\n\nThe rationale behind this order was the allegation that Huawei threatened US national security, had stolen intellectual property and could commit cyberespionage. Some US lawmakers alleged that the Chinese government was using Huawei to spy on Americans. The US did not publicise any evidence to back these allegations.\n\nOther Western countries had also cooperated with the US.\n\nDuring his first administration, Trump imposed sweeping 25 percent tariffs on Chinese goods worth as much as $60bn. In June of 2018, Trump announced more tariffs.\n\nChina retaliated by imposing tariffs on US products. Beijing deemed Trump’s trade policies “trade bullyism practices”, according to an official white paper, as reported by Xinhua news agency.\n\nIn September 2018, Trump issued another round of 10 percent tariffs on Chinese products, which were hiked to 25 percent in May 2019.\n\nIn 2011, during US President Barack Obama’s tenure, the US-China trade deficit reached an all-time high of $295.5bn, up from $273.1bn in the previous year.\n\nIn March 2012, the US, European Union, and Japan formally complained to China at the World Trade Organization (WTO) about China’s limits on selling rare earth metals to other countries. This move was deemed “rash and unfair” by China.\n\nIn its ruling, the world trade body said China’s export restraints were breaching the WTO rules.\n\nIn 2014, the US indicted five Chinese nationals with alleged ties to China’s People’s Liberation Army. They were charged with stealing trade technology from US companies.\n\nTrump and Xi are expected to meet in South Korea on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, which is set to begin on October 31.\n\nBut the latest trade dispute has clouded the Xi-Trump meeting.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump posted on his Truth Social platform, downplaying the threat: “Don’t worry about China, it will all be fine! Highly respected President Xi just had a bad moment. He doesn’t want Depression for his country, and neither do I. The U.S.A. wants to help China, not hurt it!!!”\n\nIn an interview with Fox Business Network on Monday, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said, “President Trump said that the tariffs would not go into effect until November 1. He will be meeting with [Communist] Party Chair Xi in [South] Korea. I believe that meeting will still be on.”\n\nWhen it comes to which of the two players is more affected by the trade war, Kewalramani said he thinks “what matters is who is willing to bear greater pain, endure greater cost.\n\n“This is the crucial question. I would wager that Beijing is probably better placed because Washington has alienated allies and partners with its policies since January. But then, China’s growing export controls are not simply aimed at the US. They impact every country. So Beijing has not also endeared itself to anyone,” Kewalramani said, pointing out how Trump’s tariffs and China’s rare earth restrictions target multiple countries.\n\n“The ones affected the most are countries caught in the midst of great power competition.”\n\nVekasi from the University of Montana said both economies are absorbing real pain in different ways.\n\n“The US can cushion the shock better because of its large domestic consumer base and still-strong upper-end spending. Inflation has hit lower-income households, but overall consumer demand remains solid,” she said.\n\n“China, by contrast, relies more heavily on exports, and the US remains a key market. Sustained export restrictions or new tariffs could make it hard for Beijing to meet its growth targets.”\n\nOn Sunday, US VP Vance told Fox News about China: “If they respond in a highly aggressive manner, I guarantee you, the president of the United States has far more cards than the People’s Republic of China.”\n\nKewalramani said so far, Beijing has been more organised, prepared and strategic than the US in its policies.\n\n“That said, it has overreached with the latest round of export controls. US policy, meanwhile, has lacked strategic coherence. The US still is the dominant global power and has several cards to play. What matters, however, is whether it can get its house in order.”\n\nVekasi said we are likely to see both the US and China keeping escalation tools in reserve, each claiming the upper hand. She added that how long that lasts will depend less on diplomacy and more on how the markets and broader global economy react in the coming weeks.\n\n“Neither side wants to look like it’s backing down. The rare earth regulations give Beijing flexibility – they can be implemented slowly, signalling resolve without fully cutting off exports. Trump, meanwhile, seems to be calibrating pressure (100% tariffs! Or maybe not!) to avoid spooking markets while still projecting toughness.”"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93dl93v581o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"10:27:00.472+00:00","title":"Zelensky ready to join Trump-Putin talks after 'frank' White House meeting","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has expressed openness to joining a proposed trilateral summit with US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Hungary, under a 'shuttle diplomacy' format, emphasizing a just peace over a quick one.

Trump and Vladimir Putin at a proposed summit in Hungary if he were invited.\n\nThe US and Russian presidents announced on Thursday they planned to hold talks on the war in Ukraine in Budapest, possibly in the coming weeks.\n\nIn comments released on Monday, Zelensky told reporters: \"If it is an invitation in a format where we meet as three or, as it's called, shuttle diplomacy… then in one format or another, we will agree.\"\n\nMeanwhile, media reports have suggested his White House meeting with Trump on Friday descended into a \"shouting match\" - with the US side urging Ukraine to accept Russia's terms to end the war.\n\nZelensky was guarded during his first press briefing since the talks, but still his comments made clear there were large areas of disagreement between the two sides.\n\nHe described the meeting as frank, and said he had told Trump that his main aim was a just peace, not a quick peace.\n\nHe criticised Hungary as the location of the prospective Trump-Putin talks, saying the country's Prime Minister Viktor Orban could not do \"anything positive for Ukrainians or even provide a balanced contribution\".\n\nWhen asked by reporters on Friday if Zelensky would be involved in the meeting in Budapest, Trump said he wanted to \"make it comfortable for everybody\".\n\n\"We'll be involved in threes, but it may be separated,\" he said, adding the three leaders \"have to get together\".\n\nZelensky had hoped to secure US Tomahawk missiles to strike deep into Russia at the talks, but appeared to walk away empty-handed as Trump struck a non-committal tone on the matter.\n\nOn Monday, media reports suggested the atmosphere at the US and Ukrainian leaders' meeting had been far more acrimonious than previously understood.\n\nThe Financial Times  reported  Trump warned Zelensky that Putin would \"destroy\" Ukraine if he did not agree to its terms, citing sources familiar.\n\nThe US side was said to have echoed Russian talking points at the \"volatile\" meeting. It also reported that Trump tossed aside maps of the frontline in Ukraine and insisted Zelensky surrender the entire Donbas region to Putin.\n\nRussia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nJust last month, Trump appeared to take a  major shift in his position  on ending the war by saying Kyiv could \"win all of Ukraine back in its original form\".\n\nHe said his position had changed \"after getting to know and fully understand the Ukraine/Russia military and economic situation\".\n\nTrump had previously warned the process would likely involve Ukraine giving up some territory - an outcome Zelensky has consistently rejected.\n\nThe US president has been pressuring Nato nations, as well as China and India, to stop purchasing Russian oil in a bid to create further economic pressure on Moscow to end the conflict.\n\nHe also previously threatened Russia with tougher sanctions if Putin did not meet deadlines to make progress in ending the war, though he did not follow through with those threats.\n\nTrump's public relations with Zelensky had also vastly improved in recent months, most notably from an Oval Office meeting in February when he and Vice-President JD Vance berated the Ukrainian president on live television.\n\nDuring his re-election campaign, Trump claimed he would be able to end the war in Ukraine within days but has since admitted resolving the conflict has been more challenging than any he has been involved in since returning to office."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/14/why-has-dutch-government-taken-control-of-china-owned-chipmaker-nexperia","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-14","timeOfPublication":"13:37:55+00:00","title":"Why has Dutch government taken control of China-owned chipmaker Nexperia?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Dutch government has taken effective control of the Chinese-owned semiconductor company Nexperia under the Goods Availability Act, citing serious managerial failures by former CEO Zhang Xuezheng and concerns about the availability of critical semiconductor technology for Europe.

2025-10-14T13:37:55+00:00\n\nTitle: Why has Dutch government taken control of China-owned chipmaker Nexperia?\n\nThe Dutch government has intervened to take effective control of technology group Nexperia, which is owned by Chinese group Wingtech Technology.\n\nThe decision comes amid a growing rift between China and the West over the development of technology such as computer chips and semiconductors, which are essential components for the manufacture of artificial intelligence (AI) technology.\n\nHere is more about what the Dutch government announced, why and what happens next.\n\nIn a statement released on Sunday, the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs said it had invoked the “highly exceptional” Goods Availability Act to intervene and take control of Nexperia on September 30.\n\nThe Goods Availability Act allows the Netherlands to intervene in privately owned companies in exceptional circumstances, such as if the government perceives a threat to the country’s economic security or if it is necessary to ensure that critical goods remain available.\n\nThe move followed an emergency hearing by the Dutch Enterprise Chamber on October 7, which concluded that there may be “valid reasons to doubt sound management at Nexperia under the leadership of former CEO Zhang Xuezheng”, a statement from the company said.\n\nThe Dutch Enterprise Chamber is a special division of the Amsterdam Court of Appeal, which hears corporate law cases and other matters that could have major social or financial consequences.\n\nIn its statement, the government said the intervention had been carried out “due to serious administrative shortcomings” at Nexperia, which “posed a threat to the continuity and safeguarding on Dutch and European soil of crucial technological knowledge and capabilities”.\n\nIt claimed that the intervention would ensure Nexperia’s finished and semi-finished products would remain available in case of an emergency.\n\nThe ministry added that “losing these capabilities could pose a risk to Dutch and European economic security.”\n\nFollowing this intervention, it said, “the company’s regular production process can continue.”\n\nHowever, it added, “Based on the order, decisions within the company can be blocked or reversed if they are (potentially) harmful to the company’s interests, its future as a Dutch and European company, and/or the preservation of this crucial value chain for Europe.”\n\nThe statement said that “involved parties” can appeal the decision in court.\n\nNexperia is a global semiconductor manufacturer headquartered in Nijmegen, the Netherlands. It emerged as a result of electronics group Philips’ purchase of London-based Mullard Radio Valve Company and Hamburg-based Valvo in the 1920s, ultimately forming Philips’ semiconductor operation. In 2006, Philips spun off its semiconductor division, which became NXP Semiconductors, and this was later sold to a consortium of investors led by Beijing Jianguang Asset Management (JAC Capital). Wingtech acquired Nexperia from that consortium for $3.63bn in 2018.\n\nAccording to its website, Nexperia employs 12,500 people in Europe, Asia and the United States.\n\nNexperia’s manufacturing site spans more than 80,000 square metres (861,000dsq feet) and has the capacity to build more than 50 billion components annually. It also has sales offices and research-and-development sites in China.\n\nOn Tuesday, Nexperia announced that it had suspended Zhang, founder of Wingtech, as a director and removed him as chief executive officer (CEO). It has appointed Stegan Tilger, chief financial officer (CFO), as interim CEO.\n\n“Due to the same serious managerial shortcomings, the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs observed that Nexperia’s operations in Europe were being compromised in an unacceptable manner. This situation raised broader concerns for the Dutch government about the availability of semiconductor products critical to the European industry,” Nexperia’s statement said.\n\n“The combination of Zhang Xuezheng’s behaviour as CEO and (indirect) shareholder, as well as concerns about the semiconductor product availability in the Netherlands and Europe, ultimately led the Dutch government to intervene with an exceptional emergency order on the basis of the Goods Availability Act.”\n\nThe statement added that the government’s order has also prohibited Nexperia from relocating company assets, firing existing executives or making important decisions without explicit government approval for one year.\n\nNexperia said it is confident its daily operations will continue as usual.\n\nOn October 9, China  tightened export controls  for critical rare-earth metals, citing national security interests. Foreign companies must now obtain approval from Beijing before they can export the named rare-earth metals or any products that contain them. Exporters must tell the government how the products will be used.\n\nThe US is a major consumer of Chinese rare-earth metals, which are critical for its defence industry. Following China’s announcement about new export restrictions, US President Donald Trump responded by  threatening to impose a new 100 percent trade tariff  on China.\n\nBesides being used for the manufacture of smartphones, electric cars and weapons, rare-earth metals are also used in the manufacture of semiconductors, which are essential for the development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology.\n\nThe US and its Western allies in Europe have, in recent years, passed regulations restricting China’s access to Western semiconductor technology, fearing that China could reverse-engineer and manufacture the technology, moving ahead in the technological race.\n\nIn 2022, former Democratic US President Joe Biden  restricted China’s access  to US semiconductors. The new rules extended restrictions on chipmaking tools being sold to industries which support the semiconductor supply chain. They blocked these industries from accessing US technical expertise, as well as the key components required to build the machines that produce microchips.\n\nThe US further tightened these restrictions in October 2023 and, again, in December 2024.\n\nOn September 29, 2025, the US Bureau of Industry and Security extended US export control restrictions to all groups which are at least 50 percent-owned by one or more entities on the US Entity List, a list of foreign organisations and companies believed to be participating in, or are at significant risk of participating in, activities that go against US national security or foreign policy interests. These entities are subject to sanctions, export restrictions or licensing requirements. While Nexperia itself is not on the list, Wingtech was added in December 2024.\n\nThen, on October 4, China’s Ministry of Commerce announced export controls preventing Nexperia China and its subcontractors from exporting certain finished components and sub-assemblies made in China.\n\n“Nexperia is actively engaging with the Chinese authorities to obtain an exemption from these restrictions and has deployed all available resources to that end,” the Nexperia statement said.\n\n“While Nexperia has made sufficient preparations to ensure business continuity – and as the BIS rule provides for a 60-day grace period – we are confident that a solution will be found,” Nexperia said in its statement on Tuesday.\n\nCompounding all this, earlier in the year, US President Donald Trump imposed tariffs of 145 percent on Chinese imports to the US. China retaliated with a tariff of 125 percent on US goods. Both countries then reduced their tariffs for 90 days in  May  to allow for trade talks. In August, the two agreed to another 90-day pause, with the most recent round of talks taking place between US and Chinese officials in Spain last month.\n\nBut the US has also imposed restrictions on most Chinese cars from being sold in the US. These include high tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles.\n\nIn addition to its standard 10 percent car import duty, the EU announced last year that it would impose a range of additional tariffs on electric vehicles, from 7.8 percent for Tesla vehicles to 35.3 percent on China’s state-owned SAIC [Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation] vehicles.\n\nWingtech released a social media statement saying it “firmly opposes the politicisation of commercial matters”.\n\nIn the post, it deemed the Dutch government’s move “an excessive intervention based on geopolitical bias rather than a fact-based risk assessment” that is based on the “unfounded pretext of national security”.\n\nShares in Wingtech have plummeted by 10 percent on the Shanghai Stock Exchange since the announcement. As a result, Wingtech was forced to explain the situation to the exchange, saying that the Dutch government’s decision “temporarily restricts” its control over Nexperia.\n\nBeijing “consistently opposes the overstretching of national security concepts and discriminatory practices targeting companies from specific countries”, Lin Jian, spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said on Monday.\n\n“Relevant countries should genuinely uphold market principles and avoid politicising economic and trade issues.”\n\nThe European Union has been closely coordinating with Dutch officials and will now work with the Netherlands to decide what to do next to protect important tech capabilities in Europe, according to European Commission spokesperson Olof Gill."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1e3leqx89zo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"09:13:03.726+00:00","title":"Virginia Giuffre thought she might 'die a sex slave' at hands of Epstein and his circle, memoir reveals","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Virginia Giuffre’s posthumous memoir, 'Nobody's Girl', reveals that she was sexually exploited by Jeffrey Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell, and alleges multiple sexual encounters with Prince Andrew, including at Epstein’s properties.

2025-10-20T09:13:03.726+00:00\n\nTitle: Virginia Giuffre thought she might 'die a sex slave' at hands of Epstein and his circle, memoir reveals\n\nVirginia Giuffre says she feared she might \"die a sex slave\" at the hands of Jeffrey Epstein and his circle, her posthumous memoir reveals.\n\nThe BBC has obtained a full copy of Nobody's Girl, written by the prominent accuser of convicted sex offender Epstein, ahead of its publication on Tuesday - almost six months after she took her own life.\n\nIn the memoir, Ms Giuffre also says she had sex with Prince Andrew on three separate occasions, including once with Epstein and approximately eight other young women.\n\nPrince Andrew, who reached a financial settlement with Ms Giuffre in 2022, has always denied any wrongdoing.\n\nThe memoir, which the BBC bought from a book store in central London days before its official release, paints a picture of a web of rich and powerful people abusing young women.\n\nAt the centre of the abuse was Epstein and his former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year sentence on sex-trafficking charges.\n\nMs Giuffre says that even decades later, she remembers how much she feared them both.\n\nMuch of the book makes for extremely harrowing reading, as Ms Giuffre details the sadistic abuse that Epstein put her through.\n\nShe says Epstein subjected her to sadomasochistic sex which caused her \"so much pain that I prayed I would black out\".\n\nA Buckingham Palace source told BBC News they accept there could be \"more days of pain ahead\" as a result of the publication of the book, which puts Prince Andrew under further scrutiny.\n\nThe King's engagements this week include a visit to the Vatican, where  he will pray alongside the Pope .\n\nOn Friday, Prince Andrew announced that he was voluntarily deciding not to use his titles including the  Duke of York , an honour received from his mother, the late Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nHe is also giving up membership of the Order of the Garter - the oldest and most senior order of chivalry in Britain.\n\nIn his statement, he said: \"I vigorously deny the accusations against me.\"\n\nWhile Andrew - who remains a prince as son of a monarch - will no longer be using his titles, a small number of MPs are calling for them to be officially removed from him.\n\nThey include Rachael Maskell, Independent MP for York Central, and Stephen Flynn, SNP leader at Westminster.\n\nMaskell told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that it was \"incredibly strange that you can give a title, but you can't remove a title\". She argued a simple, single clause would give a monarch the powers to do this for any titles, including peerages.\n\nFlynn said there was \"no justification\" for the UK government not to take action to remove Andrew's titles.\n\n\"The family of Virginia Giuffre, whose life was destroyed, are angry and aghast,\" he said, adding: \"The public across these isles are angry and aghast and they both deserve to know that some MPs share their outrage.\"\n\nHenry Zeffman, the BBC's chief political correspondent, said it was \"extremely unlikely\" that the government would take the lead on this matter.\n\n\"It may well be that developments require further action against Andrew but if they do, I think it would be the monarchy making that judgment call and the government following suit, rather than the other way around.\"\n\nEducation Secretary Bridget Phillipson agreed, telling the Today programme these are \"matters for the Royal Family\" rather than for government.\n\n\"The government, by long-standing convention, does not concern itself in matters concerning the Royal Family,\" she said.\n\nThe new book, written by Ms Giuffre and ghostwriter Amy Wallace, puts the prince under even more scrutiny.\n\nIn the memoir, Ms Giuffre says she first met Prince Andrew in March 2001.\n\nShe writes that Maxwell woke her up and told her it was going to be a \"special day\" and that \"just like Cinderella\" she was going to meet a \"handsome prince\".\n\nShe says that when she met Prince Andrew later that day, Maxwell told him to guess her age.\n\nThe prince, who was then 41, \"guessed correctly: seventeen\", Ms Giuffre said. \"My daughters are just a little younger than you,\" she recalls him saying.\n\nThat night, she says she attended London's Tramp nightclub with Prince Andrew, Epstein and Maxwell, where she says the prince \"sweated profusely\".\n\nIn a car on the way back to Maxwell's house afterwards, Ms Giuffre writes that Maxwell told her: \"When we get home, you are to do for him what you do for Jeffrey.\"\n\nShe wrote that back at the house they had sex.\n\n\"He was friendly enough, but still entitled - as if he believed having sex with me was his birthright,\" she says.\n\n\"The next morning, it was clear that Maxwell had conferred with her royal chum because she told me: 'You did well. The prince had fun.'\"\n\nMs Giuffre writes that she \"didn't feel so great\", adding: \"Soon, Epstein would give me $15,000 for servicing the man the tabloids called 'Randy Andy' -  a lot of money.\"\n\nMs Giuffre says she had sex for a second time with the prince around a month later at Epstein's townhouse in New York.\n\nShe says the third occasion was on Epstein's island as part of what Ms Giuffre called \"an orgy\".\n\nShe writes that she said in a sworn declaration in 2015 that she was \"around 18\".\n\n\"Epstein, Andy, and approximately eight other young girls and I had sex together,\" she says.\n\n\"The other girls all appeared to be under the age of 18 and didn't really speak English.\n\n\"Epstein laughed about how they couldn't really communicate, saying they are the easiest girls to get along with.\"\n\nLater in the book, Ms Giuffre touches on  her 2022 out-of-court settlement  with Prince Andrew after she brought a civil case against him.\n\n\"I agreed to a one-year gag order, which seemed important to the prince because it ensured his mother's Platinum Jubilee would not be tarnished any more than it already had been,\" she writes.\n\nWhile Ms Giuffre's alleged interactions with Prince Andrew have been widely reported by the British press, the book's content is wider in scope - littered with sinister details of Epstein's sex trafficking.\n\nThe girls were required to look \"childlike\", Ms Giuffre says, and her childhood eating disorder was \"only encouraged\" under Epstein's roof.\n\n\"In my years with them, they lent me out to scores of wealthy, powerful people,\" she writes.\n\n\"I was habitually used and humiliated - and in some instances, choked, beaten, and bloodied.\n\n\"I believed that I might die a sex slave.\"\n\nEpstein was convicted in Florida in 2008 for soliciting prostitution from a person under the age of 18. He died in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.\n\nOn Sunday, the Metropolitan Police said it was \"actively\" looking into media reports that  Prince Andrew tried to obtain personal information about Ms Giuffre  through his police protection officer (PPO).\n\nAccording to the Mail on Sunday, the prince asked the officer to investigate Ms Giuffre just before the newspaper published a photo in February 2011 of her first meeting with the prince.\n\nThe newspaper alleged that he gave the officer her date of birth and confidential social security number.\n\nDai Davies, the former head of royal protection at Scotland Yard, told BBC One's Breakfast the issue was \"scandalous\" adding: \"It needs to be put to bed one way or another.\"\n\n\"If - and I say if - there's any evidence of criminality either under the data protection act or malfeasance in public office, then that has to be carefully considered, and then a report sent to the Crown Prosecution [Service],\" he said.\n\n\"And clearly the government themselves then would have to act, in terms of his status still as a prince.\"\n\nA royal source told the BBC there are currently no plans for the removal of the prince title that Andrew was born with.\n\n\"The headlines are taking a lot of oxygen out of the royal room,\" they added, referring to press about Prince Andrew diverting attention away from King Charles's engagements.\n\nIn 2019, the prince repeatedly  told BBC Newsnight that he did not remember meeting Ms Giuffre \"at all\"  and that they \"never had any sort of sexual contact.\"\n\nBuckingham Palace has not commented.\n\nSign up here to get the latest royal stories and analysis  every week with our Royal Watch newsletter.

critical rare-earth metals on Thursday.\n\nThe new restrictions, announced by the Ministry of Commerce, come in advance of an expected meeting between United States President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, later this month.\n\nThe world’s two largest economies have been locked in trade negotiations aimed at calming tensions, after their tit-for-tat tariffs against each other earlier this year, before agreeing to pull back some of those duties.\n\nRare-earth metals are one of China’s major levers of influence with the US.\n\nIn “announcement number 61 of 2025”, China said it was increasing export controls for five rare-earth metals in addition to the  seven it announced in April this year .\n\nThe five metals added to the list are holmium, erbium, thulium, europium and ytterbium.\n\nThe seven minerals China placed export restrictions on earlier this year are samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium and yttrium.\n\nThere are 17 rare-earth metals in total – the 15 lanthanides (metallic elements) on the periodic table, as well as scandium and yttrium. China now has export restrictions on 12 of them.\n\nAdditionally, China also placed restrictions on the export of specialist technological equipment used to refine rare-earth metals on Thursday. Most of these restrictions will come into effect on December 1.\n\nThe announcement means that foreign companies will need to obtain special approvals from Beijing if they wish to export rare-earth magnets and certain semiconductor materials that have at least 0.1 percent heavy rare-earth metals from China.\n\nTo obtain the licence, foreign companies must explain the intended use of the product they wish to make using Chinese rare-earth metals.\n\nChina cited national security interests as the reason for these new restrictions.\n\n“Rare-earth-related items have dual-use properties for both civilian and military applications. Implementing export controls on them is an international practice,” a Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson told reporters.\n\nThe spokesperson added that “certain” foreign organisations and individuals have been directly transferring – or processing and then transferring – controlled rare-earth materials originating from China to “relevant organisations and individuals directly or indirectly for military and other sensitive applications”.\n\n“This has caused significant damage or posed potential threats to China’s national security and interests, adversely affected international peace and stability, and hindered global non-proliferation efforts.”\n\nRare-earth metals are essential for the production of technological equipment such as electric cars, lithium-ion batteries, LED televisions and camera lenses.\n\nThe metals are crucial for the US defence industry. According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) think tank, rare earths are used to manufacture components of F-35 fighter jets, Virginia and Columbia-class submarines, Tomahawk missiles, radar systems, Predator unmanned aerial vehicles and the Joint Direct Attack Munition series of smart bombs.\n\nAdditionally, rare earths are used to create semiconductors, which are used in artificial intelligence (AI) technology.\n\nThis is a strategic move on the part of China, analysts say.\n\nChina is the largest producer of these rare-earth metals. It mines at least 60 percent and processes about 90 percent of the world’s rare-earth metals, CSIS reported in 2024.\n\nThe new restrictions have been announced just three weeks before Trump visits South Korea to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in late October.\n\nDuring his visit, Trump is expected to meet Xi. The leaders last met in person in 2019.\n\nEarlier this year, Trump imposed tariffs of 145 percent on Chinese imports to the US. China retaliated with 125 percent tariffs. After reducing their tariffs to 30 percent and 10 percent, respectively, in May, the two sides struck a truce in August, agreeing on a 90-day pause to allow time for trade talks. That pause has since been renewed twice as talks continue – most recently between US and Chinese officials in Spain last month.\n\nChina’s new restrictions on rare-earth metals, which Trump is known to want badly, give it more leverage for these talks.\n\nGracelin Baskaran, director of the CSIS Critical Minerals Security Program, explained that the US defence industry is facing significant challenges caused by its limited production ability to meet rising defence technology needs. By restricting exports, China may be able to accelerate the expansion of its military strength at a faster pace than the US.\n\n“The new restrictions will only deepen these vulnerabilities, further widening the capability gap,” Baskaran said.\n\n“The move both strengthens Beijing’s leverage in upcoming talks while also undercutting US efforts to bolster its industrial base at a time where Indo-Pacific tension is climbing,” she said.\n\n“Most [restrictions] don’t go into effect until December 1, 2025, leaving close to 2.5 months for these negotiations.”\n\nThe Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson told reporters on Thursday: “China is willing to strengthen communication and cooperation through bilateral and multilateral export control dialogue mechanisms, promote compliant trade, and ensure the security and stability of global industrial and supply chains.”\n\nKristin Vekasi, the Mansfield chair of Japan and Indo-Pacific Affairs at the University of Montana, said Beijing’s latest moves are about leverage. She said this is a part of “pre-meeting choreography” before Trump’s meeting with Xi during the APEC summit in South Korea.\n\n“China hasn’t yet pulled the trigger on export restrictions, but it’s reminding Washington that it could. This move signals that Beijing is willing to weaponise its dominant position in the rare earths supply chain, especially as both governments prepare for a potential Trump-Xi meeting at APEC. It’s a classic signalling manoeuvre designed to strengthen China’s negotiating hand.”\n\nThe US will be especially hit hard. In 2023, it was the largest importer of Chinese rare-earth minerals and products, importing $22.8m worth of products from China, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC). In total, China exported $117m in rare-earth metals and products that year.\n\nThe US sourced 70 percent of its rare-earth compounds and metals imports from China between 2020 and 2023, according to a US Geological Survey report.\n\n“On the defence side, we’re talking about inputs for fighter jets, missile guidance systems, and more. On the civilian side, everything from smartphones and medical imaging equipment to electric vehicles depends on rare earth magnets. In other words, this isn’t just about defence but touches the everyday technologies that enable our modern life,” Vekasi said.\n\nHong Kong ($12.1m), Russia ($12.2m) and Japan ($9.42m) also import significant amounts.\n\nThe US restricted China’s access to its semiconductors in 2022 under the administration of Democratic former President Joe Biden. Some US lawmakers have pushed for greater restrictions, warning that China could reverse-engineer or independently develop advanced semiconductor technologies, overtaking the US in the industry and securing a military advantage.\n\n“China’s move shows it can make life very difficult for US manufacturers – but doing so would also hurt its own economy, since many of these supply chains run both ways. It’s a reminder that the US-China economic relationship isn’t a clean decoupling story; the two markets are still very much intertwined,” Vekasi from the University of Montana said.\n\nYes.\n\nThe Commerce Ministry spokesperson said exports pertaining to emergency medical needs, in response to public health emergencies or for disaster relief, will be exempt from the restrictions."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y9x1w2ee1o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"23:55:48.888+00:00","title":"LA turns Confederate statues that launched US protests into art","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reports on an exhibit titled 'Monuments' opening in Los Angeles in October 2025, which displays 18 decommissioned Confederate statues, including the melted statue of General Robert E.

What did they believe? They believed in white supremacy. Period.\"\n\nComing at a time when President Donald Trump is ordering statues and paintings of Confederate generals to be reinstalled, the warring narratives of American history are at the heart of \"Monuments,\" which opens 23 October at The Brick and at the Geffen Contemporary at the Museum of Contemporary Art.\n\nThe 18 decommissioned Confederate monuments are displayed alongside pieces of contemporary art. The massive, graffitied statue of Lee and Jackson, for example, stands next to a giant replica sculpture of the \"General Lee\" car from the iconic TV show, The Dukes of Hazzard.\n\nPresident Trump has often spoken of General Lee's bravery and he and others have criticis]ed the removal and toppling of Confederate monuments, saying it's revisionist history.\n\nWhite nationalists marched in Charlottesville, Virginia in 2017, triggering deadly clashes, to keep the statue from being removed. In the aftermath, similar statues sparked clashes in cities across the US.\n\n\"Under this historical revision, our Nation's unparalleled legacy of advancing liberty, individual rights, and human happiness is reconstructed as inherently racist, sexist, oppressive, or otherwise irredeemably flawed,\" President Trump wrote in a March executive order calling for paintings and monuments to be reinstalled.\n\nBut Mr Walker says putting Lee and Jackson on pedestals – even though they lost the war – is racist and promotes the Lost Cause ideology that argues the Civil War was a noble cause for states' rights and not about slavery.\n\n\"States rights to do what? The reason for the Civil War was slavery,\" he said, adding that it perpetuates the idea that the South was a \"noble victim\", and that slavery wasn't so terrible.\n\n\"If you could distance them from slavery, right, then you could portray them as heroes, even though they lost the war and were on the wrong side of history, fighting for something that was morally repugnant,\" he says.\n\nThe centrepiece of the show is \"Unmanned Drone\" – a completely reconstructed sculpture of Stonewall Jackson by artist Kara Walker, who transformed the horse and its rider heading into battle into a headless, zombie-like creature.\n\n\"The southern vernacular would be a 'haint', which would be a ghostly form,\" Kara Walker, who is not related to Hamza Walker, told the BBC when asked how she describes the work. \"It's an attempt to rethink the legacies of Stonewall Jackson as a mythology, as mythological holder for white supremacy.\"\n\nMost of the monuments on display will be returned to the cities and towns they've been borrowed from when the show closes in May. But Kara Walker's sculpture will need to find a new home. And the bronze ingots from the melted down Lee sculpture will be transformed again into a new work of art.\n\nThe statue was removed in 2021 and melted in 2023 after the Charlottesville City Council voted to donate the statue to the Jefferson School - African American Heritage Center.\n\n\"It's a toxic representation of history, this lost cause narrative, and we're purifying it,\" says Jalane Schmidt, an activist and professor who was there when the statue came down in Charlottesville, and when it was melted at a secret foundry. She came to see it in its new form in Los Angeles.\n\nLiving in Charlottesville, she said, the statue was always in the background until a teenage girl in 2016 started a petition to rename Lee Park and remove the statue because she found it offensive that the city would celebrate someone who fought for slavery.\n\nThe statue was the focal point for the Unite the Right rally in 2017, which turned deadly when a 21-year-old white nationalist ploughed his car into counter protesters killing Heather Heyer, a 32-year-old paralegal and civil rights activist.\n\nSchmidt says the petition and the rally changed public opinion about the monuments in Charlottesville and elsewhere.\n\n\"Especially after Unite the Right, after we were attacked, well, clearly this was evidence that, you know, people are willing to die for symbols, but they're also willing to kill for them,\" she said. \"We had to remove them just for our own health.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj0e24rrjz1o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"18:55:16.205+00:00","title":"Stolen treasures, a crown dropped as thieves fled - and serious questions for Louvre security","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A professional gang stole eight items from the Apollo Gallery at the Louvre museum, including crowns, necklaces, and brooches belonging to empresses and royal figures from Napoleon’s era.

Stolen treasures, a crown dropped as thieves fled - and serious questions for Louvre security\n\nIt is the most spectacular robbery at the Louvre museum since the Mona Lisa disappeared in 1911.\n\nAnd it poses serious questions about levels of security covering French artworks, at a time when they are increasingly being targeted by criminal gangs.\n\nAccording to France's new interior minister Laurent Nuñez, the gang that broke into the Apollo Gallery on Sunday morning was clearly professional.\n\nThey knew what they wanted, had evidently \"cased the joint\" in advance, had a brazenly simple but effective modus operandi, and needed no more than seven minutes to take their booty and get away.\n\nIn a truck equipped with an elevating platform of the type used by removal companies, they parked on the street outside, raised themselves up to the first floor, then used a disc-cutter to enter through a window.\n\nInside the richly decorated gallery they made for two display-cases which contain what remains of the French crown jewels.\n\nMost of France's royal regalia was lost or sold after the 1789 Revolution, but some items were saved or bought back. Most of what was in the cases, though, dates from the 19th Century and the two imperial families of Napoleon and his nephew Napoleon III.\n\nAccording to the authorities, eight items were taken including diadems, necklaces, ear-rings and brooches.\n\nThey had belonged to Napoleon's wife the empress Marie-Louise; to his sister-in-law Queen Hortense of Holland; to Queen Marie-Amelie, wife of France's last King Louis-Philippe, who ruled from 1830 to 1848; and to the empress Eugénie, wife of Napoleon III, who ruled from 1852 to 1870.\n\nA crown of the empress Eugénie was also taken, but was recovered damaged near the museum after the thieves seemingly dropped it.\n\nIn a statement the culture ministry said that the alarms had sounded correctly. Five museum staff who were in the gallery or nearby followed protocol by contacting security forces and protecting visitors.\n\nIt said the gang had tried to set fire to their vehicle outside but were prevented by the intervention of a museum staff-member.\n\nThe heist took place in a gallery just a short walk from some of the world's most famous paintings – such as the Mona Lisa.\n\nBut the criminal groups that order heists like this do not target world-famous paintings that cannot ever be displayed or sold. They prefer items that can be converted into cash – and jewels top the list.\n\nHowever huge their historical and cultural value, crowns and diadems can easily be broken apart and sold in bits. Even large and famous diamonds can be cut. The final sales price might not be what the original artefact was worth, but it will still be considerable.\n\nTwo recent museum thefts in France had already alerted the authorities to the growing audacity of art gangs, and a security plan drawn up by the culture ministry is gradually being put into effect across France.\n\n\"We are well aware that French museums are vulnerable,\" said Nuñez.\n\nIn September thieves took raw gold – in its mineral state – from the Natural History Museum in Paris. The gold was worth about €600,000 (£520,000) and will have been easily disposed of on the black market.\n\nIn the same month thieves took porcelain worth €6m from a museum in Limoges – a city once famous for its chinaware. The haul could well have been commissioned by a foreign buyer.\n\nThe Louvre contains thousands of artworks that are famous around the world, and an equal number of more obscure items that are nonetheless culturally significant.\n\nBut in its 230-year history there have been relatively few thefts – largely thanks to the tight security in place.\n\nThe most recent disappearance was of a landscape by the 19th Century artist Camille Corot. Le Chemin de Sèvres (The Road to Sèvres) was simply removed from a wall in 1998 when no-one was looking, and has not been seen since.\n\nBut by far the most famous theft was the one that took place in 1911, when Leonardo da Vinci's La Joconde – better known now as the Mona Lisa – was taken. The culprit back then hid in a closet overnight, then was able to remove the painting from its frame, wrap it up in his smock, tuck it under his arm and walk out.\n\nIt turned out he was an Italian nationalist who wanted the artwork brought back home. It was found in Italy in 1914 and returned to the Louvre.\n\nUnless they have a quick success in catching the thieves, today's investigators are unlikely to be so lucky.\n\nThe first aim of the gang will be to disperse the jewels and sell them on. It will not be hard."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cevzr3n02x2o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"20:25:30.544+00:00","title":"Harper Lee's newly found stories show her 'genius', say her family","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article highlights the discovery and publication of Harper Lee’s long-lost short stories in the book The Land of Sweet Forever, which were found in her New York apartment after her death in 2016.

talking to me about the tales her aunt Nelle, known to the world as Harper Lee, would weave for her when she was a little girl. \"She was just a great storyteller,\" says the 77-year-old from her home in Alabama.\n\nThat's an understatement if the success of Harper Lee's Pulitzer-prize winning novel To Kill A Mockingbird is anything to go by. Since its publication in 1960, when it was an instant hit, the book has sold more than 42 million copies worldwide\n\nBased around the story of Tom Robinson, a black man falsely accused of rape, it's told through the eyes of two white children, Jean Louise 'Scout' Finch and her brother Jem - and is often described as an American classic.\n\nBut at the point Molly is describing, before the world had heard of Lee, she was simply an aunt enchanting her niece with stories, often by riffing on one of her favourite authors, the British novelist Daphne Du Maurier.\n\n\"The stories that she told me, she would make them up but they all seemed to be based around, 'It was a dark and stormy night'... It seemed to me they were always on the moor and she would just take me into the dark,\" Molly says.\n\nMolly's cousin is 77-year-old Ed Lee Conner. His earliest memories of his aunt date back to the late 1940s, when he was tiny. \"She sang to me in a way that was very funny,\" he recalls. \"And I laughed.\"\n\nHe gives me a rendition, half-singing I've Got a Little List from the musical The Mikado. Ed says he only realised much later that \"she was singing to me songs from Gilbert and Sullivan\", the Victorian-era duo Lee \"adored\" all her life.\n\nIt seems some of Lee's influences were British, even if her roots were in Monroeville, Alabama at a time of strict segregation, when schools, churches and restaurants were divided on race lines.\n\nThe cousins are sharing their memories of their aunt - who died in 2016  - on the eve of the publication of a new book, The Land of Sweet Forever.\n\nIt's a series of newly discovered short stories Lee wrote in the years before Mockingbird, as well as previously published essays and magazine pieces.\n\nEd explains: \"I knew there were unpublished stories, I had no idea where the manuscripts of those stories were.\"\n\nThey were discovered in one of his aunt's New York City apartments after she died, a time capsule from the start of Lee's career which help explain how a young woman from Alabama became a best-selling author whose work addressed the turbulent issues of her age.\n\nMolly is \"very pleased\" that the stories have been found. \"I think it's interesting to see how her writing evolved and how she worked on her craft,\" she says. \"Even I can tell how she improved.\"\n\nSome elements will be familiar to fans of To Kill A Mockingbird.\n\nVersions of Jean Louise Finch appear, although she hasn't gained her nickname Scout yet.\n\nIn one of the stories, The Pinking Shears, the character is a spirited little girl called Jean Louie who gives a friend a haircut and faces the wrath of the child's father. Perhaps a hint of the forthright Scout to come?\n\nIn another, The Binoculars, a child starting school is berated by the teacher for already knowing how to read. A version of that story appears early on in Mockingbird.\n\nSome of them are set in Maycomb, Alabama, the fictional town which also stands for Monroeville in To Kill A Mockingbird.\n\nEd, who's a retired English professor, calls them \"apprentice stories\" which aren't \"the fullest expression of her genius and yet there's genius in them\".\n\n\"She was a brilliant writer in the making and you see something of her brilliance in these stories.\"\n\nI found one, The Cat's Meow, an unsettling read through a modern lens. Set in Maycomb, it sees two siblings, clearly Lee and her older sister Alice, confounded by her sister's black gardener Arthur, who's from the North but has apparently decided to work in the segregationist South. The older sister tells the younger one he's a \"Yankee\" who has \"as much education as you have\".\n\nWritten in 1957, seven years before the groundbreaking Civil Rights Act of 1964, Lee's own approach to the civil rights movement appears to be evolving.\n\nSome of the language in the story and at times, even the narrator's own attitudes, are uncomfortable to read.\n\nEd thinks that's a \"fair assessment\"\n\nHe points to Go Set A Watchman, the novel Lee published just a year before she died after the manuscript was found decades after she wrote it.\n\nAs liberal as the narrator thinks she is, \"she's not entirely liberated from her own prejudices, let's put it that way\", Ed says.\n\n\"And I don't say that in any demeaning sense because for white southerners, it's not easy to rid ourselves of all the prejudices that we have born over the centuries.\"\n\nThe publication of Go Set A Watchman sparked controversy. Atticus Finch, the anti-racist hero of To Kill A Mockingbird, is portrayed as a racist.\n\nThere were questions about whether Lee, who had significant health issues by then, had the capacity to give full consent. (An investigation by the state of Alabama found claims of elder abuse were unfounded).\n\nI ask whether it's an invasion of Lee's privacy to publish posthumously these stories that Lee didn't choose to make public in her lifetime. Ed Lee Conner is clear that, when it comes to The Land of Sweet Forever, \"that's an easy judgment to make, she attempted to publish all these stories\".\n\nAnd he believes - like Mockingbird - the stories have something to say about modern race relations in the US which is \"part of the continuing relevance of what she wrote\".\n\nTo Kill A Mockingbird \"had a huge influence on the way a lot of people thought about race relations in the United States\".\n\nWriting a book about a black man's struggle that's centred on white characters, particularly Atticus Finch, the white lawyer played by Gregory Peck in the 1962 film, has led, in later years, to accusations of white saviourism.\n\nEd tells me his aunt \"was writing a novel primarily for a white audience who I think would need to see a figure like Atticus Finch much more clearly and much more humanly in their lives, even as a fictional character, in order to influence them as much as she could\".\n\nIn an interview in 1964 for the New York radio station WQXR, Harper Lee described the \"sheer numbness\" she felt at the reaction to her debut novel.\n\n\"I never expected that the book would sell in the first place,\" she said. \"I was hoping for a quick and merciful death at the hands of the reviewers. I was hoping that maybe somebody might like it well enough to give me some encouragement about it.\"\n\nEd's side of the family had been given it in proof, ahead of publication. At age 13, he read the whole book in two days. \"I was absolutely enthralled and it was one of the highlights of my youth.\"\n\nHe says the whole family shared her feelings of numbness at its reception. \"We all loved it and thought it was a terrific novel, but we had no idea... that it would go on to be as phenomenal a success as it was.\"\n\nHarper Lee had looked after Molly and her brother while she was writing it. \"She was in her bedroom typing away and she locked the door and she'd come out and play with us and then go back to typing.\"\n\nWhen Molly read the book, as a 12-year-old, \"I'm not sure that I ever looked up from it. I was totally engrossed.\"\n\nI play them part of the WQXR interview that their aunt did four years after the book came out. It's the only known recording of Harper Lee talking about To Kill A Mockingbird.\n\nShe retired from public life soon afterwards. Ed says she wasn't a recluse as some have suggested and was very sociable with the people she knew. She'd simply realised, after the novel's success and then the hugely popular film, that she didn't need to promote it anymore.\n\n\"She did not particularly enjoy public appearances,\" he recalls. \"She had no interest whatsoever in being a celebrity. So there was a point at which she decided no more interviews.\"\n\nListening to her speaking on this precious recording is its own time capsule.\n\nIn her soft southern accent, melodic and lilting, she talks not just about being numbed at the reaction to the book, but also why she believes the southern states are \"a region of storytellers\" and how she wants to be \"a Jane Austen of South Alabama\".\n\nHearing her voice again \"just makes me smile,\" Molly says.\n\n\"I love hearing it,\" agrees Ed, clearly moved. \"It's wonderful.\"\n\nThe Land of Sweet Forever by Harper Lee is published on 21 October 2025."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj3zemk2j4ro","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"20:48:40.773+00:00","title":"No Kings protests: where does Democratic opposition go next?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The 'No Kings' protests in October 2025 united Democrats, liberals, and some anti-Trump Republicans in large-scale demonstrations across major U.S. cities, expressing opposition to President Donald Trump’s expansive use of presidential authority and policies on immigration, tariffs, and government spending.

2025-10-19T20:48:40.773+00:00\n\nTitle: 'No Kings' protests: where does Democratic opposition go next?\n\nThis weekend's  \"No Kings\" demonstrations  drew an estimated crowd of millions across the US to protest President Donald Trump's policies and his willingness to push the boundaries of presidential authority.\n\nIt was a moment for likeminded Democrats, liberals and some anti-Trump Republicans to rally together at a time when the American left has little formal power in national politics.\n\nBut where do they go from here?\n\nBy most accounts, the turnout at Saturday's events - in major US cities like Chicago, New York, Washington and Los Angeles, as well as hundreds of smaller towns – was higher than expected and surpassed the first \"No Kings\" rally in June.\n\nCongressional Republicans had warned that the demonstrations would be \"anti-American\", and some conservative governors had put their law enforcement and National Guard on alert in case of violence.\n\nThe massive rallies turned out to be peaceful – a carnival, not carnage. In New York City, there were no protest-related arrests, and the gathering in Washington DC featured families and young children.\n\n\"Today all across America in numbers that may eclipse any day of protest in our nation's history, Americans are saying loudly and proudly that we are a free people, we are not a people that can be ruled, our government is not for sale,\" Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said in his speech to the Washington DC rally.\n\nJust down the street from the No Kings gathering in the nation's capital, the White House responded to the protests with derision.\n\n\"Who cares,\" deputy press secretary Abigail Jackson wrote in response to multiple media inquiries about the marches.\n\nTrump shared several AI-generated videos on his Truth Social website of him wearing a crown, including  one where he was flying a jet  that dumped what appeared to be human waste on the protesters.\n\nWhile Republicans may be downplaying the significance of the marches, the scale of the turnout – along with Trump's net negative approval rating in major opinion polls - hints at a Democratic opportunity to rebound from last year's electoral defeats.\n\nThe party still has a long way to go, however.\n\nPolls suggest only a third of Americans view it favourably - the lowest for decades - and Democrats are divided over how to mount an effective opposition to Trump when they no longer control either chamber of Congress.\n\nLiberals took to the streets on Saturday for a variety of reasons. Trump's aggressive immigration enforcement, his tariff policies, his government cuts, his foreign policy, his deployment of National Guard in US cities and his norm-breaking use of presidential authority were all frequent topics of concern and outrage.\n\nSome of the frustration was also directed at Democratic leaders.\n\n\"We're just taking it on the chin, and we're not speaking out,\" one march attendee in Washington DC told NBC News on Saturday. \"You know, I think we need to throw some more elbows. Unfortunately, the high road doesn't work.\"\n\nThe Democrats have been more combative over the  ongoing government shutdown , which is about to enter its fourth week. They have been unwilling to approve a short-term extension of current federal spending without a bipartisan agreement to address health-insurance subsidies for low-income Americans set to expire at the end of the year.\n\nBecause of Senate parliamentary rules, Democrats have some power despite being in the minority – and, at least so far, the public seems to be assigning at least as much, if not more, blame for the impasse to Trump and the Republican majority.\n\nBut the strategy comes with risks too. The pain from the shutdown – particularly for those in the Democratic coalition – is only going to increase as the weeks go by.\n\nMany federal workers have missed paycheques and are  facing financial hardship . Funding is expected to run out for low-income food support. The US judicial system is scaling back its operations. And the Trump administration is using the shutdown to order new  cuts to the federal workforce  and suspend domestic spending, targeting Democratic states and cities.\n\nThe reality is that Democratic leaders in the Senate will ultimately have to find a way out of the crisis. But they may be hard-pressed to reach terms that the protesters who took to the streets on Saturday will find acceptable.\n\n\"If we shake hands with President Trump on a deal, we don't want him then next week just firing thousands more people, cancelling economic development projects, cancelling public health funds,\" Democratic Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia said on Sunday in an interview on NBC's Meet The Press. \"So we are trying to get an agreement that a deal is a deal.\"\n\nThere is a chance the government shutdown will still be happening in early November when voters in some states will head to the ballot box for the first time since last year's presidential contest.\n\nElections for governor and state legislatures could provide a barometer for whether the anti-Trump sentiment on display at the \"No Kings\" protests translates into electoral success for Democrats.\n\nFour years ago, a Republican won the governor's race in Virginia, an electoral battleground that has trended left in recent presidential elections, providing an early sign of voter dissatisfaction with President Joe Biden. This time around, the Democrat – former Congresswoman Abigail Spanberger – is leading her Republican opponent in the polls.\n\nWhile Trump lost New Jersey in last year's presidential election, the margin of defeat - less than 6% - was dramatically down from Biden's 16% victory in 2020 and Hillary Clinton's 14% margin in 2017. November's governor's election shows a similarly close race.\n\nAt the No Kings rally in Montclair, New Jersey, Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin urged attendees to vote in the upcoming election.\n\n\"It is one thing to show up at these protests,\" he said. \"And it's another to move the needle and get back some power.\"\n\nThis November's elections will be a test of whether antipathy toward Trump is enough to get left-wing voters to support Democratic candidates.\n\nThey are, however, just a prelude to next year's midterm elections, which will decide which party controls both chambers of the US Congress and could provide Democrats with a real check on Trump's power for the last two years of his presidential term.\n\nThe priority at Saturday's protests was to unite around a Stop Trump message. Of less concern, at least for the moment, was what Democrats could do once they get back to power.\n\nThere have, however, been some indications that cracks remain within the party coalition.\n\nFormer Vice-President Kamala Harris's book tour, for example, has regularly been interrupted by pro-Palestinian protestors who object to the Biden administration's Middle East policies. Centrist proposals to focus on economic issues over social policies – including trans rights – have prompted condemnations from many on the left.\n\nMaine, Massachusetts, California and Michigan are likely to have contentious primary battles to determine Democratic nominees in next year's elections – pitting older establishment politicians against younger candidates and liberals against centrists.\n\nThese battles could quickly open old political wounds that are hard to heal. In that case, marches alone may not be enough to solve what has ailed the party."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/6/nobel-prize-2025-what-they-are-when-will-the-awards-be-announced","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-06","timeOfPublication":"09:07:20+00:00","title":"What are Nobel Prizes, when are the awards announced?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The 2025 Nobel Prizes have officially begun with the announcement of the Medicine Prize, awarded to Mary Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell, and Shimon Sakaguchi for their discoveries in peripheral immune tolerance, a breakthrough with implications for treating cancer and autoimmune diseases.

are the awards announced?\n\nThe Nobel Prizes 2025 have officially kicked off with the first award for physiology or medicine announced, setting the stage for a week of global anticipation.\n\nScientists Mary Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Shimon Sakaguchi on Monday were awarded the Nobel Prize in medicine for “their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance”.\n\n“Their discoveries have laid the foundation for a new field of research and spurred the development of new treatments, for example for cancer and autoimmune diseases,” the prize-awarding body said in a statement.\n\nThe full schedule, spanning through October 13, maps out a rapid succession of announcements: medicine, followed by physics, chemistry, literature, peace and finally the economics prize.\n\nHere are details of the schedule and what to expect from this year’s Nobel Prizes:\n\nThe Nobel Prizes are the most prestigious international awards, established by the will of Alfred Nobel, a Swedish chemist, engineer and industrialist best known for discovering dynamite.\n\nIn his 1895 will, Nobel left the bulk of his fortune to fund the annual prizes, recognising those who “have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind” in the preceding year.\n\nThe first Nobel Prizes were awarded in 1901 for outstanding achievement in the fields of physics, chemistry, medicine, literature and peace.\n\nIn 1968, Sweden’s central bank, Sveriges Riksbank, established the Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, expanding the categories to six.\n\nThe prizes are awarded by different institutions: the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (for physics, chemistry and economics), the Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institutet (for medicine), the Swedish Academy (for literature) and the Norwegian Nobel Committee (for peace).\n\nEach laureate receives a gold medal, a diploma and a cash award funded by the Nobel Foundation, which manages Nobel’s endowment. This year’s prizes amount to 11 million Swedish kronor ($1.2m) each.\n\nThe prizes are formally presented on December 10, the anniversary of Nobel’s death in 1896.\n\nThe announcements began on Monday and will end a week later on October 13.\n\nMonday, October 6:  physiology or medicine\n\nAnnounced by the Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institutet, Wallenbergsalen, Nobel Forum, Solna, near Stockholm\n\nTuesday, October 7:  physics\n\nAnnounced by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, Stockholm\n\nWednesday, October 8:  chemistry\n\nAnnounced by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, Stockholm\n\nThursday, October 9 : literature\n\nAnnounced by the Swedish Academy, Stockholm\n\nFriday, October 10:  peace\n\nAnnounced at the Norwegian Nobel Institute, Oslo, by the chairperson of the Norwegian Nobel Committee\n\nMonday, October 13:  economics\n\nAnnounced by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, Stockholm\n\nThe nomination process is designed to preserve secrecy and independence. Each year, the Nobel committees invite selected experts, past winners and academics to submit nominations by January 31.\n\nThe nominations are not made public, and committee members are forbidden from discussing their decisions for 50 years. Only nominators may choose to reveal their own submissions.\n\nA person cannot nominate themselves, but they can be nominated multiple times by others.\n\nAfter the deadline, committees spend months reviewing hundreds of entries, consulting specialists and narrowing the list to a few candidates.\n\nEach prize has its own rhythm. The Peace Prize, which often recognises work from the past year, tends to be responsive to current global events.\n\nThe science prizes usually take decades to confirm after judges observe that discoveries have stood the test of time and can gauge their impact.\n\nThe world is fraught with conflict, including an ongoing genocide in Gaza, a war in Ukraine, and civil wars and political repression in numerous countries.\n\nHowever, the headlines and debates about this year’s Nobel Peace Prize are rather outsized and focused on United States President Donald Trump for his relentless self-promotion – at times, claiming to deserve it for “ending seven wars”.\n\nAt the United Nations, Trump told delegates, “Everyone says that I should get the Nobel Peace Prize.” On Tuesday, Trump reiterated that he “deserved” to win the prize for the possibility of ending an eighth war, Israel’s two-year-long war on Gaza.\n\nHowever, experts have noted that his chances are slim. The Norwegian Nobel Committee typically focuses on the durability of peace, the promotion of international fraternity and the quiet work of institutions that strengthen those goals, experts argued.\n\nAmong this year’s nominations for Trump were those from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Pakistan’s government although both were made after the deadline for the 2025 award.\n\nOne of the Nobel-awarding bodies has also warned that academic freedom is under threat from the political interference by the Trump administration.\n\nYlva Engstrom, vice president of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, said the Trump administration’s changes were reckless. “I think in both the short and long term, it can have devastating effects,” she told the Reuters news agency in an interview. “Academic freedom … is one of the pillars of the democratic system.”\n\nHowever, Engstrom is not herself on any of the three committees that will award the prizes for chemistry, physics or economics.\n\nEvery year, the Nobel Prizes are formally awarded in twin ceremonies held in Stockholm and Oslo.\n\nThe Stockholm ceremony is attended by Sweden’s royal family, and the laureates in physics, chemistry, medicine, literature and economic sciences receive their medals and diplomas from the king.\n\nIn Oslo, the Nobel Peace Prize is presented by the chairperson of the Norwegian Nobel Committee at the Oslo City Hall, honouring Nobel’s wish that the Peace Prize be awarded in Norway.\n\nLaureates are individually called to the stage, where they receive the Nobel medal, diploma and the monetary award. The ceremony also features speeches by committee chairpeople highlighting the significance of the discoveries and contributions.\n\nThe event is broadcast worldwide and followed by a Nobel Banquet at Stockholm’s City Hall for more than 1,000 guests, including royalty, diplomats, scientists and past laureates.\n\nVictor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun were awarded the 2024 prize for medicine for discovering microRNAs, tiny RNA molecules that regulate gene expression after transcription.\n\nIn physics, John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton received the prize for research that laid the theoretical and computational foundations of modern machine learning and artificial neural networks. While Hopfield’s models in the 1980s linked neuroscience and computation, Hinton’s work revolutionised deep learning, enabling advances in image recognition, natural language processing and artificial intelligence systems.\n\nIn chemistry, the prize was shared by David Baker, Demis Hassabis and John Jumper for breakthroughs in predicting and designing protein structures using computational models. Baker was honoured for developing algorithms that enable scientists to design new proteins with specific functions while Hassabis and Jumper from Google’s DeepMind were recognised for creating AlphaFold, the AI system that predicted nearly all known protein structures with unprecedented accuracy.\n\nIn the literature category, the prize went to Han Kang, a South Korean novelist known for her haunting explorations of violence, identity and collective memory. Best known internationally for the novels The Vegetarian and Human Acts, Han was cited “for her intense poetic prose that confronts historical traumas and exposes the fragility of human life”.\n\nIn the peace category, the prize was awarded to Nihon Hidankyo, the Japan Confederation of A- and H-Bomb Sufferers Organisations, honouring its decades-long campaign to abolish nuclear weapons and preserve the testimonies of Hiroshima and Nagasaki survivors.\n\nIn economic sciences, Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson and James Robinson shared the prize for their analysis of how institutions shape long-term economic growth and inequality. Their collaborative research, including the seminal work Why Nations Fail, demonstrated that inclusive political and economic institutions rather than geography or culture determine prosperity."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c051p3981m4o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"01:52:48.252+00:00","title":"Shrapnel hits cars on California highway during Marines celebration","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During a Marine Corps 250th birthday celebration on Interstate 5 in California, a 155-millimeter artillery shell detonated prematurely, sending shrapnel that struck two vehicles used in Vice President JD Vance’s protective detail.

The California Highway Patrol said one \"detonated overhead prematurely\" and struck two vehicles that were part of Vance's protective detail.\n\nIt came as state officials and the White House fought over a decision to close part of Interstate 5 for the event in southern California.\n\n\"Firing live rounds over a busy highway isn't just wrong - it's dangerous,\" Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, said.\n\nThe highway patrol said no injuries were reported and they notified the Marine Corps, which then cancelled firing any further munitions.\n\n\"This was an unusual and concerning situation,\" Border Division Chief Tony Coronado said in a statement, adding that such exercises are not common over an active freeway.\n\nNewsom said he  closed a section of the Interstate 5  \"due to extreme life safety risk and distraction to drivers, including sudden unexpected and loud explosions\".\n\nBut before they were aware of the mishap, officials in the vice-president's office had disputed that the demonstration was dangerous, and accused the California governor of trying to stoke fears.\n\nThe BBC has contacted the White House and vice-president's office about the shrapnel incident.\n\n\"If Gavin Newsom wants to oppose the training exercises that ensure our Armed Forces are the deadliest and most lethal fighting force in the world, then he can go right ahead,\" William Martin, Vance's communications director, told CNN, before reports about the incident were known.\n\n\"It would come as no surprise that he would stoop so low considering his pathetic track record of failure as governor.\"\n\nNewsom responded to the military mishap by saying that \"Donald Trump and JD Vance put lives at risk to put on a show\". He added that if they wanted to honour troops, they should work to  reopen the federal government , which ran out of funding at the beginning of October.\n\nThe First Marine Expeditionary Force at Camp Pendleton said in a statement that it was aware of the incident concerning a 155-millimeter shell fired during the event, and that an investigation was underway.\n\n\"The demonstration went through a rigorous safety evaluation, and deliberate layers of redundancy, to ensure the safety of fellow citizens,\" the statement read.\n\n\"Following established safety protocols, firing was suspended. No injuries occurred and the demonstration concluded as scheduled.\"\n\nIn a police report, California Highway officers said the two damaged vehicles, which had been used as part of Vance's detail, were then sent to guard the freeway and keep it closed during the event.\n\nThe officers wrote in a report that they saw the artillery round fail to clear the highway and explode near southbound lanes.\n\nOne of the officers said it sounded like pebbles were raining down on his patrol motorcycle. Several pieces of shrapnel were found, including one that dented the hood of a patrol car.\n\nThe demonstration was the largest in a decade in the continental US, the Marines said, and involved fighter jets, Navy vessels, helicopters and live fire from a towed howitzer.\n\nDuring his remarks in front of hundreds of marines, Vance recalled his time in the force, railed against the government shutdown and critiqued previous military diversity initiatives.\n\n\"I would not be here today, I would not be the vice president of the United States, I would not be the man I am today were it not for those four years that I served in the Marine Corps,\" he said.\n\nVance spent four years in the Marines and served a tour in Iraq in 2005.\n\nBut his remarks largely focused on politics, and in part he attacked \"woke\" aspects of the military.\n\n\"It is our common purpose, it is our common mission and it is the fact that every single person here bleeds Marine Corps green,\" he said.\n\nOne of the Trump administration's focuses has been eliminating diversity initiatives,  particularly within the Pentagon .\n\nVance also used the stage time to rail against the nearly three-week long government shutdown and put blame on Democrats, particularly Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.\n\n\"I bring greetings today from our commander in chief, Donald J Trump, and he wanted me to tell each and every single one of you that he's proud of you, that he loves you and that despite the Schumer shutdown, he is going to do everything he can to make sure you get paid exactly as you deserve,\" he said.\n\nWhile thousands of federal workers are working without pay, the Defence Department is paying troops."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn09eklpe24o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"23:53:04.607+00:00","title":"The two words you need to help you push back at work","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article emphasizes that saying 'no' at work is essential to prevent burnout, especially in high-pressure environments.

Before you know it, work is coming home with you - seeping into weekends and disrupting time with family and friends.\n\nExperts agree learning to set boundaries is the way to stem the flow.\n\nCareer coach Helen Tupper, co-founder of Squiggly Careers, suggests a simple language shift can help reinforce boundaries.\n\nShe recommends replacing \"I can't\" with \"I don't\".\n\n\"I can't\" invites negotiation - people might try to convince you that you actually can,\" she says.\n\nBut \"I don't\" is more definitive and harder to challenge.\n\nFor example you can say \"I don't go to meetings after 5pm on a Wednesday because I pick my kids up then,\" she suggests.\n\nModel and TV chef Lorraine Pascale says not doing this ultimately led to her burning out.\n\nAlongside her television career, she opened a patisserie in Covent Garden and published a series of cookbooks, all whilst raising her daughter.\n\n\"I just wasn't very good at saying no.\n\n\"You don't want to upset people, everyone's feeding stuff in your ear as to what you should be doing. So you just keep going,\" she told  The Woman's Hour Guide to Life.\n\nShe adds that her perfectionism, including personally approving every recipe in her books, didn't help.\n\nFor Lorraine, burnout manifested physically and mentally - including \"not wanting to go near\" cakes.\n\n\"It was like an all-body reaction - a tightness in my chest,\" she explains. \"I was having arguments with myself. A lot of self-blame, a lot of guilt, and a lot of tiredness.\"\n\nLorraine's experience shows burnout can affect anyone at any level, even if statistics suggest it is more likely to happen to women - in part because of added family responsibilities.\n\nDr Claire Ashley, author of The Burnout Doctor - written after experiencing it herself - says on a practical front, sticking to a firm routine over when you finish work each day allows our brains to complete the \"stress cycle\" and enjoy time off.\n\nBut the real solution is adjusting your goals to your \"current capacity\".\n\n\"Ask yourself whether what you want to achieve is reasonable given your mental and emotional resources at the time,\" she says.\n\nIn Lorraine's case this involved stepping back from cooking and going to therapy. This helped her understand that the toxic elements of her drive to impress stemmed from her childhood in foster care.\n\nShe's since begun studying psychology herself and says she is \"much better\" - gradually getting back into cooking on more \"intentional\" terms.\n\nOf course, stress and long hours are part of any job.\n\nBut stats show an increase in the number of workers reaching breaking point.\n\nNine out of 10 workers have experienced high or extreme levels of pressure or stress in the past year,  research suggests .\n\nFeeling stressed or burnt out isn't the same as having  clinical burnout  - even if we often use the term loosely.\n\nDr Ashley says exhaustion, detachment, and reduced performance are the three defining symptoms.\n\nUnless we meet all these, we don't yet have diagnosable burnout. But of course this doesn't mean we're not on the way.\n\nTupper says it's important to stop, celebrate and acknowledge your own successes, not just focus on the next thing.\n\nDoing our best to avoid comparisons with colleagues can also help, so we run our own race, Tupper adds.\n\nOf course, not everyone is in a position to push back at work - especially in corporate, or hierarchical job environments.\n\nDr Richard Duggins, an NHS psychiatrist and the author of Burnout-Free Working, often helps patients who feel they can't assert boundaries.\n\nHe encourages workers to talk to their boss regardless of how junior they are.\n\n\"Most employers, even the hard-nosed ones, will listen and make adjustments when they understand that preventing burnout benefits everyone.\"\n\nHe says setting boundaries, asking for help, or adjusting workload or flexibility can all help, but in the end if the workplace environment doesn't change then we need to make changes to protect ourselves.\n\nAppreciating our life stages can be help with this, notes Dr Ashley.\n\n\"It's okay to say that someone working part-time, or with family responsibilities, may not be able to match the workload of a younger colleague.\"\n\nAs Lorraine puts it: \"Ambitious is fine. Being ambitious is a beautiful thing, but just learn to say no more often.\"\n\nSign up here  to receive our weekly newsletter highlighting uplifting stories and remarkable people from around the world."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y0eeqz732o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"09:07:26.716+00:00","title":"Hong Kong cargo plane crash: Two dead after Emirates jet skids off runway into sea","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A cargo plane operated by Act Airlines under a wet lease agreement with Emirates, flight EK9788, skidded off the north runway at Hong Kong International Airport during landing at 03:50 local time, crashing through perimeter fencing and colliding with a patrol vehicle operated by Hong Kong airport security staff.

says\n\nSecurity measures \"failed\" in preventing a major jewellery heist in the Louvre museum in Paris on Sunday, creating a very negative image of the country, the French justice minister has said.\n\n\"People were able to park a furniture hoist in the middle of Paris, get people up it in several minutes to grab priceless jewels and give France a terrible image,\" Gérald Darmanin said.\n\nThieves wielding power tools broke into the world's most-visited museum in broad daylight, stealing eight items described as being of inestimable value, before escaping on scooters.\n\nThere are fears that unless the thieves are caught quickly, the priceless items - including a diamond and emerald necklace Emperor Napoleon gave to his wife - will be broken up and smuggled out of the country.\n\nThe museum announced it would be staying closed on Monday following the theft.\n\nDarmanin told France Inter radio he was certain police would eventually arrest the thieves.\n\nBut the head of an organisation specialising in the location and recovery of stolen and looted artworks warned that if the thieves are not caught in the next 24 to 48 hours, the stolen jewellery will likely be \"long gone\".\n\n\"There is a race going on right now,\" Chris Marinello, the chief executive of Art Recovery International, told BBC World Service's Newshour programme.\n\nCrowns and diadems - which were stolen in the heist - can easily be broken apart and sold in small parts.\n\nThe thieves \"are not going to keep them intact, they are going to break them up, melt down the valuable metal, recut the valuable stones and hide evidence of their crime,\" Mr Marinello said, adding it would be difficult to sell these jewels intact.\n\nThe French police \"know that in the next 24 or 48 hours, if these thieves are not caught, those pieces are probably long gone,\" he said.\n\n\"They may catch the criminals but they won't recover the jewels.\"\n\nFrench Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez said he was aware of \"a great vulnerability\" in museum security in France.\n\nFrench media report that a preliminary report by the Court of Auditors (due to be published in November) said a third of the rooms in the wing where the robbery took place have no surveillance cameras.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron described the robbery as an \"attack on a heritage that we cherish because it is our history\".\n\nAnd Nathalie Goulet, a member of the French Senate's finance committee, told the BBC it was a \"very painful\" episode for France.\n\n\"We are all disappointed and angry,\" she said, and it is \"difficult to understand how it happened so easily.\"\n\nGoulet told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the gallery's alarm was recently broken, and \"we have to wait for the investigation in order to know if the alarm was disactivated.\"\n\nShe said the cut up jewels would be \"used in a money laundering system.\"\n\n\"I don't think we are facing amateurs. This is organised crime and they have absolutely no morals. They don't appreciate jewellery as a piece of history, only as a way to clean their dirty money,\" she added.\n\nThe theft took place between 09:30 and 09:40 local time on Sunday morning, shortly after the museum opened to visitors.\n\nFour masked thieves used a truck equipped with a mechanical lift to gain access to the Galerie d'Apollon (Gallery of Apollo) via a balcony close to the River Seine.\n\nPictures from the scene showed a vehicle-mounted ladder leading up to a first-floor window.\n\nTwo of the thieves cut through glass panes with a battery-powered disc cutter and entered the museum.\n\nThey then threatened the guards, who evacuated the building.\n\nThe thieves smashed the glass display cases and stole the jewels, which collectively contained thousands of diamonds and precious gemstones.\n\nThe robbery took just seven minutes.\n\nAs the museum's alarms started blaring, staff followed protocol by contacting security forces, the culture ministry said in a statement.\n\nThe thieves had tried to set fire to their vehicle outside but were prevented by the intervention of a museum staff-member, it added.\n\nEight items of jewellery were stolen in total, including an emerald and diamond necklace that Napoleon gave his wife, Empress Marie Louise.\n\nAlso taken was a diadem (jewelled headband) that once belonged to the Empress Eugénie - wife of Napoleon III - which has nearly 2,000 diamonds.\n\nThey also took a necklace that once belonged to Marie-Amelie, the last queen of France, and which contains eight sapphires and 631 diamonds, according to the Louvre's website."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjr045x425vo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"22:46:24.008+00:00","title":"How China's Five Year Plans have changed the world","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"China's Five Year Plans have been instrumental in shaping global economic and technological trends.

leaders are gathering in Beijing this week to decide on the country's key goals and aspirations for the rest of the decade.\n\nEvery year or so, the country's highest political body, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, convenes for a week of meetings, also known as a Plenum.\n\nWhat it decides at this one will eventually form the basis of China's next Five Year Plan - the blueprint that the world's second largest economy will follow between 2026 and 2030.\n\nThe full plan won't come until next year, but officials are likely to hint at its contents on Wednesday and have previously given more details within a week of that.\n\n\"Western policy works on election cycles, but Chinese policy making operates on planning cycles,\" says Neil Thomas, a fellow in Chinese politics at the Asia Society Policy Institute.\n\n\"Five Year Plans spell out what China wants to achieve, signal the direction the leadership wants to go in and move the resources of the state towards these predefined conclusions,\" he adds.\n\nOn the surface, the idea of hundreds of suited bureaucrats shaking hands and drawing up plans may appear drab - but history tells us that what they decide often has huge repercussions for the world.\n\nHere are three times China's Five Year Plan reshaped the global economy.\n\nPinpointing exactly when China began its journey to become an economic powerhouse is difficult, but many in the Party like to say it was on 18 December 1978.\n\nFor nearly three decades, China's economy had been rigidly controlled by the state. But Soviet-style central planning had failed to lift prosperity and many were still struggling in poverty.\n\nThe country was still recovering from Mao Zedong's   devastating rule. The Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution - campaigns led by Communist China's founder to reshape the nation's economy and society - resulted in millions of deaths.\n\nSpeaking at the 11th Committee's Third Plenum in Beijing, the country's new leader Deng Xiaoping declared that it was time to embrace some elements of the free market.\n\nHis policy of \"reform and opening up\" became integral to the next Five Year Plan, which began in 1981.\n\nThe creation of free trading Special Economic Zones - and the foreign investment they attracted - transformed the lives of people in China.\n\nAccording to Mr Thomas, the aims of that Five Year Plan could not have been achieved more emphatically.\n\n\"China today is beyond the wildest dreams of people in the 1970s,\" he says. \"In terms of restoring national pride as well as establishing its place amongst the great powers of the world,\" he says.\n\nBut it also fundamentally reshaped the global economy. By the 21st Century, millions of western manufacturing jobs had been outsourced to new factories in China's coastal regions.\n\nEconomists have called this \"the China shock\" and it's been one of the driving forces behind the rise of populist parties in former industrial parts of Europe and the United States.\n\nFor example, Donald Trump's economic policies - his tariffs and trade wars - are designed to bring back the American manufacturing jobs lost to China over the previous few decades.\n\nChina's status as the workshop of the world was cemented once it joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. But at the turn of the century, the Communist Party leadership was already planning its next move.\n\nIt was wary of China falling into the so-called \"middle income trap\". This happens when an upwardly mobile country can't offer ultra-low wages anymore, but at the same time doesn't have the innovative capacity to create the high-end goods and services of an advanced economy.\n\nSo instead of just cheap manufacturing, China needed to find what it called \"strategic emerging industries\" - a term first officially used in 2010. For China's leaders, this meant green technology, such as electric vehicles (EVs) and solar panels.\n\nAs climate change became increasingly important in Western politics, China mobilised an unprecedented amount of resources into these new industries.\n\nToday, China is not only the undisputed world leader in renewables and EVs, it also has a near monopoly over the rare earth supply chains needed to build them.\n\nChina's stranglehold on these key resources - which are also crucial to chip-making and artificial intelligence (AI) - now puts it in a powerful position globally.\n\nSo much so that Beijing's recent move to tighten export controls on rare earths was labelled by Trump as an attempt to \"hold the world captive\".\n\nAlthough \"strategic emerging forces\" was enshrined in the next Five Year Plan in 2011, green technology had been identified as a potential engine of growth and geopolitical power by China's then leader Hu Jintao in the early 2000s.\n\n\"This desire for China to be more self-reliant in its economy, in its technology, in its freedom of action, goes back a long way - it is part of the fibre of Chinese Communist Party ideology,\" explains Neil Thomas.\n\nThis may explain why China's Five Year Plans more recently have turned their attention to \"high quality development\", formally introduced by Xi Jinping in 2017.\n\nThis means challenging American dominance in technology and putting China at the forefront of the sector.\n\nDomestic success stories such as the video sharing app TikTok, telecommunications giant Huawei and even DeepSeek, the AI model, are all testament to China's technological boom this century.\n\nBut western countries increasingly see this as a threat to their national security. The subsequent bans or attempted bans on popular Chinese technology have affected millions of internet users around the world and have sparked bitter diplomatic rows.\n\nUntil now, China has powered its tech success using American innovation, such as Nvidia's advanced semiconductors.\n\nGiven their sale to China has now been blocked by Washington, expect \"high quality development\" to morph into \"new quality productive forces\" - a fresh slogan introduced by Xi in 2023, which tilts the focus more towards domestic pride and national security.\n\nThis means putting China at the cutting edge of chip-making, computing and AI - not reliant on Western technology and immune to embargoes.\n\nSelf-sufficiency in all areas, especially at the very top end of innovation, is likely to be one of the central tenets of the next Five Year Plan.\n\n\"National security and technological independence are now the defining mission of China's economic policy,\" Mr Thomas explains.\n\n\"Again, it goes back to that nationalist project that underpins communism in China, to ensure it never again is dominated by foreign countries\".\n\nFor more on this story, listen to  Business Daily: Can China's debt problem be solved?"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn8xg1jve73o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"16:10:25.872+00:00","title":"Trump ends aid to Colombia, calls country's leader a 'drug leader'","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has announced the end of US aid to Colombia, citing Colombian President Gustavo Petro as a 'drug leader' who fails to curb drug production.

the country's closest South American allies.\n\nThe US president announced the decision in a Truth Social post on Sunday, labelling Colombia's President Gustavo Petro as \"an illegal drug leader\" who has \"strongly encouraging the massive production of drugs, in big and small fields, all over Colombia\".\n\nHis comments come after Petro accused the US of committing \"murder\" when it carried out a military strike on a boat in Colombian territorial waters in September.\n\nThe move is the latest in a string of escalating tensions between the US and countries in Latin America, as the US military continues to strike ships in the Caribbean Sea it alleges carry drugs.\n\nTrump said because the US offers \"large scale payments and subsidies\" and Petro \"does nothing\" to stop the drug production, the US will no longer offer \"payment or subsidies\" to Colombia. According to a government website, the US provided over $740m (£551m) in aid to Colombia in 2023. It is unclear if all of that aid will stop, or when.\n\nIn September, for the first time since 1996, the US declared that Colombia had failed to uphold its drug trafficking promises, and is ineligible for aid as defined in the Foreign Assistance Act. But the state department included a waiver that allowed Colombia to continue to receive aid.\n\nBut following Petro's recent accusation of Americans committing \"murder\", Trump has escalated matters and says he will halt aid.\n\nUnder Petro, cocaine production has reached a record-level and the country has failed to reach its coca eradication goals, the state department said in September.\n\nPetro has said the US violated his country's sovereignty killing a Colombian fisherman with its September attack.\n\nPosting on social media, he said: \"The Colombian boat was adrift and had its distress signal up due to an engine failure,\" when it was struck.

At least 27 people were killed in the prior five boat strikes in the waters off Venezuela, according to figures released by the US administration.\n\nThe Thursday attack, on a submarine, is the first time survivors have been reported, though the attack also killed two people.\n\nTrump  said US intelligence confirmed the vessel was \"loaded up with mostly Fentanyl, and other illegal narcotics\".\n\nThe US president said two people who survived the submarine attack would be returned to their countries of origin, Ecuador and Colombia.\n\nThey were transferred to a US Navy ship, a source familiar with the matter told CBS News, the BBC's US partner.\n\nIn recent weeks, Trump has ramped up threats against Venezuela's leadership over claims that the country is sending drugs to the US. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has accused Trump of trying to make the South American nation \"an American colony\".\n\nTrump earlier told reporters that he had authorised the CIA to conduct covert operations in Venezuela, and that he was considering launching attacks on Venezuelan soil."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy7ekl4yl8o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"23:42:05.680+00:00","title":"Cate Blanchett: In praise of the humble seed","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Cate Blanchett, a celebrated Hollywood actress, has become a passionate ambassador for the Kew Gardens Millennium Seed Bank (MSB), which celebrates its 25th anniversary.

Cate Blanchett: In praise of the humble seed\n\nShe's a Hollywood A-lister, with a mantelpiece groaning under the weight of awards. But Cate Blanchett has taken an unexpected diversion from her day job - to immerse herself in the world of the humble seed.\n\nHer eyes light up as she enthuses about the banksia species from her native Australia.\n\n\"It's quite a brutal looking seed pod that only releases its seed in extremely high temperatures,\" she tells us.\n\n\"It does look like a cross between a mallet and a toilet brush. So they're not always pretty, but yet what comes out of them is so spectacular.\"\n\nWe meet her at Kew's Millennium Seed Bank (MSB) at Wakehurst botanic garden in Sussex. She lives locally and teamed up with the project as it celebrates its 25th anniversary.\n\n\"Really, I stumbled upon Wakehurst. I was just in awe of the landscape and I always feel regenerated by being in the natural world,\" she says.\n\n\"And then I discovered the seed bank, and I literally had my mind blown by the work that goes on here… and I thought, anything I can do to be connected to it - I found it so inspiring.\"\n\nThe MSB is home to more than 2.5 billion seeds collected from 40,000 wild plant species around the world.\n\nThe seeds, which come in every shape, size and colour, are carefully processed, dried and then stored in freezers at a chilly -20C.\n\nThe conservation project was opened by The King  - then the Prince of Wales - in 2000. He's taken part in a special episode of a Kew podcast about the project called Unearthed: The Need For Seeds with Cate Blanchett.\n\nIn the recording he talks about his concerns that many plant species are being lost.\n\n\"I know  how  absolutely  critical  it all is, and  the  destruction  of  rainforests,  the  extinction  of  endless  species,  which  have  very  likely  remarkable  properties,\" he tells the podcast.\n\nWhen the seed bank first opened, it was seen as a doomsday vault - a back-up store of seeds to safeguard wild plants from extinction.\n\nBut 25 years on, the collection is being used for a different purpose: to restore environments that are under threat.\n\n\"We want those seeds to be back out in the landscape,\" explained Dr Elinor Breman from the MSB, who's been showing Cate Blanchett the team's work.\n\n\"We're just providing a safe space for them until we can get them back out into a habitat where they can thrive and survive.\"\n\nThis includes projects like one taking place on the South Downs. A special mix of seeds from the MSB are being sown to help restore the rare chalk grasslands there.\n\nAnd this restoration work is being repeated around the world.\n\n\"We've been to every kind of habitat, from sea level to about 5,000m, and from pole to pole - literally,\" explained Dr Breman.\n\n\"And we're involved in restoring tropical forest, dry deciduous forest, grassland, steppe - you name it - we're trying to help people put those plants back in place.\"\n\nThe seed bank also helped to restore plants after intense wildfires swept across Australia in 2019. Cate Blanchett says this meant a lot to her.\n\n\"There are almost 9,000 species of Australian plant that are stored [at the MSB].  And we know that bushfires are getting increasingly more intense. And it's sad to say - but knowing that insurance policy exists, is of great solace to me.\"\n\nWorking as an ambassador for Wakehurst has meant that the actor has had a chance to get hands on with the seeds.\n\n\"Have I got dirt under my fingernails? Well, I'm trying to turn my brown thumbs green,\" she laughs.\n\n\"You know, living in Sussex, you can't not but become a passionate gardener. So I've had a lot of questions about how one stores seeds as a lay person, and I've learned a lot about that. My seed management has definitely, definitely improved.\"\n\nAnd after spending so much time with the researchers at the MSB, is she at all tempted to swap the film set for the lab?\n\n\"I wish I had the skill - maybe I could play a scientist,\" she laughs.\n\nCate Blanchett describes the seed bank as the UK's best kept secret - and believes that over the next 25 years its work will continue to grow in importance.\n\n\"You often think, where are the good news stories? And we're actually sitting inside one,\" she tells us.\n\n\"You come here, you visit the seed bank, you walk through such a biodiverse landscape, and you leave uplifted. You know change is possible and it's happening.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clykev1p79xo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"23:35:41.272+00:00","title":"MoD probes claims Russian hackers stole files on bases","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The UK Ministry of Defence is investigating claims that Russian hackers stole and published hundreds of sensitive military documents, including details of RAF and Royal Navy bases and personal data of MoD staff, on the dark web.

to stress the long-term damage done to the UK economy by the 2020 Brexit deal, in her remarks at a key international economic committee at the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\nIn remarks published this weekend, the chancellor told the world's leading finance ministers and central bankers: \"The UK's productivity challenge has been compounded by the way in which the UK left the European Union.\"\n\nShe quoted the Office for Budget Responsibility's calculation of a 4% long-term hit relative to remaining in the EU, and said the UK \"acknowledges this\" in seeking stronger trade ties.\n\nLabour had been reluctant to stress arguments about economic downsides from Brexit.\n\nHowever, since its conference last month, ministers have been increasingly strident in making such arguments.\n\nThe Brexit deal announced in 2020 was negotiated by the Conservative government led by Boris Johnson, although Labour agreed  a deal to \"reset\" relations  between the UK and the EU in May this year.\n\nRaising the issues from the 2020 Brexit deal in the most high-level global economic policy council, including the G7, China, India, the EU and European Central Bank, would have been unsurprising around the table. But it confirms a notable change of emphasis, domestically.\n\nIt is expected to become a key part of the government's argument in the run-up to  the Budget on 26 November,  where a large part of the need for new measures - expected to be tax rises - will be down to a downgrade to long-term UK productivity.\n\nThe OBR will be expected to spell out in detail why any downgrade has occurred, when it publishes its forecast at next month's Budget.\n\nBrexit is expected to feature. External economists have pointed to a fall in investment amid uncertainty after the referendum, as well as an underperformance on goods trade. Others point to robust services trade, and new freedoms to do trade deals around the world.\n\nThe issue is sensitive right now with government deciding on negotiating positions for the Brexit \"reset\" including scrapping most post-Brexit checks on food and farm trade, and helping UK manufacturers join consortia to bid for Europe's surging defence budgets.\n\nEuropean ministers urged maximum ambition in the talks to help mitigate the impact of trade wars elsewhere in the world.\n\nReeves announced tax rises worth £40bn a year at her first Budget last November, including hikes to payroll taxes paid by employers, and insisted she would not have to repeat the move in subsequent years.\n\nBut the chancellor is now facing the prospect of another repair job to the public finances.\n\nThe Conservatives opened up a clear dividing line on the issue at their conference, pledging to slash public spending by £47bn a year if they win the next election through cuts to welfare, the civil service and foreign aid.\n\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter  to keep up with the inner workings of Westminster and beyond."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0jdn4yjze6o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"09:15:07.348+00:00","title":"Cyber scams: Notorious hub linked to Chinese mafia raided in Myanmar","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Myanmar military has raided KK Park, one of the most notorious online scam hubs on the Thai-Myanmar border, claiming to have dismantled a center linked to fraud, human trafficking, and ties to Chinese criminal figures like Wan Kuok Koi (Broken Tooth).

most notorious scam compounds on the border with Thailand, as it reclaims key territory it lost in the ongoing civil war.\n\nKK Park, south of the border town of Myawaddy, has been synonymous with online fraud, money laundering and human trafficking for the past five years.\n\nThousands of people were lured to the compound with the promise of well-paid jobs, and then forced to run elaborate scams, stealing billions of dollars from victims all over the world.\n\nThe military, long tainted by its links to the scam business, now says it has taken the complex as it expands control around Myawaddy, the main trade link to Thailand.\n\nIn recent weeks the military, or junta, has pushed back insurgents in several parts of Myanmar, aiming to maximise the number of places where it can hold a planned election, starting in December.\n\nIt still doesn't control large swathes of the country, which has been torn apart by conflict since a military coup in February 2021. The election has been dismissed as a sham by opposition forces who have vowed to block it in areas they hold.\n\nKK Park began with a lease agreement in early 2020 to build an industrial park between the Karen National Union (KNU), the ethnic insurgent group which controls much of this region, and a little-known Hong Kong listed company, Huanya International.\n\nResearchers believe there are links between Huanya and a prominent Chinese underworld figure Wan Kuok Koi, better known as Broken Tooth, who has since invested in other scam centres on the border.\n\nThe complex expanded rapidly, and is easily visible from the Thai side of the border.\n\nThose who managed to escape from it describe a brutal regime imposed on the thousands of people, many from African countries, who were held there, forced to work long hours, with torture and beatings inflicted on those who failed to meet targets.\n\nA statement by the junta's information ministry said its forces had \"cleared\" KK Park, releasing more than 2,000 workers there and confiscating 30 of Elon Musk's Starlink satellite terminals – widely used by scam centres on the Thai-Myanmar border for online activities.\n\nThe statement blamed what it called the \"terrorist\" Karen National Union and volunteer people's defence forces, which have been fighting the junta since the coup, for illegally occupying the area.\n\nThe junta's claim to have shut down this infamous scam centre is almost certainly directed at its main patron, China. Beijing has been pressing the junta and the Thai government to do more to end the illegal businesses run by Chinese syndicates on their border.\n\nEarlier this year thousands of Chinese workers were taken out of scam compounds and flown on chartered planes back to China, after Thailand cut access to power and fuel supplies.\n\nBut KK Park is only one of at least 30 similar compounds located on the border. Most of these are under the protection of Karen militia groups allied to the junta, and most are still operating, with tens of thousands of people running scams inside them.\n\nIn fact, the support of these militia groups has been crucial in helping the military drive back the KNU and other resistance groups from territory they captured over the past two years.\n\nThe military now controls nearly all of the road linking Myawaddy to the rest of Myanmar, a goal the junta set itself before it holds the first stage of the election in December.\n\nIt has taken Lay Kay Kaw, a new town established for the KNU with Japanese funding in 2015, a time when there had been hopes for lasting peace in Karen State following a national ceasefire.\n\nThat is a more significant blow to the KNU than the takeover of KK Park, from which it did get some revenue, but where most of the financial benefits went to pro-junta militias.\n\nA well-placed source has told the BBC that scam work is continuing in KK Park, and that it is likely the military took control of only part of the sprawling complex.\n\nThe source also believes Beijing is giving the Myanmar military lists of Chinese individuals it wants taken from the scam compounds, and sent back to face trial in China, which may explain why KK Park was attacked."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgr589k5yleo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"09:53:05.094+00:00","title":"What is Aukus, the submarine deal between Australia, UK and US?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Aukus security pact, a $239 billion trilateral defense initiative between Australia, the UK, and the US, is being reviewed by the Trump administration under its 'America First' agenda, raising concerns over strategic alignment.

US?\n\nA multi-billion dollar submarine deal between long-standing allies - Australia, the UK and the US - has come under the spotlight after the Trump administration said it was  reviewing how the deal fits in with its heavily-touted \"America First\" agenda .\n\nThe Aukus security pact, Australia's biggest ever defence project, is set to play a key part in the country's ability to replace its ageing Collins-class submarine fleet - and, crucially, its military standing in the region.\n\nThe ongoing review is being led by  the principal adviser to the US defence secretary, Elbridge Colby, who has previously been critical of Aukus. In a speech last year, he questioned why the US would give away \"this crown jewel asset when we most need it\".\n\nA US defence spokesperson said the review is about ensuring \"this initiative of the previous administration is aligned with the President's America First agenda\".\n\nFears the review may torpedo the deal have been downplayed by the UK and Australia, with both saying the review is a normal process when a new government takes power.\n\nThe deal is expected to be the focus of talks between  US President Donald Trump and his Australian counterpart Anthony Albanese as they meet in Washington, DC, on Monday.\n\nBilled as a trilateral security partnership, the Aukus deal - worth £176bn ($239bn; A$368bn) over 30 years - involves two so-called pillars.\n\nPillar one is about the supply and delivery of nuclear-powered attack submarines.\n\nAustralia will buy three second-hand Virginia-class submarines from the US from 2032 with options to purchase two more.\n\nAfter that, the plan is to design and build an entirely new nuclear-powered submarine model for the UK and Australian navies.\n\nThis attack craft will be built in Britain and Australia to a British design, but use technology from all three countries.\n\nAustralia has pledged $3bn to boost US submarine production rates, and officials have said payments are continuing on schedule despite the review.\n\nPillar two is about the allies collaborating on their \"advanced capabilities\". This involves sharing military expertise in areas such as long-range hypersonic missiles,  undersea robotics and AI.\n\nAt its core, the deal is believed to be about countering China's growing presence in the Indo-Pacific region, and its role in rising tensions in disputed territories such as the South China Sea.\n\nWhile none of the allies have directly pointed at China as a reason for the deal, the three countries have spoken about how regional security concerns have \"grown significantly\" in recent years.\n\nChina condemned the agreement  as \"extremely irresponsible\" when it was first announced.\n\nForeign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said it \"seriously undermines regional peace and stability and intensifies the arms race\".\n\nThe deal was  unveiled in September 2021  by three former leaders: Australia's Scott Morrison, the UK's Boris Johnson and the US's Joe Biden.\n\nThe UK reviewed the security pact last year after Sir Keir Starmer's Labour government won the general election.\n\nFor Australia, the deal represents a major upgrade to its military capabilities. The country is set to become just the second to receive Washington's elite nuclear propulsion technology, after the UK.\n\nSuch submarines will be able to operate further and faster than the country's existing diesel-engine fleet. They would also mean Australia would be able to carry out long-range strikes against enemies for the first time.\n\nUnder the deal, sailors from the Royal Australian Navy are due to be sent to US and UK submarine bases to learn how to use the nuclear-powered submarines.\n\nFrom 2027, the pact will allow both the US and UK to base a small number of nuclear submarines in Perth, Western Australia.\n\nIt will also create about 7,000 jobs in Britain, with the design and construction of the new fleet of nuclear-powered submarines set to take place in the UK.\n\nThe benefits for the US are less obvious - but sharing its defence technology could give the nation an opportunity to grow its presence in Asia-Pacific.\n\nArming Australia has historically been viewed by Washington and Downing Street as essential to preserving peace in a region that is far from their own."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3970pnlr0xo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"21:54:55.494+00:00","title":"Bankers on edge, a gilded cash room and US blaming China - my week at IMF","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During the IMF annual meetings in Washington DC, US Treasury officials, including Scott Bessent and Jamieson Greer, deliver a stark message that the world is in a 'China versus the world' trade conflict, intensified by China's sweeping export controls on rare earth minerals and critical tech components.

gilded cash room and US blaming China - my week at IMF\n\nThere is an eerie emptiness at the seat of US economic power.\n\nThe US Treasury is in shutdown like much of the federal government.\n\nMost staff are furloughed as the world's finance ministers and bankers jet in for the International Monetary Fund annual meetings a few blocks away, their delayed flights handled by a small number of unpaid air traffic controllers.\n\nThere is, however, one clear message the Trump administration is notably keen to get out, not so much for its domestic audience but for the bewildered world outside.\n\nAnd they delivered it in the middle of last week to a small number of people ushered into the Treasury and what is said to be the finest room in Washington DC, the ornate and marbled Cash Room, which hosted the inaugural reception for post-civil war president, Ulysses Grant.\n\n\"Make no mistake,\" said Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent alongside Trade Ambassador Jamieson Greer, as they fired the latest salvo in the ongoing 2025 global trade war. \"This is China versus the world.\"\n\nThis simple message connects several extraordinary economic currents swirling around the world right now.\n\nThey include China's new export controls on critical minerals, fears of an AI bubble bursting, the tariff chaos and even the development of an erotic chatbot by OpenAI.\n\nThe world always seems to tilt a little on its axis in the two weeks a year that top bankers and finance ministers mass in Washington DC for their meetings at the IMF.\n\nIt is rare that the host itself is the main source of upheaval. Normally it would be a developing country, or perhaps the eurozone in the 2010s and infamously the UK in 2022.\n\nThe decisions and uncertainty arising from US trade policy, dizzying markets and decisions over its interest rates, loom large.\n\nThe inescapable signal being sent by the two most powerful US trade negotiators as they spoke to a small group of media in the Treasury's Cash Room was that China last week fired perhaps its most potent weapon yet by dramatically increasing restrictions on the trade of rare earth components.\n\nThese are critical to the production of high-tech goods ranging from electric cars to military hardware.\n\nBessent called the move a \"Chinese chokehold\" on the world.\n\nChina's \"sweeping expansion\" of export controls on rare earth elements and equipment, as well as electric vehicle battery tech, industrial diamonds and super hard materials is \"an exercise in economic coercion on every country in the world\", said Greer.\n\nThis accusation is being made as his own boss, President Donald Trump, attempts to redraw global trade relations by using tariffs to eliminate US trade deficits.\n\nHe may have produced what is the toughest tariffs system the world has seen since 1933 but the disruption it has caused has been surprisingly muted so far.\n\nThe biggest economy on the planet is now behind a significant tariff wall but it's yet to feel the impact, partly thanks to a wealth boom built on some rather frothy tech valuations.\n\nThe conclusion to take from that is either the world economy is more shock absorbent than thought or it is just a matter of timing, with the real pain ahead.\n\nCompanies exporting to the US have swallowed the cost of tariffs, which are effectively import taxes, in their profit margins. But is that only for the time being?\n\nThe wall of tariffs that the US has built around its economy has led to more trade, for example, from China to Europe and Africa.\n\nThe US itself has been protected, for now, from the profound uncertainties, higher prices and domestic living standards impacts of the tariffs and the 10% fall in the value of the dollar.\n\nSome insulation has come from booming AI tech sector share valuations, creating a profound wealth effect in certain households across the US, calculated by JP Morgan economists as worth $180bn per year.\n\nThe thin line between boom and bubble is impossible to calculate. Sometimes, it can be felt.\n\nI was standing outside the Nasdaq in New York's Times Square, where the high tech market which symbolises US private sector tech ascendancy publicises its latest IPOs (stock launches) to the world.\n\nOne of the dozens of funds which raises real cash to plough into crypto, joyously \"rang the opening bell\", despite their share price already having slumped.\n\nThe executives then filed out into the Square to watch a giant video of themselves ringing the bell, among confused tourists. In fact, inside the Nasdaq, there is no bell, or trading floor either, just a bank of futuristic screens. Is it just hubris?\n\nAnother screen reminds us it is the 20th anniversary of the Nasdaq flotation of another tech company which went public here, now worth $3tn, Google.\n\nThis week, OpenAI's Sam Altman revealed that ChatGPT was developing chatbot erotica options.\n\nThis comes at a time when analysts are taking a hard look at firms like Altman's which have emerged at the front of the pack in the AI race.\n\nA raft of convoluted deals where major US firms including chipmakers are investing in their own suppliers and vice versa has raised eyebrows further about the potential that the billions being poured into data centres, AI start-ups and cutting-edge manufacturing plants could be fuelling an ever-growing bubble.\n\nSo are the Chinese trying to weaponise these fears that it's all about to burst?\n\nThis is what Jamieson Greer seemed to suggest when he said the Chinese export controls on minerals critical to many important semiconductors gives Beijing control over the entire global economy and the technology supply chain which powers the very firms that could be keeping the US economy afloat.\n\n\"This will impact artificial intelligence systems and high tech products,\" he said.\n\nBessent also joined in, saying US media reports that China was playing hardball and was prepared to use financial markets to hurt the US was like \"taking dictation\" from the Chinese communist party. He went on, unusually, to accuse a named Chinese negotiator of going rogue.\n\nNone of this seems like a game of chess.\n\nThis is not carefully considered maestros thinking out their strategies, six moves ahead of time. This is more like playing pool by smashing the balls indiscriminately around the table, and then attempting to break the cue, or the table, or both.\n\nTariffs, counter-tariffs and export controls amount to mutually assured destruction manoeuvres which are cloaked behind the general assumption that President Trump will always pull back from the brink. The more that is baked in, the higher the risk of a shock.\n\nIn this situation, it is sensible game theory to look for allies.\n\nThe China moves would affect the whole world, including Europe. UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves and other leading European finance ministers told me they would work with global partners to ensure the supply of these rare earth materials.\n\nReeves pointed to work with Canada especially on developing alternative supply chains. The US is now reopening mines, and refining facilities. Chinese dominance here is decades in the making, however.\n\nAt times like this, it is also fair to say there is some divergence between the public words of diplomacy and what is being said in private.\n\nThere was frustration and bafflement behind the scenes directed at the US for having liberally sprayed tariffs in all directions while asking the world to focus on China's trade distortions.\n\n\"It's hard to tell friend from foe,\" said one G20 finance minister.\n\n\"The Americans are basically trying to corral the rest of the world against China, using everything as leverage against China,\" one senior G7 official told me.\n\nThis climate of suspicion breeds uncertainty and the world's smaller central banks are ploughing their money into the so-called safe haven of gold for a reason, sending it to new records.\n\nBack at the US Treasury Cash Room, where there is a lot of gold detail in the seven types of marble, there is another telling statement from US Treasury Secretary Bessent.\n\nHe sees the US going through a 1990s-style high-tech productivity boom. \"That's the most analogous period to what we're seeing now.\"\n\nIn the coming weeks he will help choose the new chair of the US Federal Reserve in the mould of 1990s Alan Greenspan, who famously accommodated the run-up of the dotcom boom with low interest rates, considered by some to have contributed to the financial crash. Bessent has been rereading Greenspan's biography Maestro.\n\nBut in the 1990s the world's second biggest economy was not taking steps to interrupt the new tech supply chain and there was not a constantly rolling threat of more tariffs from China and the US.\n\nThese are centrifugal forces shaping the uneasy calm in the world economy.\n\nThe Road Runner moment has happened. Like the cartoon character, having headed off the edge of a cliff, global trade is defying gravity momentarily but the running has kept going, and even sped up.\n\nThe world's finance ministers on their field trip to Washington have had to assume the world economy will muddle through this.\n\nIt doesn't mean it will."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg7nrlkg0zxo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"09:46:04.397+00:00","title":"Everything we know about the Louvre jewellery heist","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A brazen heist occurred at the Louvre Museum in Paris on Sunday, between 09:30 and 09:40 local time, when four armed thieves used a vehicle-mounted ladder and battery-powered disc cutters to breach the Gallery of Apollo, stealing eight 19th-century royal jewellery items, including diadems and necklaces.

police investigate a brazen heist which targeted France's priceless crown jewels.\n\nThieves wielding power tools broke into the world's most visited museum in broad daylight, before escaping on scooters with eight extremely valuable items of jewellery.\n\nHere is what we know about the crime which has stunned France.\n\nThe robbery happened on Sunday between 09:30 and 09:40 local time (08:30 and 08:40 BST), shortly after the museum opened to visitors.\n\nFour thieves used a vehicle-mounted mechanical lift to gain access to the Galerie d'Apollon (Gallery of Apollo) via a balcony close to the River Seine.\n\nPictures from the scene showed a vehicle-mounted ladder leading up to a first-floor window.\n\nTwo of the thieves cut through glass panes with a battery-powered disc cutter and entered the museum.\n\nThey then threatened the guards, who evacuated the premises, and stole items from two glass display cases.\n\nA preliminary report has revealed that one in three rooms in the area of the museum raided had no CCTV cameras, according to French media.\n\nThis is a \"very painful\" episode for France, said Natalie Goulet, a member of the French Senate's finance committee.\n\n\"We are all disappointed and angry,\" she said, and it is \"difficult to understand how it happened so easily.\"\n\nGoulet told the BBC the gallery's localised alarm was recently broken, and \"we have to wait for the investigation in order to know if the alarm was disactivated\".\n\nFrance's culture ministry said the museum's wider alarms did sound and staff followed protocol by contacting security forces and protecting visitors.\n\nThe gang had tried to set fire to their vehicle outside but were prevented by the intervention of a museum staff-member, the culture ministry added.\n\nCulture Minister Rachida Dati told French news outlet TF1 that footage of the theft showed the masked robbers entering \"calmly\" and smashing display cases containing the jewels. No one was injured in the incident.\n\nShe described the thieves as seemingly being \"experienced\" with a well-prepared plan to flee on two scooters.\n\nAround 60 investigators are working on the case and prosecutors said their theory is that the robbers were under orders for a criminal organisation.\n\nThe search is on for four suspects and investigators are studying CCTV footage from the escape route.\n\nOne witness described scenes of \"total panic\" as the museum was evacuated. Later images showed entrances closed off with metal gates.\n\nAccording to the authorities, eight items were taken, including diadems (a jewelled headband), necklaces, ear-rings and brooches. All are from the 19th century, and once belonged to French royalty or imperial rulers.\n\nFrance's ministry of culture said the stolen items were:\n\nBetween them, these pieces are adorned with thousands of diamonds and other precious gemstones.\n\nTwo more items, including Empress Eugénie's crown, were found near the scene, apparently having been dropped during the escape. The authorities are examining them for damage.\n\nNuñez described the stolen jewels \"priceless\" and \"of immeasurable heritage value\".\n\n\"There is a race going on right now,\" Chris Marinello, the chief executive of Art Recovery International, said.\n\nCrowns and diadems can easily be broken apart and sold in small parts.\n\nThe thieves \"are not going to keep them intact, they are going to break them up, melt down the valuable metal, recut the valuable stones and hide evidence of their crime,\" Marinello said.\n\nIt would be difficult to sell these jewels intact, he said.\n\nEarlier this year, officials at the Louvre requested help from the French government to restore and renovate the museum's ageing exhibition halls and better protect its works of art.\n\nAt the time, French President Emmanuel Macron pledged the Louvre would be redesigned as part of the New Renaissance project - expected to cost between €700 million and €800 million ( £ 608m - £695m; $816m - $933m). The project includes reinforced security.\n\nThe Louvre remains closed on Monday while investigations into the robbery continue.\n\nIn a message on its website, the museum said visitors who had already booked tickets would be automatically refunded.\n\nPolice and security personnel could be seen around the site's famous glass pyramid entrance on Monday. Metal barriers have also been put up.\n\nNo information has been given about when the museum may reopen to the public.\n\nThe Louvre is always closed on Tuesdays, so the earliest it could reopen this week would be Wednesday.\n\nThe theft has caused a political outcry in France, with Macron calling the raid \"an attack on our history\", National Rally leader Jordan Bardella said it was a \"intolerable humiliation\" and Marine Le Pen of Front Nationale called it a \"wound to the French soul\".\n\nIn 1911, an Italian museum employee was able to make off with the Mona Lisa under his coat after lifting the painting - which was then little-known to the public - straight off the wall of a quiet gallery.\n\nIt was recovered after two years and the culprit later said he was motivated by the belief the Leonardo da Vinci masterpiece belonged in Italy.\n\nFewer chances are taken with the Mona Lisa these days: the painting, perhaps the most renowned in the museum's collection, hangs in a high-security glass compartment.\n\nIn 1998, the Le Chemin de Sevres - a 19th century painting by Camille Corot - was stolen and has never been found. The incident prompted a massive overhaul of museum security.\n\nThere has been a recent spate of thefts targeting French museums.\n\nLast month, thieves broke into the Adrien Dubouche Museum in Limoges and stole porcelain works reputedly worth €9.5m ($11m / £8.25m).\n\nIn November 2024, seven items of \"great historic and heritage value\" were stolen from the Cognacq-Jay Museum in the capital. Five were recovered a few days ago.\n\nThe same month, armed robbers raided the Hieron Museum in Burgundy, firing shots before escaping with millions of pounds worth of 20th century artworks."}]}
