For transgender Americans, this year’s memorials will take on particular poignance, as the Trump administration and  conservative lawmakers  have  taken great strides  to restrict how they can live  publicly  and privately, while also eliminating  federal data collection  about anti-trans hate crimes and ending funding for an  LGBTQ suicide hotline .\n \n\n   \n  Since last November, at least 27 trans and nonbinary people have been killed, according to the nonprofit  Advocates for Trans Equality . The number is likely an undercount as precise data is difficult to collect, the organization notes. Some research has shown trans people are  more than four times  more likely than cisgender people to be victims of violent crime.\n \n\n   \n  “In many ways, in our society, trans people are made to feel invisible,” said Bahari Thomas, the advocacy group’s director of public education.\n \n\n   \n  Trans people, particularly trans youth, are also at heightened risk of suicidal thoughts and attempts, according to the  Trevor Project . The organization notes this may be the result of a lack of social support and exposure to stigma and discrimination.\n \n\n   \n  Gwendolyn Smith – one of the activists who founded Transgender Day of Remembrance – said it’s both heartening to see her community uphold what she started decades later and sobering to see them continue to experience high rates of violence.\n \n\n   \n  It’s crucial, she said, to remember the “very vibrant lives” trans victims led. “That’s our humanity.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has profiled eight trans people who died this year, focusing on the fullness of their lives rather than the tragic circumstances of their deaths. These are their stories.\n \n\n   \n    Tahiry Broom, who stood ‘ten toes down’ for her values\n \n\n   \n  Tahiry Broom could show up anywhere – from a seat at a church service to a night club’s pulsing dance floor – armed with her long, painted nails, shimmery eyeshadow and colorful wigs. Then, like magic, the whole place would belong to her.\n \n\n   \n  And Patricia Bender would most likely be there, too, watching proudly.\n \n\n   \n  Bender is Tahiry Broom’s aunt, but the two grew up more like siblings. With only five years between them, Bender and Broom spent their days in Cleveland, practically inseparable.\n \n\n   \n  “When you see me, you saw her,” Bender said.\n \n\n   \n  Bender said she loved Broom’s fearlessness. Broom taught her to “walk into the room like you own it, every time.”\n \n\n   \n  Broom was outspoken, always standing “ten toes down” for anyone or anything she believed in, ever since she was a kid. She was a social butterfly who “could make fun out of nothing.”\n \n\n   \n  Bender, who is a member of the LGBTQ community, said Broom leaned on her for support before coming into her own as a transgender woman.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m like, ‘Hey, you can’t worry yourself worrying about what the next person is going to feel like or what the next person is going to think, because at the end of the day, you’re killing yourself trying to make everybody else happy,’” Bender said.\n \n\n   \n  She also helped Broom become more acquainted with those in Cleveland’s LGBTQ community. Bender already knew “everything and everybody” and getting to know new people “was a big thing” for Broom.\n \n\n   \n  She was outgoing. She loved everybody, and they loved her back.\n \n\n   \n  Going one to two weeks without hearing from her wasn’t cause for concern. She was independent and tended to mind her own business.\n \n\n   \n  But in February, Bender’s phone began to ring and ring and ring. She hesitated to answer, sensing there may be bad news on the other end of the line.\n \n\n   \n  “Sometimes your phone rings and it rings different,” Bender said.\n \n\n   \n  When she finally answered her cousins’ FaceTime call and saw their rosy and tear-stained faces, she said she felt numb.\n \n\n   \n  Broom – visiting snowy Southfield, Michigan, at the time – had been shot and killed, less than a month before her 30th birthday.\n \n\n   \n  “My little brother, my nephews, my male cousins, I worry about them. They’ll be outside doing only God knows what,” Bender said. “Tahiry? Nobody worries about Tahiry.”\n \n\n   \n  A suspect in Broom’s death has been charged with second-degree murder and remains in custody, awaiting a trial date, according to Southfield police.\n \n\n   \n  Hearing of an arrest in Broom’s case was a “calming feeling” for Bender, but getting her justice would involve the suspect being “in a cell for the rest of his life,” she said. She and her family members keep up with the case by regularly attending the suspect’s Zoom hearings.\n \n\n   \n  Researchers and advocacy groups say Black trans women, like Broom, are disproportionately impacted by violence. Of the 372 trans victims identified by Human Rights Watch between 2013 and 2024, 73% were women of color, and 60% were Black women.\n \n\n   \n  Bender is still Broom’s “ying and yang.” Her “frick and frack.”\n \n\n   \n  Her niece might have thought introducing her to the local LGBTQ scene, being older or being her “auntie” made Bender Broom’s “savior.” But Broom, Bender said, saved her too.\n \n\n   \n  “I may be helping you in a sense or exposing you to this…and I’m helping you live your truth,” she added. “And the whole time, you think you need me. But the whole time, I needed you more.”\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Sydney Bishop \n \n\n   \n    Karmin Wells, a Detroit ballroom legend whose walk rivaled Naomi Campbell\n \n\n   \n  She was the “walking wonder” of Detroit’s queer ballroom scene – a nightlife runway legend whose hip-twisting strut is rumored to have put Naomi Campbell to shame. She wouldn’t hit the runway in anything less than six-inch heels, and the jangle of jewelry and sharp clack of her heels announced her presence almost everywhere she went.\n \n\n   \n  She was Karmin Wells – nothing more and nothing less.\n \n\n   \n  “Her style can’t be mimicked ever again,” said her aunt, Markeitha Bibb. “When she came in, they knew what it is. They knew she was (going to) take the stage.”\n \n\n   \n  The 37-year-old was a staple of the local ballroom community, a historic queer subculture where performers compete in categories that include modeling, dancing and “voguing.” Often, performers compete as members of a “house,” a chosen family that can provide a support system that biological families sometimes cannot.\n \n\n   \n  Wells had worked the stage for years, eventually earning the status of “legend” and becoming the mother of the Detroit chapter of the internationally-renowned House of Revlon.\n \n\n   \n  Monica Hudson met Wells when she was still a teenager. Hudson had been doing LGBTQ community outreach at the city’s Palmer Park when she came across Wells and was instantly charmed by her witty sense of humor.\n \n\n   \n  “Our interaction was so real and so raw and authentic. She ended up becoming my chosen daughter,” Hudson said. When Wells was killed on May 25, Hudson said it felt like “losing a part of myself.”\n \n\n   \n  Wells was shot to death in her home just days before her 38th birthday. Police say the suspect has not been identified or charged.\n \n\n   \n  “The world lost a talented, funny, loving, caring, hardworking hustler. The world has lost a gem,” said Hudson.\n \n\n   \n  She cared deeply for her grandfather, Willie Bibb, and her younger sister, Kimari Howard, her aunt said. And she had formed her own sprawling family of chosen children – younger people she mentored and uplifted, Hudson said.\n \n\n   \n  “Whatever you gave her, she gave it back to you 10 times,” said Marcel Goudeaux-Stanley, Wells’ close friend and former significant other. “You could never outdo her. She had a really, really big heart.”\n \n\n   \n  Never staying in one place for long, Wells’ suitcase seemed to always be packed. She would leave Michigan at a moment’s notice, traveling to Las Vegas to hit the casinos or to Atlanta to compete in balls, Bibb said. Then, she would show up on her aunt’s doorstep, insisting they go out to Gigi’s or the Woodward, popular LGBTQ bars in Detroit.\n \n\n   \n  “She’s always on the go. She’s always hustling,” Hudson said.\n \n\n   \n  But Wells found peace in small ways: through morning devotionals to God, performing alone in the privacy of her living room, and finding the company of those who knew who she was when the aura of entertainment wore off, Hudson said.\n \n\n   \n  “When she’s around people that she loves, that genuinely love her, and when she can be comfortable and she can rest, that’s where she’s genuinely happy,” Hudson said.\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Elizabeth Wolfe \n \n\n   \n    Lia Smith, a curious student athlete and formidable board game opponent\n \n\n   \n  For her parents, Lia Smith’s birth was a dream come true – albeit a little nerve-racking.\n \n\n   \n  Born early at just over 31 weeks and under 4 pounds, Smith arrived just minutes before her twin (a fact she would later point out with pride to her “baby” sister). Her father, Greg Smith, camped out in the NICU for weeks until he and his husband, Keith, were able to take the babies home to meet their other child.\n \n\n   \n  “We were just thrilled beyond belief,” Greg Smith said.\n \n\n   \n  Smith grew into a healthy child and young adult who was deeply empathetic, “intrinsically curious and very hardworking,” her father said.\n \n\n   \n  She filled her days learning piano and trombone, going to swim practice, poring over books on world history, and playing board games and cards with her family. Exceptional with numbers and problem-solving, she eventually learned how to count cards and maximize her odds of winning.\n \n\n   \n  “Over time, I learned to only play games of pure chance with her if I wanted to win,” Smith said at his daughter’s   memorial service earlier this month. “Simply put, she was smarter than me.”\n \n\n   \n  Diving became a “core part of her existence,” he said. At age 8, Smith began training with Stanford’s youth swim program, and by the time she left home for college, her bedroom walls were decorated with hundreds of competition ribbons.\n \n\n   \n  Though she was recruited by several colleges to compete on their men’s teams, she was delighted to be invited to compete on the women’s team at Middlebury College in Vermont, her father said.\n \n\n   \n  It would be the first time she would compete on a team that aligned with her identity. After her first year at Middlebury, Smith stopped competing in diving but continued to practice with the team.\n \n\n   \n  “She was really more focused on being one of the girls,” Smith said. “It was very affirming, and mostly she just wanted to hang out with them and practice.”\n \n\n   \n  This year, Smith returned to Middlebury as a senior, working towards degrees in statistics and computer science. The 21-year-old was somehow able to find time to pursue other interests as well.\n \n\n   \n  “She loved to debate the history of Japan or think about the intricacies of China. She had a keen and eclectic interest, and it made it always fun and interesting to talk to her.”\n \n\n   \n  Though she loved to spend time with family and friends, she was at her core an introvert. In her cherished private moments, she would read, sit down at the piano, or write poetry, which she rarely shared.\n \n\n   \n  But while Lia was deeply loved, her father Greg said at her memorial that she “lived on a daily basis with the quiet whispers of judgment and the furrowed brows of contempt.”\n \n\n   \n  Last month, Lia was reported missing. After a days-long search, her body was found near the college campus. She had died by suicide.\n \n\n   \n  Lia did not leave a note explaining why she killed herself, but her father noted that she had felt the brunt of cultural backlash against transgender people, a feeling he said was only exacerbated by online harassment and  a parade of restrictions  on transgender people under the Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n  “Over time, I believe the relentless negativity exhausted her,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Hundreds of people attended memorial services at Middlebury and at Smith’s high school, her father said. He was stricken by the “infinite love” shared at the services and the outpouring of support he has received from strangers online.\n \n\n   \n  “She was perfect for us in every way,” he said. “We cherished her, and others did, too.”\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Elizabeth Wolfe \n \n\n   \n    Amyri Dior, a mother figure with a musical soul\n \n\n   \n  Even though Amyri Dior didn’t have children, she was like a mother to all. She guided and cared for her loved ones in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, deeply. And when it came to her family and friends’ children, she didn’t play around — she looked after them like her own.\n \n\n   \n  “My child, her friend’s children, she would claim them as her kids,” Alejandra Rederford, Dior’s cousin and best friend, said. “Always giving. She will give her last, even if it’s her last … Amyri was a good, caring, genuine soul.”\n \n\n   \n  Dior also “didn’t discriminate” when it came to music and had a passion for singing, rapping and dancing. Rederford said sometimes she would sing while Dior rapped on the spot. Through giggles, she also recalled a memory of Dior dancing in a parking lot once to the sound of a car alarm.\n \n\n   \n  “She would try to hype the people around her to dance,” Rederford said.\n \n\n   \n  Dior would write her own songs, her grandmother, Carrie Joyner, remembered.\n \n\n   \n  “She sang her own music from her own voice. She loved singing with such character,” Joyner said.\n \n\n   \n  Dior would also take the time to have deep conversations with Rederford and others about her experience as a trans woman. She was confident in her identity, even if some people didn’t accept her.\n \n\n   \n  Rederford and Joyner also highlighted Dior’s immense strength, living in foster care as a child for eight years before ultimately running away to her grandma’s house.\n \n\n   \n  Dior and Rederford were only a year apart, and mid-February was always a special time, with their birthdays on February 15 on February 21, respectively.\n \n\n   \n  On Dior’s 23rd birthday this year, they celebrated with a house party full of food and drinks. Dior sang along to songs she loved while laughing with her friends and family.\n \n\n   \n  Just seven days later, the two were supposed to be celebrating Rederford’s birthday together. While Rederford was still getting dressed, she answered a phone call, thinking it was Dior ready to be picked up for the night of festivities. Instead, the voice on the other line was her aunt, telling her Dior had been shot.\n \n\n   \n  A man has been charged with first-degree intentional homicide in Dior’s death, according to a criminal complaint from the Milwaukee District Attorney’s office obtained by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “She was a shining soul,” Rederford said. “She was really loved. Everywhere she (went), she was loved.”\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Taylor Galgano \n \n\n   \n    Kelsey Elem, who was chasing her dream of modeling\n \n\n   \n  Kelsey Elem’s smile could light up a room the moment she walked in, her mother, Calvenita Brock, said. She said Kelsey moved through the world with love, the kind you could feel just being around her.\n \n\n   \n  “Kelsey would give a person any and everything,” Brock said.\n \n\n   \n  Born in Greenville, Illinois, and raised in East St. Louis, with her mother and two brothers, Elem ran track, sang in the church choir and loved animals. Later, she joined Job Corps and received her nursing certificate, her mother said.\n \n\n   \n  Elem loved fashion. She was always dressed to impress, known for her bold style and her signature long nails. Brock said the two were very close, and Elem often turned to her for styling advice.\n \n\n   \n  “She’ll come by the house like, ‘Ma, I need to go in your closet, and I’m on my way, get me something out. I need something to wear today.’”\n \n\n   \n  Brock said she spoke to Elem daily, up until the morning of her death on April 24. She was 25 years old when she was fatally shot. The suspect, whom Brock has identified as one of Elem’s friends, was arrested and charged with second-degree murder, third-degree domestic assault and armed criminal action.\n \n\n   \n  The day before her death, Elem posted on Facebook about how proud she was of her transition journey and how happy she was with life.\n \n\n   \n  “She fought to be the woman and the queen that she were,” Brock said. Elem strove to show other trans people “that they didn’t have to have shame, they didn’t have to feel unloved, because, you know, some people’s … loved ones don’t accept them, and Kelsey was there to let them know, because I accepted my child.”\n \n\n   \n  At the time of her death, she was traveling around the US as a model, building a dream she had long imagined.\n \n\n   \n  “She been traveling all around and so she kept telling me, ‘Mom, you got to come on,’” Brock said. “So she told me, ‘Well, I’m (going to) make sure I do all this for you, Ma, you wanted to do all this, and you stopped for us.’”\n \n\n   \n  She was laid to rest on May 9 in a red, pink, white and green casket adorned with photos of her and the words “goodbyes are not forever.”\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Amanda Jackson \n \n\n   \n    Sam Nordquist, who dreamed of buying a log cabin filled with animals\n \n\n   \n  A man so kind he would give you the shirt off his back.\n \n\n   \n  That’s how Linda Nordquist describes her son Sam. His kindness permeated every part of his life, from the patient demeanor he assumed at his job caring for vulnerable adults to the loving care he showed his pet cats and lizards, or the way he showered his young nieces and nephews with affection. On drives around Minneapolis, Nordquist would often buy extra food to hand out to the homeless, his sister, Kayla Nordquist, said.\n \n\n   \n  Nordquist’s confidence blossomed after he transitioned, his sister said, buoyed by a close-knit and deeply supportive family. His mother helped administer his testosterone shots and carefully emptied his surgical drains after he got top surgery. Although transgender identity was new to her, “Sam is still Sam to me, and I loved Sam no matter what,” his mother said.\n \n\n   \n  He was close with his family, often jetting off for road trips with his sister and her children or binging true crime shows together. He lived with his mother, and they built a familiar routine: sharing a cigarette before work, walking the dog together, and making plans for the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  Last September, their routine ended when Nordquist traveled to upstate New York to meet a woman he had met online. Nordquist was tortured to death in early February, according to New York State Police. Seven people have been indicted on murder charges for their involvement. He was 24. Authorities have said there is no evidence of a hate crime but said Nordquist was treated “like a dog” before his death: beaten, assaulted, sexually abused, starved, and held captive for weeks.\n \n\n   \n  “My heart is shattered,” his sister said. Kayla Nordquist said she still wakes up every day wanting to text her brother. For his mother, “life will never be the same. Life will never be normal as we used to know it.”\n \n\n   \n  Nordquist had big aspirations, his family said: He dreamed of buying a log cabin, filled with animals. His mother wishes most of all she could have seen Nordquist find “actual true love.” It stings, she said, that she’ll never see her son get married or have children.\n \n\n   \n  In Minnesota, Nordquist’s family is dedicated to keeping his memory alive as they brace for their first holiday season without him. His sister had a portrait of him tattooed on her arm, and both his sister and mother got tattoos of “8,995,” the number of days Nordquist was alive. For Christmas, his mother is decorating the tree with ornaments adorned with her son’s name.\n \n\n   \n  His mother has taken responsibility for his cat, who sometimes wakes her up scratching at the door of Nordquist’s room, which she’s left untouched since he was killed. His sister, meanwhile, took in his bearded dragon – and she’s found herself caring for the lizard just as lovingly as Nordquist did, decorating its tank for Halloween and Christmas.\n \n\n   \n  Nordquist “was the most gentle, kindest, sweetest person that you’ll probably ever meet,” his mother said. “And the world should know that they’re all missing out on him.”\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Zoe Sottile \n \n\n   \n    Laura Schueler, the ‘Beyonce of Cincinnati’ with an eye for consignment shopping\n \n\n   \n  Laura Schueler was the friend you could call for anything.\n \n\n   \n  De’Whitney Hankins said she would text Schueler for help with outfit choices because she trusted her fashion instincts. Schueler, a transgender woman, was known for wearing trendy furs, jackets, shoes and purses often purchased from consignment shops, Hankins said. Her edgy style prompted some in their circle of friends to call Schueler the “Beyonce of Cincinnati,” Hankins said.\n \n\n   \n  “She was very much outgoing,” said Hankins, a transgender woman who befriended Schueler in the 1990s when they were living in the same neighborhood.\n \n\n   \n  But the light Schueler brought to others— along with her fun, selfless and caring spirit— darkened when she was  shot and killed on June 7  in Cincinnati, Hankins said. Schueler was 47. A 19-year-old man was arrested on July 11 in connection with her death and charged with murder, felonious assault, among other charges, court records show.\n \n\n   \n  Hankins said Schueler was confident and secure with herself, which inspired many others in the transgender community. She cared deeply about her family, including her nieces and nephews, Hankins said.\n \n\n   \n  “She was not a taker,” Hankins said. “She was more of a giver. If you were hungry, she would give you money or take you to get something to eat. And she would give you the clothes off her back.”\n \n\n   \n  Hankins said she believes Schueler was targeted because she was a transgender woman and her death was a hate crime.\n \n\n   \n  “She had a lot of love to give, and we still had stuff to do,” Hankins said. “My heart is empty.”\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Nicquel Terry Ellis \n \n\n   \n    Dream Johnson, whose animated personality was made for reality TV\n \n\n   \n  When she began her transition three years ago, Iris Terrell’s daughter chose a new name for herself, one that her mother said fit her perfectly: Dream.\n \n\n   \n  “Dream wanted to be a superstar one day,” said Terrell.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson thought her big, confident personality would be perfect for a reality show and wanted to be on TV, Terrell said.\n \n\n   \n  “She had a beautiful soul and would always, always keep you laughing,” her mother said. “She was the life of the party.”\n \n\n   \n  Johnson’s aunt, Vanna Terrell, said her niece’s desire to be in the spotlight even extended to their holiday gatherings.\n \n\n   \n  “We would say we’re going to color coordinate, and Dream would go outside the box and wear something totally different,” Vanna laughs. “We would have a family function, and she would dress like Diana Ross.”\n \n\n   \n  Johnson’s mother and aunt say the family supported her transition and credit Dream’s closest friends for helping her find her own new style.\n \n\n   \n  “They were pushing her to come out of her shell – to be whoever she wanted to be,” Vanna Terrell said.\n \n\n   \n  “I know for a fact that her friends are definitely going through the hardest time now because they stayed together,” she adds.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson’s life was cut short in July at the age of 28 when she was shot four times on a sidewalk in her hometown of Washington, DC, in a residential neighborhood about two miles from the US Capitol.\n \n\n   \n  According to a court document, witnesses say Dream got into an argument with a group of strangers mocking her and calling her “a boy” and a slur used to attack the LGBTQ community.\n \n\n   \n  Although surveillance footage showed Johnson never physically attacked anyone, according to police, a member of the group allegedly pulled out a handgun and shot her to death. She was unarmed,  prosecutors say .\n \n\n   \n  The suspect is charged with first-degree murder, and the case is classified as a gender identity hate crime.\n \n\n   \n  Although the allegation that Dream was targeted for being transgender is painful to her family, they also feel it is important that the reality of the crime be recognized.\n \n\n   \n  “We were pushing for that. We wanted the hate crime (charge),” Vanna said. “We needed the world to know that this is still out here.”\n \n\n   \n  That kind of hate was something Johnson never had to worry about at home.\n \n\n   \n  “I told her she was kind. She was beautiful,” said Johnson’s mother. “Can’t no one change you from being you, and don’t let no one change you.”\n \n\n   \n  Iris Terrell keeps Johnson’s positive spirit even through the sadness surrounding her death, but said the holidays will be hard this year.\n \n\n   \n  But despite her family’s tragedy, Iris Terrell only has   happy memories of her daughter and the person she became.\n \n\n   \n  “It was one thing that I loved about her – that she was herself.”\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Andy Rose \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/world/ukraine-russia-war-crimes-bucha-hnk-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"09:48:00-05:00","title":"Ukraine Identifies Russian Commander Accused of Mass Murder in Bucha","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ukraine has formally accused Russian military commander Yurii Vladimirovich Kim, a platoon leader in Russia’s 76th Air Assault Division, of orchestrating systematic war crimes in Bucha, near Kyiv, between March 7 and April 1, 2022.

identified a Russian commander it accuses of “systematic and coordinated war crimes” in Bucha, near Kyiv, where hundreds of civilians were murdered during its brief occupation by Russian troops in 2022.\n \n\n   \n  Yurii Vladimirovich Kim, the commander of a platoon in Russia’s 76th Air Assault Division, is accused of ordering his troops to murder civilians between March 7 and April 1 2022, according to an indictment from Ukraine’s Prosecutor General.\n \n\n   \n  Bucha, where the Russian retreat revealed the bodies of children and the elderly lying in the streets, has become synonymous with the brutality of Moscow’s ongoing war in Ukraine. Hundreds of civilians were found buried in mass graves, others were tortured and executed in basements.\n \n\n   \n  Ukraine accuses Kim, who is not in custody, of criminal responsibility in 17 killings and four instances of ill-treatment by troops under his command in Bucha. Lawyers from Global Rights Compliance, assisting Ukrainian officials in evidence gathering, said the case against Kim is founded on witness testimonies, forensics, crime scene reconstructions, identity parades, maps and open source intelligence.\n \n\n   \n  Kim is also accused of ordering the bodies of victims to be burned to cover up the crimes.\n \n\n   \n  “The case highlights a methodical approach to war crimes committed by Russian forces, indicating that many atrocities in Bucha were part of a highly coordinated criminal plan that implicates Russian leadership,” Global Rights Compliance wrote in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Ukraine has previously named soldiers and  at least one commander  it says is guilty of mass murder in Bucha.\n \n\n   \n  “We have moved beyond bringing low-ranking perpetrators to account — now we are uncovering the chain of command decisions through which ordinary orders turned into mass executions of civilians,” Maksym Tsutskiridze, First Deputy Head of the National Police of Ukraine wrote in a statement issued by the lawyers.\n \n\n   \n  The Kremlin has denied its troops killed civilians in Bucha and has accused Ukraine of creating fake images of civilian bodies in the town.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has approached the Russian government for comment.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated to remove the line saying Kim was the first commander to be issued with a Notice of Suspicion.   \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/business/walmart-economy-consumers","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"07:36:00-05:00","title":"Walmart just proved it’s America’s solution to the affordability crisis","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Walmart is emerging as a key solution to America’s affordability crisis, with a 4.5% increase in U.S. sales and growing market share from both Target and discount stores like Dollar General.

However, the preponderance of scientific evidence shows this is not true, according to  a position statement  from the Autism Science Foundation.\n \n\n   \n  “The science is clear that vaccines do not cause autism.  No environmental factor has been better studied as a potential cause of autism than vaccines . This includes vaccine ingredients as well as the body’s response to vaccines,” the Autism Science Foundation said in a statement on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Other CDC bullets say studies supporting a link between vaccines and autism have been ignored by health authorities. This, too, is not true. Studies showing a connection between vaccines and autism have proven to be fraudulent or have been poorly done or biased. There are many well done, credible studies that find no such relationship.\n \n\n   \n  The page also says HHS has launched a comprehensive assessment of the causes of autism, including investigations on plausible biologic mechanisms and potential causal links.\n \n\n   \n  The main heading  on the page  states “Vaccines do not cause Autism,” but now has an asterisk that directs readers to a footnote: “The header “Vaccines do not cause autism” has not been removed due to an agreement with the chair of the U.S. Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee that it would remain on the CDC website.”\n \n\n   \n  The footnote seems to refer to a commitment by US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to Sen. Bill Cassidy, a physician and Republican from Louisiana,  during his confirmation process  that language on the CDC website “pointing out that vaccines do not cause autism” would not be removed. Cassidy described the promise in a speech in which he explained his support for Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist.\n \n\n   \n  HHS spokesman Andrew Nixon said Thursday, “We are updating the CDC’s website to reflect gold standard, evidence-based science.”\n \n\n   \n  In a post on social media late Wednesday night, Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, who recently resigned as director of the CDC’s National Center on Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, called the changes “a national embarrassment.”\n \n\n   \n  “The weaponization of the voice of CDC is getting worse. This is a public health emergency,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Daskalakis said the scientists at CDC were completely blindsided by the page update.\n \n\n   \n  “This distortion of science under the CDC moniker is the reason I resigned with my colleagues,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to CDC for comment.\n \n\n   \n  This is the latest move by the Trump administration to alter long-standing US vaccine policy and practice and cast doubt on vaccinations.\n \n\n   \n  Kennedy has hired long time anti-vax allies, including David Geier, a discredited researcher who was  once disciplined  by the Maryland State Board of Physicians for practicing medicine without a license, and Lyn Redwood, a nurse who was the president of the World Mercury Project, which later became Children’s Health Defense, an anti-vaccine group Kennedy ran before campaigning for office, to undertake new evaluations of government data in an effort to prove conspiracy theories that hazards of vaccines have long been hidden from the public.\n \n\n   \n  The rate of routine childhood vaccinations has dropped in the United States, allowing preventable diseases including measles and whooping cough to surge.

New York jury found Spacey not liable for battery over allegations he picked up actor Anthony Rapp and laid on top of him after a party in 1986. And in 2023, Spacey was cleared of a number of sexual assault charges by a court in London, United Kingdom, in a separate case.\n \n\n   \n  “The costs over these last seven years have been astronomical.

I literally have no home, that’s what I’m attempting to explain,” he said, adding that his financial situation was “not great.”\n \n\n   \n  Spacey, 66, built a hugely successful career after starting out as a stage actor in the 1980s.

\nUpdated: \n        8:22 AM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A significant flood threat is taking shape in some of the same areas of Texas Hill Country  devastated by July floods  as storms crawl across the South.\n \n\n   \n  A Level 3 of 4 risk of flooding rainfall is in place Thursday for nearly 100,000 people in Texas Hill Country. The rest of central and northern Texas could also see localized flooding Thursday, including Dallas-Fort Worth. And a second round of downpours could pile onto the state’s flood worries beginning Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  This forecast isn’t as dire as July’s deadly flooding, but more than 5 inches of rain could fall in some locations Thursday. That’s enough to trigger flooding, particularly in storms with rainfall rates that could approach a torrential 3 inches per hour.\n \n\n   \n  There have already been flood warnings Thursday morning with as much as 3 inches of rain haven already fallen.   Strong thunderstorms stalled over the headwater forks of the Guadalupe River in northwestern Kerr County, Texas, where more than 100 people died in July’s flooding, resulting in flood warnings.\n \n\n   \n  Forecasters warned   residents there that rising water from the stalling storms could push the river out of its banks and cause moderate flooding. The warning was cancelled after storms moved out of the area early Thursday morning, but the river is still expected to rise to over 9 feet, or just below flood stage.\n \n\n   \n  The higher-end flash flood threat in the Hill Country peaks from morning into early afternoon. Storms could “train,” or line up and move over the same spot one after another, like train cars on a railroad track.\n \n\n   \n  The Hill Country’s terrain makes torrential rain especially dangerous. Narrow canyons and fast-responding creeks can’t handle a few hours of training storms, let alone as much as 5 inches over a short time.\n \n\n   \n  Farther north, storms in Dallas-Fort Worth triggered flash flood warnings Thursday morning. Several roads were closed because of flooding in the north Dallas area, according to the National Weather Service.   Between 1 to 3 inches of rain had fallen, with another round expected later in the day.\n \n\n   \n  Flood watches extend along much of the Interstate 35 corridor from the Metroplex to San Antonio into early Friday morning.\n \n\n   \n  After drying out Friday and Saturday, a second soaking storm is expected to arrive in Texas as the weekend comes to an end. A Level 2 of 4 risk of flooding rainfall has been issued by the Weather Prediction Center for northern and central parts of Texas from Sunday into Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Rainfall this heavy is usually confined to the summer months, but ongoing unseasonable heat in the South is raising the bar on how much moisture these storms could wring out of the atmosphere.\n \n\n   \n  If you’re in the Hill Country and other parts of Texas, keep phones charged and alerts on and avoid driving through flooded roads.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/us/melodee-buzzard-missing-investigation","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"08:21:00-05:00","title":"Child Missing, Mother Uncooperative: What Happens Next in Melodee Buzzard Case?","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Nine-year-old Melodee Buzzard has been missing for over a month, last seen with her mother, Ashlee Buzzard, during a cross-country road trip from California to Nebraska.

What may happen next? \n       \n  By Eric Levenson, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:21 AM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Nine-year-old Melodee Buzzard has been missing for over a month after she was last seen with her mother wearing wigs on a cross-country road trip.\n \n\n   \n  The mother, Ashlee Buzzard, returned to their California home without Melodee, did not report her daughter missing and has declined to cooperate with law enforcement, according to the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office.\n \n\n   \n  The FBI has joined in the search for Melodee, and the case has drawn  widespread attention  well outside of Southern California. In all, the set of circumstances has raised serious red flags about Melodee’s well-being and about potential criminal wrongdoing for Buzzard.\n \n\n   \n  Still, investigators have not charged Buzzard with a crime related to Melodee’s disappearance.\n \n\n   \n  So, what gives?\n \n\n   \n  “It’s just not, ‘A kid’s missing. They haven’t been seen. Let’s arrest the mother,’” CNN legal analyst  Joey Jackson  said of how law enforcement operates. “What are the specific factual circumstances that would make the mother responsible?”\n \n\n   \n  “In any case, you need probable cause,” he added. “Is there reason to believe that a crime was committed and the subject of the person being arrested committed it?”\n \n\n   \n  CNN spoke to several legal experts and re-examined other high-profile missing children cases to better understand the potential path forward in Melodee’s case.\n \n\n   \n  The sheriff’s office, with assistance from the FBI, has been searching for Melodee and has publicly released some information from the “critical” time period of the road trip from October 7 to 10. Still, investigators may have more evidence that has not been released to the public, making it difficult to speculate on the case.\n \n\n   \n  “What they’re waiting for is evidence if she should be charged, and if so, with what,” Los Angeles’ Loyola Law School Professor  Laurie Levenson  said. “This one is still kind of a mystery. We know something is amiss: All of the wigs, the travel, the concerns that people are showing. I think those are legitimate that something is amiss, but we just don’t know what it is.”\n \n\n   \n    Melodee went missing last month\n \n\n   \n  The search for Melodee Buzzard began on October 14 when a school administrator reported the girl had been absent for a prolonged period of time.\n \n\n   \n  Officers searched the home, but Melodee was nowhere to be found, officials said. Her mother could not provide a “reasonable” explanation for her whereabouts and “has been uncooperative” with investigators, the sheriff’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  The investigation into Melodee’s whereabouts has focused on her and her mother’s movements during a 1,000-mile road trip from their home in Lompoc, California, to Nebraska. On October 7, Ashlee Buzzard left California with Melodee, driving a rented white 2024 Chevrolet Malibu, and returned three days later without the girl. That period is now a “critical” time frame for investigators, the sheriff’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  Surveillance footage from a rental car business in Lompoc showed the mother-daughter pair wearing wigs on October 7, the sheriff’s office said. Further, the rental car’s license plate was changed midway through the trip in what the sheriff’s office said is believed to be an attempt “to avoid detection.”\n \n\n   \n  “Investigators also believe that Ashlee swapped wigs throughout the trip, changing to a darker wig that is similar in color and style to the one Melodee was seen wearing,”  the sheriff’s office said in a November 6 statement . “This change in appearance is believed to have been intentional to avoid recognition during travel.”\n \n\n   \n  On November 7, the sheriff’s office  announced  Ashlee Buzzard was arrested on a felony false imprisonment charge related to an adult male victim. Authorities alleged she used a box cutter and “prevented a victim from leaving a location against their will.”\n \n\n   \n  The alleged victim in the case posted a statement on social media – which he later removed – saying he went to Buzzard’s house to offer help finding Melodee. He said Buzzard “became visibly distressed after sharing information she appeared to regret disclosing.”\n \n\n   \n  She pleaded not guilty and was released from custody with GPS monitoring.\n \n\n   \n  Buzzard’s attorney, Adrian Galvan, told CNN the defense was “eager to test” the accuser’s “credibility, veracity and reliability” in the false imprisonment incident. He declined to comment about the investigation into Melodee’s whereabouts.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office said Wednesday night she was “in consistent contact with investigators and they have not had any additional information that they are prepared to release.”\n \n\n   \n  Family members said they had lost touch with Melodee and Ashlee Buzzard in recent years. Melodee’s father died from a motorcycle crash when the girl was only 6 months old,  CNN affiliate KSBY  reported.\n \n\n   \n    The next steps in the investigation\n \n\n   \n  Investigators are likely to continue tracing the steps of the road trip as they search for physical evidence, digital communications and witnesses, legal experts told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “What they’re doing is what they should be doing,” CNN chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst John Miller explained. “They are taking their time. They are being meticulous. They are building the pieces of a case that may come together if and when they do have evidence to arrest her.”\n \n\n   \n  As for Buzzard, her uncooperative stance may be frustrating for investigators, but the Fifth Amendment guarantees everyone the right to silence in an interrogation.\n \n\n   \n  “There is no legal imperative at all, under any circumstance, no matter how bad things might look for you in public opinion, for you to say anything,” Jackson said.\n \n\n   \n    Other missing children cases\n \n\n   \n  In two high-profile cases involving missing children, the parents were initially charged with lesser counts as investigators continued to search for more evidence.\n \n\n   \n  Florida mother  Casey Anthony , for one, was initially charged with child neglect, providing false statements to police and obstruction in July 2008 in the disappearance of her 2-year-old daughter  Caylee Anthony . The child had last been seen a month earlier and was reported missing by her grandparents.\n \n\n   \n  Months later, in October of that year, Anthony was indicted on a first-degree murder charge. The decomposed body of her daughter was found in December 2008.\n \n\n   \n  A jury ultimately acquitted her of murder but convicted her on four counts of providing false information to police.\n \n\n   \n  Or consider the case of the Idaho mother  Lori Vallow Daybell .\n \n\n   \n  Her children, JJ and Tylee, were last seen in September 2019, and relatives raised concerns about their whereabouts two months later. In  February 2020 , Vallow Daybell was arrested in Hawaii on suspicion of two felony counts of desertion and nonsupport of dependent children.\n \n\n   \n  The children’s bodies were found in June 2020, and Vallow Daybell and her husband, Chad Daybell, were then indicted on murder charges in May 2021. Both were later  convicted  of  murder  in the children’s deaths.\n \n\n   \n  How Melodee’s case will play out remains a mystery.   In the near term, investigators’ focus will remain on finding her and her well-being.\n \n\n   \n  “There are so many open questions at this point,” Levenson said. “Right now, I think the priority is probably less the charges and more finding the kid.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/economy/us-jobs-report-september-final","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"09:09:00-05:00","title":"US Economy Adds 119,000 Jobs in September, Unemployment Rises to Near Four-Year High","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. economy added 119,000 jobs in September 2025, exceeding expectations and driven largely by growth in health care and leisure sectors, but unemployment rose to a nearly four-year high, reflecting broader economic weakness.

market.\n \n\n   \n  The economy added 119,000 jobs in September, an unexpected rebound for the labor market — but it comes as the overall economy shows signs of slowing.\n \n\n   \n  Economists were expecting 50,000 jobs to have been added and an unemployment rate that remained at 4.3%, according to FactSet.\n \n\n   \n  Delayed for seven weeks due to the government shutdown, the latest snapshot of America’s job market showed that unemployment rose in September to the highest level in nearly four years.\n \n\n   \n  In addition, August’s tepid job gains of 22,000 were revised to a job loss of 4,000 jobs and July was revised down by 7,000 jobs, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data released Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  The health care and social assistance sector continued to drive overall employment growth. Those sectors added an estimated 57,100 jobs in September, accounting for nearly half of the overall gains. Leisure and hospital contributed 47,000 jobs during a month with unseasonably warm weather.\n \n\n   \n  Jobs were lost in sectors such as transportation and warehousing (-25,300), temporary help services (-15,900) and manufacturing (-6,000).\n \n\n   \n  Although the September employment data has been on the shelf since early October,  it provides a critical snapshot  of the labor market at a time when tariffs, stubborn inflation and elevated interest rates continue to slow the US economy.\n \n\n   \n  Plus, Thursday’s report might very well be the last clean jobs report for a couple of months, since the  shutdown mucked up the finely tuned process of data collection and analysis during October  and part of November. The BLS on Wednesday announced that there will not be a separate October jobs report published but instead some of that data will be included in the November report scheduled for December 16.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the stronger-than-expected September gains – bolstered in part by warm weather that supported strong leisure and hospitality employment – this year is still on pace for the weakest employment growth since the pandemic and, before that, the Great Financial Crisis.\n \n\n   \n   This story is developing and will be updated .\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/politics/ukraine-russia-trump-peace-proposal","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"09:22:00-05:00","title":"New Trump peace proposal for Ukraine would require land concessions and military reduction, source says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A new peace proposal drafted by the Trump administration requires Ukraine to cede parts of eastern Donbas and freeze the battle lines in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, while also reducing its military size and capabilities.

reduction, source says \n       \n  By Kevin Liptak, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:22 AM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A  new peace proposal for Ukraine  drafted by the Trump administration would require the country to cede the eastern Donbas region and to limit the size of its military in exchange for security guarantees from the United States, according to a Western official familiar with the document.\n \n\n   \n  The 28-point plan, which President Donald Trump has reviewed, is the White House’s latest attempt to bring  Russia’s war in Ukraine  to an end. Some of the proposal’s provisions — including territorial concessions in areas not currently held by Russia — have previously been nonstarters with the Ukrainians. But US officials see a new window of opportunity to restart peace discussions.\n \n\n   \n  The plan is still in the framework stage, and its many points haven’t been finalized. CNN has not reviewed the proposal and has reached out to the White House for comment on it.\n \n\n   \n  Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggested late Wednesday the document was a “list of potential ideas” rather than a completed proposal.\n \n\n   \n  “Ending a complex and deadly war such as the one in Ukraine requires an extensive exchange of serious and realistic ideas,” he wrote in  a post on X.  “And achieving a durable peace will require both sides to agree to difficult but necessary concessions. That is why we are and will continue to develop a list of potential ideas for ending this war based on input from both sides of this conflict.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, the proposal in its current form is likely to draw criticism from Ukraine and its backers since it would require significant land concessions. The two regions that  form the Donbas , Luhansk and Donetsk, are still partially held by Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  In the other contested territories of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, the current battle lines would be frozen, according to the new proposal. Moscow has previously suggested Kyiv concede both of these regions in their entirety.\n \n\n   \n  Ukraine would also be required to reduce the size of its military and roll back some of its military capabilities, including certain powerful weaponry it has received over the course of the war.\n \n\n   \n  Other points in the document include the status of the Russian language, and the Russian Orthodox Church, in Ukraine when the war ends.\n \n\n   \n  The plan also includes US-backed security guarantees meant to ensure Russia cannot invade further or expand its war into Europe. The details were described by the Western official familiar with the document.\n \n\n   \n  The proposal echoes a  peace proposal from talks  in Istanbul in the early weeks of the war in 2022, repeating some of Moscow’s wider geopolitical demands about Ukraine’s armed forces and allegiances.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Groundhog Day’\n \n\n   \n  A European diplomat echoed the Western official’s description of some of the details of the proposal. The person told CNN that the new effort, which repeats many of Moscow’s maximalist demands dating back to 2022, reminded them of “Groundhog Day,” a film in which events repeat themselves over and over.\n \n\n   \n  A European envoy based in Ukraine said the plan had caught the diplomatic community completely by surprise.\n \n\n   \n  “This has all been gone through before and rejected, and now we’re back to square one,” the diplomat said. “For the Ukrainians, it is just a non-starter and with good reason. It would just be inviting the Russians to come back again at a future date. It would be political suicide for any Ukrainian leader (to accept it), and it would be military suicide to hand over that fortified area.”\n \n\n   \n  The diplomat also described foreign ministries in Europe and elsewhere calling contacts in Washington for guidance on the plan only to be told they were equally in the dark.\n \n\n   \n  “We have heard directly from people in the State Department and on Capitol Hill that nobody knew anything about this plan until it was leaked yesterday,” the diplomat said.\n \n\n   \n  “People who should have known about it, knew nothing about it … There’s a lot of annoyance and confusion.”\n \n\n   \n  In her first public comments since reports of the plan emerged, the European Union’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, told reporters Thursday that “for any plan to work, it needs Ukrainians and Europeans on board.” Poland’s foreign minister Radosław Sikorski, meanwhile, told CNN that any plans should involve Europe and leave Kyiv with the capacity to defend itself.\n \n\n   \n  “We have a much bigger stake in this than the US, and therefore Ukraine, but also Europe, has to be involved,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s special envoy,  Steve Witkoff , has been leading the effort, CNN reported on Wednesday, with a source saying the negotiations accelerated this week as the administration feels the Kremlin has signaled a renewed openness to a deal.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, a Pentagon delegation led by Army Secretary Dan Driscoll was in Kyiv this week for discussions with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and other top officials, including about the new plan.\n \n\n   \n  US officials viewed the trip as a way to restart peace talks after they stalled over the last several months.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Andrew Carey, Nick Paton Walsh, Brian Abel, and Catherine Nicholls contributed to this report. \n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/middleeast/jets-chips-clean-slate-mbs-trump-saudi-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"09:45:00-04:00","title":"Jets, chips and a clean slate: Saudi Arabia’s crown prince got almost everything he wanted from Trump","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article details how Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman secured a major diplomatic turnaround with the United States under President Donald Trump, reversing prior Biden-era hostility and achieving significant defense, trade, and economic agreements.

President Joe Biden had vowed to make Mohammed bin Salman a pariah. Even arms sales to one of America’s closest military partners were put under review.\n \n\n   \n  This week, the crown prince and de facto Saudi leader walked into the Oval Office to find a different world - one where President Donald Trump defended him so forcefully that he scolded a reporter for “ embarrassing our guest ” when she pressed him on the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi.\n \n\n   \n  Beyond the Oval Office theatrics, the substance of the administration’s announcements tells the real story of bin Salman’s remarkable rehabilitation in Washington. It also highlights Trump’s willingness to move past the Khashoggi episode and deepen relations with a kingdom that has pledged  nearly a trillion dollars  in US investments and maintains business ties with his own family.\n \n\n   \n  The visit also underscores the crown prince’s growing clout and his ability to skillfully navigate great power rivalries to his advantage.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps his biggest win was persuading Trump to drop the one condition Washington had long insisted on before sealing major defense and trade deals with Riyadh: Full normalization with Israel.\n \n\n   \n  The shift marks another reversal from just a year ago, when the Biden administration insisted that any comprehensive US-Saudi deal could only move forward if  all three of its components  – bilateral defense and trade agreements, Saudi normalization with Israel, and an Israeli commitment to a pathway to a Palestinian state – advanced together. But with Israel rejecting the prospect of a Palestinian state and Saudi Arabia refusing to soften its position, the framework stalled.\n \n\n   \n  Now, the Trump administration appears to have decoupled those components, handing Riyadh most of what it has long sought on defense, economics and regional security.\n \n\n   \n  This week it designated Saudi Arabia a Major Non-NATO Ally, moved forward with plans to  sell it F-35 jets  “pretty similar” to those flown by Israel, and signed a new Strategic Defense Agreement.\n \n\n   \n  In a nod to Riyadh’s singular focus to rewire its economy away from oil dependence, the two countries launched an  AI cooperation framework  which includes clearing of the sale of advanced chips to the kingdom, signed a critical minerals agreement, and opened the door to expand cooperation on nuclear energy.\n \n\n   \n  Trump also delivered on bin Salman’s regional requests as the crown prince tries to reshape the Middle East’s security landscape, agreeing to help end the civil war in Sudan\n \n\n   \n  In the Oval Office, bin Salman framed the new agreements as delivering benefits for both the US and Saudi Arabia.\n \n\n   \n  “Today is a very important time in our history,” bin Salman said in the Oval Office on Tuesday, seated beside Trump.\n \n\n   \n    What Saudi Arabia didn’t get\n \n\n   \n  While bin Salman received almost everything Saudi Arabia has been seeking from the US, there were two notable exceptions: a green light to domestically enrich uranium for future nuclear plants and a formal defense commitment.\n \n\n   \n  The US has long been reluctant to back a Saudi nuclear program that includes domestic uranium enrichment – a process that can produce bomb-grade material if purified to high levels – but CNN understands that Riyadh is reluctant to give up its right to do so, citing its substantial uranium deposits. US Energy Secretary Chris Wright told Fox News on Wednesday that the agreement doesn’t include domestic enrichment.\n \n\n   \n  Among Washington’s Arab allies, Qatar has the strongest defense relationship with the US. It hosts the biggest US airbase in the region, was declared a Major Non-NATO ally in 2022, and this year received the strongest US security commitment for any Arab state, through an executive order declaring that any armed attack on the nation would be regarded as “a  threat to the peace and security  of the United States.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN understands that Saudi Arabia is seeking at least as deep a security commitment from Washington. A senior Saudi source told CNN the kingdom wants a permanent agreement that would last beyond Trump’s presidency, a move that would ultimately require Congressional approval. But a White House statement made no mention of any obligation to defend the kingdom.\n \n\n   \n  “What (bin Salman) reportedly wants is a Senate-ratified defense commitment along the lines of a NATO Article 5 pledge,” wrote Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment think tank, referring to NATO’s mutual defense clause. “The last time Washington delivered that was 65 years ago, with the 1960 US-Japan treaty.”\n \n\n   \n  There is a case to be made for such a pact, he continued. “The United States went to war to protect Saudi and Gulf oil before, a defense pact might prove to be a deterrent to future predators, and it would lock Saudi Arabia into a pro-American alignment for years to come, boxing out our competitors Russia and especially China.”\n \n\n   \n  Over the past few years, Saudi Arabia has been signaling that it is willing to seek defense partners beyond the US should Washington not make a stronger commitment to its security. In late 2023, bin Salman was  explicit about the threat  in an interview with Fox News, saying the US doesn’t “want to see Saudi Arabia shifting their armament from America to another place.”\n \n\n   \n  In recent years, Riyadh has been gradually  improving its ties with Beijing , culminating in the surprise rapprochement  between Saudi Arabia and Iran  in the Chinese capital in March 2023. The message has been that the US is Riyadh’s  first port of call , but there are others too.\n \n\n   \n  And earlier this year, bin Salman followed through on his quest to diversify security partners, securing protection from Riyadh’s closest Muslim ally, nuclear armed Pakistan. The mutual defense agreement marked a striking expansion of the kingdom’s search for non-US security guarantees.\n \n\n   \n  That hedging has not gone unnoticed in the halls of power in Washington.\n \n\n   \n  “I think that’s a positive move,” Rep. Michael McCaul, a top Republican foreign policy voice, said about the growing defense partnership between Riyadh and Washington. “Because to pull Saudi as an ally of the United States in this direction, rather than to China, and it will also solidify normalization in that process, in a post Gaza world.”\n \n\n   \n  The Eurasia Group think tank said in an analysis piece last week that the US-Saudi relationship is now driven more by great power competition than normalization with Israel.\n \n\n   \n  “The kingdom has become a key strategic partner in the US’s competition with China,” it said. “The strategic convergence underway between Washington and Riyadh will continue to be underpinned by the role the kingdom can play in supporting the US in sectors that are crucial for US competition with China.”\n \n\n   \n  It added that Riyadh’s calculation on normalization has shifted as Saudi public sentiment toward Israel has grown more negative and the kingdom has already secured many of the gains it expected from Washington.\n \n\n   \n  In the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump said he got a “positive response” from bin Salman on normalizing with Israel but said he wouldn’t “use the word ‘commitment’.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Alison Main, Manu Raju and Casey Riddle contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/politics/epstein-files-ro-khanna","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"08:51:00.000-05:00","title":"Ro Khanna explains how he helped engineer the vote that 'ripped MAGA apart'","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ro Khanna, a California Democrat representing Silicon Valley, played a pivotal role in engineering a bipartisan House vote on November 20, 2025, to release the Jeffrey Epstein files, which passed 427-1 and marked a significant political defeat for President Donald Trump’s second term and MAGA ideology.

MAGA apart’ \n       \n  By Edward-Isaac Dovere, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:51 AM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The House vote  to release the Jeffrey Epstein files  was, in the end, 427-1. That’s a margin typically reserved for proclamations and post office namings, not for what was  perhaps the biggest defeat  of President Donald Trump’s second term, a fight that GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene declared on Tuesday had “ripped MAGA apart.”\n \n\n   \n  A group of Epstein’s survivors, sitting together in one section of the House gallery, applauded. Democrats applauded. Some Republicans applauded. No one seemed to say much to Rep. Ro Khanna as he stood in the center of the floor, toward the front, chitchatting with colleagues. When Illinois Rep. Joshua Jackson patted Khanna on the back a moment later, it wasn’t clear if he was acknowledging Khanna’s work or just trying to squeeze by to get to someone on the other side.\n \n\n   \n  That morning, Khanna had noticed that Greene and Rep. Thomas Massie, his Republican co-sponsor on  the discharge petition leading to Tuesday’s vote , were trending on X and he wasn’t. He is trying to be fine with that, as playing down the Democratic role to woo Republican support was always part of the plan. He offered a “Schoolhouse Rock”-like optimism about legislating, saying, “It feels like you can make a difference in Congress.”\n \n\n   \n  But Khanna doesn’t hide his belief that Tuesday’s triumph proves he should be taken seriously as a party leader and maybe even for the long-shot 2028 presidential run he is always happy to talk about. He argues the vote vindicates the value of his long relationships with Republicans – he and Massie connected years ago working on  legislation to halt US military support to Saudi Arabia  for its war in Yemen – and his willingness to talk to almost any party.\n \n\n   \n  “I make no secret about wanting to be part of shaping the national future of the Democratic Party of this country. I make no secret about the fact that I believe I have the best economic vision for this nation,” he said in an interview with CNN before the vote, ticking through his emphasis on forgotten communities abandoned by billionaires he says have rigged the system.\n \n\n   \n  “The knock on me from some — I mean, there are many knocks on me — but one of the knocks on me has always been: ‘Okay, Ro, you can write books on this, you can write op-eds on this, but can you really, brass tacks, get things done?’ And it’s easier if you’re a mayor or a governor or a Cabinet member to show you can get things done. And what this is showing is, you know what? On one of the biggest things, which is getting MAGA on board, it’s not just ideas. I’m able to get things done.”\n \n\n   \n  Others are willing to give him credit too.\n \n\n   \n  “It took him on his side and me on my side, and our working relationship before this, to be able to do this,” Massie said after finishing thanking the survivors at their press conference outside the Capitol on Tuesday morning. “Our chance of success was about 4 percent at the beginning, and we’re going to succeed. So I am a little bit surprised. I’m used to fighting battles and not winning.”\n \n\n   \n  “I think Ro Khanna is a brilliant human being. I think he stands for justice. He’s on the right side of history,” said Haley Robson, an Epstein survivor helping organize the trembling “sister survivors” who tend to arrive holding up pictures of themselves when they first met Epstein, speaking to CNN after the vote. “If it wasn’t for Massie, Marjorie Taylor Greene and Ro Khanna, I don’t think any of this would have been possible. They are just incredible people who genuinely care.”\n \n\n   \n    How he strategized\n \n\n   \n  Khanna, a 49-year-old who represents Silicon Valley, has gotten used to often getting a better reception as the token Democrat on right-wing media than he does from some of his colleagues. This time, he’d like a little more credit for being ahead of the curve.\n \n\n   \n  “In the beginning,” he told CNN, “I’m not going to say who, but some of the folks in our own party were like, eyerolls, ‘There goes Ro on one of his issues…’ ‘Why aren’t we talking about the price of eggs?’ ‘Why aren’t we talking about the price of health care?’ ‘What’s up with this?’ And I said, ‘No, there is something legitimate here.’”\n \n\n   \n  That included building a relationship with Greene, whom he said he barely knew before – but had never blasted on Twitter like so many of his colleagues – and now texts with. Or carefully maneuvering how to get Colorado Rep. Lauren Boebert in September to sign the discharge petition that forced the vote. Massie relayed that she’d do it if she didn’t have to wait in line, so Khanna pulled the paper away from a Democratic colleague on the House floor and let her walk over and do it.\n \n\n   \n  To report about Khanna is to inspire exasperation from political journalists and operatives who’ve rued for years how many stories the congressman always manages to put himself into as the hinge point.\n \n\n   \n  But it’s also to hear from a person who speaks to Barack Obama often that the former president keeps an eye on Khanna as an administration alumnus (Khanna was a deputy assistant commerce secretary in the first term, before launching a primary against an incumbent whom Obama endorsed). Without overstating it, the person said, Obama “appreciates that Ro is willing to show up across all varieties of platforms.”\n \n\n   \n  That gives Khanna a phone full of contacts to promote himself and his ideas, from MAGA podcaster Steve Bannon to forever never-Trumper Bill Kristol to  Larry Summers, the former treasury secretary and Harvard president whom Khanna is now disgusted to think he was on the phone with arguing about economic policy just weeks ago. The batch of Epstein estate emails  released last week revealed Summers had been asking Epstein for advice  on how to sleep with a mentee of his until just before Epstein’s final arrest.\n \n\n   \n  “If there was no media attention to this,” Khanna said, “this thing would never have gotten a vote. So the idea of politicians being ambitious to raise issues they care about to the American public is a good thing, if the ambition is for a good public purpose. This idea that we should not be savvy about getting our message out in the media is setting us up for being ineffective.”\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, who voted for and touted the win, didn’t respond when asked what the Democratic leader made of Khanna’s pushing the bill through.\n \n\n   \n  Rep. Don Bacon, the retiring Nebraska Republican who’s become friendly with Khanna through their subcommittee work, argued Republicans always wanted to release the files, despite Speaker Mike Johnson in a floor speech on Tuesday calling the vote a distraction from “urgent legislative work.”\n \n\n   \n  “It could have been anybody” leading the charge, Bacon said. Then he reconsidered.\n \n\n   \n  “He was smart enough to get on it,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    Anger and regrets\n \n\n   \n  At first, Khanna says, he took up the Epstein files cause because it was another way of sticking it to the elite class, the ones he travels the country talking about under his “economic patriotism” umbrella for shipping out their jobs and selling out their communities. But he was changed by what he calls the “emotionally horrific” meetings with survivors who started to come through his office — the guilt of having recruited friends, the trauma of being coerced, the women breaking down about how they’ve blocked memories of their own rapes and wanting the records of what happened so they can at least reclaim their own experiences.\n \n\n   \n  He should have listened sooner, he said Tuesday. He shouldn’t have let it slide when he says he brought up releasing the Epstein files with former Rep. Elijah Cummings, the Democrat and House Oversight chair who died in 2019. He shouldn’t have waited until Trump’s backing off his promise to release them got him going in the spring.\n \n\n   \n  “Had I met the survivors in 2019 or 2020,” Khanna told CNN. “I would have been more vocal in the Biden administration. I think it is a fair point that all of us should have been more vocal earlier.”\n \n\n   \n  Khanna’s father taught him to be stoic, he said, so tears don’t tend to flow, but the anger does. This was insidious, he felt, “a rottenness in our civilization that allowed this to happen — like, how are we allowing these people to get away with this stuff?” he said.\n \n\n   \n  This wasn’t about billionaires rigging the system, Khanna started to say. Men so rich and powerful and interconnected that they had means and the gall for a “rape island” and then to try to intimidate away any consequences represented something more: This, he argues, was about “the Epstein class.”\n \n\n   \n    A ‘proof of concept’\n \n\n   \n  Khanna doesn’t know if he’ll be invited to the bill signing Trump is now promising. He hasn’t talked to the president since January 6, 2021, not that their relationship was ever much more than hellos at first-term bill signings and one chat in the Oval Office about a new term-limits law. He thinks Trump won’t be able to wiggle out of his promise, or of complying, and believes there are too many survivors’ lawyers and former Justice officials who’ve seen the files to know if they get selectively scrubbed.\n \n\n   \n  Khanna is already talking to Greene about joining together to try to ban private equity firms from buying up single-family homes. He wonders if he can get a few Republicans to extend Medicare to people starting at 55, even though he still favors Sen. Bernie Sanders’ Medicare for All. Cutting defense budgets seems to have some crossover appeal. Maybe they can come up with a billionaire’s tax that they’ll say is all about taking on the Epstein class.\n \n\n   \n  “My point is, if your goal is just, ‘How do Democrats win,’ maybe anti-Trump is enough for a moment. If your goal is, ‘How do we build an enduring majority, which is what progressive Democrats like me want to do?’ This is absolutely essential,” Khanna said. “This is a proof of concept that we need to actually figure out how we bring disaffected MAGA voters into our coalition, that we need to focus much more on railing against a system that has screwed Americans and offering a hopeful message about how we help them, more than just meme-ing against Donald Trump.”\n \n\n   \n   CORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct Khanna’s age. He is 49, not 47.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/science/universe-expansion-slow-down-dark-energy","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"09:00:00-05:00","title":"Is the universe’s expansion slowing down?

Astronomers cast doubt on Nobel-winning theory \n       \n  By Jacopo Prisco, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:00 AM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The universe’s expansion might not be accelerating but slowing down, a new study suggests.\n \n\n   \n   If confirmed, the finding would upend decades of established astronomical assumptions and rewrite our understanding of dark energy, the elusive force that counters the inward pull of gravity in our universe.\n \n\n   \n  Two separate teams of astronomers, while observing bright, exploding stars called Type 1a supernovas, put forth the idea in 1998   that dark energy might enable the universe to expand at an accelerating rate.\n \n\n   \n  The scientists had   noted that some of the most distant supernovas were dimmer than expected and concluded that they had moved away from Earth faster than anticipated. The discovery won them a  Nobel Prize in physics in 2011 .\n \n\n   \n  However, the nature of dark energy has remained a mystery, and its role in the universe’s expansion has been called into question  before .\n \n\n   \n  Last year, a consortium of hundreds of researchers using data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI)   in Arizona, developed the  largest ever 3D map  of the universe. The observations hinted at the fact that dark energy may be weakening over time, indicating that the universe’s rate of expansion could eventually slow.\n \n\n   \n  Now, a study  published  November 6   in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society provides further evidence that dark energy might not be pushing on the universe with the same strength it used to.\n \n\n   \n  The DESI project’s findings last year represented “a major, major paradigm change … and our result, in some sense, agrees well with that,” said Young-Wook Lee, a professor of astrophysics at Yonsei University in South Korea and lead researcher for the new study.\n \n\n   \n  Lee and his colleagues’ work builds on the evolving understanding of dark energy, suggesting that the universe’s expansion has already started to slow down — something that could alter the fate of the universe itself. “Dark energy is there, but the present universe has already entered a decelerating phase, today,” Lee said. “So the fate of the universe could change. And if you can change the fate of the universe, that is really important progress in cosmology.”\n \n\n   \n    Aging supernovas\n \n\n   \n  To reach their conclusions, the researchers analyzed a sample of 300 galaxies containing Type 1a supernovas and posited that the dimming of distant exploding stars was not only due to their moving farther away from Earth, but also due to the progenitor star’s age.\n \n\n   \n  “Before our work, Type Ia supernovae were thought to explode with nearly identical intrinsic brightness, making them highly reliable ‘standard candles,’” said study coauthor Junhyuk Son, a doctoral candidate of astronomy   at Yonsei University. “However, we found that their luminosity actually depends on the age of the stars that produce them — younger progenitors yield slightly dimmer supernovae, while older ones are brighter.”\n \n\n   \n  Son said the team has a high statistical confidence — 99.99% — about this age-brightness relation,  allowing them to use Type 1a supernovas more accurately than before to assess the universe’s expansion.\n \n\n   \n  “If confirmed, this would represent the most significant shift in cosmology since the discovery of dark energy in 1998,” Son said. “It would suggest that the (expansion of the) universe is no longer accelerating today and that dark energy is not a constant force but something that evolves over time. This discovery would open an entirely new chapter in our understanding of the physical nature of dark energy, how it has changed throughout cosmic history, and what it ultimately means for the fate of the universe.”\n \n\n   \n  Eventually, if the expansion continues to slow down, the universe could begin to contract, ending in what astronomers imagine may be the opposite of the big bang — the  big crunch . “That is certainly a possibility,” Lee said. “Even two years ago, the Big Crunch was out of the question. But we need more work to see whether it could actually happen.”\n \n\n   \n    Extraordinary claims\n \n\n   \n  The new research proposes a radical revision of accepted knowledge, so, understandably, it is being met with skepticism.\n \n\n   \n  ”This study rests on a flawed premise,” Adam Riess, a professor of physics and astronomy at the Johns Hopkins University and one of the recipients of the 2011 Nobel Prize in physics, said in an email. “It suggests supernovae have aged with the Universe, yet observations show the opposite — today’s supernovae occur where young stars form. The same idea was proposed years ago and refuted then, and there appears to be nothing new in this version.”\n \n\n   \n  Lee, however, said Riess’ claim is incorrect. “Even in the present-day Universe, Type Ia supernovae are found just as frequently in old, quiescent elliptical galaxies as in young, star-forming ones — which clearly shows that this comment is mistaken. The so-called paper that ‘refuted’ our earlier result relied on deeply flawed data with enormous uncertainties,” he said, adding that the age-brightness correlation has been independently confirmed by two separate teams in the United States and China.\n \n\n   \n  Other experts in the field who were not involved with the study echoed some of Riess’ concerns. Dan Scolnic, an associate professor of physics at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, noted that the study makes a leap from host galaxy age to supernova age that isn’t physically justified. “The authors are proposing ideas that the community has already tested and corrected for with much larger data sets. The universe is still accelerating just fine,” Scolnic said.\n \n\n   \n  Dillon Brout, an assistant professor in the departments of astronomy and physics of Boston University, pointed out via email that the paper raises a fair question about how the ages of supernova progenitors change over cosmic time, adding that it is always important to challenge our way of thinking in order to a better understand of the universe. “However, the way they model that evolution is not supported by observations nor by our understanding of how these systems form. Modern supernova analyses already account for the connection between brightness and the environments where these stars originate, which captures most of the effect they discuss,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  “Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence,” Dragan Huterer, a professor of physics at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, said in an email, noting that he does not feel the new research “rises to the threshold to overturn the currently favored model.”\n \n\n   \n  Lee is aware that the work might be controversial. “We have a long way to go to convince everyone in the supernova cosmology community,” he said. “There are still many people who are strongly against (our results), so a lot of debate and discussions should happen in the near future.”\n \n\n   \n  However, he added, more clarity on the issue might be around the corner. The new  Vera C. Rubin Observatory , which started operating this year, is set to help settle the debate with the early 2026 launch of the Legacy Survey of Space and Time, an ultrawide and ultra-high-definition time-lapse record of the universe made by scanning the entire sky every few nights over 10 years to capture a compilation of asteroids and comets, exploding stars, and distant galaxies as they change.\n \n\n   \n  “Vera Rubin will discover more than 20,000 new supernova host galaxies with very high-precision age measurement,” Lee said. “It will take three or five years, and it will allow a more direct cosmological test without worrying about this age bias effect.”\n \n\n   \n  “Dark energy is getting weirder and weirder,” Lee concluded. “But there is no good theory that can explain this very weird behavior. So I think we are missing something. Maybe, in five years, an even more surprising result can come up.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/us/golden-state-killer-case-update-cec","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"10:39:00-05:00","title":"A prosecutor reveals new details about the capture of one of America’s most notorious serial killers","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article details the arrest, prosecution, and psychological profile of Joseph DeAngelo, known as the Golden State Killer, who committed at least 13 murders and dozens of rapes across California from the 1970s to the 1980s.

notorious serial killers \n       \n  By Faith Karimi, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:39 AM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Joseph DeAngelo   moved through California neighborhoods like a shadow.\n \n\n   \n  He stalked his victims for days, learning their routines before slipping into their homes in a mask to torture, rape and kill. At first, he preyed on women who lived alone but later expanded his attacks to include couples. He pocketed wedding rings, photos and other grim tokens from crime scenes.\n \n\n   \n  What started as burglaries and break-ins escalated into brutal attacks and murders that left entire neighborhoods too terrified to sleep. Each wave of terror in a different part of California came with a new nickname: The Visalia Ransacker. The Original Night Stalker. The East Area Rapist. And finally, the  Golden State Killer .\n \n\n   \n  DeAngelo killed at least 13 people and raped dozens more in the 1970s and 1980s. In April 2018, nearly four decades after his last known crimes, police armed with DNA evidence surrounded his house in the quiet Sacramento suburb of Citrus Heights and arrested him.\n \n\n   \n  Dressed in a T-shirt, cargo shorts and tube socks, a shocked DeAngelo offered no resistance when detectives moved in after he stepped into his yard. In a jarring contrast to the cruelty he once inflicted, the predator who’d terrorized residents in 11 counties did not fight back. But he protested in a high-pitched voice, ‘I have a roast in the oven!’”\n \n\n   \n  Once inside the cold and bare interrogation room of the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Department, he slumped into a plastic chair. Alone, he quietly stared at the fluorescent-lit walls for nearly two hours, drawing in large gulps of air.\n \n\n   \n  “He reminded me of a sloppy grandpa or an alcoholic uncle whom you avoided at Thanksgiving dinner. He did not seem … particularly menacing,” writes Thien Ho, the lead prosecutor in the case, in his new book, “ The People vs. the Golden State Killer. ” “The monsters of our imagination can look and feel very different in the bright light of reality.”\n \n\n   \n  Detectives offered DeAngelo a can of Dr Pepper – the same drink he’d left behind at several crime scenes. He didn’t touch it nor acknowledge it. Investigators believe he feared he’d leave his DNA on it – unaware that they’d already obtained it from his trash can, said Ho, now the District Attorney of Sacramento County.\n \n\n   \n  DeAngelo was convicted of multiple murders in August 2020 and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.\n \n\n   \n  Ho’s book, released this month, offers a rare look inside the investigation that brought down one of California’s most notorious killers.\n \n\n   \n  CNN talked to Ho about the new revelations in his book. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n \n\n   \n    Why do you think DeAngelo shut down in the hours after his arrest?\n \n\n   \n  He was being calculating and manipulative. When he was sitting inside that room for those two hours, I was watching the video of it, and I thought a couple times that the video kind of just froze because he’s sitting there, not moving at all. And after he was confronted with the murders and rapes, he started mumbling to himself, talking to himself, saying, “I didn’t want to do it. Jerry made me do it.”  He was trying to present this mental defense of a split personality … where he was blaming Jerry for taking over and kind of forcing him to do these things.\n \n\n   \n  He didn’t realize that his mental defense didn’t work, because this isn’t the first time he tried it. In 1979, when he was arrested for shoplifting dog repellent and a hammer, he was caught by store security, and he was acting like he was crazy, mumbling to himself, saying crazy things. And when the police came, he admitted he was pretending to be crazy, hoping that security wouldn’t call them. He has used this technique of pretending to be crazy, so we knew it was fake.\n \n\n   \n    At the beginning of his crime spree, he was a police officer, even working on task forces hunting him. Did that help him evade capture?\n \n\n   \n  It did. The first series of crimes, he was the Visalia Ransacker from 1974 to 1975. There were 120 burglaries in a three-mile square radius. It turned out he was a police officer in a nearby town, and he was on the task force to find the Visalia Ransacker, and he was the ransacker. He left Visalia in central California and moved up to Sacramento, where he started committing rapes there. As a police officer, he knew how everything operated, how long it took to respond to the scene, where they would set up their blockades and how to get around that. He used his expert knowledge as a police officer to commit his crimes, find his victims and then escape.\n \n\n   \n    What drove his escalation from voyeurism and burglary to rape and murder?\n \n\n   \n  It was that insatiable appetite for power.\n \n\n   \n  When we caught him, I tried to recreate every aspect of his life, from when he was born in Bath, New York, all the way to his arrest. We found out that in his personal life, he felt … like he didn’t have control or power. For example, when he was a young boy, he witnessed his little sister, who was 8 or 9 at the time, get raped by two military service members, and he was held down and had to watch that. His parents constantly beat him.\n \n\n   \n  And … many of the victims talked about how small his penis was. So when we arrested him, … we did a search warrant to take pictures of his penis, and it was micropenis. He felt very small and powerless all his life.\n \n\n   \n  And when he became a police officer, it was his way of exerting control and power over other people. When he went in and raped and tied up people, he was drinking their beer, eating their food in their home, violating their marriage. He would take one earring and leave the other behind. He would take the wedding band. And when he would bludgeon them to death … he was playing God over their lives. He had power and control over their lives, because he didn’t have any in his life.\n \n\n   \n    Some of the survivors made their voices heard in court. How did you track them down decades later and prepare them to testify?\n \n\n   \n  After he was caught, we (victim advocates, law enforcement and prosecutors) started reaching out to people and telling them what’s going on. Some people reached out to us when they saw it on the news. We found people across the country … we went to the Midwest and different parts of the country to interview people.\n \n\n   \n  We tried to make everything victim-centered – we connected the survivors with counseling services, sat down with them and went over their testimony and prior statements, talked to them about what court’s like and gave them a tour of the courtroom before trial. We prepared them as best as we could to go through that process.\n \n\n   \n    Your book focuses more on the survivors and law enforcement officials than on the killer himself. What was the reasoning behind that approach?\n \n\n   \n  A lot of times, true crime books focus on the criminal and the crimes. But here, I wanted to focus on the law enforcement officers that never gave up the search for him, and on the victims.  There’s an amazing moment in the case that I’ll never forget and sort of led me to that … in a criminal case, the victims get to read their impact statement. And one of them was Jane Carson, who retired from the military as a colonel. She wrote her own book on being raped by him.\n \n\n   \n  During the impact statement, she says, ‘I’ve brought somebody here with me today that was also a victim, and her name is Bonnie.’ And Bonnie comes up. And Bonnie was actually engaged to DeAngelo about 40 years ago but had broken up with him.\n \n\n   \n  And the Golden State Killer is all about control, and so here was Bonnie, who he couldn’t control because she dumped him. And Bonnie stood there, and they both stared at him. I was six feet away from him. And this guy’s all about control and maintaining control. He’s sitting there, just looking straight ahead, not reacting to anything, trying to maintain control. But when Bonnie was brought into the courtroom, I looked at him, and his breathing had stopped.\n \n\n   \n  Carson also told him, ‘Oh, by the way, DeAngelo, do you remember the roast you had cooking in the oven the day you were arrested? … The only roast you’ll experience is when you roast in hell, because that’s where you’re going.’\n \n\n   \n  It was the victim and Bonnie seizing control back … you could see there was a reaction. It was a very empowering moment in the courtroom.\n \n\n   \n    His crimes were horrifying. Is there a particular survivor whose story has stayed with you?\n \n\n   \n  When I think about the case now, I don’t think about him or the crimes. I think about the survivors. One of them, Phyllis Hennemann, was the very first rape victim in Sacramento. She was diagnosed with cancer, and when it was time for court she couldn’t be there because she was having chemo. But when DeAngelo was sentenced, I looked across the courtroom, and there’s Phyllis sitting there. And she had this twinkle on her eye. For the first time in 40 years, she got justice. About three months later, she died from cancer. I think about her a lot … that we were able to get her that justice.\n \n\n   \n    After four decades, was there a moment in the investigation that marked a turning point?\n \n\n   \n  DNA technology shifted the direction of this case. We took some of the DNA, some of the semen from the Ventura rape and converted into a DNA profile that you use in the genealogy database, and then we uploaded it. We found out he had a distant relative, and so we then took that relative and built a family tree. You know, who was that person’s brothers and sisters, their parents, their uncles and aunties, their grandparents, their great-grandparents. We built this massive family tree with a thousand-plus names on it.\n \n\n   \n  And from that family tree, we investigated and looked at everybody. How many were male? How many of them were white? How many of them were police officers or military? How many lived at these crime scenes? And we were able to narrow it down to three people. And lo and behold, he was one of them. We collected his trash and found a piece of tissue that we tested for DNA that matched the killer from all these other locations.\n \n\n   \n    Having seen the evidence up close, which details have stayed with you?\n \n\n   \n  The brutality of the murder scenes in Southern California … For many of those murders, he bludgeoned the victims to death with a blunt instrument. A gunshot would draw the neighbors’ attention … (so) killing them with a log, a lamp base or a brass sprinkler head allowed him time to take in the crime scene at his leisure before leaving.\n \n\n   \n    Do you believe there are more victims out there?\n \n\n   \n  I do. His last known crime was the 1986 murder of Janelle Cruz in Orange County. People ask me, ‘Why did he stop in 1986’? And my answer is, ‘How do you know he stopped in 1986?’\n \n\n   \n  There’s a three-year period from 1986 to 1989, when he was living in LA, that we’re not sure exactly where he was and what he was doing. And he was already beginning to evolve as a killer. So what’s to say he didn’t continue to kill his victims, but he discarded the bodies somewhere that we never found?\n \n\n   \n    You describe justice in this case as not just a legal victory but a personal, full-circle moment for you. Why?\n \n\n   \n  I escaped Vietnam on a fishing boat and lived in a refugee camp. When I came to the US, I learned how to speak English by watching Bugs Bunny cartoons. Twenty years later, I graduated from law school, and I became a lawyer.\n \n\n   \n  I come from a country that doesn’t have the rule of law … it’s governed, essentially, by a dictatorship. And to come to this country, and give back to victims rights, be part of a system of justice that works, it meant everything in the world.\n \n\n   \n    What’s DeAngelo’s life like in prison today?\n \n\n   \n  He was sentenced to multiple life sentences without the possibility of parole and is in a prison in the Central Valley in California. He’s in a protective unit – this is where you put the child molesters, the rapists, the snitches, people who drop out of gangs because other prisoners want to hurt them. He’s not in the general population. And in that unit, he is constantly looking over his shoulder, worried that somebody’s going to attack him.\n \n\n   \n  So he’s in his own version of hell, where he belongs.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/sport/soccer-ncaa-washington-huskies-mia-hamant","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-05:00","title":"Washington Huskies Win Championship Three Days After Loss of Goalkeeper Mia Hamant to Cancer","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The University of Washington women's soccer team, devastated by the sudden death of their beloved teammate and friend Mia Hamant from stage 4 kidney cancer, found strength in grief.

That ecstasy will often be peppered with relief because things rarely go perfectly in a shootout. But for the other side, there is only dejection and heartbreak; it’s cruel to come so close to winning and lose.\n \n\n   \n  On November 9 in the Big Ten tournament championship game, it would have been hard to guess the result just from looking at the University of Washington’s  women’s soccer  players. They hugged each other tight, and some were weeping on their knees as they processed both a win and a loss: Just three days before the final, beloved goalkeeper Mia Hamant had died.\n \n\n   \n  Hamant had been diagnosed with an extremely rare and aggressive form of stage 4 kidney cancer in April, upending her soccer dream for her senior season.

She was also ready to contribute on FaceTime when they were on the road.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s hard to perfectly describe her because Mia was Mia,” the Huskies head coach Nicole Van Dyke told  CNN Sports , adding: “If I didn’t start with her being an exceptional goalkeeper, she might be upset.”\n \n\n   \n  Last season, Hamant’s save percentage ranked her as one of the top three goalkeepers in the college game, but she was valued for so much more than her ability to stop shots.\n \n\n   \n  “She was strong, resilient, an exceptional teammate,” Van Dyke continued. “She was funny, she just regularly kept us laughing, she always brought people with her. She brought us so much joy.”\n \n\n   \n  Hamant documented her fight against cancer on her Instagram page,  @miakickscancer , and she maintained regular contact with the coaches while helping develop some of the players in the team, particularly this season’s sophomore goalkeeper Tanner Ijams.\n \n\n   \n  “She was probably my biggest role model and definitely my biggest inspiration going into this season,” Ijams told CNN Sports. “You could just see how incredibly strong she was throughout all of this because you could tell how much pain she was in and we all knew that she was dealing with this insane battle of her life, and yet she was still laughing with us.”\n \n\n   \n  But on November 6, the laughter stopped. The Huskies had just beaten Wisconsin in their semifinal match when they learned that they had lost their friend and teammate.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s something no one’s prepared for,” explained Van Dyke, “Fortunately, we were surrounded by friends and family, and I know that’s what Mia and Mia’s family wanted for us. To be together in that moment, we’re unbelievably grateful for that.”\n \n\n   \n  They all spent the next day together, united by grief as they tried to make sense of their loss without somebody who would usually be on hand to lift their spirits.\n \n\n   \n  On a team outing to Target, they bought pajamas and candles, and at Chick-fil-A, they drank milkshakes. The next day, on the eve of the final, the senior players were asked whether they should even take the field against Michigan State. The players looked quizzically at their coach, incredulous that they were even having the conversation, but she had to be sure: Was carrying on what they all wanted to do?\n \n\n   \n  “I know she would be up there making fun of us for being so sad,” Ijams recalled. “We knew that she would want us to go out in that finals match and crush them. So, that’s what we did.”\n \n\n   \n  The players could sense Hamant everywhere around the stadium that day, they listened to her playlist in the locker room and they couldn’t help thinking of her when a sunset, which she so admired, glowed in the exact orange hue of the ribbons they’d been wearing in her honor all season. Orange is known as the color of kidney cancer awareness.\n \n\n   \n  Nobody could have known it at the time, but in what would be one of Hamant’s final games for the Huskies, she was the hero. In a quarterfinal match of the Big Ten tournament last season, Washington beat Iowa in a penalty shootout and Hamant made three saves. It seemed tragically poetic that in the first game after her passing, the match against Michigan State would also be settled with spot kicks, during which the goalkeepers play an outsized role in the proceedings.\n \n\n   \n  “Mia loved penalties, and I definitely share that love with her,” Ijams said. “She would have been absolutely thrilled to go to penalties. I knew that we had already won the game before the penalties even started.”\n \n\n   \n  Channeling some of the tricks and mind games that her late teammate had taught her, Ijams imposed herself on the shootout, saving two of MSU’s first three kicks.\n \n\n   \n  There would be no need for a fourth. Washington’s penalty takers all converted, securing an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament and a chance to win the national title – a goal that the team is still chasing.\n \n\n   \n  After their successful spot kicks, each player paid their respects.\n \n\n   \n  Jadyn Holdenried lifted her jersey to reveal a t-shirt with the inscription “For Mia,” Laura Cetina kissed her orange wristband, and Alex Buck blew kisses to the heavens. By the time Julia Hüsch stepped up with the chance to finish the game, Ijams could feel the emotional dam breaking.\n \n\n   \n  “At that point, my job was done because I knew she was going to put it away,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  When the players all rushed into each other’s arms a moment later, the emotion was palpable.\n \n\n   \n  “We felt that our love for (Mia) wasn’t going to be defined by any result,” explained Van Dyke. “We didn’t put pressure on ourselves to do it. I don’t think there was a dry eye in the stadium, or across the nation, to finish in penalties to win that game.”\n \n\n   \n  “Everyone was just sobbing in each other’s arms,” said Ijams, “We were just saying like, ‘Hey, we did it, like we did it for her.’”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/europe/poland-fighter-jets-russia-ukraine-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"06:51:00.000-05:00","title":"Rescuers scour wreckage for survivors after deadly Russian attack on western Ukraine","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following a devastating Russian airstrike on two apartment buildings in Ternopil, western Ukraine, rescuers are still searching for survivors among the rubble, with at least 26 people killed and over 20 missing.

\n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Every year, in the middle of summer, hundreds of Hong Kong construction workers and engineers walk up some 200 steps to Ching Lin Terrace in the seaside neighborhood of Kennedy Town.\n \n\n   \n  There, in one of the city’s temples ,  they gather and pay their respects to Lo Pan, a legendary Chinese carpenter from the Zhou dynasty and patron saint of builders and contractors.\n \n\n   \n  Even in the sweltering heat, workers cram into the tiny temple’s smoke-filled foyer with incense and candlesticks in hand. Bowing several times, they chant slogans in honor of the construction deity’s birthday and pray for a stable year of work.\n \n\n   \n  “I always tell people that Lo Pan is like our Michelangelo. He is a designer, an architect and an engineer,” said Lawrence Ng, president of the Hong Kong Construction Sub-Contractors Association, which represents the city’s waterproofing, metalwork and scaffolding professionals, among others.\n \n\n   \n  “We must pay respects to the workers who came before us, and Lo Pan is our ‘sifu’ (master).”\n \n\n   \n  Worshipping Lo Pan has taken on a particular significance in today’s precarious economy, Ng said.\n \n\n   \n  Since the Covid-19 pandemic, the city has seen  a decline  in large scale construction projects, leaving many laborers  without steady, long-term  employment. Among them are the city’s  “spidermen”  — thousands of construction workers trained in the ancient technique of bamboo scaffolding.\n \n\n   \n    Part of the city’s visual language\n \n\n   \n  On a slope behind Lo Pan temple is a towering residential building covered in a familiar sight to those who’ve walked Hong Kong’s streets: bamboo poles arranged in a distinct grid-like formation.\n \n\n   \n  The crisscrossed structures, in which each pole is fastened with nylon ties, are ubiquitous across the city’s dense, vertical urban landscape. These scaffolds are erected on skyscrapers, hundreds of feet high, and encased in fabric safety nets forming colorful cocoons of green, blue and purple.\n \n\n   \n  Smaller bamboo contraptions often poke out of windows, or cover air conditioning units and balconies.\n \n\n   \n  Bamboo scaffolding is not only used in the construction of new buildings, but the renovation of thousands of high-rises and historic tenements (“tong lau”) every year.\n \n\n   \n  Popular in Hong Kong for over a century, the technique’s origins in Chinese construction date back to at least the Han dynasty, around 2,000 years ago. The method was also widely used in mainland China until government regulations started calling for steel and aluminum scaffolds, in keeping with international norms, in the 1990s.\n \n\n   \n  Bamboo, however, remained the go-to material in Hong Kong, and has been used to build some of the city’s tallest skyscrapers, like Norman Foster’s HSBC headquarters and parts of the 88-floor International Finance Centre.\n \n\n   \n  Aside from helping develop Hong Kong’s modern structures, bamboo has also played an integral role in building temporary Cantonese opera  theaters .\n \n\n   \n  These traditional theaters, made entirely out of the plant, are built on special occasions like the birthdays of local deities or the Hungry Ghost Festival.\n \n\n   \n  Scaffolding has, in turn, become part of the city’s visual language. Being lightweight, customizable and relatively affordable, bamboo stands in stark contrast to its mainstream counterpart, metal.\n \n\n   \n  “Steel is relatively stiff and strong, but it’s less flexible than bamboo,” said Goman Ho, a structural engineer at British engineering firm Arup, who has more than three decades of experience overseeing the development of tall buildings in the city, including the 283-meter (928-foot) tall Cheung Kong Center.\n \n\n   \n  “Bamboo on the other hand, has its own craftsmanship,” he added. “You can build a lot of beautiful scaffolding in ways you’d never think of.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘It’s culture we need to maintain’\n \n\n   \n  Whether in traditional or modern construction, handling the long poles requires specific skills and intuition, which can take months or years to achieve.\n \n\n   \n  “Sometimes people spend one, two, three or even four years learning bamboo scaffolding and may not become masters,” said Ho Ping-Tak (no relation), Chairman of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Bamboo Scaffolding Workers Union.\n \n\n   \n  “But with metal, the technical requirements are lower. If you have the strength, you can generally meet the requirements in a much shorter time.”\n \n\n   \n  The largest member of the grass family, bamboo is combustible, susceptible to deterioration and weaker in rain, raising legitimate questions about its durability, Arup’s Ho said.\n \n\n   \n  “We need to find ways to overcome it,” he said of these challenges, suggesting that poles could be coated with epoxy or plastic solution to prevent erosion.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s culture we need to maintain,” Ho added.\n \n\n   \n  But keeping the tradition alive is challenging. The industry comprises an aging workforce –– many, like 78-year-old Leung Siu Wai, among the dozens of senior bamboo scaffold workers paying respects to Lo Pan, are close to retirement. New talent is also lacking, said Ng.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s hard to get young people to enter,” he added. “Young people in Hong Kong don’t want to do physically demanding work, or work that gives them an identity they feel uncomfortable with.”\n \n\n   \n  Discussions on safeguarding the practice resurfaced earlier this year when the Hong Kong government’s Development Bureau  announced  that 50% of new public building projects erected from March onwards would need to use metal scaffolding to “better protect workers” and align with modern construction standards in “advanced cities.”\n \n\n   \n  The notice sparked concern among some Hong Kong residents, even though the policy will only impact “one or two new building projects” this year, according to the statement.\n \n\n   \n  The bureau later confirmed to CNN that only one public project would be affected in 2025. Nonetheless, some residents have taken to social media to lament what they believed to be the beginning of the end of bamboo scaffolding.\n \n\n   \n  “This is your sign to film bamboo scaffolding while you still can,” wrote a Hong Kong videographer in an Instagram  post  that garnered over 20,000 likes. “Truly one of Hong Kong’s quiet wonders. And soon, it’ll just be part of the past.”\n \n\n   \n  The storied building technique has also been celebrated on the global stage, presented as part of the Hong Kong pavilion at this year’s Venice Biennale –– the world’s largest architecture exhibition.\n \n\n   \n  In May, a sprawling bamboo scaffold was built in the courtyard of Venice’s Campo della Tana, as part of a showcase exploring the diverse and often juxtaposing aspects of public space in Hong Kong, with a focus on threatened heritage.\n \n\n   \n  Its curators said their proposal for the pavilion was finalized in January, two months before the government announced its move to adopt more metal scaffolding in construction.\n \n\n   \n  “We were a bit shocked, to say the least, because we had planned for this without knowing (the government’s announcement) was coming,” said Ying Zhou, an architect and one of the curators.\n \n\n   \n  “So immediately, we were like, ‘Oh what does our thing now say?’ It takes on a whole different kind of importance, especially when we bring it to a place like Venice.”\n \n\n   \n  Eleven bamboo “sifus,” or masters, traveled to Venice to build the structure. Watching them in action, Zhou’s Italian counterparts were, she said, impressed with the way the material was assembled so quickly and precisely –– without much calculation.\n \n\n   \n  “These pre-modern technologies are never recognized in a standardized world, because you have steel, you have concrete, you have numbers that are calculable,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “And here we have something that even the Italians are like, ‘Oh, we need your structural engineer to certify (it).’”\n \n\n   \n    Safety concerns\n \n\n   \n  Thirty-six-year-old Over Chan, a bamboo scaffold worker who builds structures for external repair work, claims that recent industry-wide discussions about fatal accidents on construction sites have prompted more government intervention. (There were  24 deaths related to bamboo scaffolding  from January 2018 to August 2025, according to Hong Kong’s Labour Department).\n \n\n   \n  “When I was starting out as a worker, we didn’t even have to wear shirts, but now, we’re required to wear our uniform, have good manners, and so on –– this ultimately allows us to rise above the competition.”\n \n\n   \n  “Bamboo is not unsafe,” Ho, the chairman of the workers’ union, said, emphasizing the importance of workers fastening themselves to the wooden structures.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s fine to use metal scaffolding –– we’re not saying that metal scaffolding is a competing technique, but if (the government) makes an announcement without much explanation…it gives the public the wrong impression that bamboo is unsafe, which has huge implications.”\n \n\n   \n  Hong Kong’s Development Bureau told CNN that adopting metal scaffolding in construction is just one of many ways to improve site safety.\n \n\n   \n  “Provided relevant legislative requirements on bamboo scaffolds and metal scaffolds are fulfilled, both types of scaffolds are safe,” the bureau said in an email, adding that the government has “no intention to phase out the adoption of bamboo scaffolds.”\n \n\n   \n  Many large-scale construction projects in Hong Kong already incorporate a hybrid of bamboo and steel scaffolding, the union leader Ho said, with metal bars fixed to the ground supporting wooden structures higher up.\n \n\n   \n  He estimates that, currently, 80% of scaffolds are created using bamboo, while 20% use metal or a hybrid of materials.\n \n\n   \n  Chan, who remains eager and optimistic about the trade, said he has started taking courses on metal scaffolding to stand out in the workforce, despite his belief that bamboo isn’t going anywhere.\n \n\n   \n  “Over the past few years, there’s been this feeling in Hong Kong about needing to preserve what’s left of the city’s identity,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/middleeast/israel-strikes-gaza-escalation-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"05:59:00-04:00","title":"Israeli strikes across Gaza kill at least 32 Palestinians, as Hamas warns of ‘dangerous escalation’","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israeli airstrikes in Gaza killed at least 32 Palestinians, including 12 children and 8 women, in a major escalation of violence since a ceasefire agreement took effect in October 2025.

Israel and Hamas took effect.\n \n\n   \n  The Palestinian Ministry of Health said 12 children and eight women were among those killed in the strikes, which continued from Wednesday into Thursday morning, while a further 88 people sustained injuries.\n \n\n   \n  The Israel Defense Forces said it carried out the strikes on Hamas targets after “several terrorists” fired on Israeli soldiers operating in Khan Younis in southern Gaza. “This action constitutes a violation of the ceasefire agreement,” the IDF said, adding that none of its forces had been injured.\n \n\n   \n  Hamas condemned the strikes as “a dangerous escalation” and rejected the IDF’s account, accusing Israel of trying to “justify its ongoing crimes and violations.” It called on the US to exert “immediate, serious pressure” on Israel to “respect the ceasefire and halt the aggression against our people.”\n \n\n   \n  The latest strikes bring the total Palestinian death toll since the ceasefire came into effect to 312.\n \n\n   \n  They come just days after the UN Security Council  endorsed  US President Donald Trump’s plan for how to move beyond the fragile truce to a more sustainable peace and the reconstruction of the devastated enclave.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, in a separate development, Israel also carried out airstrikes on what it claimed were Hezbollah weapons storage sites in southern Lebanon.\n \n\n   \n  The strikes in Gaza were the third major escalation since the  ceasefire agreement  came into force in October, each preceded by an attack on Israeli soldiers.\n \n\n   \n  In the two previous escalations, on  October 19  and  28 , approximately 150 Palestinians and three Israeli soldiers were killed.\n \n\n   \n  However, despite those escalations the ceasefire has largely held.\n \n\n   \n  CNN footage taken Wednesday at Gaza City’s Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital complex shows dozens of people crowding around incoming ambulances carrying victims of the strikes.\n \n\n   \n  The footage shows several people sitting beside the corpses inside the hospital, some peering into the body bags in despair. One of the body bags contains the bodies of three lifeless children still covered in dust.\n \n\n   \n  The deadliest strike Wednesday was in the Zaytun area in the east of Gaza, where 10 people, including a woman and a child, were killed, Gaza Civil Defense said.\n \n\n   \n  Another strike hit an area west of Khan Younis targeting “a group of civilians inside the UNRWA club,” the Civil Defense added.\n \n\n   \n  UNRWA is the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East.\n \n\n   \n  Israel launched its war in Gaza after Hamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people and took more than 250 hostage during an attack on Israel on October 7, 2023. Since then, according to the Gaza health ministry, more than 69,000 Palestinians – most of them women and children – have been killed.\n \n\n   \n  As part of the first phase of the US-brokered ceasefire framework, Hamas agreed to release all the remaining hostages in Gaza, living and dead, while Israel agreed to withdraw from some parts of Gaza and release some Palestinian prisoners. Hamas has since released all of the living hostages and the bodies of all but three of the dead ones.\n \n\n   \n  The strikes in Gaza come a day after an Israeli strike on a Palestinian refugee camp in  Lebanon killed 13 people,  according to Lebanon’s health ministry. The IDF said Tuesday’s strike had targeted “a Hamas training compound” that was being used to “plan and carry out terrorist attacks against the IDF and the State of Israel.”\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, Israel carried out further strikes in southern Lebanon, targeting what it said were “several weapons storage facilities belonging to Hezbollah’s rocket unit.” The strikes caused no casualties but damaged several houses, according to Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency.\n \n\n   \n  Israel has been carrying out strikes in  Lebanon targeting militants from Hezbollah  as well as various Palestinian militant factions for more than two years. These escalated after Iran-backed Hezbollah launched attacks on Israel in support of Hamas following the October 7 attack.

Kaitlan Collins, Hannah Rabinowitz, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   President Donald Trump  on Wednesday sought to bring a swift end to perhaps the most damaging saga of his term,  signing a measure  compelling the release of the Epstein files after losing a monthslong, tooth-and-nail fight to prevent their disclosure.\n \n\n   \n  The decision represents a stunning reversal for the president aimed chiefly at quelling a brewing GOP revolt and restoring his iron grip over the party. But few believe the path will be so easy from here.\n \n\n   \n  “I HAVE JUST SIGNED THE BILL TO RELEASE THE EPSTEIN FILES,” Trump posted on Truth Social late in the day, framing the overwhelming votes for it in Congress as a result of his involvement.\n \n\n   \n  The measure becoming law is now set to open a fraught new stage in  the push for the files  tied to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, putting the Justice Department under fresh scrutiny and testing the White House’s ability to pivot attention away from the president’s past dealings with Epstein and toward more advantageous political ground.\n \n\n   \n  At an unrelated press conference earlier Wednesday, Attorney General Pam Bondi would only say that the Justice Department would “follow the law” when asked about the Epstein files.\n \n\n   \n  But already, officials face growing suspicion from Capitol Hill and their MAGA base that the administration will use a just-opened, Trump-ordered criminal investigation as an excuse to keep some of the Epstein case file under wraps.\n \n\n   \n  Justice officials, meanwhile, are scrambling to balance their probe with a looming December deadline for releasing the documents after being caught off-guard by both Trump’s demand for a new investigation and his subsequent sudden support Sunday evening for making all the Epstein files public, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  And even as the White House tries to accelerate past the controversy to focus on next year’s midterm elections, there remains little sign that Trump’s supporters are anywhere near ready to leave it behind.\n \n\n   \n  “This is a storyline that’s going to continue to dog the president into the second year of his presidency,” said Alex Conant, a longtime GOP operative. “The Epstein conspiracies have reached moon landing status. And we’ll never stop talking about it.”\n \n\n   \n  The relentless intrigue surrounding the Epstein files marks the rare issue that has driven a wedge between Trump and the Republican Party he’s led for the last decade, exposing a vulnerability for the White House made all the more frustrating by the fact that it’s largely the result of a series of self-inflicted wounds.\n \n\n   \n  Since it became clear that he could not suppress the files’ release, Trump has tried to reunify the GOP behind a new effort to tie Epstein directly to the Democratic Party.\n \n\n   \n  In announcing he’d signed the bill, Trump focused squarely on Democrats, writing, “Perhaps the truth about these Democrats, and their associations with Jeffrey Epstein, will soon be revealed,” and adding, “This latest Hoax will backfire on the Democrats just as all of the rest have!”\n \n\n   \n  The offensive has drawn on newly disclosed Epstein emails that mention various prominent Democrats, alongside numerous references to Trump — a development that White House officials hope will put them back on offense after months under siege. (Corresponding with Epstein would not be a crime, and there’s no evidence in the emails that any of them participated in Epstein’s wrongdoing.)\n \n\n   \n  “All of a sudden there existed a real opportunity to change the narrative,” one official told CNN, noting that aides had only limited knowledge of what was in the documents compiled by Epstein’s estate until a House committee released them last week.   \n \n\n   \n  But the strategic shift comes after months of failed gambits, dismissals and outright resistance to releasing the files — all of which has sapped precious attention and time from the administration’s core agenda.\n \n\n   \n  The president now faces some of the lowest approval ratings of his term so far, as well as the twin challenges of waging an uphill battle toward the midterms while keeping a lid on the simmering divisions over Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the president was in the right position at the end,” GOP Sen. Mike Rounds said of his support for the Epstein measure. “The rest of the story now is that they will have to deliver on that package in very short order, and then it’s going to depend upon what’s in the package and what’s been withheld.”\n \n\n   \n    Pressure for the files was a problem of Trump’s own making\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s signature on the bill — and the credit he claimed for its success — capped a public push for the files that the president himself first fueled nearly a year-and-a-half ago, after he pledged on the campaign trail to release the materials if elected.\n \n\n   \n  His team then leaned into that off-hand commitment   as a way to energize a segment of the GOP base that’s been fixated on the Epstein files and has been convinced they would implicate a range of powerful figures in the late financier’s sexual abuse of young girls.\n \n\n   \n  The administration further heightened expectations in February, when Bondi distributed “Epstein Files” binders to conservative influencers at the White House. The event was a dud; virtually all of the information was already public, sparking public backlash and opening the door to months of private tensions among top DOJ officials.\n \n\n   \n  Bondi later claimed the administration was poring over newer materials, only for the DOJ to announce months later that no “further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted.”\n \n\n   \n  The ensuing firestorm pitted the White House against many of the MAGA figures who had aided Trump’s rise, sparked a bipartisan effort on Capitol Hill to force the release of the files and prompted an internal scramble to tamp down an issue that threatened to consume the administration through much of the summer.\n \n\n   \n  That effort became more challenging in the wake of revelations that magnified Trump’s past connections to Epstein, including that the president’s name had surfaced in the files. (Trump has not been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.)\n \n\n   \n  Within the White House, aides sought to manage the expectations of their allies, trying to explain that publicizing the rest of the files risked harming victims and violating the privacy of people whose names were in the documents but not credibly accused of wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, meanwhile, repeatedly took to social media to try to browbeat Republicans in line, insisting that the files he once vowed to release were now little more than a Democratic “hoax.” Yet neither approach succeeding in quelling the calls for more disclosure.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re trying to explain to people that they’re believing in something that does not exist,” a senior White House official said. “That’s why it’s so frustrating.”\n \n\n   \n    New investigation raises fresh questions about what will be released\n \n\n   \n  At one point, as the congressional effort to compel the Epstein files’ release gained steam, officials floated launching the new DOJ investigation as a way to alleviate the pressure and block any more documents from being released, an administration official said.\n \n\n   \n  But it’s not clear whether the option made it to Trump. A White House official said the idea of an investigation into Democrats came after the emails were released by the House oversight panel last week. The Justice Department declined to comment.\n \n\n   \n  During Wednesday’s unrelated press conference, Bondi said that “new information” obtained by investigators had prompted her to reopen the Epstein matter without specifying what that was.\n \n\n   \n  So last Friday, as the House vote on releasing the files loomed, Trump abruptly called for the DOJ to probe Epstein’s connections to a handful of Democrat-aligned figures including former President Bill Clinton. He also sought an inquiry into the banking giant JPMorgan Chase’s associations with Epstein.   (Responding to the probe, spokespeople for Clinton and JPMorgan maintained they were not involved in Epstein’s crimes.)\n \n\n   \n  The White House insists Trump has always been on the side of releasing the files. “President Trump has never been against releasing the Epstein files — rather, he has always been against Republicans falling into the Democrat trap of talking about this rather than focusing on the historic tax cuts signed into law, the fact that zero illegal aliens have entered our country in five months, and the many other accomplishments of the Trump Administration on behalf of the American people,” White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  And since the opening of the new investigation, multiple White House officials have insisted to CNN that Trump will not stand in the way of the documents being released and that aides have little reason to believe the new investigation will affect that process, though Bondi declined to offer any explicit assurances on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Within the DOJ, some officials have lamented that Trump’s novel support for releasing the files amounts to a lose-lose — with Bondi and her department now facing dueling directives to both run an investigation and make public its pertinent documents.\n \n\n   \n  The White House’s belated bid now to lean into the Epstein files as a political attack line has also generated some grumbling among allies on Capitol Hill and in the broader Trump orbit who had hoped to move on from a challenging period.\n \n\n   \n  In the last two weeks, some of these allies noted, Trump oversaw an end to the record-long government shutdown, promoted the administration’s efforts on key affordability issues and hosted a series of high-profile diplomatic events.\n \n\n   \n  Yet as Trump and his aides try to turn the tables on Democrats over Epstein, “this is all anyone’s talking about,” Conant said.\n \n\n   \n  “The power of the presidency is the ability to set the agenda,” he added. “And to the extent that this is a distraction, it does undermine what else he can do.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/middleeast/israeli-hostage-kupershtein-gaza-captivity-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-05:00","title":"In your head, you count every day: Ex-October 7 hostage describes 2 years in captivity","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Bar Kupershtein, a 23-year-old security guard and paramedic, was kidnapped by Hamas on October 7, 2023, during a terror attack at the Nova Festival in Israel.

      \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Bar Kupershtein smiles and laughs as if he hasn’t spent the last two years in “hell,” as he describes it, his demeanor belying the time he spent  in Hamas’ captivity in Gaza .\n \n\n   \n  “I prefer to take things with humor and laughter, to be happy with my family, and to look forward, not back,” the 23-year-old security guard who was kidnapped from  the Nova Festival on October 7, 2023 , told CNN, hours before boarding a flight to meet US President Donald Trump at the White House on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  It’s the same resolve that made him stay behind during the terror attack, aiding the wounded partygoers, until he was ultimately shot and kidnapped by Hamas. Despite the enormous hardship he endured, he says he would do the exact same thing again.\n \n\n   \n  “I was responsible for the safety of all the partygoers”’ he said. “If I ran away and saved myself, knowing that others were there and I could have helped them –– I wouldn’t have been able to live with myself.” Survivors have called him a hero. “I just did my job,” he insists.\n \n\n   \n  That decision cost him 738 days.\n \n\n   \n  “In your head, you count every day, that’s how you keep yourself busy,” he told CNN. In the beginning, he recalls, blindfolded and forbidden from speaking, counting was one of the only activities available. Days became weeks, months, two years.\n \n\n   \n  “There were moments when they tried to execute us, when they starved us, when they abused us, whether with beatings, physically, verbally, depriving us from basic human conditions,” he recounts. “You feel like the most miserable person in the world.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Just endure it’ or ‘It can’t get any worse than this’\n \n\n   \n  Held underground with five other hostages, in what he described as “a small dungeon,” Kupershtein recalls an especially violent period, following statements by far-right  Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir  on Palestinian prisoners. “They came to us, beat us and hit us, and when we asked why, they said it was because of Ben Gvir and because of our government,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  In April 2025, Hamas released  a propaganda video  showing Kupershtein and another hostage, Maxim Herkin, appearing emaciated and distressed, begging to be brought home. “All I was thinking about was that my family would know that I am alive, that’s it,” he said. “I didn’t care what they told me to say, I would say everything – just for my family to see me safe and sound and speaking.”\n \n\n   \n  In that hell, Kupershtein says his anchor was his faith.\n \n\n   \n  “God gave me the strength to be strong. I truly believed and knew that I would get out safe and sound,” he said. “From day one, I had this inner feeling. I kept telling myself not to give up and stay strong – for the family – because one day I will get out and go back to being Bar. I told myself that it can’t get any worse than this – so just endure it.”\n \n\n   \n  His faith grew even stronger during captivity.\n \n\n   \n  “I wasn’t very religious beforehand, only traditional, but in captivity, one really connects to God, you talk to him. He saved me – not once or twice. Every day that I stayed alive was a miracle.”\n \n\n   \n  In captivity, Kupershtein had little access to the outside world and was only occasionally aware of what was happening. Even then, it was often what his captors wanted him to know.\n \n\n   \n  But a radio transmitter brought in to broadcast Quran passages to the hostages gave them an unexpected link to the outside.\n \n\n   \n  Kupershtein managed to locate an Israeli military radio station and get updates from home. “I remember waking up every morning, looking at the radio and waiting to listen to it,” he says. “It really is a miracle. Imagine you’re 30 meters (98 feet) underground and you’re listening to the radio.”\n \n\n   \n    A father’s fight for his son\n \n\n   \n  From that radio, he heard about his family’s efforts to secure his release. Kupershtein’s father, Tal, was a former volunteer paramedic for  United Hatzalah , Israel’s largest volunteer emergency medical service organization. He suffered a severe stroke in a motorcycle accident three years prior to the kidnapping. The accident made Bar, the eldest of five siblings, the family’s breadwinner, managing their falafel stand while also working as a security guard at events. He also followed in his father’s footsteps, volunteering as a paramedic.\n \n\n   \n  During his son’s captivity, Tal – who was in a wheelchair and had been unable to speak for years – engaged in an intense recovery effort with speech therapists and regained his ability to speak so he could advocate for his son’s freedom.\n \n\n   \n  “I saw my father sometimes at demonstrations, they even brought me a picture of him standing at a demonstration,” Kupershtein says. “I also heard my mother organized a birthday for me at Hostages Square.”\n \n\n   \n  He didn’t believe his release was coming until the last minute. “There were so many deals that didn’t go through, so we thought here’s another one that won’t go through, something will mess up,” he said. “Even when I was on my way home, I didn’t believe we were actually getting out.”\n \n\n   \n  Now, he is on his way to the Oval Office, where the US president invited all 20 newly- freed hostages. Kupershtein, who calls Trump “an emissary of God,” plans first and foremost to thank him. “God said we needed to get out of there and he was the emissary,”, he says. “He played a big part in us getting out of there.”\n \n\n   \n  Asked if he believes in peace, Kupershtein is measured. “Personally, yes, but after these two years I was there, I know that the other side is really not interested in peace, so as much as we as a state can want peace – I don’t think it can happen with Hamas.”\n \n\n   \n  He describes himself now as an “upgraded version” of who he was before and says being back in Israel is like a daily dream.\n \n\n   \n  “There is an excitement every day to wake up in the morning here – and not there in the tunnels – and to be alive and breathing,” he said. “I thank God for this every day.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, underneath the smiles and the laughter, he acknowledged the wounds remain.\n \n\n   \n  “Of course, there are moments when I can’t fall asleep at night with hard thoughts and a need to go out for fresh air,” he admits. “Sometimes I find myself in situations where I see everyone around me happy, but I’m just regular, and it’s not true happiness.”\n \n\n   \n  He says he tries “to surround myself with a loving, supportive environment so that I don’t reach those situations and just be happy. It’s part of it, I believe it will heal.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/us/transgender-ideology-gender-cec","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"07:30:00-04:00","title":"The White House wants to eliminate ‘gender ideology’ and ‘trans ideology.’ What does that mean?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The White House, under President Donald Trump, is actively promoting the elimination of 'gender ideology' and 'transgender ideology' from federal policy, replacing 'gender' with 'sex' and asserting a biological definition of sex.

It was the newest escalation in a running conflict that began when a student in a summer course on children’s literature recorded video of herself accusing her professor of going “against our president’s laws” by teaching “gender ideology” and declared that she was reporting the purported violation to the administration.\n \n\n   \n  Texas Republican politicians seized on the video as a scandal, with one state representative calling it “TRANSGENDER INDOCTRINATION.” The Trump administration joined in, with Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Harmeet Dhillon calling it  “deeply concerning”  and declaring she would look into it. Within days, the professor had been  fired , students led academic freedom  protests , and the president of the system’s flagship university  resigned  for reasons unspecified — all in the wake of a controversy about whether a class about children’s literature could legally discuss a children’s book about a 12-year-old coming out as nonbinary.\n \n\n   \n  In the past year, the terms “gender ideology” and its sibling, “transgender ideology,” have become ubiquitous — in government documents and policy announcements, in mass media and in online disputes. The White House has declared its intention to stamp them out. Yet what do they mean, exactly?\n \n\n   \n    Donald Trump demands ‘biological truth’\n \n\n   \n  In 2016, North Carolina passed the law HB2, colloquially known as the “Bathroom Bill,” banning people from using public restrooms that did not correspond with the sex listed on their birth certificates. The backlash was immediate: advocates nationwide sprang into action against it, the general public was appalled, the state lost  millions of dollars  in business and the NCAA pulled its high-profile sporting events. One year later, the bill was repealed.\n \n\n   \n  Yet less than a decade later, restrictions on transgender people have taken hold of state and national policy. While HB2 was viewed by some as a blatant form of transgender discrimination, similar mandates are being imposed and upheld by every level of government today.\n \n\n   \n  On President Donald Trump’s first day in office this year, he signed an executive order titled “Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government.” In it, he ordered the federal government to replace the term “gender” with “sex” throughout its policies and documents and declared that “sex” referred to “an individual’s immutable biological classification as either male or female.”\n \n\n   \n  “Gender ideology includes the idea that there is a vast spectrum of genders that are disconnected from one’s sex,” the  executive order read . “Gender ideology is internally inconsistent, in that it diminishes sex as an identifiable or useful category but nevertheless maintains that it is possible for a person to be born in the wrong sexed body.”\n \n\n   \n  Zaya Perysian, however, said Trump’s order brought a new and dangerous inconsistency to her life. Under the new White House rules, Perysian, a content creator who has documented her transition online, was issued a passport that identifies her as male, the sex she was assigned at birth. This left Perysian — with her chest-length curls and low-cut clothes, after more than five years on estrogen and both top and bottom surgery — holding a government ID that didn’t match her other legal documents. All the passport does, she said, is put her at risk.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re 1% of the population and 90% of the conversation,” Perysian said. “It’s just so ridiculous. We’re always being forced to defend ourselves against complete nonsense and complete propaganda.”\n \n\n   \n    Finding ideology everywhere\n \n\n   \n  The term “gender ideology” didn’t originate in the US. The phrase has been part of a larger  anti-gender movement  taking shape across the world — first in Europe in the 2010s and now in Latin America, Africa and the US — particularly among conservative governments, religious groups and civil society groups, according to  a United Nations report . In 2018, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro centered  his right-wing election campaign against  “gender ideology.” Brazil is one of the  deadliest countries  for transgender people.\n \n\n   \n  The worldwide movement against “gender ideology” views the use of the term “gender” in classifying people’s social identities as a way to “destroy the traditional family and family values,” the UN report states. Indeed, much of the opposition is framed as a religious, moral choice: When Bolsonaro visited the White House  in 2019 , he decried “gender ideology” by saying both countries share a “respect to traditional and family lifestyles, respect to God, our creator, against the gender ideology of the politically correct attitudes and fake news.”\n \n\n   \n  “Transgender ideology,” a phrase largely used in the US, is, if anything, even more amorphous. Trump, in various public remarks or executive orders, has vowed to “get  transgender ideology  the hell out of our military,” to stop child abuse by “prohibiting public schools from indoctrinating our children with  transgender ideology ,” and to undo what he called the Biden administration’s efforts to “force Christians to affirm radical  transgender ideology .” During the investigation of the killing of Charlie Kirk, law enforcement leaked a preliminary internal report to the media incorrectly claiming the shooter’s ammunition had been marked with “ transgender ideology .”\n \n\n   \n  The president and his followers now use “gender ideology” and “transgender ideology” more or less interchangeably. A scroll through social media shows both phrases cropping up in conservative and right-wing corners of the internet, largely as a shorthand for anything pertaining to transgender people. Using a transgender person’s  correct pronouns ? That’s transgender ideology. A Glamour magazine cover  celebrating transgender women ? Also transgender ideology.\n \n\n   \n  Sometimes, the content of the “ideology” isn’t even stated. Florida’s commissioner of education removed a sociology professor from a curriculum workgroup for “promoting gender ideology,” he announced on X, without ever specifying how  that ideology had actually been promoted . His replies were filled with hundreds of thank yous anyway.\n \n\n   \n    What makes trans people a unique target\n \n\n   \n  Jay W. Richards is a director at The Heritage Foundation and a contributor to the conservative policy blueprint Project 2025, who wrote about “gender ideology” back in 2023. That people can be divided into two sexes, male or female, is a matter of “biological reality,” he said — though biological research on sex distinctions has yielded  more complicated results . Richards described “gender ideology” as “toxic,” saying it causes people to misunderstand who they are. Having a subjective, internal sense of gender, he told CNN, should not constitute one’s literal identity. Those who are questioning their gender need help “to understand their bodily reality.”\n \n\n   \n  The goal, he said, is to successfully “defeat gender ideology.”\n \n\n   \n  “Say, 25 years from now, it never occurred to a child that he or she might be born in the wrong body, that to be whole, he or she needs to take body and mind-altering drugs and undergo radical surgery in order to be whole,” Richards said.\n \n\n   \n  That goal goes against the advice of major medical organizations. The American Medical Association, the American Psychiatric Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics support what they call  gender-affirming care  — a multidisciplinary approach that includes medically necessary and scientific evidence-based practices that has been shown to be  life-saving for transgender people. \n \n\n   \n  Yet more than half of US states have banned  some care for transgender youth  including puberty blockers, other hormone therapy, and gender-affirming surgery (although research shows such surgeries are  rarely performed on minors  in the US).\n \n\n   \n  By using “gender ideology” and “transgender ideology,” people are explicitly trying to diminish the human nature of gender identity, said Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, an infectious disease physician and former director at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n \n\n   \n  “They want it to be like, this person isn’t a transgender person, they’re an ideologue,” he said. “These are not evidence and science-based things that they’re saying. They’re really trying to destabilize the base of science that brought us to the place where gender diversity was something that we were supporting for people’s health.”\n \n\n   \n  In most other areas of medical care, it’s a generally accepted premise that people and their doctors make decisions together. When it comes to questions like avoiding vaccination, the Trump administration encourages people to follow their subjective beliefs, even amid rampant disinformation and, in some cases, limited access. Yet the government’s program of fighting “trans ideology” means that trans people are excluded from those principles — along with everyday principles like “ call people what they want to be called ” and “don’t  fire people from their jobs  because of their personal identity.”\n \n\n   \n  The usage casts transgender and nonbinary people as having succumbed to an undefined doctrine, rather than experiencing a differing gender identity. Trans personhood isn’t an identity, these terms suggest, it’s a belief imposed on people by outside ideological forces. And those forces, those so-called ideologies, can be overturned.\n \n\n   \n  “When you make our existence into an ideology, it becomes much easier to dismiss us than it is if you approach us as people,” said Laurel Powell, communications director for the Human Rights Campaign.\n \n\n   \n    Ban gender, spread measles\n \n\n   \n  Ultimately, the language is “demonizing transgender people as a group,” said Chase Strangio, attorney and co-director of the ACLU’s LGBT & HIV Project. Using this rhetoric suggests that people’s identities are an ideological threat to a country’s national order.\n \n\n   \n  “Part of what’s happening here is, ‘Oh, the world is changing in scary ways. It’s a threat to the order,’” Strangio said. “‘Gender ideology is at the root. We’re going to root it out.’”\n \n\n   \n  The effects of this rooting out are already seen. Already, between May 2024 and May 2025, hate attacks against transgender people increased by 14% compared with the year before, according  to GLAAD data . More than half of all anti-LGBTQ incidents tracked over the year targeted transgender and gender diverse people specifically. Political rhetoric can have potentially deadly effects.  One study found  that when states pass anti-trans laws, like bans on trans-specific health care or sports participation, there’s a rise in transgender and nonbinary teens’ suicide attempts.\n \n\n   \n  The downstream effects of politicizing gender identity aren’t only harmful to transgender people.\n \n\n   \n  One of the most notable uses of this terminology was earlier this year, when an array of government health webpages were taken down in order to scrub  references to “gender ideology.”  To comply with the executive order, Daskalakis said the CDC had to pull down a 45-minute video educating providers about measles care — in the midst of a  measles outbreak in Texas  — because they uttered the phrase “gender identity” once.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a prime example of what happens when ideology is powered up beyond science and concern for the health of people,” Daskalakis said.\n \n\n   \n  When identity becomes politicized, vulnerable populations start to falter and the entire country is weakened. In the long term, Daskalakis said vulnerable populations “will experience worse health, will get sick, and some will die.”\n \n\n   \n  “The stakes are high,” he said. “There will be people who are going to further demonize and vilify people based on who they are. And we know how that goes in the US.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/us/charlotte-ice-raids-residents-mobilizing","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"05:40:00-05:40","title":"Volunteer patrols and the PTA at school entrances: How some Charlotte residents are mobilizing amid the immigration crackdown","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In response to a federal immigration crackdown known as 'Operation Charlotte’s Web,' residents of Charlotte are mobilizing through volunteer patrols, school protections, and community-led safety initiatives.

Andy Buck, Dianne Gallagher, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:40 AM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The pews of the Charlotte church were packed as onlookers watched a man restrain a woman while a group in bright vests furiously blew their whistles and filmed the interaction, chanting, “La migra esta aqui.”\n \n\n   \n  Another group loudly sang, “This little light of mine, I’m gonna let it shine.”\n \n\n   \n  Clapping then erupted from the crowd.\n \n\n   \n  The scene was among several role-play scenarios hundreds watched Wednesday evening at Dilworth United Methodist Church as part of a training on how to respond to the expanding federal immigration enforcement operation that has  gripped the Charlotte area  and left residents on high alert.\n \n\n   \n  “Let’s practice our whistling language,” Rev. Joel Simpson, a pastor at First United Methodist Church in Taylorsville, said before a dissonant symphony of whistles filled the church.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to report active operations that are happening in our city, alert people nearby and offer reminders of our rights,” Simpson, who led the training, told the crowd. “We’re going to document and record unlawful practices, and we’re going to deter violence by getting as many people as possible to join quickly as an organized presence.”\n \n\n   \n  The plan is simple: Volunteers sign up for shifts and receive instructions from a “patrol dispatch team” on specific zones in Charlotte they will drive around in and alert people when they see immigration enforcement activity. They’re advised to do it in pairs, keep a safe distance from agents and to never try to physically impede law enforcement.\n \n\n   \n  The initiative is just one of many launched by Charlotte residents to help immigrant neighbors as the Trump administration touts  over 250 arrests  in the area since the aggressive immigration crackdown began over the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  Parents are banding together to guard school entrances or carpool students to class, and business owners across the city are patrolling their neighborhoods and closing their doors to protect their customers.\n \n\n   \n  People throughout Charlotte  have been  using many of the same tactics employed in Chicago – including watching for raids, blowing warning whistles and carrying signs advising people of their rights. Flags from Honduras, Colombia and Mexico were seen adorning cars and hanging from homes and businesses.\n \n\n   \n  Still, the fear throughout the city is palpable: families are keeping their children home from school and taking off from work, worrying they’ll be targeted by federal immigration agents.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Loving your neighbors is holy’\n \n\n   \n  Immigrant worker group Siembra NC organized Wednesday’s event at the church to train volunteers to help immigrants safely get to school and work and guard against constitutional violations during immigration enforcement activities, according to the organization.\n \n\n   \n  Volunteers stood outside the church doors, passing out warning whistles and held signs saying “Loving your neighbors is holy.”\n \n\n   \n  Hundreds of volunteers have attended training sessions held by the group to help immigrants as they travel within the city, document and record “unlawful practices” by agents and warn about enforcement activity, Simpson said.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re coming out on weeknights and they’re saying this is how we need to be spending our time and we want to be on the streets and in our communities, making sure people are cared for,” Simpson told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Over 1,000 people registered for Wednesday’s training and some people had to be turned away, the pastor said.\n \n\n   \n  Simpson said they got “best practices” from other communities that have been stops in the administration’s immigration blitz, including Chicago, Los Angeles and Washington, DC.\n \n\n   \n  “People are telling me as they go through this training like, ‘I’m feeling empowered,’” he said. “‘I feel like I can do something and there’s a way to channel my love and my anger and my fear into something that supports other people.’”\n \n\n   \n  That was the case for Maria Klein, who has used the training as a way to channel her frustration about the crackdown in her city.\n \n\n   \n  She attended the training because she cares about “our children who should be able to go to school safely, for our parents who should be able to go to work for the American dream.” Klein, who teaches English as a Second Language to adults, says many of her students have stopped attending class.\n \n\n   \n  “This was an opportunity to really do something practical and to have an immediate impact,” Klein told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    Parents and teachers help families as school attendance plummets\n \n\n   \n  “What is gonna happen if I go home and my parents aren’t there?”\n \n\n   \n  “What does that mean if my parents get taken away?”\n \n\n   \n  These are the questions teacher Jamie Roldan told CNN she has been getting from students at Charlotte East Language Academy since the immigration crackdown began in the city.\n \n\n   \n  “I tell them that I’m gonna fight if someone comes to my door. I’m fighting – hands, feet, it doesn’t matter. You’re not coming in my classroom and taking any of my kids,” Roldan said. “My classroom is a safe space and it will stay that way.”\n \n\n   \n  Amid “Operation Charlotte’s Web” – the immigration enforcement operation in the city named after the classic 1952 children’s book – more than  30,000 students were absent  from Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools on Monday, about 20% of the district’s enrollment.\n \n\n   \n  “We just understand that they were not in school receiving education, advancing their social skills and we know that that there was an impact to those homes where parents had to modify their work schedules,” Charlotte Mayor Pro Tem Danté Anderson told CNN Wednesday. “They had to have an economic impact out of fear that something would occur at those schools.”\n \n\n   \n  The district  issued a statement Sunday night  that no immigration activity had happened on their campuses and that leaders   hadn’t been informed of impending action. There were no reports of immigration enforcement on their campuses on Monday or Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools teacher David Gillespie says hallways and classrooms were nearly empty on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not sure which of my students I’m going to see again,” Gillespie told CNN affiliate  WCNC . “Whether because their parents were involved in detainments or because their parents have to make that unfortunate safety calculus — is it worth it to send my kids to school and put myself at risk?”\n \n\n   \n  As attendance plummets, some parents in the district are organizing to help families who are afraid to leave their homes.\n \n\n   \n  Some PTA members are standing guard at school entrances during drop-off and pick-up so they can alert staff and families if they see federal immigration agents, WCNC reported. Others are passing out information packets and using PTA funds to help families experiencing food insecurity or transportation issues.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re standing there bearing witness and being part of the community,” PTA member Amy Hawnelson told WCNC. “They do not stick around — and that’s why we’re here.”\n \n\n   \n  Another member, Mike Mastry, said they want to help students feel safe at school.\n \n\n   \n  “Seeing a familiar face that’s friendly and smiling helps bring a sense of normalcy,” Mastry told WCNC. “When kids don’t know what’s going on, they get disoriented and have trouble learning.”\n \n\n   \n  Roldan said parents with legal status are picking up children whose parents may not have legal status to bring them to school.\n \n\n   \n  Gillespie says he’s reaching out to families to help students stay on top of schoolwork.\n \n\n   \n  Extracurriculars have been impacted by the operation too. OurBRIDGE, an organization that helps newly arrived immigrant children and their families, has suspended its afterschool programs after Border Patrol activity at one of its sites, the group  announced  on social media.\n \n\n   \n  High school students in the district  staged a walkout Tuesday morning  to protest immigration enforcement in the city. Several hundred students gathered around the edge of a football field at East Mecklenburg High School, many wearing black and holding flags, photos of the demonstration showed.\n \n\n   \n  “The students’ main objective is to provide protection and cover to their fellow students of immigrant descent,” a news release on the demonstration said.\n \n\n   \n    Business owners work to protect customers\n \n\n   \n  Charlotte business owner Bryan Li enrolled in a training session offered by a local advocacy group and has been out patrolling the city the past few days, looking for federal agents and reporting back to advocacy groups that alert the community.\n \n\n   \n  Li, a US citizen born in Hong Kong, told CNN he couldn’t sit at home and not do something.\n \n\n   \n  “When harm is done, more people rally, learn and prepare so we can help protect our most vulnerable,” Li told CNN. “Charlotte will stand united and protect our immigrant community with everything we have.”\n \n\n   \n  While people like Li patrol the city, many businesses have shuttered their doors, fearing their customers will be a target.\n \n\n   \n  About  half the mom-and-pop businesses  the community development organization  CharlotteEast  works with have closed their doors at some point, despite all of them being owned by US citizens, Executive Director Greg Asciutto said Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  “From strictly an economic standpoint, it’s pretty catastrophic right now,” Asciutto said, comparing current closures to the first week of the coronavirus pandemic in the area.\n \n\n   \n  A Colombian bakery open for 28 years closed its doors Saturday after men in tactical gear   chased and tackled people outside the shop. Community members showed up afterwards to guard the business.\n \n\n   \n  Beth Clements, who stood outside the bakery wearing a yellow vest, had been standing guard there for three days.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m going to walk the streets with my whistle and I want to keep my neighbors protected because they deserve protection and they deserve to live in a world where they’re not scared,” Clements said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/politics/dick-cheney-funeral-washington","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"05:57:00-04:00","title":"Trump and Vance Not Invited to Dick Cheney’s Funeral, But All Four Living Former Vice Presidents Attending","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"At the funeral of former Vice President Dick Cheney, held on November 20, 2025, at the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C., all four living former vice presidents—including Kamala Harris, Mike Pence, Al Gore, and Dan Quayle—along with former presidents George W.

Prior to being elected vice president, Cheney served as defense secretary, White House chief of staff and as a congressman representing Wyoming.\n \n\n   \n  He was considered one of the most powerful and influential vice presidents in history, but his role as the architect of the Iraq War saw him leave office  deeply unpopular  and cemented a polarizing legacy.\n \n\n   \n  While official Washington funerals usually include invites to the White House, excluding Trump should not be a surprise.\n \n\n   \n  Cheney was a lifetime hardline conservative who endorsed Trump’s 2016 campaign. But he spent the last years of his life speaking out against Trump, particularly after his daughter then-Rep. Liz Cheney drew the president’s ire for her prominent role in a congressional committee investigating the January 6, 2021,  insurrection at the Capitol .\n \n\n   \n  In 2022, Cheney  described Trump as a coward  and said no one was a “greater threat to our republic.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump has not publicly expressed his condolences or commented on Cheney’s death.\n \n\n   \n  The White House offered a muted reaction after Cheney’s death with press secretary Karoline Leavitt telling reporters that Trump was “aware” the former vice president had died and noting that flags had been lowered to half-staff.\n \n\n   \n  Honorary pallbearers at Cheney’s funeral will include members of his Secret Service detail; his former chiefs of staff, David Addington and Scooter Libby; and photographer David Hume Kennerly.\n \n\n   \n  On one of the last pages of the service leaflet is a quote from the writer and naturalist John Muir, saying: “The mountains are calling and I must go.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-democrats","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"04:00:00Z","title":"Democrats Debate How to Approach Marjorie Taylor Greene After Public Apology","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Democratic Party is in a heated debate over whether to engage with Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, who recently apologized for her past inflammatory rhetoric and public criticism of Democrats and President Donald Trump.

Jasmine Crockett watched GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene  apologize on national television  for her role in perpetuating divisive rhetoric and immediately instructed her staff to see if the Georgia Republican wanted to work with her on a bill addressing lawmaker safety.\n \n\n   \n  Crockett had reached out to Greene on the issue shortly after Charlie Kirk’s assassination in September, without response. But now, with Greene’s public rebuke of President Donald Trump and her own party, Crockett sees even more potential in teaming up.\n \n\n   \n  “If you can put Marjorie and myself as co-leads on anything, it automatically gets attention, and it also reveals to the American public that we can bridge these gaps if we just decided that we want to,” Crockett told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The pair don’t necessarily have a friendly history. Often seen trading insults during House Oversight Committee meetings, Crockett has  dismissed Greene as racist  and once referred to the congresswoman as a “ bleach blonde, bad built, butch body. ” No, Crockett said, she wouldn’t consider Greene a “Democratic bestie,” but she hopes they can develop a new working relationship.\n \n\n   \n  Crockett’s attempts to find common ground with Greene reflect a broader discussion in the Democratic Party about whether they should embrace Greene or if the congresswoman’s history of offensive,  at times violent , rhetoric and  conspiracy theories  – often  directed  at Democrats – makes the  idea  just too unpalatable.\n \n\n   \n  In conversations with over a dozen Democratic lawmakers and aides, the proverbial scars from Greene’s incendiary past statements cut deep and, as a result, there’s no clear consensus on how to best work with her in the future.\n \n\n   \n  Greene’s office declined to comment for this story, but she called for unity in her recent interview with CNN’s “State of the Union.”\n \n\n   \n  “I think America needs to come together and end all the toxic, dangerous rhetoric and divide. And I’m leading the way with my own example, and I hope that President Trump can do the same,” Greene told CNN’s Dana Bash.\n \n\n   \n    Some Democrats see opportunity\n \n\n   \n  In their pursuit of circumventing House GOP leadership to force a vote on the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files, Democrats found an unlikely ally in Greene.\n \n\n   \n  Even though virtually all Republicans ended up voting for the measure, Greene was one of only four Republicans to buck their party and sign onto the petition that made Tuesday’s vote possible. It culminated in a shared embrace with Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, a key Democratic backer of the effort, at a high-profile press conference on Capitol Hill (once strangers,  the pair now texts ) and laid the groundwork for some Democrats to start to see an opening.\n \n\n   \n  Another area Democrats see as an opportunity to work together: The issue of rising health care costs and affordability.\n \n\n   \n  During the government shutdown, Greene openly vented about how health care prices for her family would double due to the expiring enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies that were central to Democrats’ shutdown argument.\n \n\n   \n  “Not a single Republican in leadership talked to us about this or has given us a plan to help Americans deal with their health insurance premiums DOUBLING!!!” Greene  wrote  on X in October.\n \n\n   \n  Her criticisms reached the upper echelon of the House Democratic caucus.\n \n\n   \n  The second highest Democrat in the House, Minority Whip Rep. Katherine Clark, said she was open to working with Greene on lowering the cost of health care and cost of living.\n \n\n   \n  “Our hand is always extended in bipartisanship, and we will work with anyone that is going to prioritize the economic needs of families at home and reduce their costs,” Clark said.\n \n\n   \n  Greene’s criticism of Israel in the war with Hamas has also brought her closer to some unexpected allies.\n \n\n   \n  Minnesota Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar said that despite the pair’s charged history (Greene tried to censure Omar  last year ), she approached Greene on the House floor even prior to Greene’s  apparent political breakup  with Trump to thank her for speaking out on Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  “In regards to her stances and addressing the genocide, I have actually personally gone to thank her for that. I think it is important when somebody is doing a principled thing that we thank them for what they are doing,” Omar said of her conversation with Greene a few months ago.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Rep. Pramila Jayapal has even gone through the trouble of tracking down Greene’s cell phone number to thank her for being outspoken against Trump and the Republican Party and wants to suggest teaming up on the progressive priority of “Medicare for All.” It wasn’t something she ever thought she’d do.\n \n\n   \n  “But I also have worked with a lot of people that I disagree with on a lot of things,” Jayapal told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    Distrust remains\n \n\n   \n  Not all Democrats are quick to trust when it comes to the Georgia Republican, and some questioned the influence she has within her party to draw other Republicans to the table.\n \n\n   \n  Members of the progressive group known as “the Squad” who were often the subject of Greene’s most vile attacks said they needed to see evidence that Greene’s arc was real and not just a publicity stunt.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said she needs to see Greene’s words followed up by action and that it’s on Greene to reach out to make amends.\n \n\n   \n  “I personally believe that you never close the door to a person who wants to have changes in their life and in their heart, but they have to be genuine and they have to be authentic,” the New York congresswoman said. “It is incumbent upon her to repair the harm that she has done to people. It is not on the people she has harmed.”\n \n\n   \n  As a candidate in 2020, Greene  posted  on her candidate Facebook page an image of herself holding a gun alongside images of Ocasio-Cortez, Omar and Rep. Rashida Tlaib and encouraged going on the “offense against these socialists.” Facebook took down the photo at the time.\n \n\n   \n  Rep. Ayanna Pressley remembers that photo, but says she would be willing to work with Greene if the Republican show true change.\n \n\n   \n  “I am a Christian woman of deep faith, so I certainly believe in the capacity of people to evolve, to atone, and to redeem themselves. And if she is on a path to do that, that is extraordinary. And I need to see action that supports what she’s saying,” the Massachusetts Democrat said.\n \n\n   \n  “I never want to cause any harm or anything bad for anyone,” Greene told Bash on Sunday, saying she’d previously addressed her hateful comments.\n \n\n   \n  In  2021 , Greene also apologized for her offensive comments comparing Capitol Hill mask-wearing rules to the Holocaust after visiting the US Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Rep. Becca Balint who put forward a resolution censuring Greene in  2023 , arguing she’s “fanned the flames of racism, antisemitism, LGBTQ hate speech, Islamophobia, anti-Asian hate, xenophobia, and other forms of hatred,” said Greene will need to be proactive if she is serious about making a change.\n \n\n   \n  “We all know politics always makes for strange bedfellows. In this instance, though, it has been truly remarkable and shocking to see her change of heart regarding nasty rhetoric. The only way for this to be anything other than just platitudes is for her to truly make amends to all the colleagues she’s hurt and put in danger,” Balint said.\n \n\n   \n  If Greene were serious about showing her evolution many Democrats argued a great place for her to start would be supporting a congressional memorial to honor law enforcement caught in the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar, who formerly served on the January 6 select committee, said Greene having dismissed the violence that day and refused to accept Joe Biden as the rightful winner of the 2020 election make it hard for him to conceive of working directly with her.\n \n\n   \n  “Her positions on January 6th and supporting the ‘Big Lie,’ you know, would continue to be an issue. It’s not someone I choose to cosponsor legislation with,” Aguilar said. “But I appreciate that people evolve on certain issues and if she wants to work with us on health care issues, then I welcome that.”\n \n\n   \n    Relationships after Trump\n \n\n   \n  Part of the calculus for Democrats is that they want to show the capacity to forgive Republicans who are starting to grapple with what the future of their party looks like in a world where Trump will no longer be the ballot.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland went as far as to say the Democratic Party has a big enough tent that Greene could one day be a part of.\n \n\n   \n  “Obviously, Marjorie Taylor Greene would have a lot of political transformation to go through before she could come to the Democratic Party, but I do want to make the serious point that we have to be open to a lot of people who are refugees from the political corruption and authoritarianism of the Republican Party,” Raskin told CNN. “I hear from Republicans every day who say, ‘I can’t take it anymore.’”\n \n\n   \n  A senior House Democratic aide, pressed on the idea of Greene one day becoming a Democrat, quipped that “converts are the most devout.”\n \n\n   \n  But even the Democrats who see the capacity for forgiveness acknowledge that it’s a long road ahead.\n \n\n   \n  “She’s got to do her own work. She’s on her own life journey,” Ocasio-Cortez said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/politics/russia-ukraine-white-house-plan","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"02:53:00-04:00","title":"Trump administration quietly attempting to hammer out new peace plan with Russia","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration is quietly advancing a new peace plan with Russia aimed at ending the war in Ukraine, led by special envoy Steve Witkoff and supported by a Pentagon delegation including Army Secretary Dan Driscoll.

Treene, Kevin Liptak, Matthew Chance, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:53 AM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Trump administration has been quietly hammering out a new peace plan with Russia to end its war with Ukraine, a person familiar with the talks told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The president’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, who has been at the center of the  administration’s talks with Moscow , has been leading the effort, the source said. The negotiations accelerated this week as the administration feels the Kremlin has signaled a renewed openness to a deal, the source added.\n \n\n   \n  Army Secretary Dan Driscoll and a top-level Pentagon delegation arrived this morning in Ukraine “on a fact finding mission to meet with Ukrainian officials and discuss efforts to end the war,” Army Spokesperson Col. Dave Butler said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  The mission, at the direction of the president, was part of the White House effort to resuscitate peace talks, according to a separate source who is a US official.\n \n\n   \n  Driscoll was expected to discuss battlefield conditions and weapons needs with President Volodymyr Zelensky and other senior Ukrainian officials, as well as the nascent peace efforts, the official said.\n \n\n   \n   The Wall Street Journal  first reported on the US delegation traveling to Kyiv.\n \n\n   \n  In a post on Telegram, Ukrainian Defense Minister Denys Shmyhal wrote that he had the honor of meeting with Driscoll, posting a photo of the two men shaking hands.\n \n\n   \n  Shmyhal expressed “gratitude” to the US for its “important support that saves the lives of Ukrainians every day.” He added that he “presented to partners our developments in the field of defense innovations” and “focused on the next steps to implement the historic defense agreements reached by President Zelensky and President Trump.”\n \n\n   \n  Driscoll has not been publicly involved in the last rounds of peace talks, but he is a close ally of Vice President JD Vance, with whom he attended Yale Law School. He has focused on military acquisitions.\n \n\n   \n  Other officials traveling with Driscoll to Kyiv were Army Chief of Staff Gen. Randy George; Gen. Chris Donahue, the top US Army commander in Europe; and Sergeant Major of the Army Michael Weimer.\n \n\n   \n  Russian sources also confirmed to CNN that there are ongoing high-level contacts between US and Russian officials, including Witkoff.\n \n\n   \n  Russian Special Envoy  Kirill Dmitriev went to the US in October  to meet Witkoff and others and had what a Russian source told CNN were “very productive discussions.”\n \n\n   \n  According to an  Axios report , the current draft being hashed out between Washington and Moscow is focused on 28 points, including security guarantees for Ukraine and Europe, as well as future US relations with Russia and Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  The Kremlin on Wednesday downplayed the Axios report. When asked about it, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that there are “no new developments to report so far” regarding an end to the war.\n \n\n   \n  “There were discussions in Anchorage. Beyond what was discussed in Anchorage, there have been no updates yet,” he said, referencing a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Trump in Alaska in August.\n \n\n   \n  Europe and Ukraine’s involvement in the talks so far remains unclear, the source familiar said, as well as whether they would support such a plan.\n \n\n   \n  In her first public remarks since reports of the new deal, European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas on Thursday told reporters that “for any plan to work, it needs Ukrainians and Europeans on board.”\n \n\n   \n  Attending the same meeting in Brussels, Poland’s foreign minister Radoslaw Sikorski said “we command peace efforts, but… it’s, of course, Europe’s security that’s at stake. So we expect to be consulted,” Reuters reported.\n \n\n   \n  Secretary of State Marco Rubio in a social media post Wednesday evening indicated that the Trump administration is in communication with both Kyiv and Moscow to come up with ideas for possible peace plans.\n \n\n   \n  “Ending a complex and deadly war such as the one in Ukraine requires an extensive exchange of serious and realistic ideas,” he said on X, noting that a lasting peace would also require difficult concessions from both sides. “That is why we are and will continue to develop a list of potential ideas for ending this war based on input from both sides of this conflict.”\n \n\n   \n  The White House declined to respond to a request for comment.\n \n\n   \n  The discussions come as the Trump administration has tried repeatedly to find an end to the war, only for talks to fall apart after Putin refused to make substantial commitments to the effort.\n \n\n   \n  “I thought that was going to be my easy one, because I have a good relationship with President Putin, but I’m a little disappointed in President Putin right now,” Trump said during remarks at a US-Saudi investment conference Wednesday. “He knows that.”\n \n\n   \n  After Trump  spoke with Putin by phone last month , he was so convinced there was enough progress made that he announced would soon be traveling to Budapest for an in-person summit with the Russian leader.\n \n\n   \n  But just five days later, the  summit was off  and  new sanctions on Moscow  — the first of Trump’s second administration — were on.\n \n\n   \n  US officials told CNN that in the time between, the president and his administration came to the conclusion that Putin’s stance on ending the war had not significantly shifted from the last time he  met Trump on a US air base in Alaska .\n \n\n   \n  Previous US peace talks had focused on freezing Russian and Ukrainian troops along current battle lines. Europe and Ukraine backed the plan as a jumping off point for fresh negotiations, while the Kremlin rejected the proposal, arguing they were not interested in a ceasefire but a longer-term peace deal.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Haley Britzky contributed to this report. \n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/china/japan-china-taiwan-dispute-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"02:48:00-05:00","title":"China warns there is ‘no market’ for Japanese seafood exports as spat over Taiwan comments escalates","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"China has issued a strong warning that there is 'no market' for Japanese seafood exports, escalating diplomatic tensions with Japan over Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s remarks in parliament that a Chinese attack on Taiwan would threaten Japan’s survival.

warns there is ‘no market’ for Japanese seafood exports as spat over Taiwan comments escalates \n       \n  By Jerome Taylor, Ross Adkin, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:48 AM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   China  has warned there is “no market” for  Japanese seafood exports,  the latest veiled threat from Beijing as its diplomatic spat with Tokyo escalates over recent comments by Japan’s leader on defending Taiwan.\n \n\n   \n  The two neighbors have been engaged in a  rapidly spiraling dispute  after Japanese leader Sanae Takaichi, in response to a question in parliament, said that a Chinese attack on Taiwan would count as “a situation threatening Japan’s survival,” and thus could trigger a military response from Tokyo.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing views the self-governing democracy of Taiwan as its territory and has vowed to take control of the island, by force if necessary. For Beijing, Taiwan’s sovereignty is the most sensitive issue in its relations with other nations – a “red line” not to be crossed.\n \n\n   \n  For more than a week, China and its state media has issued near daily denunciations of Takaichi   as well as threats to economically punish Tokyo unless the comments are retracted.\n \n\n   \n  Seafood emerged as the latest pressure point at a regular press briefing on Wednesday from China’s foreign ministry.\n \n\n   \n  “Due to the erroneous remarks made by Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi on important Taiwan issues, there has been strong public outrage in China,” spokesperson Mao Ning told reporters. “Under the current circumstances, even if Japanese seafood were exported to China, there would be no market for it.”\n \n\n   \n  Mao was responding to reports earlier that day in Japanese media that China had already informed Tokyo that it planned to ban seafood exports from Japan. Both NHK and Kyodo ran the reports, citing sources.\n \n\n   \n  However Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara told reporters Tokyo has yet to receive any confirmation from the Chinese government on the matter.\n \n\n   \n  Mao’s response did not confirm a ban was in place, but it has raised the prospect that one might be on its way as well as further punitive measures.\n \n\n   \n  “Japan should first retract its erroneous remarks and take concrete actions to safeguard the political foundation of China-Japan relations; otherwise, China will have no choice but to take further measures,” Mao said.\n \n\n   \n    Fukhshima era ban\n \n\n   \n  China had only  partly resumed imports  of seafood from Japan earlier this year after banning them in August 2023 in response to Tokyo’s decision to begin releasing treated radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear plant.\n \n\n   \n  Japan’s devastating 2011 earthquake and tsunami caused water within the plant to be contaminated with highly radioactive material. Tokyo had argued that it had treated the water properly, but Beijing had long led regional opposition to the water being returned to the ocean.\n \n\n   \n  In contrast to China threats, Taiwan’s leader Lai Ching-te turned to social media to show his support for Japanese seafood this week, posting a picture on X on Thursday of his sushi lunch.\n \n\n   \n  The threat of a new   seafood ban comes after Beijing last week advised its citizens against travelling to Japan.\n \n\n   \n  Although the move is non-binding, it is hugely symbolic – nearly 7.5 million travelers from China visited Japan between January and September this year, by far the highest count of any country or region, according to official data cited by Japanese public broadcaster NHK.\n \n\n   \n  Chinese airlines including Air China, China Eastern and China Southern later published notices on their websites offering customers refunds or free changes on certain tickets to Japan, Chinese state broadcaster CCTV reported.\n \n\n   \n  Japanese companies are starting to report cancellations.\n \n\n   \n  Tokyo-based tour operator East Japan International Travel Service said it had lost 70% of its bookings for the remainder of the year, because of the ongoing row between Japan and China.\n \n\n   \n  Yu Jinxin, the company’s vice president, told CNN it was “a huge loss for us”, adding Chinese tour groups are a key part of their business.\n \n\n   \n  “We can withstand a short-term impact of one to two months, but if the situation becomes prolonged, the financial strain on our operations will be significant,” Yu added.\n \n\n   \n  Previous Japanese leaders have avoided discussing Taiwan in the context of a military response to avoid ruffling feathers in China – Japan’s biggest trade partner.\n \n\n   \n  Takaichi,  a hawk who has pushed to strengthen Japan’s defense capacity,  visited Taiwan earlier this year – before she became Prime Minister – and called for cooperation on “defense challenges,” which Beijing condemned at the time.\n \n\n   \n  She has previously criticized Beijing’s increasing military presence in East Asia, and during the APEC summit, she met with Taiwan’s representative, again angering China.\n \n\n   \n  She met Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the same summit, at which she said she had asked China to resume imports of Japanese beef and seafood imports.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Mai Takiguchi and Kloe Zheng contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/politics/former-congressional-staffer-charged-allegedly-staging-assault","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"13:00:00-05:00","title":"Former Hill staffer charged for allegedly staging her own violent assault","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A former congressional staffer, Natalie Greene, has been charged by the Justice Department with conspiracy and making false statements after allegedly staging a violent assault on herself.

Analysis by Stephen Collinson, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:00 AM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  What now?\n \n\n   \n  The drama, emotion and shock of Congress’s sudden demand for transparency on the  Jeffrey Epstein drama  has ceded to uncertainty and suspicion that President Donald Trump will try to wriggle off the political hook.\n \n\n   \n  The  victims of Epstein , an accused sex trafficker, have tragically seen justice postponed before. They’d been quick to warn after an unprecedented Republican revolt against Trump on Tuesday that it was just one more step in their long quest for vindication. Their wisdom was obvious once the euphoria of their triumph began to clear.\n \n\n   \n  Washington waited all day Wednesday to find out that  Trump had signed   the bill  passed with a 427-1 majority in the House and waved through on unanimous consent by the Senate, which had no desire to be drawn into the president’s self-inflicted political crisis. The measure requires the Justice Department to release  all investigative files , documents and other materials about Epstein, with some exceptions,  within 30 days  of it becoming law. It’s hardly surprising that Trump didn’t rush to sign it, since, despite his late embrace of the legislation, it repudiated his weekslong bid to keep the evidence secret.\n \n\n   \n  Trump was in a box. Any presidential veto was likely to be overturned, judging by the congressional majorities for the bill. But now his Justice Department — in theory at least — is bound to implement it. Any foot-dragging or obstruction would certainly worsen already disastrous public disapproval of his handling of the issue and would only fuel the question that got him into his current mess: What is he trying to hide?\n \n\n   \n    The political battle to come\n \n\n   \n  Epstein survivors and Trump critics are turning to the next stage of the political battle over the documents, but there is almost no clarity over if and when evidence will come out — and how much.\n \n\n   \n  Lawmakers who endorsed the bill seemed unclear what would happen if Trump just ignored it. And Trump’s Attorney General Pam Bondi put on a flustered public performance that fostered little confidence that she would obey Congress or that the administration has a coherent political plan.\n \n\n   \n  There were also new indications of the depth of the bipartisan morass over Epstein and the likelihood that the release of Justice Department files could cause deep embarrassment for many prominent business and political leaders, entertainment stars and even royalty who associated with him.\n \n\n   \n  Larry Summers, a former Treasury secretary and top White House official in Democratic administrations  resigned from the board of OpenAI  after the release of emails revealed his friendly correspondence with Epstein. Summers also will not finish out the semester in his instructor role at Harvard University, a school spokesperson  confirmed Wednesday .\n \n\n   \n  And  Stacey Plaskett , a Democrat who represents the US Virgin Islands in Congress as a non-voting delegate, struggled for a convincing explanation of why she texted with Epstein during a congressional hearing in 2019.\n \n\n   \n  No one can say where this extraordinary scandal with far-reaching consequences will go next. But one thing is clear — it is deeply damaging Trump, both in wider public opinion and because of a never-before-seen split that it has opened in the MAGA movement.\n \n\n   \n  A newly released Marquette University poll — conducted November 5-12, before many of the saga’s latest developments — found that 74% of adults disapproved of Trump’s handling of the Epstein affair. And only 43% of Republicans approved. Marquette’s question asking Americans to choose their top issue didn’t include Epstein on the list. But it found that Americans cared deeply about the economy and the cost of living, on which they gave Trump overwhelmingly negative report cards.\n \n\n   \n    DOJ is yet to show its cards\n \n\n   \n  Such is the reputation of Trump’s Department of Justice — a fully coopted branch of his political machine — that few observers in Washington expect Bondi to follow the letter of the law just established by Congress.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer warned that his party would be ready to hold Trump to account. This shows that Democrats believe that Trump’s exposure to the Epstein drama will outweigh any embarrassment that disclosures could bring to other prominent Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  “There must be no funny business from Donald Trump,” Schumer said. “This bill is a command for the president to be fully transparent, to come fully clean, and to provide full honesty to the American people, even if he doesn’t want to.”\n \n\n   \n  Schumer referred to the possibility that the DOJ could seek an end run around the bill. It could potentially cite investigations into prominent Democrats and Epstein that Trump ordered last week to argue against the release of evidence. Another possibility is that evidence could be released but redacted in such a way as to make it almost meaningless on the premise that officials were protecting victims, witnesses or people who committed no criminal wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  Some Democrats fear the DOJ will scrub any references to the president himself in the files. There has been no evidence of criminal wrongdoing by Trump in relation to Epstein. But emails released by Congress showed  multiple mentions of him  by Epstein and his jailed associate Ghislaine Maxwell.\n \n\n   \n  Connecticut Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal told CNN’s John Berman on Wednesday that he had “no trust, no confidence whatsoever … that this Justice Department will be evenhanded or fair in the disclosure of these files.” He added, “It will be on us in Congress, and hopefully a bipartisan effort, to scrutinize and oversee this process.”\n \n\n   \n  The Republican rebellion against Trump on the Epstein files — an issue that obsesses parts of the Republican base — is one thing. But it’s unclear whether GOP lawmakers would risk the kind of vigorous oversight to which they’ve never subjected Trump to force his compliance with their law. Pressure from Epstein victims could be important in this regard.\n \n\n   \n  Several senators expressed hopes Wednesday that the administration would show good faith. Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley said he’d “be really surprised” if the DOJ refused to release all the required information “given the huge bipartisan” support for the measure. Missouri’s other senator, Eric Schmitt, said that “all the credible information that can be released should be released.” And Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois told CNN’s Manu Raju he hoped Trump wouldn’t “defy the act of Congress.”\n \n\n   \n  At the Justice Department, Bondi was asked why she had agreed to Trump’s  demand to investigate Democrats over Epstein  — which critics say was an archly political move — after arguing earlier this year that the evidence suggested no new probes were necessary.\n \n\n   \n  “Information. Information. There’s information that, new information, additional information,” Bondi said, while offering no clarity on the situation. And she repeatedly told reporters, “We will follow the law, we will continue to follow the law, while protecting victims and also providing maximum transparency.”\n \n\n   \n  This only underscored the great unknowns about what will happen next. Given the extraordinary movement in the saga so far, it seems impossible to believe that the files won’t come out, somehow, eventually. If the administration stalls or obstructs, it’s possible DOJ whistleblowers will emerge.\n \n\n   \n  Republican lawmakers keen to get to Trump’s right on the issue ahead of midterm elections might discover a political motive to join colleagues like  Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene  in pushing for transparency. GOP Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky has warned he’d be ready to read aspects of the evidence surrounding Epstein into the record of the House. And a delay could help Democrats weaponize the issue ahead of midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  The survivors will be waiting.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m hoping that they’re going to do the right thing and release everything,” Sharlene Rochard, a victim of Epstein’s abuse, told CNN’s Audie Cornish. “We just want proof that this happened to us. … And we want to help other girls (so) that — that this doesn’t happen again.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/politics/what-we-know-epstein-files","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"13:05:00Z","title":"Trump Signs Bill to Release Epstein Case Files; Public Access to Records Sparks Political and Legal Scrutiny","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has signed a bill directing the Department of Justice (DOJ) to release all records from the federal investigation and prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.

Here’s what we know about them \n       \n  By Haven Orecchio-Egresitz, Kara Scannell, Evan Perez, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:05 AM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump said on social media Wednesday he has  signed the bill  that directs the Justice Department to publicly release all records amassed by federal prosecutors during the sex trafficking investigation and prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein and his accomplice  Ghislaine Maxwell .\n \n\n   \n  The question of what is actually in those pages — and whether the public will ever see all of those documents — has become a headache for Trump and his administration.\n \n\n   \n  On November 12, the House Oversight Committee released  20,000 more pages  of records it received from Epstein’s estate, including emails in which Epstein insulted Trump and appeared to coordinate his response with Maxwell to a lawsuit brought by accuser Virginia Giuffre.\n \n\n   \n  At this point, though — six years after Epstein died in his New York prison cell — the public has gotten its hands on many records related to the disgraced financier and his alleged child sex trafficking ring.\n \n\n   \n  Some documents have come from the criminal trial and case file of Maxwell, Epstein’s onetime girlfriend. Others   came from Epstein’s estate, which provided the records to the House Oversight Committee in response to a subpoena.\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear what new information, if any, is stuffed in the boxes of evidence within the Justice Department.\n \n\n   \n  Some of it, such as records that detail the physical and sexual abuse of women and girls, may never be released.\n \n\n   \n  The Epstein files are made of over 300 gigabytes of data, paper, video, photographs, and audio that live within the FBI’s main electronic case management system, “Sentinel.” These records would include investigative reports and records from the FBI Miami field division’s original Epstein investigation. The bulk of the records would come from the second investigation carried out by the FBI’s New York Office, including memorandums about the investigation and potential targets, locations to be searched, records to be subpoenaed, and hundreds of pages of “302s,” which are the forms that FBI agents use to memorialize what witnesses, victims and suspects said in interviews with investigators.\n \n\n   \n  The case has continued to fascinate the public, years after Epstein’s death, due to his ties to powerful people. Politicians, including Trump, and celebrities have been publicly linked to Epstein for years — sometimes by appearing in flight logs or at events — and all have denied any wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  Epstein’s death by suicide before trial launched conspiracy theories and deprived many of his accusers a public airing of his conduct. Maxwell was convicted of sex trafficking minors following a four-week trial in 2021.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, after the most recent release of estate records announced he was asking Attorney General Pam Bondi  to investigate Epstein’s ties  to many other high-profile Democrats, including former President Bill Clinton, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman — as well as the bank JPMorgan Chase.\n \n\n   \n  Bondi later announced on X that  Jay Clayton , the US attorney in Manhattan, will lead the federal investigation.\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear whether opening a new criminal investigation would prevent the release of the highly anticipated Justice Department records.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we do and don’t know about the Epstein records:\n \n\n   \n    Grand jury\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department had asked federal judges in New York to unseal grand jury transcripts from Epstein and Maxwell’s criminal cases. Former federal prosecutors say the transcripts likely contain a miniscule amount of evidence from the investigations.\n \n\n   \n  Federal prosecutors in New York generally call law enforcement agents to testify before the grand jury to present just enough evidence they need to support an indictment. Other witnesses, including accusers, are rarely called in to testify before federal grand juries in New York.\n \n\n   \n  The judges overseeing the two cases in New York asked DOJ for more legal argument for why they should unseal grand jury material, which is rarely done. In August, two federal judges in New York  declined Justice Department requests  to unseal grand jury information in Epstein and Maxwell’s cases.\n \n\n   \n  A federal judge in Florida also denied DOJ’s request to unseal grand jury transcripts from its 2005 and 2007 investigations into Epstein, stating the department didn’t meet the legal hurdle to do so under the rules governing the circuit.\n \n\n   \n    Search warrants\n \n\n   \n  Federal prosecutors and the FBI obtained a trove of information during the searches of Epstein’s homes in Florida, New York and Little Saint James, Epstein’s private Caribbean island. That information is under the control of DOJ and is not blocked from public release by secrecy rules.\n \n\n   \n  FBI officials recovered thousands of nude and seminude photographs of young females, including at least of one minor, in a search of his Manhattan mansion in the days following his arrest. Binders of CDs containing the photos were seized. Agents used a saw to open a safe that had more than $70,000 in cash, 48 loose diamond stones, one as large as 2.38 carats, and a large diamond ring.\n \n\n   \n  They also collected documents from the New York home, including notes, messages with names and contact information for certain victims, and phone records.\n \n\n   \n  A search of Epstein’s private island was conducted days after he was found dead in a jail cell about one month after his arrest. By then the investigation had shifted its focus to any co-conspirators of Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  In February, the Justice Department provided an  index  of evidence it has. The index includes over two dozen computers, numerous hard drives, at least two cell phones, and four iPads. The index says there are boat trip logs potentially of who traveled to his private island — that information has not been made public.\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department does not release child pornography so those records would not be expected to be made public under any circumstance.\n \n\n   \n    Florida DOJ case file\n \n\n   \n  Federal prosecutors in New York obtained the investigative record from the earlier investigations into Epstein conducted by their counterparts in Florida in 2007 and 2009. Any of those records that were not covered by grand jury secrecy rules could be released.\n \n\n   \n    Civil lawsuits\n \n\n   \n  Much of the public record relating to Epstein has derived from civil lawsuits brought by accusers, some filed under their own names and others using Jane Doe pseudonyms. Judges have  ordered  the release of thousands of pages of documents, including depositions taken under oath.\n \n\n   \n  Among the famous names referenced in those  documents  are Trump, Clinton, Britain’s Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, French modeling scout Jean-Luc Brunel, American investor Glenn Dubin, and Leslie Wexner, the CEO of L Brands. Not all of them were accused of wrongdoing, and all of them have denied any wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  Two financial institutions, Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan Chase — where Epstein held bank accounts — also reached settlements with survivors and others.\n \n\n   \n  Records from a lawsuit brought by the US Virgin Islands, where Epstein owned Little Saint James, against JPMorgan Chase revealed details about Epstein’s  financial transactions  with Wall Street titans and his practice of withdrawing large amounts of cash. JPMorgan filed numerous suspicious activity reports with the Treasury Department flagging those transactions.\n \n\n   \n    Maxwell trial\n \n\n   \n  Maxwell’s four-week criminal trial was a public airing of her close relationship to Epstein and her role recruiting, grooming and at times participating in the sexual abuse of minors with Epstein. Four women testified about being sexually assaulted when they were minors.\n \n\n   \n  Epstein’s former pilot  testified  and identified people he saw on Epstein’s plane, including Trump, former Sens. John Glenn and George Mitchell,   Andrew, actor Kevin Spacey, and violinist Itzhak Perlman. The pilot said he never saw any wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  Gawker first published a copy in 2015 of Epstein’s so-called black book with names and phone numbers of his contacts. The Justice Department released a redacted version of it earlier this year as well as copies of the flight logs that were made public during Maxwell’s criminal trial.\n \n\n   \n  The release was criticized by some of Trump’s supporters because the information was already public — and did nothing to answer lingering questions.\n \n\n   \n    The estate\n \n\n   \n  In November, the House Oversight Committee released about 20,000 pages of documents it received from Epstein’s estate through a subpoena — materials the Department of Justice said it didn’t previously have access to.\n \n\n   \n  The documents included emails sent by Epstein. In one dated April 2, 2011, Epstein emailed Maxwell: “i want you to realize that that dog that hasn’t barked is trump.. REDACTED spent hours at my house with him ,, he has never once been mentioned. police chief. etc. im 75 % there.” GOP members of the House Oversight Committee  identified  the person as Giuffre. In one January 2019 email, Epstein wrote to author Michael Wolff: “trump said he asked me to resign, never a member ever. . of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop.” The emails also showed an apparent effort between Epstein and Maxwell to coordinate how they would respond to a lawsuit from Giuffre.\n \n\n   \n  The recent release   was the second time that the House Oversight Committee released documents from Epstein’s estate.\n \n\n   \n  In September, the committee put out a tranche of records, including a reported collection of birthday letters gifted to Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  The panel has been investigating the case and  had subpoenaed  the estate for documents as part of its probe.\n \n\n   \n  In a  social media exchange  last week, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche claimed that law enforcement did not have access to the estate documents at the time of his interview with Maxwell this summer.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details.

\nUpdated: \n        9:39 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The House on Wednesday night referred a Republican’s push to ​censure her fellow GOP colleague to the chamber’s Ethics Committee, beating back an effort to swiftly remove him from his committee assignments.\n \n\n   \n  Lawmakers voted 310-103 to send GOP Rep. Nancy Mace’s complaint against Florida Rep. Cory Mills to the committee, staving off another vote on the matter later this week. Mills had moved to refer it to the panel.\n \n\n   \n  The House Ethics committee revealed separately on Wednesday it voted to  establish  an investigative subcommittee to probe the various allegations that Mills is facing.\n \n\n   \n  Mace announced earlier in the day that she would seek to censure the Florida congressman and remove him from the House Armed Services and House Foreign Affairs committees, pointing to several controversies surrounding him. Though ultimately unsuccessful, seven Republicans – Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene, Anna Paulina Luna, Lauren Boebert, Harriet Hageman, Tim Burchett, Kat Cammack and Joe Wilson – joined with Mace to move it forward.\n \n\n   \n  Once considered rare in the House chamber, censure has been  used more frequently  in recent years and amounts to a significant rebuke of a member of Congress.\n \n\n   \n  The congresswoman’s attempt to reprimand Mills comes after House Democrats on Tuesday night  abandoned a separate censure measure  against the Florida Republican after a GOP effort to censure Democratic Del. Stacey Plaskett failed.\n \n\n   \n  Mills said in  a statement  Wednesday that there was no deal between lawmakers leading Democrats to pull the Tuesday resolution and that he and his team were surprised by the move.\n \n\n   \n  “Let me be perfectly clear, there was no backroom deal, no negotiation, and no quid pro quo of any kind that would’ve forced the Democrats to stand down on that vote against me. Anyone pushing that narrative is just wrong,” he said on X.\n \n\n   \n  Mace’s resolution to censure Mills points to individuals who served with Mills in the Army and dispute his version of events that led him to be recommended the Bronze Star, which was reported on by  NOTUS .\n \n\n   \n  Arguing that Mills’ conduct “brings discredit upon the House,” the resolution also outlines the  allegation of assault  against Mills and  accusations from  an ex-girlfriend that he threatened to release sexually explicit images and videos of her. The resolution also  mentions a judge’s order  that Mills is not to have any contact with that ex-girlfriend. Mills has denied any wrongdoing in both matters.\n \n\n   \n  Mace’s resolution also points to the  Office of Congressional Ethics’ findings  that Mills may have entered into or held contracts with federal agencies while serving as a member of Congress, which is in violation of House rules. It also cites the ethics office’s finding that Mills may have omitted required information in his financial disclosure statements and accepted excessive contributions to his campaign.\n \n\n   \n  “These allegations are far too serious to ignore,” Mace said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  “A member of Congress accused of assaulting women, profiting off federal contracts from his seat, and inflating or falsifying his service record has no business anywhere near national-security committees. This isn’t about partisan politics, it’s about protecting the integrity of this institution and the safety of women,” she added.\n \n\n   \n   This headline and story have been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/health/byheart-formula-recall-botulism-grows","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"21:37:00-05:00","title":"As infant botulism cases climb to 31, recalled ByHeart baby formula is still on some store shelves","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A growing number of infant botulism cases linked to ByHeart infant formula have prompted federal and state health officials to issue urgent warnings, despite a nationwide recall.

Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As cases of potentially deadly botulism in babies who drank ByHeart infant formula continue to grow, state officials say they are still finding the  recalled product  on some store shelves.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile the company reported late Wednesday that laboratory tests confirmed that some samples of formula were contaminated with the type of bacteria that has sickened more than 30 babies in the outbreak.\n \n\n   \n  Tests by an independent food safety laboratory found Clostridium botulinum, a bacterium that produces toxins that can lead to potentially life threatening illness in babies younger than 1, the company said on its website. ByHeart officials said they notified the U.S. Food and Drug Administration of the findings but did not specify how many samples were tested or how many were positive.\n \n\n   \n  “We are working to investigate the facts, conduct ongoing testing to identify the source, and ensure this does not happen to families again,” ByHeart said on its website.\n \n\n   \n  The FDA did not immediately respond to questions about the findings.\n \n\n   \n  The lab results come as investigators in at least three states found ByHeart formula still for sale even after the New York-based company recalled all products nationwide, officials told The Associated Press.\n \n\n   \n  At least 31 babies in 15 states who drank ByHeart formula have been hospitalized and treated for infantile botulism since August,  federal health officials said Wednesday.  They range in age from about 2 weeks to about 6 months, with the most recent case reported on Nov. 13.\n \n\n   \n  No deaths have been reported.\n \n\n   \n  In Oregon, nine of more than 150 stores checked still had the formula on shelves this week, a state agriculture official said. In Minnesota, investigators conducted 119 checks between Nov. 13 and Nov. 17 and removed recalled products from sale at four sites, an agriculture department official said. An Arizona health official also said they found the product available.\n \n\n   \n  Businesses and consumers should remain alert, Minnesota officials said in a statement. “No affected product should be sold or consumed,” they wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration conducted inspections at ByHeart manufacturing plants in Allerton, Iowa, and Portland, Oregon. No results from the inspections have been reported.\n \n\n   \n  California officials previously confirmed the germ that can lead to illness in an open can of ByHeart formula fed to a baby who fell ill.\n \n\n   \n   Infant botulism,  which can cause paralysis and death, is caused by a type of bacteria that forms spores that germinate in a baby’s gut and produce a toxin.\n \n\n   \n  Symptoms can take up to 30 days to develop and include constipation, poor feeding, a weak cry, drooping eyelids or a flat facial expression. Babies can develop weakness in their limbs and head and may feel “floppy.” They can have trouble swallowing or breathing.\n \n\n   \n  ByHeart had been manufacturing about 200,000 cans of formula per month. It was sold online or at retail stores such as Target and Walmart. A Walmart spokesperson said the company swiftly issued a restriction that prevented sale of the formula, removed the product from stores and notified consumers who had bought it. Customers can visit any store for a refund of the formula, which sold for about $42 per can.\n \n\n   \n  Federal and state health officials are concerned that some parents and caregivers may still have ByHeart products in their homes. They are advising consumers to stop using the product — including formula in cans and any singe-serve sticks. They also suggest marking it “DO NOT USE” and keeping it for at least a month in case a baby develops symptoms. In that case, the formula would need to be tested.\n \n\n   \n  The California health department operates the Infant Botulism Treatment and Prevention Program, which tracks cases and distributes treatment for the disease. Officials there have launched a public hotline at 833-398-2022, which is staffed with health officials from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. Pacific Standard Time.\n \n\n   \n  The new hotline was created after calls from hundreds of parents and caregivers flooded a different, longstanding hotline for doctors to discuss suspected infant botulism cases, officials said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/entertainment/jonathan-joss-murder-texas-man-indicted","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"23:00:00-05:00","title":"Texas Man Indicted on Murder Charge in Shooting of 'King of the Hill' Voice Actor Jonathan Joss","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A grand jury in Texas has indicted Sigfredo Ceja Alvarez, 57, on murder charges for the shooting of Jonathan Joss, a voice actor best known for voicing John Redcorn on the animated series 'King of the Hill' and for a recurring role on 'Parks and Recreation'.

The   corporate real estate manager and mother of three  vanished around New Year’s 2023 .\n \n\n   \n  Walshe pleaded guilty to the lesser charges without a deal with prosecutors, who “refuse to negotiate,” according to a defense filing, “unless negotiations included the indictment charging murder.”\n \n\n   \n  Walshe still faces one count of first-degree murder, which, if convicted, carries a mandatory life sentence without the possibility of parole.\n \n\n   \n  The eleventh-hour guilty pleas Tuesday came as a shock – and piqued interest in Walshe’s defense strategy.\n \n\n   \n  The decision to have Walshe plead guilty to those charges is an “incredibly bold move by the defense,” said Ronald Sullivan, a Harvard law professor, and will allow the defense to focus the trial solely on the question of whether the defendant killed his wife, potentially limiting what evidence the jury will see about Walshe’s disposal of Ana’s remains.\n \n\n   \n  “It may well be a good strategic move for the defense,” said Sullivan.\n \n\n   \n  It’s also possible Walshe’s attorneys are maneuvering for their client to face lesser homicide charges in the hopes of avoiding life without parole.\n \n\n   \n  Under Massachusetts law, Walshe cannot plead guilty to first-degree murder, so the commonwealth would have to change course and agree to Walshe pleading guilty to a lesser homicide charge like second-degree murder or voluntary manslaughter, which could allow for the possibility of parole.\n \n\n   \n  As of now, Walshe’s attorneys have made clear he isn’t admitting to Ana’s murder, despite his change of pleas.\n \n\n   \n  “Mr. Walshe is prepared to admit to the recitation of facts with respect to the indictment that the government just read in so far as it alleges he did impede and obstruct the criminal investigation into the disappearance of Ana Walshe. We obviously object, and he’s not admitting to … murder,” defense attorney Kelli Porges said in court Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Jury selection continues Thursday. Judge Diane Freniere has ordered the chosen panelists to stay off social media and avoid the news to reduce their risk of exposure to coverage of Walshe’s case.\n \n\n   \n    How we got here\n \n\n   \n  Ana Walshe’s employer reported her missing on January 4, 2023, sparking a search that drew national media attention. When local police went to the Walshe home, Brian Walshe told officers his wife had left early New Year’s Day to return to Washington, DC for a work emergency, and he hadn’t seen or heard from her since.\n \n\n   \n  Ana Walshe, who lived and worked in DC, commuted to the Boston suburbs to see her family on December 30, 2022. Her former boss joined the family to celebrate on New Year’s Eve around 8 p.m. and told authorities he left around 1 a.m. the following day.\n \n\n   \n  The guest didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary, and told authorities the couple seemed happy, according to court records. He is expected to testify at trial.\n \n\n   \n  Walshe reportedly called Ana’s employer, Tishman Speyer, on January 4, 2023, asking about his wife, court records say, but he never reported her missing to the police.\n \n\n   \n  Walshe was arrested on January 8, 2023, for misleading police in connection to Ana’s disappearance. He was charged with her murder later that month, and he has been in commonwealth custody since his arrest.\n \n\n   \n  The trial was originally slated to begin last month, on October 20. But Judge Freniere granted a delay for Walshe to undergo a mental health evaluation.\n \n\n   \n  Walshe’s attorneys lobbied for the delay after he was stabbed in jail in September, expressing concern their client could not adequately assist in his defense following the attack. He was deemed competent to stand trial last week after a 40-day stint in a state hospital.\n \n\n   \n    Possible defense strategies\n \n\n   \n  Walshe’s defense team has kept its strategy close to the vest, rarely commenting in the media about the case since his arrest almost three years ago.\n \n\n   \n  Following his guilty pleas Tuesday, Walshe faces up to 10 years in prison for the charge of misleading police – which could be enhanced up to 20 years if he is convicted of Ana’s murder. He also faces up to three years in prison for pleading guilty to the conveyance charge.\n \n\n   \n  Separately, Walshe is serving a 37-month prison sentence tied to a federal case from 2018, in which Walshe pleaded guilty to charges connected to selling forged Andy Warhol artwork. That sentence is set to run concurrently with his prison time for the state case connected to his wife’s death.\n \n\n   \n  Walshe faces a charge of first-degree murder for Ana’s death. But before the jury begins deliberating, his attorneys could ask the judge to allow the panel to consider less severe homicide charges.\n \n\n   \n  It’s possible the judge would not grant the request, Sullivan said. But she would consider “if there are enough facts to support something, or the absence of contradictory facts – like nobody was there.”\n \n\n   \n  Brian and Ana Walshe and their three young children are the only people said to have been in their home after ringing in the New Year. At this point, there is no publicly released evidence to suggest how Ana Walshe died. Her body  has not been found .\n \n\n   \n  The success of the defense case could hinge on testimony by Walshe himself, who could take the stand to offer the jury a narrative of what happened after their dinner guest left around 1 a.m. on New Year’s Day. For example, his lawyers could claim Walshe is innocent of murder because a terrible accident caused Ana’s death, or provide some justification to support a theory that Walshe caused her death in self-defense.\n \n\n   \n  “The problem with these sorts of defenses is that there’s no corroboration, and the alleged victim is unable to say anything, because the person is deceased,” said Sullivan, who was on the defense team that secured an acquittal in the 2017 double homicide case against one-time NFL player Aaron Hernandez.\n \n\n   \n  “If he testifies and says, ‘We got into an argument, you know, she pulled a knife on me, and I defended myself,’ he gets to testify to that because there are no contrary facts there,” he said. “And, you know, no one else was around, and that’s the evidence.”\n \n\n   \n  “The jury can credit it or not credit it,” Sullivan added, “but that’s on the record at this point.”\n \n\n   \n    What we might see at trial\n \n\n   \n  Sullivan indicated Walshe’s guilty pleas this week for misleading the police and improper conveyance of a body suggested the defense felt the evidence against their client was substantial.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re saying, ‘We will eat everything for which there’s such overwhelming evidence … We’re not going to win that fight so let’s just say we did it,’” Sullivan said, channeling the defense’s possible perspective.\n \n\n   \n  “Now all (they’re) fighting over is whether the defendant caused the death of the decedent,” Sullivan said. “So, one thing instead of several things.”\n \n\n   \n  Before Walshe changed his plea on two of the three counts in the indictment, prosecutors had said they could call up to 60 witnesses in the commonwealth’s case against him. But the commonwealth’s witness list will likely be trimmed down now that prosecutors don’t need to establish that Walshe disposed of his wife’s body and belongings or that he lied about his activities in the days after her disappearance.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors will likely show the jury some evidence of Walshe’s activities in the days after he claims he last saw his wife – but less than what would have been necessary to prove the charges to which he’s now pleaded guilty.\n \n\n   \n  “What the judge will likely do is say, ‘Well, some of that will come in because it goes to your state of mind,’ and the jury can reasonably infer consciousness of guilt from some of these actions,” Sullivan said.\n \n\n   \n  For instance, records and video surveillance put Walshe at Lowe’s and Home Depot on January 1 and 2, 2023, buying a bevy of cleaning supplies with cash. Walshe was also seen on video surveillance throwing several black bags into dumpsters.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators searched a dumpster at the complex where Walshe’s mother lived and recovered a number of items, including a Tyvek suit, a hatchet, a hacksaw and several items with  Brian and Ana Walshe’s blood  and DNA on them. They also found some of Ana’s belongings, including her Hunter boots, a Prada purse and her Covid-19 vaccination card.\n \n\n   \n  Ana’s blood was also found in the basement of the Walshe family home.\n \n\n   \n  Additionally, prosecutors have alleged Walshe used his 6-year-old son’s iPad for  dozens of Google searches  on the morning of January 1, 2023, like, “How to get blood out of hardwood floors,” “how to dispose of a body in the trash” and “how to stop a body from decomposing.”\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors have suggested Walshe had a financial motive to kill his wife, to cash in on life insurance policies that would help him pay restitution tied to his federal art fraud conviction.\n \n\n   \n  They have also said it’s fair to assume Walshe knew his wife was  having an affair  with a man in Washington, DC and suggested he could have been motivated to kill her because of the romantic entanglement. The jury is expected to see text messages between Ana and the man, who is also expected to testify.\n \n\n   \n  Walshe’s attorneys argue there is no proof he knew about the affair before Ana’s disappearance. But prosecutors say Walshe Googled the man days before Ana vanished.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/politics/ryan-wedding-justice-charges","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"19:34:00-05:00","title":"Federal officials unveil more charges against the former Olympic snowboarder accused of running international drug ring","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Federal officials, including U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, unveiled additional charges against Ryan James Wedding, a former Canadian Olympic snowboarder, accusing him of running a transnational drug trafficking ring that shipped cocaine from Colombia through Mexico into the U.S. and Canada.

Will he actually release them all? \n       \n  Analysis by Aaron Blake, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:56 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Both chambers of Congress passed legislation this week  forcing the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files , after President Donald Trump  capitulated  and blessed the bill. Trump said Wednesday night he had signed it.\n \n\n   \n  Now the question has quickly become: Will the Trump administration  actually release everything  the Justice Department has? Plenty of supporters of the legislation, including Republicans, have been quick to caution that this isn’t the end of the matter — that the White House might still have ways to get around that.\n \n\n   \n  “The real test will be: Will the Department of Justice release the files?” Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia said Tuesday. “Or will it all remain tied up in investigations?”\n \n\n   \n  GOP Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky — the co-sponsor of the effort in the House to force a vote on the issue — has warned of a “last-ditch effort” by the administration to block the release of the files.\n \n\n   \n  These lawmakers have good reason to worry, based on the administration’s actions and comments. Attorney General Pam Bondi on Wednesday declined to provide assurances beyond saying the administration would “follow the law.”\n \n\n   \n  But it’s also difficult to see how the administration could not follow through with releasing the files — at least without risking yet another major political fiasco.\n \n\n   \n    The administration’s suspicious moves\n \n\n   \n  First, some background. There is a clear path for the administration to try and hold some documents back.\n \n\n   \n  It goes like this:\n \n\n   \n  That’s a very convenient progression of events if your goal is to try and withhold documents.\n \n\n   \n  Suddenly an investigation that was completely exhausted and needed to be closed has some supposedly juicy new leads that are worth pursuing. And this happens right at the time when Trump needs just such a pretext to keep avoiding full disclosure.\n \n\n   \n  There are certainly other reasons for Trump to want those investigations – including making it look like it’s  other  people (ones often associated with Democrats) who have Epstein problems, and not him. (Neither Trump nor the people he asked to be investigated have been accused by law enforcement of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.)\n \n\n   \n    The administration has played games on this before\n \n\n   \n  There are other reasons to be suspicious about how the administration might handle this.\n \n\n   \n  For one, it’s  already been  shown to be playing games  on Epstein disclosures.\n \n\n   \n  When the situation first blew up in its face in July, the administration’s first big effort to quell the backlash was to push for judges to release grand jury materials. But as plenty of experts quickly noted, that was unlikely to actually shed much light for a host of reasons.\n \n\n   \n  Sure enough, it did not shed much light. But not only that; two judges suggested the administration was proactively creating a “diversion.” One said the move appeared “ aimed not at full disclosure but at the illusion of such .”\n \n\n   \n  Both noted the government had much more extensive information at its fingertips that it could release whenever it wanted to.\n \n\n   \n  Given this, it wouldn’t seem ridiculous to ask whether the administration might play games with whatever discretion it has — say, by releasing information that’s politically advantageous but withholding other information using the available justifications.\n \n\n   \n    Why Trump and Co. have said they didn’t want full disclosure\n \n\n   \n  And then there are the many things Trump and top officials have said warning about the dangers of full disclosure.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has repeatedly cited the need to protect “innocent” people – not just victims, but also people whose names turn up in the documents who did nothing wrong. Just corresponding with Epstein, for example, would not be a crime.\n \n\n   \n  “You got a lot of people that could be mentioned in those files that don’t deserve to be,” Trump said in August, “because (Epstein) knew everybody in Palm Beach.”\n \n\n   \n  The FBI’s July memo that announced it wouldn’t be releasing any new documents cited a desire “to protect victims” and “not expose any additional third-parties to allegations of illegal wrongdoing.”\n \n\n   \n  FBI Director Kash Patel in September testimony to Congress and elsewhere has suggested that part of the reason the administration has resisted full disclosure was to guard against releasing pornography. He also suggested that releasing more information could violate court orders.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not going to break the law to satisfy your curiosity,” Patel told a House Democrat.\n \n\n   \n  And House Speaker Mike Johnson on Tuesday argued that the Epstein bill could hurt people whose “names may be in these files, and they had nothing to do with this.” The Louisiana Republican also made an impassioned case that the bill did not adequately prevent the release of child sexual abuse material, despite a clause intended to do that.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson ultimately voted for the bill, saying he hoped the Senate would amend it. But Senate Majority Leader John Thune apparently didn’t share his concerns, allowing the bill to pass by unanimous consent without amendment.\n \n\n   \n  Given all of this — and given Trump’s clear reluctance for months to grant such disclosure, right  up until the moment the battle appeared lost  — you could see how the administration might want to at least preserve its options.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said Sunday that Congress “can have whatever they are legally entitled to,” but the phrase “legally entitled to” certainly looms large, for the reasons mentioned above.\n \n\n   \n    But not releasing would be a huge risk\n \n\n   \n  Even if the administration is reserving its options or intends to withhold significant documents, it’s hard to see how doing that could pass muster politically.\n \n\n   \n  For one, the legislation requires the withholding of documents related to active investigations to be “narrowly tailored and temporary.” Trump has more than three years remaining in his presidency; it’s difficult to see the administration withholding significant information for that long citing active investigations.\n \n\n   \n  For another, anything that’s redacted or withheld must include a written justification, and the administration must notify Congress about these categories of documents within 15 days. The legislation also requires the administration to give Congress an unredacted “list of all government officials and politically exposed persons” included in the materials.\n \n\n   \n  In other words, it could be pretty easy to piece together if the administration is hiding extensive amounts of information. What’s more, attempting to do that could risk an even bigger backlash than the administration has already seen, from even its own base.\n \n\n   \n  That doesn’t mean the administration wouldn’t  attempt  to withhold documents. Its handling of this matter  has been baffling  throughout.\n \n\n   \n  But if it did, that would be among the most desperate and politically risky things the administration has done — and at a time when it can’t really keep taking such hits.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/politics/arctic-frost-provision-senators-house-vote","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"20:02:00Z","title":"House Moves to Repeal Controversial ‘Arctic Frost’ Provision That Allows GOP Senators to Seek $500,000 Payouts","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. House of Representatives unanimously voted to repeal a controversial provision in a government funding law that allows senators to sue the Justice Department for up to $500,000 when their phone records are seized without notice.

‘Arctic Frost’ provision that allows GOP senators to seek $500,000 payouts \n       \n  By Ellis Kim, Alison Main, Manu Raju, Morgan Rimmer, Ted  Barrett, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:02 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The House on Wednesday unanimously moved to repeal a controversial provision in the government funding law that allows senators to sue the Justice Department for up to $500,000 when their phone records are seized without their knowledge.\n \n\n   \n  The provision, included in the legislation that ended the historic shutdown, requires senators be notified when federal investigators access their phone records, with some exceptions. If they’re not notified, the lawmakers can sue the federal government for up to $500,000 in damages for each violation.\n \n\n   \n  House members publicly wary of the measure voted 426-0 to nullify the provision. But its future remains in doubt in the Senate, where Majority Leader John Thune had added it to the bill at the request of several members of his conference.\n \n\n   \n   Tucked into one of the appropriations bills , the language comes after Senate Republicans released FBI records related to an investigation called “Arctic Frost,” which pertained to the fake elector scheme from 2020 where Donald Trump allies pressured GOP electors to register Electoral College votes for Trump from states that former President Joe Biden won.\n \n\n   \n  It’s caused bipartisan furor on Capitol Hill and spotlighted a rare divide between the top Republican leaders. House Speaker Mike Johnson said he was blindsided by the measure, while Thune has resolutely stood behind it.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re striking the provision as fast as we can, and we expect the Senate to move it,” Republican Rep. Chip Roy of Texas told CNN Tuesday. “We believe there’s a fairly sizable growing majority over there that believes that they should strike it.”\n \n\n   \n  Some of the senators whose phone records were seized as part of Arctic Frost have tried to distance themselves from the legislation and  say they won’t seek  monetary damages.\n \n\n   \n  Missouri GOP Sen. Josh Hawley called it a “bad idea.”\n \n\n   \n  “I’m all for accountability. I mean, I had my phone tapped, so I’m all for accountability, don’t get me wrong, but I just, I think taking taxpayer money is not the way to do it. The way to do it is tough oversight,” he told reporters earlier Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for another member, Sen. Dan Sullivan, told CNN last week he does not plan on suing and is supportive of the House effort to repeal the provision.\n \n\n   \n  But at least one targeted senator is looking to reap gains.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Lindsey Graham on Wednesday said he plans on suing DOJ in his case for “far more” than $500,000, and advocated for expanding the measure to include private citizens.\n \n\n   \n  “You want to make sure that people who are going to issue subpoenas in the future against private citizens to get their phone records without a court order, I mean, without a warrant, have to think twice, and if the government doesn’t pay, you’re going to get more of this,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Mike Rounds, who was not one of the senators swept in Arctic Frost, explained that the measure was meant to “send a message to the administration that this can’t happen” in the wake of the news of then-special counsel Jack Smith’s subpoenas, though he predicted that many GOP senators would be “open for a reconsideration” depending on how the House approaches the issue.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Steve Daines, a Thune ally, said he doesn’t think House’s measure could pass the Senate, arguing that Smith’s move to obtain phone records of nine GOP lawmakers with grand jury subpoenas in his January 6 investigation was a “massive overreach.”\n \n\n   \n  “My name is not on the list, so I don’t benefit from this. This seems to be a strong pushback. I think the provision that Leader Thune put in there was appropriate, and I stand by his leadership,” he added.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/politics/cherfilus-mccormick-indicted-fema-funds-theft","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"19:59:00-05:00","title":"Rep.

Elizabeth Wolfe, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:21 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A US appeals court has temporarily blocked an order curtailing federal immigration enforcement in Chicago, arguing the lower court judge overstepped when she imposed strict and wide-reaching restraints on how agents can interact with protesters and journalists.\n \n\n   \n  A three-judge panel for the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals on Wednesday granted the Trump administration’s emergency request to pause the order issued by US District Court Judge Sara Ellis earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  In an incremental victory for the Trump administration, the appeals panel concluded  Ellis’s order  was “too prescriptive,” writing in their decision that she is “impermissibly infringing” on the separation of powers between the executive branch and the courts.\n \n\n   \n  This is yet another twist in what has been a tense legal showdown in Chicago between the administration — which desires wide latitude to use force on protesters who it says are violently hindering its immigration agents — and the judge — who has expressed deep skepticism over the government’s presentation of the facts in court.\n \n\n   \n  For months, plaintiffs’ attorneys have complained to Ellis that federal agents have indiscriminately and without warning used chemical agents and other riot control measures against protesters — including members of the clergy — and reporters.\n \n\n   \n   Ellis’ order , issued November 6, prohibited several methods of force, including pulling or shoving; required federal agents to give warnings before deploying tear gas or other riot control weapons; and stipulated that almost all agents must wear clear identification and body cameras.\n \n\n   \n  The judge also ordered the government to turn over extensive use-of-force records and other internal records.\n \n\n   \n  But the appeals panel criticized the scope of Ellis’ order, saying it is so detailed it “resembled federal regulation.” They wrote that the order is so sweeping, it applies to almost any law enforcement personnel within the executive branch.\n \n\n   \n  “The district court’s order enjoins an expansive range of defendants, including the President of the United States, the entire Departments of Homeland Security and Justice, and anyone acting in concert with them,” the panel wrote in its decision.\n \n\n   \n  The order comes one day before Ellis is set to issue her written opinion in the case that has required a high-level Border Patrol agent, Greg Bovino, to  appear before her  in a downtown Chicago federal courtroom.\n \n\n   \n  However, the pause of Ellis’ order is only temporary as it considers the Trump administration’s larger appeal.\n \n\n   \n  “Do not overread today’s order,” the judges wrote, noting that they have a ream of facts to consider. “Those findings may support entry of a more tailored and appropriate preliminary injunction that directly addresses the First and Fourth Amendment claims raised by these plaintiffs.”\n \n\n   \n  At times, Ellis has chided ICE officials and federal attorneys in open court, saying their statements often “lack credibility.”\n \n\n   \n  The judge expressed particular skepticism over a confrontation between federal agents and protesters in which DHS said use of force was justified because Bovino was hit in the head with a rock thrown by a demonstrator. Video did not support the claim and “ defendant Bovino admitted that he lied ,” the judge said.\n \n\n   \n  In its written decision, the appeals panel appeared to question whether the plaintiffs suing the Trump administration still have a strong enough claim, as the federal presence in Chicago has tapered off while federal agents  flood into Charlotte, North Carolina, and prepare to enter New Orleans .\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration is battling on multiple legal fronts as it attempts to carry out what it hopes will be a history-making national immigration crackdown.

One of the incidents it highlights involves an unnamed patient at the Virtua Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Camden, New Jersey. The patient was pronounced dead and the network started the process to recover their organs, the letter says, but soon after the recovery process began, the person “reanimated.”\n \n\n   \n  The procurement team called the network’s chief executive officer to find out what to do. Witnesses told the committee that the CEO instructed the NJTO staff on site to “proceed with recovery,” according to the letter. “However, hospital staff intervened, and recovery did not move forward.”\n \n\n   \n  Neither the hospital nor the procurement organization responded to CNN’s requests for comment.\n \n\n   \n  The committee described the case as “shocking” and “alarming” and said several whistleblowers told investigators that documents with regard to details about the case were deleted or manipulated.\n \n\n   \n  The committee’s letter also alleges that the New Jersey Sharing Network misused documents to tell patients’ families it had authority to remove organs, even if the patient was not currently listed as an organ donor on their driver’s license or, in some cases, had withdrawn their permission to donate; may have procured and thrown out hundreds of organs just to meet federal metrics; and gave organs to people out of sequence on the transplant list.\n \n\n   \n  “This is unacceptable,” the letter says. “The organs procured by every [organ procurement organization] across the country belong to the individuals on the waitlist who are ranked and matched using medical criteria. They do not belong to the OPOs, and it is not NJTO’s role to pick winners and losers on the transplant waiting list.”\n \n\n   \n  The letter also says the organization has made misleading statements to Congress throughout the investigation.\n \n\n   \n  “These allegations raise questions about whether NJTO should keep its tax-exempt status and highlights the need for potential legislative reforms,” the letter says.\n \n\n   \n  The House Ways and Means Committee has asked the New Jersey organization to send additional documents including any complaints it has received, documents from the head of the organization and staff communications, as well as any more unredacted documents related to the patient in the Camden case.\n \n\n   \n  The letter is the latest development in the committee’s focus on the nation’s organ procurement groups.\n \n\n   \n  In July,  the committee sent a letter  to the Indiana Donor Network with regard to its use of private jets for non-mission charter flights. It also demanded documents from the Miami-area Life Alliance Organ Recovery Agency, and  after its investigation , the US Department of Health and Human Services moved to decertify the organization – essentially shutting the operation down – in September.\n \n\n   \n  The investigation found unsafe practices, staff shortages and paperwork errors,  according to HHS . Agency Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said at the time that the move was meant as a “clear warning” to other donor organizations.\n \n\n   \n  In September, the committee sent a letter to the Network for Hope, a Kentucky-based organ procurement organization, that demanded documents related to practices it considered unsafe.\n \n\n   \n   In one case  four years ago in Richmond, Kentucky, a man says he woke up on the operating table while a recovery team was shaving his chest to take his organs.\n \n\n   \n  Witnesses say the hospital staffers were pressured by people within the organization to continue with the procedure, but a local surgeon refused to continue the operation when she saw that the man wasn’t dead. The Kentucky Attorney General’s Office has also been investigating the case.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/sport/football-nfl-kris-boyd-jets-shooting","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"19:26:00-05:00","title":"Jets Cornerback Kris Boyd Begins to Breathe on His Own After Midtown Shooting","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Kris Boyd, a 29-year-old cornerback with the New York Jets, was shot in the abdomen in midtown Manhattan on Sunday, November 16, 2025, just after 2 a.m., and was taken to Bellevue Hospital where he remained in critical but stable condition.

people pleaded guilty Wednesday to terrorism-related charges after they were accused of supporting antifa in a  July shooting  that wounded a police officer outside a Texas immigration detention center.\n \n\n   \n  The charges brought by the Justice Department followed President Donald Trump signing an order that designated the decentralized movement known as antifa  as a domestic terrorist organization . Trump has blamed antifa for political violence.\n \n\n   \n  FBI Director Kash Patel has previously said the charges in Texas are the first time a material support to terrorism charge has targeted antifa. A police officer was injured in the July 4 shooting near Dallas outside the Prairieland Detention Center, where federal prosecutors say an antifa cell carried out an attack that included gunfire and fireworks aimed toward the facility.\n \n\n   \n  Antifa, short for “anti-fascists,” is not a single organization but rather an umbrella term for left-leaning militant groups that confront or resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations.\n \n\n   \n  Nathan Baumann, Joy Gibson, Seth Sikes, Lynette Sharp and John Thomas each entered guilty pleas to one count of providing material support to terrorists in federal court in Fort Worth. They face up to 15 years in prison at sentencing.\n \n\n   \n  Sharp’s attorney, Erin Kelley, said entering the plea was “step one in a long process” before the sentence is actually determined. Lawyers for the other four defendants either did not immediately return messages Wednesday or comment.\n \n\n   \n  Cases against others also charged in the shooting remain ongoing.\n \n\n   \n  According to court documents, one member of the group outside the facility yelled “get to the rifles” and then opened fire as officers responded, striking an Alvarado Police Department officer in the neck area. He fell to the ground but was able to return a few shots. Prosecutors say more rounds were then fired at the wounded officer and an unarmed DHS correction officer.\n \n\n   \n  Court documents say Gibson, Baumann and Sikes were among those who were present the night of the attack and were arrested shortly after, while Sharp and Thomas were among those who helped the accused shooter avoid arrest until July 15.\n \n\n   \n  The shooting took place as  Trump  ’s administration has ramped up deportations. Days after that shooting, a man with an assault rifle  fired dozens of rounds  at federal agents and a U.S. Border Patrol facility in McAllen near the Mexico border, injuring a police officer. Authorities shot and killed the attacker.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/us/woman-fire-chicago-train-blue-line","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"18:18:00Z","title":"Federal terrorism charge filed against man who allegedly set woman on fire on Chicago train","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 50-year-old man named Lawrence Reed of Chicago was charged with a federal terrorism offense for allegedly setting a 26-year-old woman on fire on a Blue Line L train on Monday night.

James Comey’s vindictive-prosecution hearing \n       \n  By Hannah Rabinowitz, Holmes Lybrand, Katelyn  Polantz, Casey Gannon, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:10 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The hearing Wednesday morning in the case against former FBI Director James Comey ended with a revelation by prosecutors and a conundrum: if a full grand jury never reviewed the final set of charges handed up against Comey, are they void?\n \n\n   \n  The question arose after a shocking back and forth where prosecutors conceded that instead of presenting a new indictment to the grand jury after it declined to approve one of three counts, interim US Attorney Lindsey Halligan simply brought an altered version, omitting the rejected count, to the magistrate’s courtroom for the grand jury’s foreperson to sign.\n \n\n   \n  Her admission sent shockwaves through the courtroom on Wednesday, where attorneys were gathered to argue a separate legal issue of whether Comey was charged only because of President Donald Trump’s animus toward him.\n \n\n   \n  What will happen to the criminal case was not immediately clear. Judge Michael Nachmanoff, despite appearing exasperated and taking several seconds of silence to take in what the prosecutors admitted, did not give away whether he viewed the issue as a procedural or fatal error.\n \n\n   \n  Nachmanoff did not make any rulings from the bench, saying that the issues before him were too  “weighty”  to immediately decide.\n \n\n   \n  But the judge ask the Justice Department to address Wednesday their legal interpretation of what happened with the grand jury, and the revelation is likely to play into another ongoing fight in the case where defense attorneys have asserted that federal investigators and top prosecutor Halligan mishandled the case.\n \n\n   \n  In a brief filed Wednesday evening, the Justice Department defended Halligan’s grand jury presentation and said the case should not be dismissed. The final indictment was reviewed by the grand jury foreperson and another representative — and then explained on the record in open court that it was reflective of the grand jury vote, the Justice Department wrote.\n \n\n   \n  The former FBI director has pleaded not guilty to lying during congressional testimony.\n \n\n   \n    The stunning admission\n \n\n   \n   Nachmanoff called on Halligan  — Trump’s handpicked US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia who secured the indictment against Comey by herself — to explain exactly what grand jurors did, or did not, see.\n \n\n   \n  Halligan appeared frustrated as she confirmed that only the foreperson and one other juror – not the entire grand jury – saw the final indictment. In the brief exchange, she tried to answer the judge before he finished asking his question and concluded the exchange with a terse “OK.”\n \n\n   \n  The back and forth lasted about one minute.\n \n\n   \n  Nachmanoff also trained his attention on a different prosecutor on the case, Tyler Lemons, and asked him to explicitly confirm that the final document was never presented to the grand jury.\n \n\n   \n  “I wasn’t there, but that is my understanding,” Lemons said.\n \n\n   \n  After the hearing concluded, people connected with the prosecutors’ office told CNN that they weren’t sure  how problematic Halligan’s admission will be  for the case. Some may consider it a clerical error that could be fixed, while others see a possibility it could be the fatal flaw in the case, as Comey’s team initially argued on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors have six months to “cure” an indictment that was dismissed over legal issues, according to the  Justice Department manual , even if the statute of limitations has expired – as is the case for Comey’s charges.\n \n\n   \n  Comey’s attorney Michael Dreeben said that, given the testimony of the prosecutor, “no indictment was returned.”\n \n\n   \n  And even if it is a legal problem, a grand jury document flub may pale in comparison to other issues that have arisen in the case and are still playing out in court, including regarding what Halligan told the grand jurors about Comey’s rights, the evidence and the law.\n \n\n   \n    Grand jury transcripts\n \n\n   \n  The issue over the indictment could also aid in defense attorneys’ efforts to gain access to the grand jury transcripts, an issue that is currently before a magistrate judge in the same courthouse.\n \n\n   \n  That judge initially allowed Comey’s team to have access to the grand jury material, finding in his own review that “the record points to a disturbing pattern of profound investigative missteps.”\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors quickly asked the magistrate judge to pause the order so that they could file an appeal, which the magistrate judge allowed.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Ms. Halligan was not a puppet’\n \n\n   \n  The hearing focused primarily on defense attorneys’ efforts to have the case dismissed because, they argue, it was brought at the direction of Trump and born from his animosity toward Comey.\n \n\n   \n  “The president of the United States has caused the executive branch to prosecute a perceived enemy,” Dreeben began his arguments.\n \n\n   \n  Dreeben, citing a  social media post  from Trump addressed to the attorney general and calling for the prosecution of Comey and other political enemies, argued that the president has gone after the former director to “punish Mr. Comey for speaking out against him.”\n \n\n   \n  Lemons pushed back, arguing that Comey was making “inferential leaps” in arguing that the case is selective and vindictive.\n \n\n   \n  The prosecutor said that there is “no proof” that Halligan took Trump’s social media post “as a charge.”\n \n\n   \n  “Ms. Halligan was not a puppet,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Still, the judge questioned “what independent examination could she have made” in the few days between her appointment and the charges being brought against Comey.\n \n\n   \n    DOJ refuses to say if a memo declining to prosecute Comey exists\n \n\n   \n  Nachmanoff also pressed Lemons on whether previous prosecutors who worked on the case before Halligan’s appointment had submitted a memo recommending that Comey not be prosecuted.\n \n\n   \n  Lemons told the judge that someone in Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche’s office told him he couldn’t disclose  “privileged” information  without their permission, which included the existence of any memo.\n \n\n   \n  “At this point, my position would be, whether there was a declination memo, is privileged,” Lemons said, adding that “I don’t know in the world of documents there is a declination memo.”\n \n\n   \n  Nachmanoff challenged the assertion, pushing Lemons to eventually say that “someone in the Deputy Attorney General’s office” had instructed him not to say anything.\n \n\n   \n  Asked why, Lemons demurred, conceding briefly that he has “reviewed” draft memorandums – both declination and prosecution memos – and other internal communications, but declined to give additional details.\n \n\n   \n  “I hope you understand that I am trying to answer your questions,” Lemons said.\n \n\n   \n    Justice Department defends Halligan’s work\n \n\n   \n  Federal prosecutors in their Wednesday brief defended Lindsey Halligan’s handling of the grand jury proceedings against Comey.\n \n\n   \n  At the end of Wednesday’s hearing, Nachmanoff instructed the parties to review a case in Washington, DC, from the late 1960s that dealt with similar grand jury issues.\n \n\n   \n  But in that case, prosecutors argued in their brief, “the grand jury never saw any version of the eventual indictment.”\n \n\n   \n  “In this case, the grand jury was provided the proposed Indictment, deliberated, and determined that probable cause existed to believe that the defendant had committed the crimes charged in two counts,” prosecutors said.\n \n\n   \n  The grand jury did not hand up an indictment on a third charge prosecutors attempted to bring against Comey.\n \n\n   \n  After their vote, according to prosecutors, only the foreperson and one other grand juror remained when a final version of the indictment – that omitted the third charge that was rejected – was signed by the foreperson.\n \n\n   \n  “Only the numbering of the counts (i.e., proposed Count Two became Count One, and proposed Count Three became Count Two) and the paragraphs differ,” prosecutors said in their brief.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors argue the case doesn’t need to be dismissed “given that the grand jury was presented with the two counts on which it voted to return an indictment and in fact voted upon those counts.”\n \n\n   \n  “Grand Jury foreperson, as the representative of the Grand Jury, endorsed the revised two count Indictment by signing it and explaining on the record in open Court that the Indictment reflected the vote of the Grand Jury,” prosecutors continued.\n \n\n   \n  A magistrate judge earlier this week made the rare decision to order prosecutors to give Comey’s team all grand jury materials, including transcripts and recordings of the secret process.\n \n\n   \n  That judge, William Fitzpatrick, said his review of those transcripts and recordings suggested that the grand jury could have been shown privileged evidence or given false instructions by the attorney who presented the case, Lindsey Halligan.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors strongly pushed back against that, too, arguing Fitzpatrick had quoted portions of Halligan’s

the record directly disproves,” prosecutors wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “The U.S. Attorney did not misstate the law, the grand jury was not misled, and the transcript shows a routine, regular presentation of the indictment,” they said.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article

Here’s what we know \n       \n  By Taylor Romine, Priscilla Alvarez, Rebekah Riess, Dianne Gallagher, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:44 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Rheba Hamilton was sipping coffee   on her porch Saturday morning as she watched the two workers she‘d hired begin    draping her front yard tree with lights in a quiet Charlotte, North Carolina, neighborhood.\n \n\n   \n  Suddenly, a gray minivan – doors already ajar –  made a sharp stop at the corner . Two federal   agents emerged and asked the landscapers for their papers. Hamilton joined the men on the lawn and started recording. Shortly after, the agents retreated.\n \n\n   \n  The abruptness of the incident took Hamilton by surprise,  mirroring the shock local officials and residents  felt as Charlotte became the latest city caught up this year in a string of targeted immigration actions.\n \n\n   \n  What began in Charlotte quickly spread to other cities in the state as the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration crackdown continues to expand nationally.  Gregory Bovino , the top Border Patrol official charged with enforcement operations, is expected to head to New Orleans in coming weeks.\n \n\n   \n  Here is where things stand:\n \n\n   \n    Next city to be targeted may already be in enforcement crackdown’s sights\n \n\n   \n  While the spotlight has been focused on North Carolina’s most populated city, immigration enforcement action has started to spread to other areas of the state and is expected to reach New Orleans within weeks.\n \n\n   \n  Bovino – who for many has become the face of the crackdown – is expected to arrive in New Orleans, where he once served as chief patrol agent, the first week of December, according to two sources familiar with the planning.\n \n\n   \n  The Department of Homeland Security is expected to deploy 250 agents in Louisiana – roughly in line with the number of agents  sent to other cities to assist Bovino, the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump has previously floated New Orleans as a destination for his federal crackdown, saying in an Oval Office meeting this year his administration was “making a determination.”\n \n\n   \n  As immigration enforcement is expected to spread further throughout the South, Customs and Border Protection agents  were seen Tuesday in North Carolina’s Wake and Durham counties , Raleigh Mayor Janet Cowell said during a City Council meeting. The counties are home to Raleigh and Durham, two of the state’s other major cities and part of the Research Triangle, with Chapel Hill.\n \n\n   \n  “We are just encouraging everyone, if you feel unsafe or you see something that you think is illegal, to please call the Raleigh Police Department or your local jurisdiction and to stay safe,” Cowell said.\n \n\n   \n  Residents of Cary, North Carolina, west of Raleigh, have  also reported seeing federal agents  at hospitals, restaurants and construction sites, Mayor Harold Weinbrecht told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Protesters  gathered at Moore Square in downtown Raleigh  on Tuesday night, holding American flags and signs printed with slogans like, “No fear no hate, no ICE in our state” and “Respect due process,” aerial footage from CNN affiliate WRAL shows.\n \n\n   \n    DHS arrests more than 250 people in Charlotte\n \n\n   \n  Over 250 people have been arrested in immigration raids in Charlotte since the weekend, DHS said in an update Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Among those arrested are “numerous criminal illegal aliens with extensive immigration and criminal histories, including domestic violence, assault, breaking and entering, larceny, and driving while intoxicated,” a Wednesday DHS statement said.   \n \n\n   \n  DHS Secretary Kristi Noem  said Tuesday  the Charlotte operation was based on previous investigative work, specifically citing “a high number of child abuse, trafficking, neglect type of instances that we had identified over our work there.”\n \n\n   \n  Two men were  federally charged in Charlotte  Tuesday for allegedly using their vehicles in separate incidents to assault federal officers who were conducting immigration enforcement, according to Russ Ferguson, the US Attorney for the Western District of North Carolina. The charges don’t stem from protests in the area, the US attorney said.\n \n\n   \n  A woman was also charged Wednesday after she allegedly assaulted a federal agent outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Charlotte, the US attorney’s office  said in a news release . The 44-year-old woman is accused of “grabbing the officer’s shoulders and attempting to jump on the officer’s back” while the officer was trying to arrest another person Sunday, the release said.\n \n\n   \n    Attorneys are turning to creative measures to find their clients\n \n\n   \n  The uptick in immigration detentions in Charlotte and the absence of information from the federal government has prompted some immigration attorneys to get creative in how they track clients being held in ICE custody.\n \n\n   \n  One of those attorneys is Gigi Gardner, a North Carolina immigration attorney, who said her client was detained on Tuesday after attending a routine ICE check-in.\n \n\n   \n     Her client – who she didn’t name, citing safety and client confidentiality concerns – has been in the US for roughly 40 years and has checked in with ICE annually, Gardner said.\n \n\n   \n     After failed attempts to get into the ICE office late last week due to a high volume of people, Gardner’s client checked in Tuesday, when he was detained, she said. Gardner and her client’s wife tracked his whereabouts by using the location of his AirPods, she said.\n \n\n   \n  They tracked his movements to  Folkston, Georgia, where there’s an ICE detention center . The AirPod’s battery appeared to die and it wasn’t until Wednesday morning that the man called his wife to say he had been transferred again – this time, to Jacksonville, Florida, Gardner said.\n \n\n   \n  “Nothing has changed. He has an attorney. And he was unable to contact me. They haven’t sent me any paperwork. They haven’t told me where he is. And they still haven’t told me where he is,” she said, referring to ICE.\n \n\n   \n    Charlotte community takes some tips from Chicago\n \n\n   \n  While the targeted immigration raids were unexpected to many of those in the Charlotte community, they were ready to meet the moment.\n \n\n   \n  People throughout Charlotte  were seen Monday  using many of the tactics employed in Chicago – including watching for raids, blowing warning whistles and carrying signs advising people of their rights.\n \n\n   \n  The support from residents across the city is palpable. Flags from Honduras, Colombia and Mexico are seen adorning cars and hanging from homes and buisinesses, a stark difference from what could be seen as recently as a week ago.\n \n\n   \n  Their vigilance comes as many businesses across the city have closed their doors, fearing their customers will be a target. About  half the mom-and-pop businesses  the community development organization  CharlotteEast  works with have closed their doors at some point, despite all of them being owned by US citizens, Executive Director Greg Asciutto said Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  “From strictly an economic standpoint, it’s pretty catastrophic right now,” Asciutto said, comparing current closures to the first week of the coronavirus pandemic in the area.\n \n\n   \n  A Colombian bakery open for 28 years closed its doors Saturday after men in tactical gear   chased and tackled people outside the shop. A program for immigrant and refugee children  was also suspended until further notice  Monday after Border Patrol was active at their site.\n \n\n   \n  A local laundromat is taking a different approach, with  the owner locking their doors  while customers are inside in an attempt to keep them safe.\n \n\n   \n  In Raleigh, more than 600 volunteers signed up in the overnight hours to help others travel within the city when the community became aware that federal agents intended to come to the area Tuesday, Siembra NC, a statewide immigrant worker organizing group, said.\n \n\n   \n  “By early morning, trained volunteers were dispatched throughout Raleigh as safety patrols ready to assist neighbors in getting to school and work safely,” a release from the organization said.\n \n\n   \n    About 20% of students absent from Charlotte-area schools Monday\n \n\n   \n  More than  30,000 students were absent  from Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools on Monday, about 20% of the district’s enrollment. CNN has reached out to the district to see how attendance was affected Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  The district  issued a statement Sunday night  saying no immigration activity had happened on their campuses and noting leaders hadn’t been informed of impending action. There were no reports of immigration enforcement on their campuses on Monday or Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  “CMS follows all federal and state laws protecting students’ right to a public education. The U.S. Supreme Court guarantees that all children, regardless of immigration status, have the right to attend public school,” CMS Assistant Communications Officer Tom Miner said in a statement to school district families.\n \n\n   \n  High school students in the district  staged a walkout Tuesday morning  to protest immigration enforcement in the city. Several hundred students gathered around the edge of a football field at East Mecklenburg High School, many wearing black and holding flags, an aerial Getty photo of the demonstration showed.\n \n\n   \n    North Carolina governor and local leaders denounce the raids\n \n\n   \n  Many Democratic leaders across North Carolina have denounced the raids.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve reached out to the White House,”  North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein said Tuesday.  “We haven’t gotten any word. We’re not hearing directly from Customs and Border Patrol, so we don’t know for sure where they’re going, how long they’ll be here, where else they’re going.”\n \n\n   \n  Stein went on to criticize the tactics used by federal agents, saying they are “not promoting safety in our communities.”\n \n\n   \n  In the county where Charlotte is located,   the Mecklenburg Board of County Commissioners unanimously passed a resolution Tuesday to affirm constitutional protections and express support for the immigrant community.\n \n\n   \n  “This is not an issue of policy. This is an issue of morality,” Chair Mark Jerrell said. “It’s immoral to profile, to tear families apart. It’s not right to have people living in fear … This board declared tonight that we don’t condone it. We won’t stand for it.”\n \n\n   \n  While the governor and local leaders vocally oppose the federal action, North Carolina’s Republican Party  praised the immigration enforcement  operation, saying “the need is real.”\n \n\n   \n  Though some people are overwhelmed with the intensity of the moment, Councilmember LaWana Mayfield  said during a City Council committee meeting Monday  that this moment is “an opportunity to show up for each other.”\n \n\n   \n  “Get to know your neighbors, get their phone numbers, go to their back door, bring them over to your house so the children can feel safe, let the kids play together, because they don’t need to be going through all of this,” Mayfield said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/us/anna-kepner-carnival-cruise-death","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"16:51:00Z","title":"Speculation intensifies in the death of a Florida high schooler on a cruise","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The mysterious death of 18-year-old Anna Kepner, a high school cheerleader from Temple Christian School in Titusville, Florida, on the Carnival Horizon cruise ship has triggered international speculation and a federal investigation.

In a presentation to their guests, students detailed how they use the technology for class projects – and the rules governing that usage.\n \n\n   \n  Children’s literacy was front and center for the second lady as Trump and Vance played games and did arts and craft projects with younger children at nearby DeLalio Elementary School. Trump donned a headband with an index card as she played a reading game with the children.\n \n\n   \n  Vance offered praise to her counterpart during remarks to service members at the conclusion of their trip.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m honored to introduce our first lady, who shares my deep gratitude for your sacrifices to secure our country’s safety and its well-being,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, Vance added, is “committed to bettering our nation by ensuring that every child feels loved, supported, and prepared for the future.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear how much the two women have substantively engaged with each other behind the scenes, though the Vances hosted the Trumps at the Naval Observatory for dinner last month, spending about an hour and a half at the vice presidential residence. The first lady’s office declined to respond to CNN’s inquiries about their relationship.\n \n\n   \n  But in a sign of warm relations, Usha Vance joined Melania Trump in her cabin on the flight to North Carolina, according to a source familiar with the matter. That invitation was not extended for one of her predecessors, former second lady Karen Pence, who sat instead with her staff when traveling with the first lady during the first Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n  Trump and Vance appeared friendly in their engagements throughout the day, sharing a handshake on stage in the hangar and telling reporters they had a “very nice visit” upon their departure.\n \n\n   \n  Vance, a  former high-powered lawyer , is navigating the delicate dynamic of being a top figurehead in a new administration alongside the first lady, who has taken  her own approach  to the spousal role.\n \n\n   \n  The second lady has joined her husband, who appears to have higher political ambitions, on key trips across the country and abroad, all while transitioning three small children to a life under the microscope and becoming a public figure with a quiet platform of children’s literacy and early childhood development.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, meanwhile, took a more hands-off approach to her role, spending most of her time in the first months of the president’s second term away from the White House in New York or Palm Beach, Florida, often disappearing for weeks between public appearances.\n \n\n   \n  She has a much smaller staff compared with her first term. Though she was an active steward of White House preservation during her husband’s first term, she has left many of those decision to the president this time around,  culminating dramatically  last month with the demolition of  the East Wing , which has served as headquarters for presidential spouses since the Carter administration.\n \n\n   \n  But recently, the first lady has returned to public view with a series of engagements on a range of topics.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has held events advocating for children’s well-being and artificial intelligence safety, launching a  global coalition  on the issue called “Fostering the Future Together.” She joined the president as he signed an executive order last week on a (unrelated) “Fostering the Future” initiative for children in foster care. And she back-channeled with Russian President Vladimir Putin on releasing allegedly abducted Ukrainian children with  mixed results .\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, Trump honored the Marine Corps’ 250th anniversary as she looked ahead to new challenges facing the US military.\n \n\n   \n  “Technology is changing the art of war. Predictably, AI will alter war more profoundly than any technology since nuclear weapons,” she said during her remarks in the hangar.\n \n\n   \n  She continued, “Artificial intelligence will take center stage in the theater of war – it already plays a meaningful role on the battlefield. But of course, it is the Marine who will always play the most critical role in realizing mission success.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear why the first lady is choosing to reemerge now, and her office declined to respond to questions on whether this might portend a more active role. Trump recently indicated that the multimillion-dollar deal she signed with Amazon for an  eponymous documentary  highlighting her return to the White House had taken up much of her attention this year.\n \n\n   \n  “The silver screen and I have been in deep conversation lately. You may have heard the news — I produced a new film with Amazon MGM named ‘Melania,’” Trump said earlier this month in remarks accepting Fox Nation’s “Patriot of the Year” award.\n \n\n   \n  The “Melania” documentary, which will be released in January, is being directed by Brett Ratner and marks the filmmaker’s first major project since 2017, when he was  accused of sexual misconduct  by numerous women. Ratner has denied the allegations.\n \n\n   \n   This headline and story have been updated with additional reporting from Trump and Vance’s visit.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/politics/dissent-texas-redistricting-case-judge-jerry-smith-all-about-eve","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"17:13:00Z","title":"‘I dissent,’ judge says 16 times in 100-page broadside against colleagues in Texas redistricting case","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a high-profile redistricting case involving Texas’s newly drawn congressional map, federal judge Jerry Smith issued a 100-page dissent against the majority decision authored by U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Brown and joined by David Guaderrama, accusing them of violating judicial restraint and good faith by releasing their ruling before Smith had completed his dissent.

He said the “’obvious reason’” behind the decision to redraw the state’s congressional maps “’of course, is partisan gain,’” and that Brown was wrong to conclude that state lawmakers are “more bigoted than political.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s all politics, on both sides of the partisan aisle. George and Alex Soros have their hands all over this,” Smith wrote, referring to the billionaire father and son who have supported liberal causes.\n \n\n   \n  The judge also repeatedly invoked California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, who successfully pushed lawmakers and voters in the Golden State to redraw its maps to counteract the Texas effort.\n \n\n   \n  “Gavin Newsom took a victory lap in Houston to celebrate the Democrat redistricting win with Proposition 50,” he wrote. “That tells you all that you need to know – this is about partisan politics, plain and simple.”\n \n\n   \n  Smith also argues that Brown wrongly described the standard the court needed to use when deciding whether to block the map quickly, writing, in part, that his colleague understated how strong the challengers’ arguments against the redrawn districts needed to be.\n \n\n   \n  “With his creative formulation of the preliminary-injunction standard, Judge Brown is intentionally misleading at best and disingenuously false,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Sprinkled throughout the stinging opinion issued by Smith are more insults but also lighter, zippier lines, including references to the 1950 movie “All About Eve.”\n \n\n   \n  “’Fasten your seatbelts. It’s going to be a bumpy night!’” Smith’s dissent began.\n \n\n   \n  He closed with: “Darkness descends on the Rule of Law. A bumpy night, indeed.”\n \n\n   \n  Texas has appealed the ruling. But should it stand, it will be a major setback for Trump and Republicans, who had made Texas the  centerpiece of a national campaign  to redraw maps ahead of the midterms.\n \n\n   \n    ‘The outrage speaks for itself’\n \n\n   \n  \n \n\n   \n  In his four-page statement accompanying the 100-page dissent, Smith describes in detail the timeline that precipitated the release of the majority decision, penned by Brown and joined by District Judge David Guaderrama, an appointee of former President Barack Obama.\n \n\n   \n  Smith says that Brown told him last week that the majority intended to issue their ruling in coming days because they believed they could not wait any longer due to an election law principle that says courts should avoid making last-minute changes to how elections are run before the contests get underway.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, Smith said, Brown wrote him a note in the morning that said: “I’m sorry that we can’t wait on your dissent. Purcell compels us to get the ruling out as soon as we possibly can. It turns out that’s today.” The majority opinion was issued shortly thereafter.\n \n\n   \n  “This outrage speaks for itself,” Smith wrote in his statement. “Any pretense of judicial restraint, good faith, or trust by these two judges is gone. If these judges were so sure of their result, they would not have been so unfairly eager to issue the opinion sans my dissent, or they could have waited for the dissent in order to join issue with it. What indeed are they afraid of?”\n \n\n   \n  The majority’s decision to release the ruling Tuesday without the dissenting opinion attached, Smith said, diminished “the impact of the dissent and the public’s access to it.”\n \n\n   \n  “In the interest of justice, one can hope it is only a Pyrrhic victory,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  “Judges in the majority don’t get to tell a dissenting judge or judges that they can’t participate,” Smith wrote. “If the two judges on this panel get away with what they have done, it sets a horrendous precedent that ‘might makes right’ and the end justifies the means.”\n \n\n   \n  The judge’s statement skewering Brown ended on an ominous note.\n \n\n   \n  “When I was … newer on the bench, a friend asked me, ‘Now that you’ve been a judge for a few years, do you have any particular advice?’” Smith wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “I replied, ‘Always sit with your back to the wall.’”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Ethan Cohen contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/politics/bessent-trump-federal-reserve-powell","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"15:58:00-05:00","title":"Trump Teases He’ll Fire Bessent If Fed Doesn’t Cut Interest Rates","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump threatened to fire Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent if the Federal Reserve does not cut interest rates, demonstrating growing political pressure on monetary policy.

If you don’t get it fixed fast, I’m going to fire your ass,” the president said, smirking, during a speech at a US-Saudi investment forum at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC.\n \n\n   \n  However, it won’t be easy for Trump to bend the Fed to his will: The Fed makes its decisions on interest rates independently, based solely on economic data, meaning that firing Bessent would simply not lead to lower rates. Several Fed officials have also said in recent public comments that they remain concerned about inflation, leaning against further rate cuts.\n \n\n   \n  The president has been a frequent critic of the central bank and its chair,  Jerome Powell , throughout his second term as the Federal Reserve declined to cut interest rates this year until September. But he acknowledged on Wednesday that Bessent has been privately urging him not to fire Powell, whom Trump has repeatedly said he wants out of the job.\n \n\n   \n  Trump appeared to suggest that Bessent has been the “voice of reason,” while Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick “is a little bit more for firing” Powell.\n \n\n   \n  “Please don’t fire him. He’s got three months to go,’” the president said, appearing to repeat what Bessent has told him of Powell.\n \n\n   \n  “I want to get him out,” Trump said, reenacting their conversation.\n \n\n   \n  “I think Howard is a little bit more for firing him. I think Howard would say get him the hell out of there,” the president said\n \n\n   \n    Bessent as a “voice of reason”\n \n\n   \n  Trump frequently threatened to fire Powell during the spring, but the president eventually backed off from those threats after his closest advisers warned of the chaos in financial markets that could ensue if he were to do so,  CNN previously reported .\n \n\n   \n  Wednesday is the first time Trump has appeared to suggest that Bessent, who has become well-respected on Wall Street, was one of the voices urging him to keep Powell in his role until the end of his term.\n \n\n   \n  “Markets have really appreciated having Bessent around,” James Ragan, director of wealth management research at DA Davidson, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s been very much the voice of reason in the Trump administration, so I don’t like to hear him challenging Bessent,” he added.\n \n\n   \n    The Fed’s decision making and Trump’s demands\n \n\n   \n  Fed officials say their decisions on rates are guided solely by what economic figures show, and they strive to achieve their dual mandate of full employment and stable prices. That’s precisely why Trump’s frequent demands for lower rates have largely fallen on deaf ears — and may continue to do so.\n \n\n   \n  The Fed’s rate-setting committee, led by Powell as chair, began to lower interest rates in September for the first time in nine months, and delivered another quarter-point rate cut at its latest meeting last month. October’s rate cuts bring the benchmark lending rate to  its lowest in three years. \n \n\n   \n  The Fed has been lowering rates to prevent unemployment from surging, though officials are divided over whether they should continue to lower rates with  inflation still above their 2% target  and Trump’s tariffs still threatening to push inflation higher.\n \n\n   \n  Minutes from the Fed’s October meeting underscored the heated debate among the policymakers of the world’s most powerful central bank, with several stating that they prefer to stand pat in December: “Many participants suggested that, under their economic outlooks, it would likely be appropriate to keep the target range unchanged for the rest of the year,” the minutes said.\n \n\n   \n  Investors currently see a roughly 68% chance of the Fed holding rates steady next month, according to futures, compared to a 32% chance of another cut.\n \n\n   \n  New data on the labor market’s health in September, which was delayed due to the government shutdown, is due on Thursday. Signs that the labor market is falling off a cliff would prompt the Fed to continue to lowering borrowing costs heading into next year, though officials are keeping a close eye on inflation.\n \n\n   \n  How the Fed makes its decisions is no secret, but that hasn’t stopped Trump from repeatedly demanding aggressive rate cuts and lambasting Powell, whose term ends in May.\n \n\n   \n  Trump could name Powell’s successor as early as December, and there are  five people on his short list , according to Bessent, who has led the search. But even if Trump names a loyalist who would call for aggressive rate cuts, that still wouldn’t do the trick because the Fed chair only gets one vote and they cannot unilaterally veto what the majority of the Fed’s 12-person rate-setting committee decides.\n \n\n   \n  The new Fed chair, whoever it may be, would have to persuade their colleagues to go along with any plans to lower rates aggressively, and at the moment, only one Fed official said he believes that is the right approach: Fed Governor Stephen Miran, who is taking an unpaid leave from his job as a top White House economist to temporarily serve on the Fed’s board.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/tech/nvidia-earnings-ai-bubble-fears","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"17:00:00-05:00","title":"Nvidia Beats Earnings Expectations, Even as Bubble Concerns Mount","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Nvidia reported a significant 62% year-over-year revenue growth to $57 billion and a 65% increase in profits to $31.9 billion in the October quarter, surpassing Wall Street projections.

concerns mount \n       \n  By Clare Duffy, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:25 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Nvidia posted strong revenue and profits that exceeded Wall Street’s expectations Wednesday. The closely watched result could prompt a sigh of relief across the stock market following growing concerns about an artificial intelligence bubble.\n \n\n   \n  Nvidia’s sales grew 62% year-over-year to $57 billion in the October quarter, ahead of the $54.9 billion Wall Street had projected, signaling that demand for AI chips remains strong even as more questions emerge about whether returns from the technology will keep up with the pace of infrastructure investments. It posted profits of $31.9 billion, up 65% from the year-ago quarter and also slightly above expectations.\n \n\n   \n  “Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement, a message that echoes his earlier arguments that fears of an AI bubble are overblown.\n \n\n   \n  The company also posted stronger-than-expected sales guidance of around $65 billion for the fourth quarter, another indicator that the AI spending spree isn’t slowing anytime soon.\n \n\n   \n  Nvidia’s stock ( NVDA ) jumped 3.4% in after-hours trading immediately following the report.\n \n\n   \n  Nvidia has become both the backbone and an emblem of the AI boom, with much of the industry’s technology running on its chips. The  world’s most valuable public company  has also been central to this year’s stock market rally — it accounts for roughly 8% of the S&P 500 and its deals with other tech firms have helped fuel their stocks, too — meaning that nearly all investors and 401k holders  stand to be impacted  by Wednesday’s results.\n \n\n   \n  Fears of an AI bubble ahead of Nvidia’s report had caused volatility across the stock market as investors adopted a risk-off attitude and dumped assets like bitcoin and AI stocks.\n \n\n   \n  Shares of other tech stocks — including Meta, Microsoft, Amazon and Google — were in the green in after-hours trading following the Nvidia report, underscoring the chipmaker’s impact on the wider market.\n \n\n   \n  “This answers a lot of questions about the state of the AI revolution, and the verdict is simple: it is nowhere near its peak, neither from the market-demand nor the production–supply-chain sides for the foreseeable future,” Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com, said in emailed commentary following the report.\n \n\n   \n  At the heart of the bubble concerns are the circular funding deals that Nvidia and other chipmakers have formed with AI companies, such as a  $100 billion investment  in OpenAI in exchange for chip purchases that was announced in September. OpenAI Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar further raised eyebrows earlier this month when  she suggested  that the government should backstop the debt tech companies are taking on to build AI infrastructure — a statement the company later tried to walk back.\n \n\n   \n  But the fears haven’t stopped Nvidia from making more such deals. Anthropic on Monday  committed  to buying $30 billion in computing capacity from Microsoft Azure, running on Nvidia chips, in exchange for an investment in the AI lab from both tech giants.\n \n\n   \n  Huang has repeatedly batted down bubble concerns. At the company’s GTC AI conference last month, he told CNN that people’s willingness to pay for AI tools indicates that the technology is “profitable,” even if most tech firms are now reinvesting the money they’re earning into new infrastructure.\n \n\n   \n  The fact that Nvidia’s business continues to hum isn’t surprising given that tech giants such as Meta, Microsoft, Amazon and Google  all indicated  in their most recent earnings reports that they plan to continue hiking their AI infrastructure spending. Huang also  laid out  at GTC the company’s plans to get its technology into even more areas of life — from cell phone towers to self- driving cars.\n \n\n   \n  Nvidia Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress sought to reinforce that AI is generating returns in the company’s earnings call by taking the unusual tack of ticking through highlights from the chipmaker’s partner’s recent financial reports. At Meta, for example, AI recommendation systems are leading to “more time spent on apps such as Facebook and Threads;” Anthropic recently noted it expects to earn $7 billion in annual revenue this year; and Salesforce’s engineering team is 30% more efficient now that it’s using AI for coding, she said, ﻿among a long list of corporate customers she rattled off.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/americas/brazilian-amazon-gangs-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"17:51:00-05:00","title":"Gangs Expand to Nearly Half the Towns in the Brazilian Amazon, Report Finds","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Criminal gangs, including the Red Command and First Capital Command, have expanded their operations across nearly half of the municipalities in the Brazilian Amazon, reaching 344 out of 772, a 32% increase from the previous year.

nearly half of the region’s municipalities, according to a report published Wednesday by a prominent nonprofit organization.\n \n\n   \n  The growth of these crime groups in the region, where  UN climate talks  are currently taking place, is driving violence and threatens the preservation of the world’s largest tropical rainforest, according to the Brazilian Forum on Public Safety.\n \n\n   \n  Organized crime groups are now active in 344 municipalities out of 772, or some 45%, the nonprofit said. That’s a jump of 32% from last year’s report when they were present in 260, and more than double from two years ago.\n \n\n   \n  The Red Command drug trafficking gang has more than doubled its presence since 2023. The notorious crime group was the target of Rio’s  most lethal  police operation ever on October 28, when 121 people died.\n \n\n   \n  The raid in Rio sparked a nationwide discussion on organized crime in Brazil, and on Tuesday evening the country’s lower house approved a bill that proposes an increase in the severity of sentences for gang membership.\n \n\n   \n  “These crime groups are seeking to diversify and maximize their illegal activities,” David Marques, one of the report’s authors, told The Associated Press. “In addition to drug-trafficking, there’s been an increase of extortion and environmental crimes,” such as illegal logging and mining, he said.\n \n\n   \n  With more criminal gangs come territorial disputes, weapons and violence, Marques said. There were 8,047 slayings in the region in 2024, a rate of 27.3 killings per 100,000 inhabitants, 31% higher than the national average, the group said.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to Red Command and its main rival, First Capital Command, there are some 17 other criminal gangs operation in the region, also including Venezuela’s  Tren de Aragua , a target of  military attack s by U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration.\n \n\n   \n  The Rio-based Red Command has dominated river routes in coordination with Peruvian and Colombian cartels. Drugs flow to strategic ports such as Manaus, Santarem, Barcarena, Macapa and Belem – where Brazil is hosting COP30.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the Sao Paulo-based First Capital Command has focused on using clandestine airstrips in remote areas that are tied to illegal mining, the group said.\n \n\n   \n  The group’s director, Renato Sérgio de Lima, said in a statement that combating organized crime in the Amazon will require a focus on alternate ways of developing the region besides “predatory exploitation of resources.”\n \n\n   \n  The bill approved by the lower house on Tuesday would boost sentences for certain crimes when the defendant also is a member of a gang, for example increasing the 6-to-20-year recommended sentence for intentional homicide to 20-to-40 years. It also would allow authorities to seize assets even before a case’s final judgement and oblige gang leaders to carry out their time behind bars in maximum-security federal prisons.\n \n\n   \n  President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has lamented on X that the legislation has been weakened because of proposed budget cuts to the federal police. The bill is now headed for the Senate, where it is likely to be modified, though some compromise version is likely to pass the congress eventually because crime has become a top concern of voters.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/tech/saudi-arabia-us-chips-ai-race","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"17:23:00Z","title":"Why the world’s richest man and the CEO of the most valuable company met with Saudi officials","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia has launched a major AI strategy during his first U.S. visit in years, announcing large-scale partnerships with American tech firms including Elon Musk’s xAI, Amazon Web Services, and Nvidia.

November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Saudi Arabia is strengthening its ties with American AI companies — announcing a flurry of new joint ventures worth billions of dollars. The country seeks to make its mark in the AI industry as its de facto leader, Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman, makes his first visit to the United States in years.\n \n\n   \n  Humain —  an AI company backed by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund  — announced a series of partnerships with prominent American tech companies, including xAI, Cisco, AMD and Qualcomm, during a US-Saudi investment forum in Washington on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Saudi Arabia is trying to further firm up ties with the United States and shift its economy  away from oil . For American companies, the Middle Eastern country answers three urgent   problems for AI expansion: funding, space and cheap energy.\n \n\n   \n  Elon Musk announced at Wednesday’s event that xAI,  his AI company , will develop a huge data center in Saudi Arabia alongside Humain. The planned 500-megawatt data center would be xAI’s first large-scale center outside of the United States, and the partnership will see xAI’s  Grok chatbot  deployed throughout Saudi Arabia.\n \n\n   \n  “The future of intelligence will be engineered through massive and efficient compute combined with the most advanced AI models,” Musk said in a statement on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  The center will be powered by chips from Nvidia, whose founder, Jensen Huang, sat alongside Musk and Saudi Arabian Minister of Communications and Information Technology Abdullah Alswaha at Wednesday’s panel. No further details about the partnership were revealed.\n \n\n   \n  “This is how we walk the talk in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia in partnership with the US,” Alswaha said. “Yesterday, the president and his royal highness announced the AI strategic framework and partnership. Today we’re going big with Elon and Jensen, so thank you for those opportunities.”\n \n\n   \n  Bloomberg  reported  on Wednesday that the United States is set to approve the first sales of advanced AI chips to Humain.\n \n\n   \n  At the event, Alswaha announced a 100-megawatt data center for Amazon Web Services “with a gigawatt ambition” that also will be powered by Nvidia’s infrastructure. AWS said in a statement that it plans “to provide, deploy and manage up to 150,000 AI accelerators” in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia.\n \n\n   \n  As AI companies expand, their huge data centers need  space  and  massive energy sources . Many data centers are being built in the United States, including  xAI’s Colossus in Memphis . However, there’s fear that China will beat out the United States when it comes to  energy production  to power AI systems. Saudi Arabia could help with that — it has much easier access to the space and energy needed to power these massive ventures.\n \n\n   \n  The investment from Saudi Arabia also plays a major part in Prince bin Salman’s redemption in the United States, following being labeled a “pariah” by  President Joe Biden  for his role in the killing of  Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi .\n \n\n   \n  During his Oval Office visit on Wednesday, Prince bin Salman claimed the country will be investing $1 trillion dollars in the United States, a substantial increase from the previously announced $600 billion investment in May. The comments surprised even President Donald Trump in the moment, although the timeline of the investments is not clear.\n \n\n   \n  “You’re saying to me now that the $600 billion will be $1 trillion?” Trump said to Prince bin Salman in the Oval Office. “Good. I like that very much.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2023/01/10/us/ana-walshe-brian-missing-timeline","dateOfPublication":"2023-04-05","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00Z","title":"China Enacts Sweeping Fintech Regulations to Ensure Financial Stability and Data Security","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On April 3, 2023, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) announced a series of new financial regulations targeting fintech companies, emphasizing data privacy, cybersecurity, and anti-money laundering (AML) compliance.

Here’s a timeline of the case \n       \n  By Eric Levenson, Holly Yan and Lauren del Valle, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:21 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Ana Walshe, a 39-year-old mother of three, was first reported missing by her coworkers in Washington, DC on January 4, 2023.\n \n\n   \n  Her husband, Brian Walshe, initially told investigators that he had last seen her on New Year’s Day when she left their Cohasset, Massachusetts, home for the airport.\n \n\n   \n  But prosecutors say his statements to police were misleading, and they argue he secretly killed his wife, dismembered her body and disposed of her remains. As evidence, they pointed to a  series of chilling Google searches  on his son’s iPad, including “How long before a body starts to smell” and “How to clean blood from wooden floor.”\n \n\n   \n  Brian Walshe, now 50, has  pleaded not guilty to murder , but in a surprise move just as jury selection was about to start on November 18, 2025, he  pleaded guilty  to misleading police and improper conveyance of a human body.\n \n\n   \n  His murder trial subsequently started later that day.\n \n\n   \n  To better understand the case, CNN assembled a timeline of the couple’s movements in recent years, including his history of legal trouble, strains on their marriage and his actions in the critical days around his wife’s disappearance.\n \n\n   \n    September 2018\n \n\n   \n  Brian Walshe’s father, Dr. Thomas Walshe, died in September 2018 and left nothing to Brian, leading to a protracted legal fight over his estate, according to court documents filed in Plymouth Probate and Family Court in Massachusetts.\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Walshe’s will noted he was not in contact with Brian, to whom he bequeathed only his “best wishes” and “nothing else” from his estate, according to photographs of the document attached to court documents. Brian Walshe unsuccessfully contested the will and suggested his father’s signature on the document was a possible forgery.\n \n\n   \n  Affidavits in opposition to Brian Walshe’s petition said he had been estranged from his father and detailed years of alleged swindling and manipulation.\n \n\n   \n  “He had a severe falling out with his son,” wrote Andrew Walshe, the estate’s executor and one of Dr. Walshe’s nephews. “Brian had ran off with a significant amount of his money; he had had almost zero contact with Brian R. Walshe over the last ten plus years.” \n \n\n   \n    2018\n \n\n   \n  Brian Walshe was indicted on federal fraud charges in October 2018 for allegedly selling fake Andy Warhol artwork online, according to court documents.\n \n\n   \n  FBI investigators alleged Brian or Ana Walshe used her eBay account to sell the paintings in November 2016, less than a year after they were married. The complaint does not charge Ana Walshe with wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  The document also alleged Brian Walshe took real artwork from a friend to sell, but never did. He also did not compensate the friend for the art, prosecutors alleged.\n \n\n   \n  Walshe pleaded not guilty to wire fraud, interstate transportation for a scheme to defraud, possession of converted goods and unlawful monetary transaction in November 2018.\n \n\n   \n    2021\n \n\n   \n  In April 2021, Brian Walshe  pleaded guilty  to three of the four federal counts in exchange for a recommended sentence of incarceration, supervised release, fines, restitution and forfeiture, court documents show. He also agreed to either return the artworks or pay for them.\n \n\n   \n  As part of pre-sentencing probation, Brian Walshe was placed on monitoring and house arrest. He can request to leave home but must detail the specific locations, times and reasons.\n \n\n   \n    November 2022\n \n\n   \n  Ana Walshe  was having an affair with a man  in DC and spent Thanksgiving with him in Dublin, Ireland, according to court documents. The man told investigators he had been in a relationship with Ana Walshe for several months, the documents state.\n \n\n   \n    December 2022\n \n\n   \n  Brian Walshe began to suspect his wife was having an affair, according to  Norfolk County Assistant District Attorney Greg Connor .\n \n\n   \n  “He was routinely visiting the Instagram page of one of her male friends. And on December 26th, his mother – with his input and direction – obtained and hired a private investigator to surveil Ana Walshe in Washington, DC.”\n \n\n   \n  Brian Walshe’s defense attorney disputes the allegation that the husband suspected his wife was having an affair.\n \n\n   \n    December 27, 2022\n \n\n   \n  Brian Walshe Google searched, “What’s the best state to divorce for a man,” according to prosecutors.\n \n\n   \n    December 28, 2022\n \n\n   \n  During dinner with a friend in DC, Ana Walshe “became uncharacteristically upset and told her friend she believed that Mr. Walshe was going to be incarcerated as a result of his federal case, and that she was prepared to leave him and take the children to Washington, DC,” according to Connor.\n \n\n   \n    December 30, 2022\n \n\n   \n  Ana Walshe flew home to Massachusetts to be with her family during for the holiday weekend and was not expected to return to DC until January 3, prosecutor Connor said.\n \n\n   \n    December 31, 2022\n \n\n   \n  The Walshes hosted a New Year’s Eve dinner at their home with a friend named Gem, Brian Walshe told police, according to an affidavit.\n \n\n   \n  Brian and Ana Walshe went to bed shortly after the friend left around 1 or 1:30 a.m., he told investigators, according to the affidavit. He also told police that Ana Walshe said she had a work emergency and needed to fly to Washington for her job the next morning.\n \n\n   \n    January 1, 2023\n \n\n   \n  Brian Walshe told police that the morning of New Year’s Day, Ana Walshe “got ready and kissed him goodbye and told him to go back to sleep,”  the affidavit states. She usually took an Uber, Lyft or taxi to the airport and left between 6 and 7 a.m., according to the affidavit.\n \n\n   \n  According to prosecutors, Brian Walshe made a  series of Google searches  on his son’s iPad, including “How long before a body starts to smell,” “10 ways to dispose of a dead body if you really need to,” “How long for someone to be missing to inherit,” and “How to clean blood from wooden floor.”\n \n\n   \n  Walshe told police a babysitter arrived in the afternoon, and he left home to get groceries at about 3 p.m., the affidavit states. \n \n\n   \n  He told police he then went to see his mother around 4 p.m. in Swampscott, about an hour drive from Cohasset, but did not have his cell phone and got lost – making the trip longer than usual, the affidavit states. \n \n\n   \n  He said he left his mother’s home within about 15 minutes of arriving to run errands for her at Whole Foods and CVS. Brian Walshe told police he eventually returned home to Cohasset at about 8 p.m., according to the affidavit.\n \n\n   \n  But prosecutors say the evidence from January 1 tells a far different story than what Walshe claimed. \n \n\n   \n  Brian Walshe had told the babysitter and a family friend that he had lost his phone, Connor said.\n \n\n   \n  But “subsequent analysis of his phone determined that it was actually plugged in the morning of January 1,” Connor said. \n \n\n   \n  “However, while his phone stayed at the house, the oldest child’s cell phone did not.”\n \n\n   \n  Cell phone data from January 1 showed the oldest child’s device had traveled to two stores. Surveillance video showed Brian Walshe walking into those same stores by himself, Connor said.\n \n\n   \n  Around 5:30 p.m., surveillance video showed Walshe and his vehicle going to a dumpster in the parking lot of a liquor store and disposing of items before returning to his car, the prosecutor said. \n \n\n   \n  Afterward, cell phone data shows the device traveled to the dumpster at an apartment complex where Brian Walshe’s mother lived. \n \n\n   \n  The phone then traveled to a Lowe’s store, where Walshe is also seen on surveillance footage. He purchased five 5-gallon buckets, a hacksaw, 48 terry cloth towels, a full-coverage suit, 200 disposable rags, trash bags and cleaning products, Connor said. \n \n\n   \n  The phone then traveled to a CVS store, where Walshe was also seen on surveillance video purchasing “13 different types of hydrogen peroxide,” the prosecutor said.\n \n\n   \n    January 2, 2023\n \n\n   \n  Ana Walshe’s cell phone pinged in the area of their Cohasset home on January 1 and 2, prosecutor Lynn Beland said.\n \n\n   \n  Brian Walshe told investigators that he took one of his children for ice cream at a juice bar in Norwell on January 2 while the babysitter watched his two other kids, the affidavit states. Investigators confirmed this trip occurred, the affidavit states.\n \n\n   \n  He went to Home Goods and purchased three rugs, prosecutors said.\n \n\n   \n  Just after noon, prosecutors said, Brian Walshe made several more Google searches: “Hacksaw best tool to dismember,” “Can you be charged with murder without a body,” and “Can you identify a body with broken teeth.”\n \n\n   \n  According to surveillance video, Brian Walshe traveled to a Home Depot in Rockland wearing a surgical mask and gloves and made a cash purchase, the affidavit states. There, Walshe bought $450 of cleaning supplies, including mops, a bucket, tarps, goggles, a hatchet and baking soda, Beland said.\n \n\n   \n    January 3, 2023\n \n\n   \n  Brian Walshe allegedly made more Google searches, including “What happens to hair on a dead body,” “What is the rate of decomposition of a body found in a plastic bag compared to on a surface in the woods,” and “Can baking soda mask or make a body smell good,” prosecutors said.\n \n\n   \n  Cell phone data tracked Brian Walshe’s whereabouts to an apartment complex in Abington at 4:27 p.m., according to prosecutors. Surveillance video shows he exited his car with a heavy garbage bag and put it into a dumpster, prosecutors said.\n \n\n   \n  At 4:48 p.m., he traveled to another apartment complex in the same town, and at 5:10 p.m. he went to an apartment complex in a different town where he again discarded items in a dumpster, prosecutors said.\n \n\n   \n  These garbage bags were taken away and incinerated by the time police tracked them down, prosecutors said.\n \n\n   \n    January 4, 2023\n \n\n   \n  Brian Walshe visited Home Goods and TJ Maxx to buy towels and bath mats and visited Lowe’s to buy squeegees and a trash can, prosecutors said.\n \n\n   \n  Ana Walshe’s employer, the real estate company Tishman Speyer, called police to report she did not show up for her job, according to Cohasset police logs.\n \n\n   \n  According to Brian Walshe’s defense attorney, he called her workplace to ask whether they knew of her whereabouts before the employer called police.\n \n\n   \n  Cohasset Police went to Ana Walshe’s home for a well-being check, according to an affidavit. Brian Walshe spoke with investigators multiple times and provided the above timeline for his actions and whereabouts on January 1 and 2.\n \n\n   \n  Police noticed that Brian Walshe’s vehicle had the back seats down and a plastic liner in the back of the car, according to prosecutors.\n \n\n   \n    January 5, 2023\n \n\n   \n  Police noticed that the plastic liner was gone from Brian Walshe’s vehicle, and the carpet of the car showed fresh vacuum streaks, prosecutors said. Brian Walshe told police he threw the liner in the trash.\n \n\n   \n  Cell phone data showed Brian Walshe went to Swampscott and traveled to the corner of an apartment complex where there is a dumpster, according to prosecutors. Ten trash bags that originated from this dumpster contained blood stains, cleaning materials, a hacksaw, a hatchet, a purse and boots worn by Ana Walshe and her Covid-19 vaccination card, according to prosecutors.\n \n\n   \n   Cohasset Police announced Ana Walshe is missing  and asked the public to come forward with any information. Police said she was last seen “shortly after midnight on New Year’s Day.”\n \n\n   \n    January 6, 2023\n \n\n   \n  Police launched a massive search for Ana Walshe that included K-9 officers and search-and-rescue teams in the wooded areas near her home.\n \n\n   \n    January 7, 2023\n \n\n   \n  Investigators received an email saying “we have her here with us” and that Ana Walshe would not be returned until she paid $127,000,  according to court documents .\n \n\n   \n  “We have the so named Ana Walshe with us here… we had a deal worth $127,000… she messed up,” read the email, which was sent from the gmail account of “richardwalker9984.” It went on to say: “We have her here with us and if she doesn’t pay the money.. then she’ll never be back, and we know that the police and the FBI are involved.. good luck finding us.”\n \n\n   \n  Investigators said the email, which was sent to a Cohasset Police Department detective, was suspicious because it did not put forth a timeline to respond to the demand and did not include contact information, according to the documents.\n \n\n   \n  At least six investigators were tasked with driving to the north shore area of Massachusetts and watching surveillance video to try to verify Walshe’s timeline of events, the affidavit states. Investigators did not observe Brian Walshe on video at the Whole Foods or CVS in Swampscott on January 1, as he had stated, the affidavit says.\n \n\n   \n  Cohasset Police and Massachusetts State Police announced the search for Ana Walshe had ended.\n \n\n   \n    January 8, 2023\n \n\n   \n  Investigators obtained a search warrant for the Walshe’s Cohasset home and found blood and a bloody knife in the basement, prosecutors said.\n \n\n   \n  Brian Walshe was arrested and charged with misleading a police investigation,  police said in a statement .\n \n\n   \n    January 9, 2023\n \n\n   \n  Brian Walshe was arraigned in court and pleaded not guilty to a charge of misleading police.\n \n\n   \n  Beland, the prosecutor, said investigators had found no evidence of Ana Walshe taking a rideshare from the couple’s home on January 1. She said his statements to police caused a delay in the investigation.\n \n\n   \n  The judge set bail at $500,000 cash and set the next hearing for February 9.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors released the affidavit in support of a criminal complaint that lays out authorities’ timeline of the prior week. The affidavit describes Brian Walshe’s statements to police as a “clear attempt to mislead and delay investigators.”\n \n\n   \n  The affidavit outlines several trips he made that were not requested and approved beforehand and that may represent violations of the terms of his probation.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators conducted searches north of Boston and collected a number of items that would be processed and tested, the Norfolk district attorney said. The DA also called Ana Walshe’s disappearance “suspicious.”\n \n\n   \n  According to a source with direct knowledge of the investigation, investigators put crime scene tape around dumpsters near the home of Brian Walshe’s mother in Swampscott and dug through trash at a transfer station in Peabody. Both locations are north of Boston.\n \n\n   \n  Law enforcement sources told CNN investigators found a hacksaw, torn-up cloth material and what appears to be bloodstains at the Peabody site. The evidence was sent for testing.\n \n\n   \n    January 17, 2023\n \n\n   \n  An arrest warrant  charging Brian Walshe with murder  was issued for the death of his wife, according to  Norfolk District Attorney Michael Morrissey .\n \n\n   \n    January 18, 2023\n \n\n   \n  Brian Walshe was arraigned in Quincy District Court on  charges of murder and disinterring of a body without authority . \n \n\n   \n  Prosecutor Beland accused him of dismembering his wife and disposing her remains in dumpsters. She also laid out some of the evidence that led to the charges, including the discovery of Ana Walshe’s belongings and blood in the garbage and Brian Walshe’s Google searches.\n \n\n   \n  A not guilty plea was entered on Brian Walshe’s behalf. His attorney at the time, Tracy Miner, issued a statement suggesting the evidence against him was not strong.\n \n\n   \n  “In my experience, where, as here, the prosecution leaks so-called evidence to the press before they provide it to me, their case isn’t that strong,” she said. “When they have a strong case, they give me everything as soon as possible. We shall see what they have and what evidence is admissible in court, where the case will ultimately be decided.”\n \n\n   \n    March 30, 2023\n \n\n   \n  A  grand jury indicts Brian Walshe  on charges of murder, misleading investigators, and improperly conveying a human body, according to a district attorney. The indictment moves the case from Quincy District Court to Norfolk County Superior Court.\n \n\n   \n    April 27, 2023\n \n\n   \n  Brian Walshe was arraigned in Norfolk County Superior Court and pleaded not guilty to the charges. \n \n\n   \n  Prosecutor Connor laid out a spate of new details from the investigation. Among them: “Ana Walshe had taken out approximately $2.7 million in life insurance on herself, where Brian Walshe is the sole beneficiary,” Connor said. She also had a life insurance policy through her employer.\n \n\n   \n  Miner, his then-attorney, countered the prosecution’s notion that Walshe was trying to cash in on his wife’s life insurance policies. She said there is “no evidence Mr. Walshe was the least bit needing of money” and noted that his mother is wealthy.\n \n\n   \n  The judge ordered Brian Walshe to be held without bail.\n \n\n   \n    February 20, 2024\n \n\n   \n  Brian Walshe was  sentenced to 37 months  in prison and three years of supervised release and was ordered to pay restitution of $475,000 in the federal fraud case for selling fake Andy Warhol paintings.\n \n\n   \n    November 14, 2025\n \n\n   \n  Brian Walshe was ruled competent to stand trial after a 40-day stint in a state hospital for mental health evaluation, Judge Diane Freniere said in Norfolk County Superior Court.\n \n\n   \n  The trial was originally slated to begin October 20 but was delayed after Walshe’s attorneys called his competency into question after he was attacked in jail in September.\n \n\n   \n    November 18, 2025\n \n\n   \n  Just before jury selection began, Brian Walshe  pleaded guilty  to misleading police and improper conveyance of a human body related to the death of his wife. The guilty plea was made without a deal with prosecutors.\n \n\n   \n  Walshe faces a maximum sentence of 10 years on the misleading police charge, with up to a 20-year sentence enhancement if convicted of murder. He faces up to 3 years in prison on the conveyance charge.\n \n\n   \n  His attorney made clear he was not admitting to the murder of his wife.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/economy/us-jobs-report-september-preview","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"15:40:00Z","title":"What to expect in Thursday’s jobs report","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The long-delayed September jobs report, originally scheduled for October 3 but pushed to November 19 due to a government shutdown, will offer a crucial update on U.S. labor market conditions as the economy navigates uncertainty.

The shutdown disrupted data collection, leading to a delayed and potentially stale report, and affected the release of October’s payroll data, which will now be included in the December 16 report. Despite ongoing high unemployment claims and economic instability, experts do not foresee a recession in the near term, viewing the current state as the end stage of a post-pandemic labor market marathon. A more resilient outlook for 2026 is anticipated due to improved policy clarity and potential fiscal stimulus.","keyTakeAways":["The September jobs report, delayed for six weeks due to a government

Source: CNN\n \n   \n  One of the most hotly anticipated economic reports is finally set to be released Thursday: the long-delayed jobs report for September, originally due on October 3. It lands as the floodgates open for a slew of backlogged economic data that was held up due to the historic government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Sitting on the shelf for six weeks, the months-old data has the potential to come across as stale – especially for a fast-moving economy that is  feeling increasingly perilous  for many Americans and  businesses .\n \n\n   \n  Economic uncertainty and the rising cost of living have caused consumers to pull back (as  The Home Depot  and  Target  can attest). Affordability concerns are reaching a fever pitch (so much so that President Donald Trump  exempted some grocery store items  like coffee, beef and fruit from steep tariffs).\n \n\n   \n  However, the end of the federal data drought provides a much-needed look at how the economy fared in recent weeks and what’s in store for the months to come.\n \n\n   \n  Plus, Thursday’s report might very well be the last clean jobs report for a couple of months, since the  shutdown mucked up the finely tuned process of data collection and analysis during October  and part of November.\n \n\n   \n  And on Wednesday we learned that some of that October jobs data – the payroll numbers from the establishment survey – will be included with the November jobs report that’s pushed back to December 16, from December 5. The household survey data was not able to be collected, BLS said.\n \n\n   \n  As such, Thursday’s jobs report will provide a critical baseline of the US labor market entering the fourth quarter.\n \n\n   \n  Economists are expecting 50,000 jobs were added in September and that the unemployment rate held steady at 4.3%, according to FactSet. The consensus estimates would mark a pickup from  August’s preliminary 22,000-job gain .\n \n\n   \n  If September job gains come in as expected at 50,000, they will keep this year on course for the weakest employment growth since the pandemic and, before that, the Great Financial Crisis.   \n \n\n   \n  “I’m not expecting huge changes in the (September) report, relative to past reports,” said Allison Shrivastava, economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab. “I really just expect this continuation of this anemic job market that we’ve seen.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s been a low-hire, low-fire slog of a labor market where the lion’s share of job gains has occurred in health care and social services.\n \n\n   \n  That trend was largely confirmed by a  host of private sector  labor market data released during the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Still, while economists aren’t expecting many surprises, Thursday’s report doesn’t come without some fairly big risks – especially for the consideration of monetary policy. The Federal Reserve trimmed interest rates by a quarter point on October 29 with a backdrop of a “less dynamic and somewhat softer labor market,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time.\n \n\n   \n  “Anything that looks kind of ugly now has had the potential to fester for a little bit longer, for the six weeks before we got a better eye on it,” Oliver Allen, senior US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    ‘A precarious place’\n \n\n   \n  Job growth was expected to slow following the post-pandemic economic recovery; however, it’s been  practically listless  the past several months. Since May, job gains have averaged 31,000 per month, which is about one-fifth of the average seen in 2024, BLS data shows.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re in this place of such uncertainty because there’s so much change in policy,” Shrivastava said, noting the frequently changing tariff rates imposed by the Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n  The economy has continued to expand in recent months and consumer spending has held up; however, it’s wealthier Americans who are propping up those outlays.\n \n\n   \n  “This is already a pretty precarious spending situation that could really topple,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The bifurcation (also widely known as  K-shaped  or two-lane) in the spending environment has further contributed to the bifurcation in the labor market. Aside from health care, social services and leisure and hospitality (to some extent), job gains have been flat or negative in many industries, she said.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to uncertainty around trade policy, factors such as immigration, artificial intelligence, federal employment and funding cuts, high interest rates and pandemic-era overhiring are serving as headwinds, she said.\n \n\n   \n  And that in turn, will continue to put downward pressure on wages and serve as barriers for people trying to break into or re-enter the labor market, she said.\n \n\n   \n  Continuing jobless claims, which are submitted by people who have filed for at least a week or more of unemployment, have been hovering at around four-year highs, Department of Labor data shows. The latest claims data, which was filled in partially this week, showed that continuing claims were 1.957 million as of October 18, the highest since August.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re in a precarious place, we’re in an anemic place, but not necessarily something wholly negative,” Shrivastava said.\n \n\n   \n    A more ‘upbeat’ outlook for 2026\n \n\n   \n  Still, layoff activity hasn’t worrisomely accelerated: First-time claims for unemployment benefits were 232,000 as of October 18, a tally that was in line with September.\n \n\n   \n  If claims are “in the order of, 300,000 to 400,000 and once we kind of are consistently above that level, then I’d start to be a little more worried about the job market in general,” Oren Klachkin, financial market economist at Nationwide, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  At this point, Klachkin and other Nationwide economists “don’t see a recession on the horizon anytime soon.”\n \n\n   \n  “If I had to put a metaphor around it, it’s like we’re at the end stages of a marathon for the labor market,” Klachkin said. “We came out of the pandemic with extremely robust gains in job growth, and now we’re reaching the end stages of this so-called race, where the job market is looking a bit softer, a bit slower and is potentially at risk, just given where we are in the cycle.”\n \n\n   \n  The labor market is vulnerable to a crash-out; however, the odds are still in favor of it trudging across the finish line and to a point where it could get refueled early next year by increased certainty around tariff rates as well as a potential fiscal boost from the tax and spending bill.\n \n\n   \n  “In the earnings results for the third quarter, the corporate sector is still essentially signaling that we can be relatively upbeat about the economy into next year,” Klachkin said.\n \n\n   \n   This story was updated to include additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/climate/trump-endangered-species-act-protection-roll-back","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"15:36:00-05:00","title":"Trump moves to strip protections for endangered and threatened species","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration has proposed rolling back Biden-era protections for endangered and threatened species by reinstating rules that allow economic development to outweigh species conservation under the Endangered Species Act.

But new research challenges recent claims about the risks of fluoride in drinking water — and instead suggests that it may have additional positive effects.\n \n\n   \n  The heightened federal debate was spurred by a  recent government study  from the National Toxicology Program that concluded that high levels of fluoride exposure are linked to lower IQ in children, but that study evaluated fluoride exposures that were at least twice the federally recommended limits with notably “ insufficient data ” to determine the effects of lower levels.\n \n\n   \n  The new study looked at more typical, recommended levels of fluoride in drinking water and instead found “robust evidence” that young people exposed to fluoride at these lower levels actually performed better on ​cognitive tests than their peers who did not have fluoride in their drinking water.\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Rob Warren, lead author of the  study published in the journal Science Advances  on Wednesday, said he was “shocked” by the findings from the National Toxicology Program study and motivated to provide research that was more relevant to public policy decisions.\n \n\n   \n  “I wouldn’t have done this work had it not been an empirical question that I didn’t think we had an answer to, of great immediate policy interest,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  US Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has called fluoride “an industrial waste” and cited “IQ loss” in  pledges  to roll back federal recommendations that fluoride be added to municipal drinking water.  Utah  and  Florida  have become the first two states to ban the practice.\n \n\n   \n  “Imagine testing some new drug for heart disease and the recommended dosage is 100 milligrams, and then your study compares people who get a million milligrams to people who get half a million milligrams. Well, that doesn’t tell you anything about the effect of getting 100 milligrams versus getting nothing,” Warren said. “That’s kind of the world we’re in with fluoride research. It’s important to know that if you get a toxic dose, really bad things happen to your body, but that’s not relevant for the public policy discussion.”\n \n\n   \n  Warren, a sociology professor at the University of Minnesota, leads a program that started in the US Department of Education and has followed a cohort of tens of thousands of people for more than four decades since their high school years in the 1980s.\n \n\n   \n  For the new study, he and other researchers used this data to overlay performance on mathematics, reading and vocabulary tests for a nationally representative sample of nearly 27,000 people with their exposure to fluoride in community drinking water based on historical data from HHS and the US Geological Survey.\n \n\n   \n  The analysis assumed that individuals lived near their high school for their whole childhood and grouped them based on whether they would have been consistently exposed to recommended fluoride levels through community water fluoridation or natural occurrence of the mineral, consistently lacking exposure to fluoride, or partly exposed if their community changed their local fluoridation policy at some point during their childhood.\n \n\n   \n  Students who were exposed to fluoride for part of their childhood had higher test scores in high school than those who had no exposure to fluoride, and the difference was even greater for those who were exposed to fluoride for their whole childhood, the study found. Follow-up tests continued through 2021, when most participants had reached 60 years of age, and suggested that fluoride exposure also did not contribute to cognitive decline as participants aged.\n \n\n   \n  Cognitive tests are not direct measures of IQ. There is a strong correlation, Warren says, but cognitive tests measure a mix of how well someone’s brain works along with the opportunities they’ve had to learn the material. He’s working on additional research that will directly assess the link between fluoride and IQ, with more precise measurements data about where the individuals lived during childhood, too.\n \n\n   \n  Other  research  from this year estimated that removing fluoride from public water in the US would lead to 25.4 million excess decayed teeth in children and adolescents within five years, along with $9.8 billion in health care costs. The new study did not measure individual dental health, but experts say that pain from tooth decay can cause children to have trouble focusing in school or miss it completely — which could be a factor affecting cognitive test scores.\n \n\n   \n  Fluoride is a mineral that can be found naturally in some foods and groundwater. It can help prevent tooth decay by strengthening the protective outer layer of enamel that can be worn away by acids formed by bacteria, plaque and sugars in the mouth. The practice of adding fluoride to public water systems started in the United States in 1945 to help improve oral health in a cost-effective and equitable way.\n \n\n   \n  The American Dental Association and many experts have continued to support the practice of community water fluoridation, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has not changed its recommendations. The agency cannot mandate that communities add fluoride to their water, but it considers 0.7 milligrams of fluoride per liter of water to be the “optimal level.”\n \n\n   \n  But the US Food and Drug Administration recently  took action  to restrict the use of prescription fluoride supplements. “There are better ways to protect children’s teeth than taking unapproved ingestible fluoride, which is now recognized to alter the gut microbiome,” FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary said in a news release about the action.\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Bruce Lanphear, an epidemiologist and professor at Simon Fraser University in Canada, said it’s important to capture a more complete set of all sources of fluoride exposures, such as toothpaste and pesticides.\n \n\n   \n  “Population strategies – like fluoridation, like vaccination, like taking lead out of gasoline – they can be extraordinarily powerful. If you’ve got a safe and effective intervention, you can have a big impact on the health of populations,” he said. “But when you have a population strategy like fluoridation, the evidence about its safety and about its effectiveness has to be extraordinarily strong.”\n \n\n   \n  But in a  formal response  to the new research that was also published in Science Advances on Wednesday, Dr. David Savitz, an epidemiologist with the Brown University School of Public Health, argues that the greater burden lies on proving the risk before ending a public health practice that has been successful for decades.\n \n\n   \n  “Until clear evidence exists that water fluoridation lacks public health benefit or compelling evidence of harm at the level of fluoride exposure in fluoridated water, neither of which has occurred, it seems foolhardy to interfere with a long-established and well-recognized public health success,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “With due credit to the folk wisdom of Bert Lance, director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Jimmy Carter, ‘If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.’ Warren and colleagues move the needle a bit further into the ‘ain’t broke’ range.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/americas/us-military-deployment-support-caribbean-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"17:00:00Z","title":"What we know of the countries backing US military moves in the Caribbean","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United States is conducting a broad military and diplomatic campaign in the Caribbean, primarily targeting Venezuelan drug trafficking networks like the Cartel de los Soles, which it claims is led by President Nicolás Maduro.

countries backing US military moves in the Caribbean \n       \n  By Gonzalo Zegarra, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:18 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The United States shared images on Wednesday of joint military exercises in  Trinidad and Tobago , as its armed forces amass in the region, building pressure on  Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro .\n \n\n   \n  The deployment is receiving logistical and diplomatic support from multiple Latin American countries, ranging from limited assistance to open cooperation with to US forces.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s more on who’s backing the US operation in the Caribbean, which Washington says is meant to combat drug trafficking in the region:\n \n\n   \n    Trinidad and Tobago\n \n\n   \n  Trinidad and Tobago, which is only 11 kilometers (7 miles) from Venezuela at its closest point, has declared its full support for the US operation.\n \n\n   \n  “I, along with most of the country, am happy that the US naval deployment is having success in their mission,” Trinidadian Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar said in early September, after the US launched its first attack on an  alleged drug vessel  in the Caribbean. “I have no sympathy for traffickers; the US military should kill them all violently,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  After the US began the deployment in August, Persad-Bissessar also warned that if Venezuela attacks Guyana, a country with which it has a  territorial dispute , she would grant the US government access for defense operations. The declaration showed her willingness to abandon a yearslong policy of neutrality and a pragmatic relationship with Venezuela based on economic interests.\n \n\n   \n  In late October, the US Navy destroyer USS Gravely carried out military drills in Trinidad and Tobago for several days, a move that the Venezuelan government called “a hostile provocation.” Maduro responded by announcing the suspension of bilateral gas agreements with the country, claiming its prime minister was threatening to turn Trinidad and Tobago into “the aircraft carrier of the US empire against Venezuela.”\n \n\n   \n    Guyana\n \n\n   \n  Guyana backed the US military deployment in the Caribbean shortly after it started in August, saying it would support a “collaborative and integrated approach to tackle transnational organized crime.”\n \n\n   \n  It added that transnational organized crime was a “threat to peace and security in the region” and involved networks like “the Cartel de los Soles of Venezuela.”\n \n\n   \n  Washington claims Cartel de los Soles is led by Maduro and is responsible for trafficking drugs to the US and Europe. Caracas has dismissed the accusation as a “fabrication.” But experts and former US government officials  say the group is not a  formally organized cartel, and it’s a stretch to suggest Maduro leads it, though there is government involvement in the drug trade.\n \n\n   \n  The head of US Southern Command Admiral Alvin Holsey visited Guyana this month to promote regional security and met with senior commanders to discuss a long-standing defense alliance between both countries, the US Embassy said.\n \n\n   \n    El Salvador\n \n\n   \n  In early November, an AC-130J military aircraft operated by the US Air Force was spotted in El Salvador’s Comalapa Cooperative Security Base, according to photos and satellite imagery obtained by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The gunship can carry Hellfire missiles but is primarily armed with large-caliber cannons. The AC-130J seen in El Salvador had two cannons – including a 105mm howitzer – visible its left side.\n \n\n   \n  Until recently, the Salvadoran base had been used almost exclusively for unarmed aircraft, according to the US Southern Command. Its location near the coast provides a strategic position for the US campaign in the Pacific, as the reach of bases in the Caribbean is limited.\n \n\n   \n  “Operating from Comalapa offers more options and allows for monitoring and defending a much wider swath of the Pacific Ocean, through which much of the cocaine trafficked to the United States passes,” Ryan Berg, director of the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told CNN earlier in  November. \n \n\n   \n  Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele has not commented specifically on the US military deployment, but he has a close relationship with US President Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n    Panama\n \n\n   \n  US military personnel are conducting training exercises in Panama, although the government of President José Raúl Mulino is trying to downplay the matter.\n \n\n   \n  The president denied last week that his country is participating in any “hostile act against Venezuela” and asserted that the military maneuvers are part of bilateral cooperation agreements with Washington.\n \n\n   \n  Panama, which has not had armed forces since 1990, has hosted military exercises since the  US invasion of the country in 1989 . In April, Panama signed a memorandum of cooperation enabling a greater US military presence and authorizing the use of air and naval bases for joint exercises. Mulino again denied that the activities are related to the White House’s pressure on Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n    Dominican Republic\n \n\n   \n  President Luis Abinader said Monday that the Dominican Republic and the US Drug Enforcement Administration would launch “much more extensive and in-depth” actions in the fight against drug trafficking.\n \n\n   \n  That same day, Dominican authorities said they boarded a speedboat with 806 packages of suspected cocaine off the coast of Pedernales. The National Drug Control Directorate said the intervention was in support of Operation Southern Spear, the name the Pentagon uses for the military deployment in the region.\n \n\n   \n  The collaboration had already begun on Saturday, when authorities seized another shipment of nearly 500 packages of cocaine on a speedboat.\n \n\n   \n    Puerto Rico and other bases\n \n\n   \n  Puerto Rico, a self-governing US territory in the Caribbean, also plays a key role in the deployment, as it contains the most US military bases in the Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n   Satellite imagery and photographs  taken in the area show that Roosevelt Roads Naval Station, which had been closed since 2004, is now operational again, and that US Marines supporting the Southern Command missions participated in amphibious landing drills in the archipelago in late September.\n \n\n   \n  The United States has two other bases in and around the Caribbean, but in both cases, the countries where they’re located have spoken out against the deployment.\n \n\n   \n  In southeastern Cuba, the Guantanamo Naval Base has been used for logistical, surveillance, and other operations since 1903, but the Cuban government, an ally of Venezuela, has repeatedly rejected the US military presence as well as its recent deployment.\n \n\n   \n  Washington also has an air base in Honduras staffed by more than 500 US military personnel and 500 Honduran and American civilians, according to its website. In January, before Trump took office, Honduran President Xiomara Castro threatened to reconsider the use of the base if the US carried out mass deportations. In August, she called some of Washington’s accusations against Maduro “unfounded” and later spoke out against the US military deployment in the Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n    Political support\n \n\n   \n  Countries in South America have shown political support for Washington’s pressure campaign on Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  In August, Ecuador designated Cartel de los Soles as an “organized crime terrorist group.” The decree was signed by President Daniel Noboa, an ally of Washington, whose attempts to lift a ban on foreign military bases was rejected in a recent referendum.\n \n\n   \n  Paraguay and Argentina, other White House allies, have also designated Cartel de los Soles as a terrorist organization.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/health/tierra-walker-death-texas-propublica","dateOfPublication":"2024-04-17","timeOfPublication":"10:00:00+00:00","title":"New Immigration Policies and Human Rights Concerns in 2024","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On April 1, 2024, a series of new immigration policies were introduced, leading to increased scrutiny and detention of asylum seekers.

She died after she couldn’t get an abortion in Texas \n       \n  By Kavitha Surana and Lizzie Presser, ProPublica; Photography by Lexi Parra for ProPublica\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:12 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   This story was originally published by  ProPublica . \n \n\n   \n   ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive  its biggest stories  as soon as they’re published. \n \n\n   \n  Tierra Walker had reached her limit. In the weeks since she’d learned she was pregnant, the 37-year-old dental assistant had been wracked by unexplained seizures and mostly confined to a hospital cot. With soaring blood pressure and diabetes, she knew she was at high risk of developing preeclampsia, a pregnancy complication that could end her life.\n \n\n   \n  Her mind was made up on the morning of Oct. 14, 2024: For the sake of her 14-year-old son, JJ, she needed to ask her doctor for an abortion to protect her health.\n \n\n   \n  “Wouldn’t you think it would be better for me to not have the baby?” she asked a physician at Methodist Hospital Northeast near San Antonio, according to her aunt. Just a few years earlier, Walker had developed a dangerous case of preeclampsia that had led to the stillbirth of her twins.\n \n\n   \n  But the doctor, her family said, told her what many other medical providers would say in the weeks that followed: There was no emergency; nothing was wrong with her pregnancy, only her health.\n \n\n   \n  Just after Christmas, on his birthday, JJ found his mom draped over her bed, lifeless. An autopsy would later confirm what she had feared: Preeclampsia killed her at 20 weeks pregnant.\n \n\n   \n  Walker’s death is one of multiple cases ProPublica is investigating in which women with underlying health conditions died after they were unable to end their pregnancies.\n \n\n   \n  Walker had known that abortion was illegal in Texas, but she had thought that hospitals could make an exception for patients like her, whose health was at risk.\n \n\n   \n  The reality: In states that ban abortion, patients with chronic conditions and other high-risk pregnancies often have nowhere to turn.\n \n\n   \n  They enter pregnancy sick and are expected to get sicker. Yet lawmakers who wrote the bans have refused to create exceptions for health risks. As a result, many hospitals and doctors, facing the threat of criminal charges, no longer offer these patients terminations, ProPublica found in interviews with more than 100 OB-GYNs across the country. Instead, these women are left to gamble with their lives.\n \n\n   \n  As Walker’s blood pressure swung wildly and a blood clot threatened to kill her, she continued to press doctors at prenatal appointments and emergency room visits, asking if it was safe for her to continue the pregnancy. Although one doctor documented in her medical record that she was at “high risk of clinical deterioration and/or death,” she was told over and over again that she didn’t need to worry, her relatives say. More than 90 doctors were involved in Walker’s care, but not one offered her the option to end her pregnancy, according to medical records.\n \n\n   \n  Walker’s case unfolded during the fall of 2024, when the dangers of abortion bans were a focus of protests, media coverage and electoral campaigns across the country. ProPublica had revealed that five women —  three   in Texas   alone  — had died after they were unable to access standard reproductive care under the new bans.\n \n\n   \n  ProPublica condensed more than 6,500 pages of Walker’s medical records into a summary of her care with the guidance of two high-risk pregnancy specialists. More than a dozen OB-GYNs reviewed the case for ProPublica and said that since Walker had persistently high blood pressure, it would have been standard medical practice to advise her of the serious risks of her pregnancy early on, to revisit the conversation as new complications emerged and to offer termination at any point if she wanted it. Some described her condition as a “ticking time bomb.” Had Walker ended her pregnancy, every expert believed, she would not have died.\n \n\n   \n  Many said that her case illustrated why they think all patients need the freedom to choose how much risk they are willing to take during pregnancy. Walker expressed that she didn’t want to take that risk, her family says. She had a vibrant life, a husband and son whom she loved.\n \n\n   \n  Under Texas’ abortion law, though, that didn’t matter.\n \n\n   \n    ‘I don’t know how much more I can take’\n \n\n   \n  On a hot September day, Walker was lying down with JJ after a walk with their two small dogs, Milo and Twinkie, when she started shaking uncontrollably.\n \n\n   \n  Terrified, JJ called 911, asking for an ambulance.\n \n\n   \n  As the only child of a single mom, JJ had always considered Walker his closest friend, coach and protector wrapped in one. In their mobile home, JJ was greeted each morning by his mom’s wide smile and upturned eyes, as she shot off vocabulary quizzes or grilled him on state capitals. He loved how fearlessly she went after what she wanted; in 2021, she had proposed to her boyfriend, Eric Carson, and the two eloped. She’d just been talking about moving the family to Austin for a promotion she was offered at a dental clinic.\n \n\n   \n  At the hospital, JJ was shocked to see her so pale and helpless, with wires snaking from her head and arms.\n \n\n   \n  To Walker’s surprise, doctors quickly discovered that she was five weeks pregnant. They also noted hypertension at levels so high that it reduces circulation to major organs and can cause a heart attack or stroke. That, and her weight, age and medical history, put Walker at an increased risk of developing preeclampsia, a pregnancy-related blood pressure disorder, said Dr. Jennifer Lewey, director of the Penn Women’s Cardiovascular Health Program and expert in hypertension.\n \n\n   \n  “If I’m seeing a patient in her first trimester and her blood pressure is this uncontrolled — never mind anything else — what I’m talking about is: Your pregnancy will be so high risk, do we need to think about terminating the pregnancy and getting your health under control?”\n \n\n   \n  As Walker’s first trimester continued, she kept seizing. Her body convulsed, her eyes rolled back and she was often unable to speak for up to 30 minutes at a time. Some days, the episodes came in rapid waves, with little relief.\n \n\n   \n  For three weeks, she stayed at Methodist hospitals; doctors were not able to determine what was causing the spasms. Walker couldn’t get out of bed, in case a seizure made her fall, and this left her vulnerable to blood clots. She soon developed one in her leg that posed a new lethal threat: It could travel to her lungs and kill her instantly.\n \n\n   \n  Carson watched over her during the day and her aunt Latanya Walker took the night shift. She was panicked that her tough niece, whose constant mantra was “quit your crying,” now seemed defeated. One evening, during Walker’s third hospitalization, when she was about 9 weeks pregnant, she told Latanya she’d had a vision during a seizure: Her grandmother and aunt, who had died years earlier, were preparing a place for her on the other side.\n \n\n   \n  “You better tell them you’re not ready to go,” Latanya said.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t know how much more I can take of this,” Walker whispered.\n \n\n   \n  The next morning, Walker called for a doctor and asked about ending her pregnancy for the sake of her health. “When we get you under control, then everything will go smoothly,” the doctor replied, Latanya recalled. The physician on the floor was not an OB-GYN with the expertise to give a high-risk consultation, but the Walkers didn’t realize that this mattered. By the time the doctor left the room, her aunt said, tears streamed down Walker’s cheeks.\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Elizabeth Langen, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist in Michigan who reviewed Walker’s case, said a physician comfortable with high-risk pregnancies should have counseled her on the dangers of continuing and offered her an abortion. “The safest thing for her was to terminate this pregnancy, that’s for sure.”\n \n\n   \n  During Walker’s many hospital and prenatal visits, 21 OB-GYNs were among the more than 90 physicians involved in her care. None of them counseled her on the option — or the health benefits — of a termination, according to medical records.\n \n\n   \n  In Texas, the law bars “aiding and abetting” an illegal abortion. As a result, many physicians have avoided even mentioning it, according to interviews with dozens of doctors.\n \n\n   \n  In her condition, Walker couldn’t fathom leaving the state. When her aunt suggested ordering abortion medication online, Walker was worried she could go to jail. She was spending so much time in the hospital; what if she got caught taking the pills?\n \n\n   \n  At 12 weeks pregnant, she was admitted to University Hospital. Doctors there noted that even on anticoagulation medication, the clotting in Walker’s leg was so profound that she needed a thrombectomy to remove it.\n \n\n   \n  “At this point, we’ve gone from ‘complicated, but within the realm of normal’ to ‘we’ve got someone with a major procedure in pregnancy that tells us something isn’t going well,’” said Dr. Will Williams, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist in New Orleans, where an abortion ban is also in place. “In my practice, we’d have a frank discussion about whether this is a person we’d offer a termination to at the point of thrombectomy.”\n \n\n   \n  ProPublica reached out to five physicians who were involved in key moments of Walker’s care: the hospitalist on duty on Oct. 14, 2024, when she asked about ending her pregnancy; three OB-GYNs; and a hospitalist on duty at the time of her thrombectomy. They did not respond. The hospitals Walker visited, including those run by University Health System and Methodist Healthcare, which is co-owned by HCA, did not comment on Walker’s care, despite permission from her family. Although the Walkers have not pursued legal action, they have engaged a lawyer. A University Health System spokesperson said that it is the company’s policy not to comment on potential litigation.\n \n\n   \n  In her second trimester, Walker’s seizures continued and her hypertension remained out of control. At an appointment on Dec. 27, at around 20 weeks, a doctor noted spiking blood pressure and sent her to University Hospital’s ER. There, doctors recorded a diagnosis of preeclampsia.\n \n\n   \n  The experts who reviewed Walker’s vital signs for ProPublica said her blood pressure of 174 over 115 was so concerning at that point, she needed to be admitted and monitored. Most questioned her doctor’s choice not to label her condition as severe. The treatment for severe preeclampsia, which points to a problem with the placenta, is delivery — or, at 20 weeks, an abortion.\n \n\n   \n  Instead, doctors lowered her blood pressure with medication and sent her home.\n \n\n   \n  Three days later, JJ crawled into bed with his mom and fed her soup. “I’m so sorry,” Walker croaked. “It’s your birthday and it shouldn’t be like this.”\n \n\n   \n  He told his mom it was okay. He hadn’t expected laser tag or a trip to Dave & Buster’s this year. Over the past few months, when his mom was home, he had tried his best to make things easier on her, walking the dogs when she was out of breath, checking in every hour or so with a hug. JJ knew that after missing so many days of work, she had lost her job. She was stressed about getting enough food for the house. He was relieved when he heard her snoring — at least she was resting.\n \n\n   \n  That afternoon, when his stepdad was out grocery shopping and his grandmother was just getting back from dialysis, he cracked open the door to Walker’s room.\n \n\n   \n  His mom was lying face-down in bed, as if she had fallen over while getting up. JJ ran over and tried to find any sign she was breathing. When he called 911, a dispatcher coached him to slide her to the rug and start CPR.\n \n\n   \n  “I need you,” he shouted as he leaned over his mom, pressing down on her chest. “I need you!”\n \n\n   \n    ‘We have to allow for more exceptions’\n \n\n   \n  The anti-abortion activists who helped shape America’s latest wave of abortion bans have long seen health exemptions as a loophole that would get in the way of their goals. They fear such exceptions, if included in the laws, would  allow virtually anyone to terminate a pregnancy .\n \n\n   \n  In Idaho, an anti-abortion leader testifying at a state Senate hearing suggested doctors would use health exceptions to give abortions to patients with headaches.\n \n\n   \n  In South Dakota, a pregnant Republican lawmaker with a high risk of blood clots begged her colleagues to consider creating a health exception that would protect her; her bill never made it to a hearing.\n \n\n   \n  In Tennessee, an anti-abortion lobbyist with no medical training fought and defeated an amendment to the state law that would allow a health exception to “prevent” an emergency. He testified in the state Capitol that the carve-out was too broad since some pregnancy complications “work themselves out.”\n \n\n   \n  The refusal to entertain these broader exceptions is particularly consequential given the state of women’s health. Women are entering pregnancy older and sicker than they have in decades. The rate of blood pressure disorders in pregnancy has more than doubled since 1993; they now affect up to 15% of U.S. pregnancies. And they’re most prevalent in states with restrictive abortion policies, according to a 2023  study in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology . The burden of disease falls heaviest on Black women, like Walker, for an array of reasons: neighborhood disinvestment, poor access to health care and discrimination in the medical system. Cuts to Medicaid funding and changes to the Affordable Care Act are likely to exacerbate these problems, according to experts.\n \n\n   \n  Other countries give pregnant women and their doctors far more control over the medical decision to terminate. Across Europe, for example, most laws permit abortion for any reason through the first trimester, when more than 90% of abortions occur. After that gestational limit, their statutes also tend to include broad health exceptions that can be used for chronic conditions, illnesses that develop in pregnancy, fetal anomalies and, in some countries, mental health.\n \n\n   \n  U.S. abortion bans generally restrict interventions to a far more limited set of health risks, like a “life-threatening medical emergency” or “substantial and irreversible” harm to major organs. A small subset of lawyers and doctors argue that the law can and should be interpreted to cover patients with chronic conditions that are worsening in pregnancy. But the vaguely written bans threaten criminal penalties for performing an illegal abortion — in Texas, up to 99 years behind bars. In practice,  few hospitals grant health exceptions , ProPublica’s reporting has found.\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Jessica Tarleton, an OB-GYN who provides abortions in South Carolina, recalled how much changed at her hospital when the state’s ban was put in place: OB-GYNs who want to provide an abortion to a patient with a health risk now need to get a maternal-fetal medicine specialist to explicitly write in the chart that it is necessary, in compliance with the law. Not many doctors are willing to do so.\n \n\n   \n  “Some people were not because of their personal beliefs, and some because they didn’t want to be involved in any kind of potential legal actions,” Tarleton said. “They didn’t want their opinion to have anything to do with a patient getting an abortion or not.”\n \n\n   \n  Recently, for example, Cristina Nuñez sued two hospitals in El Paso for their inaction in her care in 2023. She had diabetes, uncontrolled blood pressure and end-stage kidney disease when she learned she was unexpectedly pregnant at 36. Doctors wrote in her medical record that “she needs termination based on threat to maternal life or health,” but Nuñez alleged that one hospital failed to find an anesthesiologist willing to participate. She remained pregnant for weeks, even as blood clots turned her right arm black, until an advocacy organization threatened legal action and she was able to obtain an abortion. The lawsuit is ongoing.\n \n\n   \n  This year, Texas Republicans  passed legislation with minor  amendments to their ban after ProPublica reported the deaths of three miscarrying women who did not receive critical abortion care during emergencies. In the updated law, an emergency still needs to be “life-threatening” to qualify for an abortion, but it no longer needs to be “imminent.” Doctors expect that most hospitals still won’t provide abortions to women like Walker who have dangerous chronic conditions but no certain threat to their lives.\n \n\n   \n  ProPublica asked Sen. Bryan Hughes, the author of Texas’ abortion ban, about how the specific complications Walker faced should be treated by doctors under the amended law. When her pregnancy began, would she be eligible for an abortion due to her health? Would she need to wait for a diagnosis of severe preeclampsia? Is there a reason the law doesn’t include an exception for health risks? ProPublica put the same questions to the 20 state senators who co-wrote the bipartisan amendment.\n \n\n   \n  Only Sen. Carol Alvarado, a Democrat, responded. In her view, the amendment was far too narrow. But, she said, her Republican colleagues defer to the far right of their base and oppose broader exceptions.\n \n\n   \n  “You can’t proclaim to be pro-life, but you’re passing laws that are endangering women and causing death,” she said. “We have to allow for more exceptions.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘So you’d rather let somebody die?’\n \n\n   \n  After Walker died, her family felt bewildered by her medical care. The doctors had assured them that her baby was healthy and she would be fine. The autopsy found that the fetus was indeed healthy, at just under a pound and measuring 9 inches long. But it showed that Walker had hypertensive cardiovascular disease with preeclampsia, along with an enlarged heart, dangerously full of fluid, and kidney damage — signs that her condition had declined even more than she knew.\n \n\n   \n  In Carson’s mind, the many doctors they saw cast the risks as challenges that would be overcome if his wife followed directions. “She was doing what they told her to do,” he said. He couldn’t understand how no one suggested ending the pregnancy to keep Walker safe. “Nobody said nothing.”\n \n\n   \n  Latanya worried the law played a role. “They didn’t want to offer to end the pregnancy, because the government or someone says you can’t? So you’d rather let somebody die?” she said. “Now we are the ones that have to suffer.”\n \n\n   \n  JJ couldn’t bear to stay in the home where he had found his mom, so he moved in with Latanya. Each day, he scrolls through old videos on the computer so he can hear Walker’s voice.\n \n\n   \n  Latanya does everything she can to support him, but she knows she can’t erase his pain.\n \n\n   \n  She recalls watching JJ steady himself at Walker’s funeral, to see her one last time. Until that point, he hadn’t cried.\n \n\n   \n  When he finally faced the open casket where his mom lay holding her fetus, JJ sank to his knees, overcome. His aunt, uncles, cousins and grandmother gathered around him and rocked him in their arms.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/us/latino-population-us-tradition-identity-cec","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"16:00:00Z","title":"Latino Identity in the United States: Tradition, Policy, and Growth in a Changing America","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the evolving identity and cultural significance of the Latino population in the United States, now exceeding 68 million and growing through native-born generations rather than immigration.

and policies, the US Latino population grows and cultural traditions remain \n       \n  By Karen Esquivel and graphics by Jhasua Razo, CNN en Español\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:07 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In a country where some 68 million Latin Americans — nearly 20% of the population — are redefining their place in public life, Latino identity in the United States is at a turning point. Growth no longer depends primarily on immigration, but rather on a native-born generation that is transforming priorities and expectations.\n \n\n   \n  But this shift is occurring amid a harsher immigration policy. There have been  more than 500,000 deportations  and over  1.6 million voluntary self-deportations  since January 2025. That reality is impacting the economies of entire neighborhoods, increasing community tensions, and reshaping the political landscape.\n \n\n   \n  Between the growing presence of an increasingly younger population that still celebrates its origins and traditions and the pressure of historically aggressive measures, the question of what it means to be Latino in the US today is taking on new layers of complexity. Who are they, where do they come from, and how do they live?\n \n\n   \n  Many Hispanics feel more connected to the United States but remain tied to their country of origin’s traditions: food, language ,  and festivities are some of the customs they preserve, according to responses to a CNN survey answered by more than 120 readers, all Latino residents in the U . S.\n \n\n   \n  Sara Sánchez says she still enjoys Salvadoran food such as pupusas and in December celebrates Christmas Eve on December 24 and Christmas the following day with traditional dishes and music from her homeland.\n \n\n   \n  Arepas, for example, are still the preferred food of many Colombians and Venezuelans throughout the United States. Mexicans eat pozole, tacos, or beans on any given day, and Nicaraguans enjoy gallo pinto, a traditional dish that contains rice, beans, chili ,  and onion.\n \n\n   \n  Mexico’s Independence Day or Día de Muertos are celebrated by people who trace their origins to Mexico; some Colombians maintain religious celebrations such as Día de las Velitas or Colombia’s traditional Christmas festivities with their respective traditional dishes. Venezuelan music, especially Gaitas in December, is present in homes and gatherings.\n \n\n   \n    Diversity of origin\n \n\n   \n  The growing Latino community in the United States reached a record of over 68 million in 2024, according to  Census Bureau figures . This means its population is larger than that of countries such as Spain, Canada ,  and any other in Latin America except Brazil (over 211 million) and Mexico (130 million).\n \n\n   \n  Historically, the Mexican population has been the largest Hispanic group in the United States. In 2024, they totaled 38.9 million (11.5%), a significant increase compared to the 35.9 million counted in 2020,  according to Census data .\n \n\n   \n  Second are Puerto Ricans, with 6.1 million (1.8%); followed by Cubans with 2.9 million (0.9%), Salvadorans with 2.7 million, and Dominicans with 2.5 million as of last year.\n \n\n   \n  Puerto Rico is an unincorporated territory of the United States. For this reason, Puerto Ricans have been U . S .  citizens by birth since 1917, but they  do not have the same rights  as other citizens of the country: They cannot vote in presidential elections and do not have representation in Congress. They are considered part of the Latino community because the U . S .  government  defines this group  as the population that speaks Spanish or descends from Latin Americans or Spaniards.\n \n\n   \n  People with roots in Central and South America have registered a significant increase, with two populations — Colombia and Honduras — that for the first time since 2010 surpassed the one million mark, while the Venezuelan population reported the fastest growth of Hispanic groups, with an increase of 181% from 2010 to 2020, according to the Census.\n \n\n   \n  The Mexican population is the largest Hispanic group in 40 states, but has settled mainly in California, a state that recorded more than 12.2 million Mexicans as of 2020, according to the Census, followed by Texas (9 million) and Arizona (1.8 million). Their presence and reach in the country have been such that in the 1960s the Chicano movement was born with the objective of empowering the U . S .  population of Mexican descent and was focused in the southwestern United States.\n \n\n   \n  Chicano murals, for example, stand out in neighborhoods in California, Texas ,  and Arizona as a window into the labor struggle, social justice, Mexican Independence, migration, historical figures, pre-Hispanic symbols, and daily life. In Sacramento, California, there is one of the oldest Chicano murals in the country called “The Rise of the Chicano Social Struggle in a Bicultural Society.” These works, created by local artists, are a symbol of resistance and pride for the Latino community.\n \n\n   \n    The South of the U.S. is home to the largest number of Latinos\n \n\n   \n  Geographically, California, Texas, and Florida are the  states with the largest Latino populations , but this group has expanded beyond traditional enclaves, settling in areas of the Midwest and the South where the Latino population was historically scarce.\n \n\n   \n  These three states are clear examples of the settlement and expansion of the Latino community. As of 2024, California’s total population was more than 39.4 million people, of which more than 16 million were Latinos (40%) and more than 10 million were immigrants (27%),  according to data  from the Public Policy Institute of California.\n \n\n   \n  In Texas, a state with more than  31.2 million inhabitants , there are 12.6 million Hispanics (40%), surpassing the White population (39.8%), according to Census data. This means that the Latino community is the largest demographic group in the country’s second largest state.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Florida is home to 6.7 million Hispanics (28.7%) among its more than 23.3 million residents. The Latino community is also the second-largest ethnic group in the so-called Sunshine State.\n \n\n   \n    Enduring customs\n \n\n   \n  Rodríguez lives in a Latino community in San Francisco, California, a state where Hispanics of Mexican origin make up more than 12% of the population, which  —  she says  —  reminds her a lot of Mexico. “Here, there are many street vendors on the streets and they sell all kinds of food, especially on weekends, you find everything: There are pupusas, tamales, tacos, anything. It’s not something you see in other places in the United States, but it reminds me a lot of Mexico,” she explains.\n \n\n   \n  Gastronomy is one of the areas where Latinos of Mexican origin have made a strong presence. According to  data from Pew Research Center , one in 10 restaurants in the United States serves Mexican food and 85% of counties nationwide have at least one Mexican restaurant.\n \n\n   \n  Clemente López replied that he feels more connected to the United States, but he prefers the food of Honduras, his country of origin, as well as the music and soccer.\n \n\n   \n  Paola Acosta, originally from Colombia and a resident of Florida, came to the U . S .  15 years ago in search of the so-called American dream. For her, the connection to her country of origin is greater and is reflected in her traditional diet: arepas, sancocho ,  and rice are on her table every day.\n \n\n   \n  And for Marabeth Márquez, the religious traditions of Venezuela are still present in her life in the United States with celebrations such as Christmas Eve on December 24, observing Lent and fasting during Holy Week, in addition to not having adopted holidays like Halloween.\n \n\n   \n  One in every five inhabitants in the United States is Latino (20%), making this group the largest racial minority in the country. Although immigration has historically been a determining factor in this increase, now the births of people of Latino origin have taken first place: just between 2022 and 2023, there were 722,000 births recorded, compared to 437,000 migrants who arrived in the country,  according to official figures. \n \n\n   \n  Gina López is a clear example: She was born in New York but feels more identified with the traditions of Colombia, her parents’ country of origin. She now lives in Florida.\n \n\n   \n    Soccer, a sport that connects roots\n \n\n   \n  Regardless of their flag of origin, Latinos in the United States prefer soccer over other sports because it is an extension of their national identity that connects them to their roots. This sport, favored in Latin America, has expanded and gained popularity in the country.\n \n\n   \n  While in 1997, soccer was tied for last place on the list of favorite sports along with figure skating, by 2023, it had climbed to fourth place, just behind American football, baseball, and basketball,  according to a Gallup poll.  Hispanic television viewers in the U . S .  represented the vast majority of soccer’s audience in 2017, with 68% of viewers that year, according to another  study from Nielsen. \n \n\n   \n  Talking about this sport among the Hispanic population has another important nuance: Latinos who prefer soccer tend to support teams outside the United States. According to a  2024 report  from the marketing and media company For Soccer, 32% of Hispanics consider the U . S .  men’s national soccer team their favorite, while 21% prefer the women’s team. However, among Mexican Americans — the largest Hispanic group in the United States — only 40% have one of these U . S .  teams as their favorite, which means that most of them prefer other teams, from Mexico or other countries.\n \n\n   \n  Soccer has become a cultural meeting point and a common language for many Colombians, Mexicans, Ecuadorians, Salvadorans ,  and Venezuelans, mainly in states such as Florida, California and Texas, according to Latinos who responded to CNN’s questionnaire. An example of this is that the states hosting the most Major League Soccer teams — the US professional soccer league — are California, Texas and Florida, which are also the states with the largest Latino populations.\n \n\n   \n  Paola Acosta, a Florida resident, noted that not only is soccer her favorite sport, but she is also a fan of the Colombian national team, her country of origin. And John Jauregui, who was born in California and traces his origin to Mexico, prefers soccer over other sports.\n \n\n   \n  That said, American football and baseball have also become integral parts of the lives of many Latinos in the United States. According to the NFL, by early 2025 there were  39 million  Latino fans in the U . S . , and according to  Nielsen data , the percentage of Hispanic viewers of the Super Bowl increased from 10% in 2016 to 14% in 2024. Meanwhile, the percentage for the World Series went from 10% in 2016 to 15% in 2023.\n \n\n   \n    Spanish language, important in identity\n \n\n   \n  Latinos still maintain Spanish as a way to communicate at home and with close family and friends, in addition to considering it an important part of their identity and traditions. In fact, the United States is already the  second country with the most Spanish speakers  in the world, according to the report “Spanish: A Living Language 2024,” with just over 57.4 million Spanish speakers, second only to Mexico.\n \n\n   \n  But as the Hispanic population is increasingly made up of individuals born in the U . S . , the proportion of Latinos who speak English fluently is growing. In 2022, 72% of Latinos age 5 or older spoke the language fluently, compared to 59% in 2000,  according to the Pew Research Center. \n \n\n   \n  Additionally, the proportion of Latinos who speak Spanish at home decreased from 78% in 2000 to 68% in 2022, a figure driven mainly by those born in the United States.\n \n\n   \n    Latinos, a driving force in the economy\n \n\n   \n  Hispanics are a key part and engine in the economic development of the United States and will become even more relevant as the rest of the population ages in the coming decades, according to an  analysis by the Latino Donor Collaborative and Arizona State University. \n \n\n   \n  The Latino Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the United States increased from $2.1 trillion in 2015 to $4 trillion in 2023, according to the report, which is equivalent to being the fifth largest economy in the world, behind only the U . S . , China, Germany ,  and Japan, and above the United Kingdom, France ,  and Italy.\n \n\n   \n  “The magic and secret power, the superpower of the Latino community is the ability to be so diverse, to come from different countries in Latin America and from Spain, but at the same time have certain characteristics that also unite us, such as the great entrepreneurial spirit and the way our community continues to contribute to all aspects of life and American society,” said Frankie Miranda, of Hispanic Federation.\n \n\n   \n  Latinos in the United States are much more than a statistic: They are a force that transforms the country, drives its economy, and renews its culture. They are increasingly American, but their identity is strengthened by traditions and pride, and they are key to the future of the nation, a future that is also expressed in Spanish.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/politics/boasberg-contempt-of-court-alien-enemies-act-flights","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"15:09:00-05:00","title":"Judge Boasberg to resume criminal contempt inquiry into Trump officials involved in Alien Enemies Act deportation flights","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, a former Obama appointee, is resuming a criminal contempt inquiry into Trump administration officials who allegedly defied his court order to halt the use of the Alien Enemies Act for speeding up deportations of migrants linked to a Venezuelan gang.

Alien Enemies Act deportation flights \n       \n  By Devan Cole, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:09 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A federal judge said Wednesday that he plans to “promptly” move ahead with an effort to find out which Trump administration officials were responsible for flouting his orders in a high-stakes immigration case – and whether they will face punishment for their actions.\n \n\n   \n  The comments from US District Judge James Boasberg, the chief judge of the federal trial-level court in Washington, DC, come nearly a week after a appeals court cleared the way for him to continue with a criminal contempt inquiry that was put on ice months ago.\n \n\n   \n  ”I am authorized to proceed just as I intended to do in April – seven months ago,” Boasberg said during a hearing Wednesday in the immigration case concerning President Donald Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act to speed up deportations of alleged members of a Venezuelan gang.\n \n\n   \n  “This has been sitting for a long time and I believe that justice requires me to move promptly on this,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Boasberg, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, had ordered the administration in mid-March to turn around planes carrying migrants being deported to a notorious prison in El Salvador under the sweeping 18th Century wartime authority.\n \n\n   \n  Yet the flights continued, and the migrants were held at the prison for several months before being released this summer as part of a prisoner swap with Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  “I certainly intend to find out what happened on that day,” Boasberg said on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n    What Boasberg wants to find out\n \n\n   \n  In a blockbuster decision issued in April, Boasberg said “probable cause exists to find the Government in criminal contempt.” But before he could move forward with finding out who was responsible for defying his orders, the proceedings were put on hold by the DC US Circuit Court of Appeals. That court on Friday paved the way for him to restart his inquiry.\n \n\n   \n  The judge suggested that part of his inquiry could involve declarations from administration officials, or hauling officials into his courtroom to provide testimony under oath. Those hearings, he said, could begin as soon as December 1.\n \n\n   \n  Among those he’s interested in hearing from is an ex-Justice Department lawyer who alleged in a whistleblower complaint earlier this year that a then-top DOJ official told his colleagues in March that the administration  intended to ignore court orders  as part of the government’s aggressive deportation effort.\n \n\n   \n  That complaint, Boasberg said, was just one part of the “significant developments” that have occurred while his contempt proceedings were on hold for much of this year.\n \n\n   \n  Boasberg’s decisions this year in the case  drew the ire of Trump , who earlier this year called for the judge’s impeachment, prompting a rare rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts. The chief said the proper ways to respond to a disagreeable court ruling is to appeal it.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, South Carolina GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham and several other Republican senators are calling for Boasberg to be suspended and impeached after learning that the judge refused to allow the phone carrier Verizon to notify them that their phone records had been subpoenaed in the January 6, 2021, US Capitol riot investigation.\n \n\n   \n  Boasberg has asked the Justice Department and attorneys behind the Alien Enemies Act legal challenge to provide their view on how he should proceed with the contempt inquiry by Monday.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Morgan Rimmer contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/entertainment/family-stone-sequel-thomas-bezucha-diane-keaton","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00Z","title":"A 'Family Stone' Sequel Is in the Works, Says Writer-Director Thomas Bezucha","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Thomas Bezucha, the writer-director of the 2005 holiday classic 'The Family Stone,' is developing a sequel in response to the emotional impact of Diane Keaton’s death, who played the matriarch Sybil Stone in the original film.

Nationals new manager details how he became a dad and an MLB skipper in the same day \n       \n  By Hannah Keyser, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:16 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  When Blake Butera checked his phone after the birth of his first baby, he had about 600 text messages congratulating him on his new job: fatherhood.\n \n\n   \n  Well, not  just  fatherhood.\n \n\n   \n  The 33-year-old new dad to a daughter was also named the  Washington Nationals ’ new manager, making him the youngest major league manager in over 50 years. That news had broken about two hours before Blair Margaux Butera was born.\n \n\n   \n  “I didn’t respond until we got out of the hospital a couple days later and, with that, it was funny because almost half the messages were like ‘Congrats on the job!’ and then another text message a day later that was like, ‘Oh wait, and you guys had a baby!’” Butera told  CNN Sports .\n \n\n   \n  Actually, to be precise, both baby and job were finalized on the same day.\n \n\n   \n  Before he even agreed to interview for one of the most exclusive jobs in the world, Butera needed to ask his wife: “Is this something we can do right now?”\n \n\n   \n  Butera, the then Tampa Bay Rays’ senior director of player development, had wanted to be a major league manager someday, but he was happy in his role, happy with his organization and about to have his first baby.\n \n\n   \n  His wife, Caroline Margolis, was adamant.\n \n\n   \n  “She’s like, ‘We’ll figure it out, we always do,’” Butera said. “She’s like, ‘This is how the baseball world is. It’s hard to prepare and plan for everything to go exactly how you want it to, or how you expect it to.’”\n \n\n   \n  “I just know it’s something he’s always thought about and dreamt about,” Margolis told CNN Sports. “He was really missing being back on the field.”\n \n\n   \n  In baseball, teams have to grant permission for one of their employees to interview elsewhere. This meant that the Nats’ new general manager, Paul Toboni, needed to speak with the Rays president of baseball operations, Erik Neander, before reaching out to Butera. Neander had told Toboni that Butera was expecting a baby imminently.\n \n\n   \n  “So when Paul reached out, he said, ‘I’m fully aware of what’s going on. I have four kids myself. Before we start this process, I want you to know that your wife and your soon-to-be baby are first and foremost. And if we ever have to cut off communication, I completely understand. I don’t want you to miss the birth of your first child. You need to be there for that, you need to be there for Caroline,’” Butera said.\n \n\n   \n  That, and Toboni’s willingness to come to Raleigh, where Butera and Margolis live, for the interview rather than requiring him to travel in the weeks near the end of her pregnancy, reassured them about the organization’s priorities. They moved forward with the process.\n \n\n   \n  October 26 was the baby’s due date. The next day, a Monday, the Nationals offered Butera the job, kicking off the contract negotiations. On October 29, Butera and Margolis went to the hospital. They discussed the contract and watched the  World Series  game on TV that night.\n \n\n   \n  In the morning, October 30, Toboni called Butera to tell him that ESPN’s Jeff Passan was about to break the news. Soon, everyone would know that he was the next Nats manager. His new boss advised Butera to turn off his phone and focus on his family.\n \n\n   \n  But the TV was still on in the delivery room. The news of Butera’s hiring aired just as his wife was about to deliver their baby.\n \n\n   \n  “You couldn’t even make it up,” he said. “It just feels like a story that’s not real.”\n \n\n   \n  Later, after they’d moved to the recovery room, Butera signed his contract making the hiring official.\n \n\n   \n  “Once we had settled our breath a little bit, I was like, ‘All right, we’re doing this? You’re ready for me to sign the contract?’” Butera said. “Signed the contract together and said, ‘All right, well, we’re now a new family, and we also have kind of a new chapter in our lives.’”\n \n\n   \n  “To the extent that I remember it, that is how I remember it,” Margolis laughed. “I just remember her being in my arms.”\n \n\n   \n  The Nats waited two weeks to introduce their new manager so the equally new parents could have some time to settle in. The news conference was a full family affair. Baby Blair came, along with Margolis and her parents, and the Nats welcomed them with a custom jersey small enough to fit a two-week-old.\n \n\n   \n  That wasn’t even her first merch. The team had a care package waiting at the couple’s home when they got back from the hospital – three gift bags all full of Washington Nationals baby clothes.\n \n\n   \n  “It was strictly for Blair. Like, the only one we care about here is Blair,” Butera said. “I think we’re learning pretty early that Blair is the focus here.”\n \n\n   \n  Blair and Toboni’s four boys were highlighted in  a social media post  by the team as well.\n \n\n   \n  “Sports, and  baseball  in particular, you’re gone so much of the year. I think it’s really hard on families sometimes,” Butera told CNN Sports. “It’s just important to us that we still spend time together as a family in an industry where it’s really hard to. I think just being able to see that on social media and on TV, like for others to see, it means a lot to us.”\n \n\n   \n  For Margolis, this whirlwind has been just what she expected out of a life in baseball.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s what you sign up for. They’re gone a lot, and if you’re not supporting the passion and the dream, then it’s just not going to work,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  And this particular complication was one they were excited to have. Margolis is just beginning to think about what it will mean for Blair to grow up around a major league clubhouse.\n \n\n   \n  “I hope that she will appreciate how special it is and just how cool,” Margolis said. “Her dad’s job is very cool.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/europe/turkey-suspected-poisoning-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"15:03:00Z","title":"Turkish Police Investigating After Family on Holiday Dies in Suspected Poisoning","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A family of four from Hamburg, Germany, died of suspected pesticide poisoning in Istanbul after staying at a hotel in the city's old district.

UK waters and aims lasers at military pilots, Britain says \n       \n  By Christian Edwards, Catherine Nicholls, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:50 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A Russian spy ship has entered British waters and directed lasers at military pilots, Britain’s defense secretary said Wednesday, as he warned that the country was facing a “new era of threat” from hostile actors.\n \n\n   \n  During a speech in London, John Healey said the Yantar spy ship was currently on the edge of British waters, north of Scotland, and that the ship was designed for “gathering intelligence and mapping Britain’s undersea cables.”\n \n\n   \n  He said a Royal Air Force (RAF) Poseidon-8 military plane had been deployed to “track this vessel’s every move” and that its pilots said they were targeted by lasers.\n \n\n   \n  “That Russian action is deeply dangerous,” Healey said. “My message to Russia and to (President Vladimir) Putin is this: ‘We see you, we know what you’re doing, and if the Yantar travels south this week, we are ready.’”\n \n\n   \n  Russia’s embassy in London responded angrily to what it called “the latest provocative statements” from Healey and claimed that the Yantar was an   “oceanographic research vessel” operating in international waters. In a statement, the embassy denied targeting Britain’s underwater communications or undermining its security.\n \n\n   \n  “London’s Russophobic course and the whipping up of militaristic hysteria are contributing to the further degradation of European security, creating the conditions for new dangerous situations,” the embassy said.\n \n\n   \n  The Yantar has entered Britain’s exclusive economic zone, which extends up to 200 nautical miles (about 230 miles) offshore, but the ship has stayed on the edge of the country’s territorial waters, defined as stretching 12 nautical miles (13.8 miles) from the coast, Britain’s PA Media news agency reported.\n \n\n   \n  Healey said Russia’s actions would not deter Britain from supporting Ukraine and that the government would continue to be vigilant – “just as we have been about incursions into NATO airspace, just as we are being now in terms of identifying the Russian spy ship in UK waters and just as we have continued to be in response to sabotage threats that we have seen across many different European countries as well.”\n \n\n   \n  Healey’s extraordinary announcement marked the second time this year that Britain has called out the activities of the Yantar. The government says the ship maps the undersea cables used by Britain and its NATO allies for energy and communications and is part of Russia’s secretive deep-sea research unit known as GUGI. But Healey said this is the first time that Russia has directly aimed lasers at British military aircraft.\n \n\n   \n  “We take it extremely seriously,” he said.   “I’ve changed the navy’s rules of engagement so that we can follow more closely, monitor more closely, the activities of the Yantar when it’s in our wider waters.” The defense secretary stressed that Britain has “military options ready, should the Yantar change course.”\n \n\n   \n  Britain sees Yantar’s latest incursion into waters of the UK’s economic zone as part of a pattern of increasingly reckless Russian  forays  into NATO territory, as Moscow seeks to show Europe that there are costs for backing Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  In recent months,  drones  have repeatedly crossed from Russia into NATO’s airspace, alongside other acts of  sabotage . This week, Polish officials blamed Russia for an explosion on a key  rail track  from Poland to Ukraine, calling it an “unprecedented act of sabotage.” Overnight into Wednesday, NATO once again  scrambled fighter jets  over Poland and Romania after Russian airstrikes struck western Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  “This is a new era of threat,” Healey said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/politics/jessica-tisch-zohran-mamdani-nypd","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"12:52:00-05:00","title":"Jessica Tisch Accepts Zohran Mamdani’s Offer to Remain New York Police Commissioner","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani announced that Jessica Tisch, the current NYPD Commissioner, has accepted his offer to remain in her role as she prepares to take office in January 2025.

\n        12:52 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  New York City  Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani  announced Wednesday that Jessica Tisch accepted his offer to stay at the helm of the nation’s largest police force.\n \n\n   \n  The announcement secures Mamdani’s highest-profile appointment as  he prepares to take office in January .\n \n\n   \n  It will require significant compromise from both Tisch and Mamdani, who have expressed different views on policing and public safety. Mamdani, who has been previously critical of the police and  once supported defunding the department , apologized to officers during his successful mayoral run. Tisch, known as a technocrat, has pushed to roll back criminal justice reforms and expand quality-of-life policing.\n \n\n   \n  “Leading this department is the greatest privilege of my life, and I am proud to continue doing it,” Tisch wrote in a letter to the NYPD that was obtained by CNN. “Now, do the Mayor-elect and I agree on everything? No, we don’t. But in speaking with him, it’s clear that we share broad and crucial priorities: the importance of public safety, the need to continue driving down crime, and the need to maintain stability and order across the department. We also agree that you deserve the city’s respect and support.”\n \n\n   \n  For weeks, it remained unclear whether Tisch, who was appointed to the department by Mayor Eric Adams, would accept to stay in the role after Mamdani publicly committed to keeping her on the job during the last mayoral debate.\n \n\n   \n  It was a final-hour effort by  Mamdani and his campaign  to show how much he was willing to compromise and appeal to city voters who remained skeptical about his campaign, particularly among older and more moderate Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  Tisch abstained from commenting on the race for mayor or Mamdani’s politics during the campaign. Last week, Mamdani and Tisch held a meeting, but it remained unclear if he had secured a commitment.  Gov. Kathy Hochul , one of the chief supporters of retaining Tisch, said she was confident Tisch would stay.\n \n\n   \n  Tisch, heiress to the Loews family fortune, is a career public servant who previously served as commissioner for the sanitation department and the city’s chief technology officer. She is highly regarded in government circles and was appointed to the job following a string of high-profile corruption scandals that rocked the department under Adams’ administration.\n \n\n   \n  In the last year, Tisch has overseen a record drop in the city’s crime rate, a reduction in shootings and homicides, and an effort to remove thousands of illegal guns from city streets.\n \n\n   \n    Joint appearance\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani and Tisch appeared together Wednesday at the Fallen Heroes Memorial in Lower Manhattan. The pair walked around the site while Tisch pointed out the names of officers recently killed in the line of duty. They were joined by a small group of officers who shook hands with Mamdani as he asked about their time in the department.\n \n\n   \n  “I appreciate the moments I just shared with Commissioner Tisch and a number of officers here with us to pay our respects to NYPD officers who lost their lives in the line of duty and to learn a little bit more about the names that some many New Yorkers have come to know, the heroism and the families they left behind,” Mamdani told reporters after the visit.\n \n\n   \n  Tisch declined to answer questions and told reporters she wanted to keep “politics out” of the discussion.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m sure there will be plenty of time to discuss all of that,” Tisch said, praising Mamdani for choosing the police memorial as the site of their first public appearance. “To me it is very meaningful that he asked to come here as our first public venture to visit the memorial.”\n \n\n   \n  As part of his campaign, Mamdani proposed creating a “Department of Community Safety,” which would shift focus away from the NYPD for certain emergency calls like responding to people in mental distress, domestic violence calls or the homeless. Mamdani has said the calls would still rely on police when necessary, but he has described the effort as a move that would allow police to focus on fighting serious crime.\n \n\n   \n  Following his visit, Mamdani suggested Tisch was on board with his proposal.\n \n\n   \n   “It’s untenable for officers to be asked to respond to respond to the 200,000 mental health calls they receive every year, to be tasked with the responsibility to deal with the mental health crisis, the homelessness crisis,” Mamdani said. “The commissioner and I share a belief in the fact that in order for police officers to be able to do their jobs we also need to create a Department of Community Safety to be tasked with those responsibilities.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/us/uriostegui-rios-deportation-government-lawsuit-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"13:10:00-05:00","title":"Trump administration ‘inadvertently’ deported transgender woman to Mexico despite judge’s concern she may face torture there","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration admitted it 'inadvertently' deported a transgender woman, Britania Uriostegui Rios, to Mexico despite a judge's ruling that she faced a substantial risk of torture or violent persecution due to her history of trauma and exposure to cartel-related sexual trafficking.

\nUpdated: \n        1:10 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Trump administration admitted it “inadvertently” deported a transgender woman to Mexico this month after a judge ordered she not be removed to the country over fears she may be tortured or violently persecuted.\n \n\n   \n  The government has said it will allow Britania Uriostegui Rios, a Mexican national,   to return to the US if she is able to make it to the border. Once she has returned, she will be placed back in ICE custody while the administration tries to deport her to a different country,   court documents show.\n \n\n   \n  The case marks the latest example of the Trump administration wrongfully removing someone protected by court orders or special status as it works to carry out the president’s goal of a  history-making  mass deportation program. Uriostegui Rios is  at least the fifth  such case this year, including the administration’s  dramatic legal showdown  over the removal – and  eventual return  – of Salvadoran man Kilmar Abrego Garcia.\n \n\n   \n  Uriostegui Rios’s attorneys are suing the administration and demanding that she not be required to return to federal custody once she is back in the US – “if she happens to make it to a port of entry without dying.”\n \n\n   \n  Mexico is one of the deadliest countries in the world for transgender people, according to the  Trans Murder Monitoring Project . Though the full scope of risk to transgender people in Mexico is unclear, journalists and advocacy groups  have documented  pervasive – and  often fatal  – violence.\n \n\n   \n  Since entering the US in 2003, Uriostegui Rios has racked up a lengthy criminal history that includes convictions for disorderly conduct, sexual solicitation and DUI, according to  court filings  from a Department of Homeland Security official.\n \n\n   \n  An immigration judge  ordered her deportation  in March after she was convicted of assault with a deadly weapon in Las Vegas.\n \n\n   \n  But the judge simultaneously blocked the government from removing Uriostegui Rios to her native Mexico, finding there was a likelihood she could face “torture” there.\n \n\n   \n  Even so, Uriostegui Rios was flown from a detention center in Louisiana to Texas on November 11, where her attorneys say she was taken across the border to Mexico without money, her daily medications or a cell phone. She was able to borrow a phone and call her attorneys, who say they were not notified Uriostegui Rios had been deported.\n \n\n   \n  “ICE confirmed that your client was removed to Mexico inadvertently,” Department of Justice attorney Shannon Smitherman  wrote in an email  filed in court. The next day, she wrote, “ICE stands ready to remedy the inadvertent removal by allowing your client to voluntarily reenter the United States if your client wishes to do so.”\n \n\n   \n  DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to CNN that Uriostegui Rios was “removed from the US and will be brought back to the US.” At the same time, the agency will seek another country for deportation.\n \n\n   \n  “The end result will be the same - Rios will not be able to remain in the US and will be removed,” McLaughlin said.\n \n\n   \n  The White House has not responded to a request for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Uriostegui Rios was being detained in a men’s facility in Louisiana while the US government unsuccessfully tried to deport her to Costa Rica, Honduras and Nicaragua, according to court filings. In August, it began an effort to remove her to El Salvador, but the petition is still pending with Salvadoran officials.\n \n\n   \n  It is unclear what fears Uriostegui Rios expressed to the judge, but the  legal definition of torture  is vast and includes state-sanctioned violence, “cruel and inhumane treatment,” and prolonged mental suffering out of fear for one’s life.\n \n\n   \n  When asked what threats Uriostegui Rios faces in Mexico, her attorney Bridget Pranzatelli told CNN she “is a trans woman who has been through extreme trauma, including being sexually trafficked by cartels [at] as young as 12 years old.”\n \n\n   \n  “As a result of these experiences, she has significant mental health issues,” Pranzatelli said. “There are many actors in Mexico who want to hurt her, which is why an immigration judge found it more likely than not that she would be tortured or killed if forced to return.”\n \n\n   \n   ﻿ Since being sent to Mexico, Uriostegui Rios has been shielding her identity while sheltering with family out of fear they will discover she is trans and kick her out, one of her attorneys, Talia Lepson, wrote in  a court filing .\n \n\n   \n  If Uriostegui Rios is able to return to the US, her legal team is asking that she be released from ICE custody and be allowed to go home under a supervision order, saying “the government cannot be trusted to follow the law” or court orders.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/sport/curacao-football-world-cup-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"15:25:00-05:00","title":"Curaçao Makes History as Smallest Nation by Population to Qualify for a World Cup","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Curaçao, a small Caribbean autonomous territory with a population of about 156,000, has made history by becoming the smallest nation by population to qualify for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, surpassing Iceland’s previous record.

Although an appeal has been filed, his family is seriously concerned about his health.\n \n\n   \n  The United States does not have a diplomatic presence on the ground in Iran, and Switzerland which represents US interests there, has not been allowed access to him, his family said.\n \n\n   \n  Rep. Tom Suozzi, who represents Hekmati’s state, called on the State Department to “urgently work toward the release” of his constituent. The New York Democrat said Hekmati should be released “immediately on humanitarian grounds.”\n \n\n   \n  According to family members, Hekmati was stopped at the airport when he sought to return home to New York in May. Authorities seized his passport and searched his phone and social media accounts. In the subsequent months, Hekmati was blocked from leaving the country and interrogated.\n \n\n   \n  In July, around the time of the so-called “Twelve Day War” between Israel and Iran, Hekmati was arrested, family members said.\n \n\n   \n  He was sentenced, without legal representation, to four years in prison under a law prohibiting Iranian passport holders from traveling to Israel. According to his family, which has since hired a lawyer, the punishment under the law was changed a few weeks later, and his sentence was reduced to two years.\n \n\n   \n  Family members said he had pictures of the trip on his Facebook.\n \n\n   \n  Although Hekmati is a US citizen, Iran does not recognize dual nationality. Tehran has a long history of imprisoning Americans and the US State Department has warned that “anyone with a U.S. connection, including dual U.S.-Iranian nationals, is at significant risk of questioning, arrest, and detention in Iran.”\n \n\n   \n  Asked about Hekmati’s case, a State Department spokesperson said they were unable to comment on individual cases due to “safety and privacy considerations.”\n \n\n   \n  “We continue to engage with allies and partners on this issue and on cases of unjust detention in Iran in general,” they said.\n \n\n   \n  Suozzi, in a letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, described Hekmati as “a respected and active member of our community.”\n \n\n   \n  “This case has deeply alarmed my constituents, particularly within the large Persian Jewish community on Long Island, and among his colleagues in the government of the Village of Great Neck Estates where he serves on the Zoning Board of Appeals,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Family members described him as a loving father, grandfather, and husband.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/media/princess-of-wales-bbc-apology-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"10:29:00-05:00","title":"BBC Apologizes to Princess of Wales Over Title Error","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The BBC apologized to Catherine, Princess of Wales for mistakenly referring to her as 'Kate Middleton' during a live Armistice Day coverage, an error that sparked viewer complaints.

orders \n       \n  By Natasha Bertrand, Zachary Cohen, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:05 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Half a dozen members of Congress who previously served in the military or intelligence community are urging service members and intelligence officials to disobey illegal orders that might be issued by President Donald Trump’s administration.\n \n\n   \n  In a video  posted on X  Tuesday, Democratic lawmakers Sen. Elissa Slotkin, Sen. Mark Kelly, Rep. Jason Crow, Rep. Maggie Goodlander, Rep. Chris Deluzio and Rep. Chrissy Houlahan said the “threats to our Constitution” are coming “from right here at home,” and repeatedly urged the military and intelligence community to “refuse illegal orders.”\n \n\n   \n  “No one has to carry out orders that violate the law, or our Constitution,” they said. “Know that we have your back… don’t give up the ship.”\n \n\n   \n  In the video, the lawmakers don’t specify which orders service members have received, or might receive, that could be illegal.\n \n\n   \n  Service members are required to follow only lawful orders in accordance with the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Following an order that might violate the law could open service members up to prosecution, as legal precedent holds that receiving an order alone isn’t a defense, colloquially known as the “Nuremberg defense” as it was deployed by senior members of Adolph Hitler’s leadership team during legal proceedings after World War II.\n \n\n   \n  The video comes as US military officials, including the  commander of US Southern Command , and US allies,  including the UK , have questioned the legality of a series of military strikes targeting suspected drug traffickers in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific. The attacks have killed at least 83 people since September.  The Trump administration is also fighting multiple  court cases  over its use of troops in American cities, raising legal questions about how the military can be used on US soil.\n \n\n   \n  Republican lawmakers quickly pushed back on the video. Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn told Fox on Wednesday, “It is inconceivable that you would have elected officials that are saying to uniformed members of the military who have taken an oath that they would defy the orders that they have been given to execute their mission.”\n \n\n   \n  Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham told Fox on Tuesday that “the senators and congressmen who made a video suggesting our men and women in the military do not have to follow unlawful orders have yet to show us an example. They owe it to our men and women in the military to be specific about orders issued by President Trump or those under his command that they believe to be unlawful.”\n \n\n   \n  The Defense Department is relying on a Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel opinion to legally justify the US military’s strikes against boats allegedly carrying drugs. The OLC opinion includes a list of 24 different cartels and criminal organizations based around Latin America it says the administration is authorized to target, CNN has reported.\n \n\n   \n  But lawmakers who have been briefed by the Pentagon about the operation have said that military officials have  acknowledged  not knowing the individual identities of those they are targeting before killing them. Instead, the officials said they need only establish that those on board the vessels are affiliated with cartels. Lawyers inside the Pentagon have raised legal concerns about the US military strikes, CNN has reported.\n \n\n   \n  Military lawyers have been conspicuously absent from recent congressional briefings on the operation, lawmakers have said. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth fired the top uniformed lawyers for the Army and Air Force earlier this year,  telling reporters afterwards  that he viewed them as potential “roadblocks to orders that are given by a commander in chief.”\n \n\n   \n  To date, key lawmakers have also not received a single briefing from members of the intelligence community on its role in the boat strikes  —despite submitting multiple requests for information and the Trump administration publicly citing intelligence that those killed were known drug traffickers, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  Formal requests, including at least one sent to Trump’s Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, have gone unanswered, the source added, noting lawmakers have received briefings only from officials at the State Department and Department of Defense so far.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/tech/folotoy-kumma-ai-bear-scli-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"09:36:00-05:00","title":"Sales of AI-enabled teddy bear suspended after it gave advice on BDSM sex and where to find knives","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Sales of the AI-enabled 'Kumma' teddy bear by Singapore-based FoloToy have been suspended after researchers from the US PIRG Education Fund found that the toy generated explicit sexual content, including detailed discussions of BDSM practices, roleplay scenarios involving minors, and instructions on where to find knives.

\nUpdated: \n        12:15 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Air travelers have become all too accustomed to flight delays and cancellations lately.\n \n\n   \n  Air traffic controller shortages caused major issues during the US government shutdown, triggering the Federal Aviation Administration to mandate flight cuts. While those cuts have been lifted, the busy holiday season could spell more disruptions, particularly if bad weather complicates operations.\n \n\n   \n  Keep in mind that in the United States, when an airline cancels your flight, you are entitled to a refund if you choose not to travel.\n \n\n   \n  “If a flight does get canceled, travelers are owed a full refund for the ticket, full stop. If they are presented with a credit, they have the right to refuse and ask for monetary refund,” said Katy Nastro, a spokesperson for travel site Going.com, who was underlining  Department of Transportation rules .\n \n\n   \n  If a big storm or another complication seems poised to disrupt your flights, “look to make alternative travel plans immediately,” said Eric Napoli, chief legal officer at  AirHelp , an air passenger rights company. Competition for seats becomes fierce during the holiday season when flights are more full.\n \n\n   \n  “Travelers should consider looking at flights that are very early in the morning — as these are typically less delayed, too,” Napoli said.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s more on what experts say you should do if your flight is delayed or canceled.\n \n\n   \n    It starts long before you go to the airport\n \n\n   \n  As bad as it is to find out your flight has been delayed for a long time, or worse, canceled, it’s better to find out from the comfort of home or a hotel room.\n \n\n   \n  “Check your flight status before you go the airport. Most of these notifications are not happening at the last minute,” said Scott Keyes, the founder of  Going.com . “Save yourself the drive to the airport.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s important that passengers closely monitor the routes they’re planning to travel, Napoli said.\n \n\n   \n  “We recommend booking refundable tickets or purchasing travel insurance in case of any issues that come up,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Other tips from Keyes and Going.com:\n \n\n   \n    If you’re at the airport already\n \n\n   \n  If you’re at the airport, act with urgency. Quickly head to the airline agents’ desk. “It’s going to make a difference who arrives first. It’s first-come, first-serve. Positioning yourself close to the desk can pay off,” Keyes said.\n \n\n   \n  You should also call up your carrier while you’re waiting, Keyes suggested. It might be faster to get through to a call center.\n \n\n   \n  Other tactics you can try:\n \n\n   \n    Attitude and research matter\n \n\n   \n  How you approach things can make a big difference, whether on the phone or in person.\n \n\n   \n  “Honey attracts more flies than vinegar,” Keyes said. “Look at this from the airline agents’ perspective. … The agent is the one who has the most ability to help you. Asking nicely and sympathetically is far more likely to get what you want than being a jerk about it.”\n \n\n   \n  And when it’s your turn to talk to an agent about new arrangements: “Come prepared to offer your own options already. Doing your own research is absolutely helpful.”\n \n\n   \n  Other considerations:\n \n\n   \n    Help from other airlines\n \n\n   \n  Cooperation between airlines could work in your favor.\n \n\n   \n  “When flights are canceled, many airlines have the option of putting you on another carrier’s flight because they have interline agreements,” Lousson Smith, product operations specialist at Going.com, told CNN Travel.\n \n\n   \n  “This means, for example, if Delta is having service interruptions but American is running a flight to your destination, you may be able to get on that flight.”\n \n\n   \n    Frequent flyer miles\n \n\n   \n  Thanks to changes in frequent flyer programs over the past several years, airlines often still have flights available with miles even when demand is high during a weather event, Julian Kheel, founder and CEO of  Points Path , told CNN Travel.\n \n\n   \n  “You’ll need to be prepared to spend a lot of miles, and you may not get the best value for them,” Kheel said, but the cash savings could be significant.\n \n\n   \n  “Most US airlines now allow you to cancel flights booked with frequent flyer miles without any fee or penalty right up until departure time. That means you can book multiple alternate flights on different airlines using your miles in case one of them ends up delayed or canceled.\n \n\n   \n  “But don’t try to book alternate flights on the same airline, as duplicates can be automatically canceled. And don’t forget to cancel the remaining flights you don’t end up using so you can get your miles back.”\n \n\n   \n    Trapped for the night\n \n\n   \n  What do you do if you’re not going to be able to fly out until the next day and you’re not in your home city?\n \n\n   \n  This depends on the specifics of your situation — in the US, for example, airlines aren’t legally required to put you up in a hotel. US-based airlines have their own individual policies for situations “within the airline’s control” that are tracked by the Department of Transportation,  here .\n \n\n   \n  According to the DOT, “a controllable flight cancellation or delay is essentially a delay or cancellation caused by the airline. Examples include: maintenance or crew problems; cabin cleaning; baggage loading; and fueling.” So weather events — or government shutdowns — typically would not fall into this category.\n \n\n   \n  But requirements in other countries are different. In the United Kingdom, for example, you’ll likely be automatically entitled to  food and drink vouchers and accommodation . You can read  all the details  at the UK’s Civil Aviation Authority (CAA)’s website.\n \n\n   \n  Your canceled flight will be  covered by UK law  if it was supposed to be departing from the UK, no matter who you were flying with.\n \n\n   \n  And if your flight was supposed to be arriving in the UK, you’ll be covered by UK law as long as you were traveling on an EU or UK airline.  This document  from the UK’s Civil Aviation Authority explains all the ins and outs of these rules.\n \n\n   \n  Despite this, sometimes airlines can’t help everyone, and as the CAA says, “this can happen when staff are stretched during major disruptions.” The  CAA advice  is to organize “reasonable care and assistance yourself, then claim the cost back later. If you end up paying for things yourself, keep every receipt and do not spend more than is reasonable.”\n \n\n   \n  Other things to consider:\n \n\n   \n    Refunds in the US\n \n\n   \n  Airlines in the United States are now required to give passengers cash refunds if the airline cancels or significantly delays or changes a flight and the passenger chooses not to travel. See more from the  Department of Transportation here .\n \n\n   \n    Travel insurance and receipts\n \n\n   \n  Travel insurance can be helpful to ensure reimbursement in a wide variety of circumstances. However, it doesn’t help in every situation.\n \n\n   \n  Many travel insurance policies apply to “unforeseen events,” according to Chrissy Valdez, senior director of operations at travel insurance comparison site Squaremouth. But once an event like the shutdown is known, it’s often not covered. Check with your insurer on your policy’s fine print.\n \n\n   \n  Cancel For Any Reason and Interruption For Any Reason coverage offer the highest level of protection for travelers shopping for insurance, she said.\n \n\n   \n  Nastro suggests checking on any protections offered by your credit card before purchasing additional coverage.\n \n\n   \n  Be sure to save all of your receipts in case you need to file a claim with your insurer or your airline.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Marnie Hunter contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/sport/basketball-nba-lebron-james-longest-career","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"09:42:00.000Z","title":"LeBron James begins season No. 23, marking longest career in NBA history","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"LeBron James begins his 23rd NBA season, marking the longest career in league history, surpassing Vince Carter’s 22-season record.

By Kevin Dotson, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:42 AM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As Los Angeles Lakers forward  LeBron James  took to the court at Crypto.com Arena Tuesday night to begin his 23rd season in the NBA, the 40-year-old added yet another record to his illustrious resumé – the longest career in league history.\n \n\n   \n  Prior to Tuesday, James shared the accolade with Vince Carter, who played 22 NBA seasons from 1998 to 2020.\n \n\n   \n  “It was just fun to be out there with the guys, man. It’s been rough mentally for me,” the four-time NBA champion said after the game, “this is the first time I’ve started a basketball season and not played since I’ve started playing basketball, like nine years old, I’ve never missed the beginning of a basketball season.”\n \n\n   \n  Sporting his famed No. 23 jersey, James was on the hardwood for the opening tip against the Utah Jazz.\n \n\n   \n  The public address announcer in the arena announced James’ achievement to a short ovation from the Lakers’ faithful during the first quarter. The future Hall of Famer acknowledged the crowd with a wave.\n \n\n   \n  The Lakers got off to a slow start, trailing by as many as 11 points early on. James was held scoreless in the opening quarter of play as the Jazz led 36-27 after 12 minutes.\n \n\n   \n  James knocked down a three-pointer from the wing early in the second quarter for the first points of his history-making season.\n \n\n   \n  As James heated up, so did the Lakers team. Los Angeles closed the gap in the second quarter and pulled away in the second half, winning comfortably, 140-126.\n \n\n   \n  James finished with a double-double, scoring 11 points and dishing out 12 assists in the game. The 21-time All-Star has now scored in double digits in a mind-boggling 1,293 consecutive games played.\n \n\n   \n  Lakers coach JJ Redick said postgame: “Just thought he played with the right spirit. Very unselfish all night. Was a willing passer, didn’t force it, took his drives and his shots when they were there.\n \n\n   \n  “The defense is going to pay attention to him, particularly when he has the ball in the post, particularly when he’s putting pressure on the rim, and I just thought he made a lot of great decisions tonight. Really good to have him back.”\n \n\n   \n  The 21-time All-Star played 30 minutes in the game, on par with the rest of the LA’s starters as the Lakers eased him back into action. James had been concerned about his stamina ahead of Tuesday’s season debut.\n \n\n   \n  “The pace tested me, but I was happy with the way I was able to go with the guys. As the game went on, my wind got a lot better. Caught my second wind, caught my third wind,” James said. “Rhythm is still coming back, obviously. First game in almost seven months, so everything that happened tonight was to be expected.”\n \n\n   \n  James missed the Lakers’ first 14 games of the 2025-26 campaign due to sciatica – a nerve issue causing pain that originates in the spine and radiates down the back of the leg.\n \n\n   \n  The  NBA’s all-time leading scorer  returned to Lakers’ practice this week after being absent from the team since the opening of training camp in early October due to what head coach JJ Redick said is a nerve irritation in his glute.\n \n\n   \n  Retirement rumors swirled around James over the course of the past year, but in June, the four-time league MVP reportedly picked up his $52.6 million option to return for an eighth season with the Lakers.\n \n\n   \n  Last year, playing in his record-tying 22nd season, James continued to display astounding productivity, averaging 24.4 points, 7.8 rebounds and 8.2 assists while appearing in 70 games.\n \n\n   \n  James had scored a record 42,184 regular-season points and 50,473 with the regular season and playoffs combined ahead of Tuesday night’s debut.\n \n\n   \n  The Akron, Ohio, native entered the NBA to much fanfare as an 18-year-old after being selected No. 1 in the 2003 NBA Draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers. He turns 41 in December.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Jacob Lev contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/sport/basketball-ncaa-michigan-state-kentucky-analysis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"09:40:00-05:00","title":"Michigan State’s dismantling of Kentucky highlights the philosophical divide in college basketball","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Michigan State defeats Kentucky 83-66 in a Champions Classic game at Madison Square Garden, highlighting a philosophical divide in college basketball: Kentucky, with a reported $22 million roster and flashy player spending, struggles with defense, scoring, and team cohesion, while Michigan State, with a financially modest roster of homegrown players, demonstrates resilience and team identity.

basketball \n       \n  Analysis by Dana O’Neil, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:40 AM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  One team walked into Madison Square Garden in its team-issued sweatsuits. The other approached the Champions Classic much like an NBA squad arriving for work, fashioned in their outfits of the day. Otega Oweh sported a designer jacket from Amiri that runs about $1,200.\n \n\n   \n  Which maybe makes sense. Kentucky’s roster checks in at a reported $22 million. Might as well dress the part.\n \n\n   \n  But as college athletics continues its reckoning with big money and  bigger problems , it is perhaps worth remembering the wise words of the Beatles, penned some 60 years ago.  Can’t buy me love. \n \n\n   \n  Or, in Kentucky’s case, it can’t buy defense, offense, wins, continuity, effort and at least for the time being, success.\n \n\n   \n  The Wildcats got pantsed by Michigan State, 83-66. They trailed by as many as 24, and never led past the 14-minute mark of the first half.\n \n\n   \n  The Spartans came into the game shooting 21.7 percent from beyond the arc, and had hit a grand total of 13 treys in their first three games. Upon meeting the matadors from Kentucky, they drained 11 of 21 from long range.\n \n\n   \n  On the flip side, the Wildcats hit just six from deep, and missed 22. Kentucky also got manhandled on the boards (42 to 28) and dished 13 assists, which is the exact same number that Michigan State guard Jeremy Fears, Jr. handed out on his own.\n \n\n   \n  Built on promise and promissory notes, the Wildcats are now 3-2, the three wins coming against teams ranked between 258 and 317 in Ken Pomeroy’s rankings.\n \n\n   \n  After spending 45 minutes in the locker room with his team, Mark Pope emerged for his post-game press conference looking despondent. He waffled between just below-the-surface seething and out-and-out baffled, taking the heat while simultaneously questioning his team’s identity, promising he’d fix whatever ails his squad but also admitting what needed to be fixed would require a ‘long answer.’\n \n\n   \n  At one point, he used the words disappointed, discouraged and discombobulated in one sentence to describe his team. Fabulously alliterative, but not terribly encouraging, if you’re part of the Big Blue Nation.\n \n\n   \n  That this disastrous showing comes exactly one-week after Kentucky got beat up by rival Louisville does not help.\n \n\n   \n  After that equally disappointing, discouraging and discombobulated showing Pope alluded to a mysterious pre-game locker room issue. The way he said it - “I’m not ready to tell the story yet, but at some point, we’ll talk in detail about our pregame experience at Louisville, and it was out of character for us, and that’s young and new,’’ - it did not sound like this was some rival hijinks.\n \n\n   \n  By not specifically identifying the issue - joking later he wanted to plant some Taylor Swift Easter eggs - he opened the door to frantic speculation among a fan base that does not need to be led into the deep end of paranoia where its basketball team is concerned. It happily gets there on its own.\n \n\n   \n  At least now the issue seems clearer. Bad good news, if you will. It would be insulting to say the Wildcats don’t care. Athletes care. But perhaps this crew is currently misguided in what exactly it ought to care about.\n \n\n   \n  Flanked by Oweh and Malachi Moreno, who both looked like someone stole their lunch money (or maybe their NIL money?), Pope was asked how player injuries (point guard Jaland Lowe didn’t play) might be affecting his team’s performance. A Mormon who doesn’t really curse, Pope started, “I’m going to temper my words.’’\n \n\n   \n  He then took a deep long breath. “If you build an organization, your identity isn’t about an individual person; it’s about a collective group.”\n \n\n   \n  It is perhaps unfair to take one team’s misery a handful of weeks into a season and extrapolate it into some sort of moratorium on what does and does not work in college basketball.\n \n\n   \n  But it’s almost impossible to consider what just happened on the Madison Square Garden court and not think big picture. The chasm on the scoreboard was only slightly wider than the way the two programs operate.\n \n\n   \n  Tom Izzo did not spend $22 million on his roster. He didn’t even spend $10 million.\n \n\n   \n  He has a team with players that in this era might be considered endangered species - four-year guys (Carson Cooper and Jaxon Kohler), three-year guys (Coen Carr and Fears), a redshirt (Jesse McCullough) and a four-star top 60 player who averaged 3.1 minutes per game last year and came back anyway (Kur Teng).\n \n\n   \n  Playing for Izzo is no picnic. Teng isn’t the only one who could have bolted, and who no doubt was enticed with promises of cash and playing time.\n \n\n   \n  Instead they stayed, biding their time and finding their minutes along with their purposes. Teng scored 15, Kohler 20. Cooper and Carr both yanked six rebounds and Fears did his assist thing.\n \n\n   \n  More telling, at one point on Tuesday night, during a Division I college basketball game in the year 2025, the entire bench - players, managers, staff - stood up and started clapping and chanting, ‘De-fense, de-fense,’ as if this they were playing in a church-league game.\n \n\n   \n  Comparatively Kentucky’s Collin Chandler hit a three while his team trailed by 19 with two minutes left in the game and did the inject ice into my veins move as he came down the court.\n \n\n   \n  It is only November. Nothing is decided. Kentucky could very well find its groove and Michigan State could once again forget how to shoot. Both coaches know that.\n \n\n   \n  Yet as the two teams exited the building, one left in an existential crisis.\n \n\n   \n  “I feel like the identity that we felt like we carried may have been stripped away, and that’s some reality we’re facing,’’ Pope said.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s an incredibly, incredibly painful process. It’s a terrifying process. If you treat it right, it can be a galvanizing process. And that comes down to the character of your organization. I think the character of our organization is terrific and tested in a big way right. But that’s the beautiful thing about sports. You either get it done or you don’t.”\n \n\n   \n  And then there was Izzo, college basketball’s perpetual Eeyore, basking in something nearing joy and satisfaction. Izzo has not hidden his disdain for either the transfer portal or the transactional nature of college athletics.\n \n\n   \n  And so when he was asked if there’s something about having guys that stick around and stick it out, he too had to temper his remarks. He took a long beat before answering, promising to be careful with his words.\n \n\n   \n  “How about 100 frickin’ percent?” he said. “They’re homegrown and they play for the name on the front of their jersey because they know the name on the front of the jersey.’’\n \n\n   \n  He wasn’t talking about Amiri.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/politics/tom-steyer-california-governor","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"09:00:00-05:00","title":"Tom Steyer, the billionaire Democratic activist, enters California governor’s race","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tom Steyer, a billionaire Democratic activist and former presidential candidate, has officially entered the California governor’s race to succeed term-limited Governor Gavin Newsom.

A bitter legal dispute has turned it into an empty eyesore \n       \n  By Barbie Latza Nadeau, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:25 AM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  For more than two centuries, the Antico Caffè Greco has been part of the cultural landscape of Rome. Authors and artists, movie stars and princesses — even cowboys — have all made the pilgrimage to Via dei Condotti, at the foot of the Spanish Steps, to soak up the storied atmosphere of the Italian capital’s oldest coffee house.\n \n\n   \n  Last month, that all changed. The café, a favorite for Romans and tourists, shut its doors. Portraits of former clientele — including Wild West sharpshooter Buffalo Bill — were stripped from its walls; plush red velvet chairs, seating booths and bar stools removed; gilded porcelain tableware carried away.\n \n\n   \n  The venue, as popular among Rome’s 19th-century bourgeoisie as it was with the 1960s “La Dolce Vita” in-crowd, became an empty shell.\n \n\n   \n  Antico Caffè Greco’s sudden demise was the result of a long-running rent dispute between its proprietors, Carlo Pellegrini and Flavia Iozzi, and their landlord, the Israelite Hospital of Rome. The hospital is a private institution that also provides healthcare to patients through Italy’s national health service.\n \n\n   \n  It began in September 2017 when an 80-year lease expired and the Israelite Hospital raised the monthly rent from 17,000 euros to 120,000 euros — a leap from about $20,000 to $140,000. The move, it said, was in line with other properties on the street, which is home to stores that include Gucci, Versace and Dior.\n \n\n   \n  High commercial rents have pushed many small businesses out of the center of Rome in recent years, especially since the Covid pandemic when lockdowns fueled the rise of home delivery and online shopping.\n \n\n   \n  “We would be ready to pay more rent to keep the café open but not six times the amount we’re paying now,” Pellegrini said when the Antico lease expired eight years ago. “I feel very angry, but we will fight this.”\n \n\n   \n    Casanova’s café ‘tryst’\n \n\n   \n  That fight was dealt a decisive blow in 2024, when the hospital finally won a court battle to remove the café’s occupants. It’s aim is to reopen the venue with a new tenant.\n \n\n   \n  Until last month, portraits on the walls reflected the café’s past, including the day in 1890 when Buffalo Bill  took his morning coffee  there with some fellow cowboys. It was a favorite haunt of Charles Dickens, Henry James and John Keats in the 19th century. Later, Orson Welles, Audrey Hepburn and Sophia Loren all spent time there.\n \n\n   \n  Notorious 18th-century seducer Giacomo Casanova even mentioned a “tryst” at the café in his memoir. The sofa in the back where it was said to have taken place became popular with lovers over the centuries since.\n \n\n   \n  Despite above-average prices, customers always seemed to think sipping a cappuccino or hot chocolate from the same cups as Pablo Picasso or Princess Diana was worth paying extra.\n \n\n   \n  Pellegrini and Iozzi were formally evicted in October after losing five appeals and retrials.\n \n\n   \n  The café was shuttered with the help of the military police. The locks were changed and the heavy wooden doors closed for the last time. Lawyers for the hospital removed a temporary “closed for vacation” sign that had been taped to the doors since September.\n \n\n   \n  The court stipulated that the hospital must preserve the historical integrity of the property, but departing staff told CNN through their lawyer that they removed the café’s artwork in September, which included portraits, sculptures and memorabilia said to be worth around 8 million euros, fearing damage from a leaking pipe.\n \n\n   \n  Antonio Maria Leozappa, special commissioner for the Israelite Hospital, told CNN the removed works and furnishings have since been seized by authorities and are now being protected by Italy’s Culture Ministry until new tenants can be found. It is unclear whether the hospital will seek backpayment from Pellegrini for an annual 100,000 euros rent shortfall since the legal battle began eight years ago.\n \n\n   \n  “The Israelite Hospital is a public health asset, and the revenue generated by its properties has always been and will always be used by the Israelite Hospital, an institution affiliated with the National Health System, for the sole purpose of improving healthcare,” the hospital said in a  statement  in 2023 after having won one of many court battles.  It said the rent increase was an attempt to improve healthcare “for the benefit of all citizens.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘A tragedy’\n \n\n   \n  Leozappa said the café will open again once work is done in the building. “It is a historic café, it is one of the first in Italy, it dates back to the late 18th century,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Under a new owner, the Antico Caffè Greco will “continue to enjoy a long history, respecting tradition and the established regulations, and the historic character of the place will be preserved,” he added. ”The city, Romans, and tourists will continue to enjoy their coffee at the Antico Caffè Greco for centuries to come.”\n \n\n   \n  Pellegrini isn’t ready to give up the battle just yet. “The matter cannot be closed like this,” his lawyer, Alessandro Ciciarelli, said when the locks were changed.\n \n\n   \n  Whatever happens next, the once-grand space is now an eyesore on one of the most prestigious streets in the city center — one of many empty storefronts, some of which sit vacant for years, that have appeared as a result of soaring commercial and residential prices.\n \n\n   \n  The Antico Caffè Greco’s wooden outdoor terrace now has signs that its empty planters   are not garbage bins.” Curious tourists peer through the windows into the empty space. Inside, the lights are on, but no one is making coffee.\n \n\n   \n  “I came here every day for almost 15 years,” Manuel Capponi, an elderly local who lives at the top of the Spanish Steps, told CNN. “It is a tragedy that it had to close this way, the fights, the anger. But this café — and this city — have weathered worse storms. There will be another café and I’m sure the prices will reflect the higher rent.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/business/target-stock-economy","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"08:46:00-05:00","title":"Target’s problems are intensifying","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Target is facing severe financial and operational challenges, including declining sales, stagnant growth for four years, and a 35% stock drop in 2025.

Over the next 10 days, changes in the stratosphere will upend weather patterns and set the stage for a cold, snowy December across parts of the Northern Hemisphere.\n \n\n   \n  It will mean a dramatic swing in weather for parts of the US that are currently simmering in record heat just a week before Thanksgiving.\n \n\n   \n  It could also be one of the earliest significant  polar vortex disruptions  recorded since the dawn of the satellite era.\n \n\n   \n  Think of the stratospheric polar vortex   like a wall of wind, corralling the ultra-cold, Arctic air over the North Pole. When it weakens, cold air spills south into places like the Lower 48, Europe and Asia.\n \n\n   \n  Right now, the air in the stratosphere — the layer of the atmosphere above where most weather occurs — is warming quickly and dramatically, in a phenomenon known as a  sudden stratospheric warming event .\n \n\n   \n  But the sudden warming in the far upper atmosphere is going to result in anything but warmth. It is causing the polar vortex winds to weaken, said Amy H. Butler, a meteorologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and they could even reverse.\n \n\n   \n  Scientists are still trying to figure out why these warming events happen, and for good reason: they can trigger the most intense “polar vortex” cold-air outbreaks in the US.\n \n\n   \n  Over the next two weeks, these shifts could start to be felt in North America, Europe and Asia as the polar vortex weakens and tumbles south, like a spinning top that slows and wobbles off course.\n \n\n   \n  One unusual feature of this event is its timing; sudden stratospheric warming events of this magnitude are almost unheard of in November, said meteorologist Judah Cohen, a research scientist at MIT.\n \n\n   \n  It’s still not certain there will be a major winter blast, but scientists are watching for colder than normal conditions to develop in the mid-latitudes — where most of the world’s population resides — over the next month or so. Once the polar vortex is disrupted, it can take a month or more to recover, said Andrea Lopez Lang, a meteorologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n \n\n   \n  What’s most difficult to predict is where the polar vortex will deliver its icy blast, and the temperature outlooks aren’t taking it fully into account, yet.\n \n\n   \n  “We can see more active and shifted storm tracks and increases in cold air outbreaks in regions across the Northern Hemisphere,” she said in an email.\n \n\n   \n  Both Butler and Lopez Lang said having accurate forecasts for polar vortex events can help make 7- to 10-day forecasts better, which can be beneficial for decision-making.\n \n\n   \n  “Even though the stratospheric polar vortex is miles above us, it’s sometimes connected to our weather via invisible puppet strings we describe with atmospheric dynamics and thermodynamics,” Lopez Lang said.\n \n\n   \n  For example, other polar vortex events early in the winter have been followed by colder and snowier Decembers in the US, she said. Polar vortex events like these tend to generate a ridge of warm, high pressure over Alaska, which triggers a dip, or trough, in the jet stream to the east.

The market is already nervous \n       \n  By John Towfighi, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Growing concerns about an artificial intelligence bubble have, in large part, caused the stock market’s  recent bout of volatility . So the AI industry will face an enormous test when Nvidia, the world’s most valuable company and backbone of the AI boom, reports earnings after the bell on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  The stock market rally —  ﻿ that had been going practically nonstop since April until this month’s blip — largely depends on Nvidia. The chipmaker, which is the gold standard for AI computing power, has propelled the market higher across the past three years.\n \n\n   \n  Investors are now eager to know whether demand for Nvidia’s chips — and its optimism about the future — are continuing to grow or if there are signs of AI fatigue.\n \n\n   \n  Earnings this month from tech company Palantir ( PLTR ), which uses AI for its government contracts, beat Wall Street’s estimates. However, concerns about the stock’s expensive valuation and nerves about a bubble gave investors pause — and fueled a  sell-off in AI stocks  over the past several weeks. Nvidia’s stock ( NVDA ) has fallen more than 8% this month, although it’s still up 37% this year.\n \n\n   \n  “The market for the first time is questioning whether the hype will turn into reality,” Bob Elliott, CIO at asset management firm Unlimited Funds, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Nvidia’s chips power part of practically every major AI venture, meaning investors will scrutinize its earnings as well as chief executive Jensen Huang’s remarks.\n \n\n   \n  “Nvidia takes on even greater weight than normal,” Elliott said. “If it doesn’t confirm high expectations built into the market, then watch out below.”\n \n\n   \n    Market-moving earnings\n \n\n   \n  Every investor should care about Nvidia’s earnings this afternoon: Nvidia accounts for roughly 8% of the S&P 500, which is weighted by market value. That means investors — and those with 401(k)s — are increasingly exposed to the company’s strong gains. Similarly, they are more exposed to a drop in Nvidia’s stock price.\n \n\n   \n  As of Tuesday, Nvidia shares’ gains have accounted for 18% of the S&P 500’s total return this year, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.\n \n\n   \n  Since Nvidia last reported earnings in August, concerns have been rising about  circular financing , with tech companies entwined in a massive web of extraordinarily lucrative deals.\n \n\n   \n  Now nerves are fraying about whether the money being poured into the AI boom will be justified. On top of that, tech stocks have become relatively expensive.\n \n\n   \n  “Nvidia’s earnings on Wednesday are particularly important given the rising skepticism regarding the longevity of the AI cycle and current AI stock valuations,” James Demmert,   CIO at Main Street Research, said in an email. “Anything less than a stellar report and outlook could make stock indexes vulnerable.”\n \n\n   \n  And it’s bigger than just Wall Street. There are concerns that the AI boom — which has helped boost US economic growth this year — is now masking signs of weakness in the economy.\n \n\n   \n  At its market value of $4.4 trillion, Nvidia is currently larger than every country’s economy except the United States, China and Germany.\n \n\n   \n  Nvidia’s fate is interlinked with other big tech companies that depend on its products. A sign of a slowdown in demand could signal that the other tech companies are less confident about the AI buildout. \n \n\n   \n  Some Wall Street analysts are optimistic that Nvidia will continue to deliver impressive earnings. AI chatbots like ChatGPT — and the data centers powering AI — depend on the company’s chips. It’s the foundation of the current AI wave.\n \n\n   \n  “That is why everyone listens to every word that Jensen Huang has to say, because it’s a good gauge of the health of the AI ecosystem,” said Angelo Zino, a tech analyst at CFRA Research.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/style/celebrities-spring-summer-2026-fashion","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00-05:00","title":"From the runway to the wild: Celebrities are already stepping out in clothes designers want you to wear next spring","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Spring-Summer 2026 fashion collections, showcased in fashion capitals like New York, London, Milan, and Paris during September and October 2025, have seen a shift where high-profile celebrities — such as Greta Lee, Sarah Paulson, and Michelle Obama — are wearing designs before they go on sale.

want you to wear next spring \n       \n  By Kati Chitrakorn, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:08 AM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Spring-Summer 2026 collections, shown across the main fashion capitals of New York, London, Milan and Paris during September and October, marked a season of significant change as a number of high-profile designers made their debuts at big brands. While many of those designs are not yet available for general purchase or widespread red-carpet wear, they’ve already been spotted in the wild — worn by an exclusive few.\n \n\n   \n  Getting their clothes on famous individuals is important for brands. “In some cases, it’s because the brands have employed these people as ambassadors, so they’re on payroll,” said Booth Moore, a veteran editor and author of books including “American Runway,” pointing to the actor Greta Lee, who was recently named as a global face for Dior and has attended several high-profile events wearing the brand’s latest designs. “In other cases, it’s people who are highly visible because they have a show or film to promote, like Sarah Paulson who has been wearing Balenciaga. Sometimes, it’s just a one-off, like we’ve seen with Michelle Obama, who is arguably one of the most visible women in the world.”\n \n\n   \n  Only a few years ago, the red carpet was representative of fashion’s production schedule, with celebrities wearing runway looks around the time that the collections arrived in stores. These moments played a key part in motivating shoppers to buy — even if it is a more affordable lipstick or perfume. That pipeline has now shrunk to reflect shorter attention spans: what was shown on the catwalk a mere month ago can now be seen at movie premieres, film festivals, awards ceremonies, talk shows, galas, and other glitzy celebrity events, which seem to be multiplying in abundance.\n \n\n   \n  Some fashion designers, including Dario Vitale of Versace, have sped things up even further by  showing their designs on the red carpet even before they hit the catwalk . “There are a record number of brands trying to change their image at the same time,” said Moore. “They’re in races against each other, and their reliance on Hollywood as a promotional machine has increased so much in recent years, that there’s this kind-of feeding frenzy to reach the right people, and to get to them first.”\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, the competition is now heated among stylists to outdo each other, as they vie for the approval of online commentators and the media’s best-dressed lists. For some, there is kudos in  reviving an archival or vintage design , but for many others, being the first to wear something still translates to access, status, and trend-setting power. And while celebrities have typically worn custom designs to the biggest red carpet events, any occasion now seems to be fair game.\n \n\n   \n  See the latest catwalk looks — and who wore them where — below.\n \n\n   \n    \n \n\n   \n    \n \n\n   \n    \n \n\n   \n    \n \n\n   \n    \n \n\n   \n    \n \n\n   \n    \n \n\n   \n    \n \n\n   \n    \n \n\n   \n    \n \n\n   \n    \n \n\n   \n    \n \n\n   \n    \n \n\n   \n    \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/politics/lame-duck-presidency-trump-epstein-analysis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"06:00:00-05:00","title":"Is Trump a lame duck now?

Wolf, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:00 AM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  For the first time in his second term, President Donald Trump was confronted by his fellow Republicans. And he fell in line.\n \n\n   \n  Rather than face a massive defection of Republican votes in the House,  Trump flipped to support a bill  to force the Department of Justice to release non-classified files related to the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  The flip-flop was a long time coming. The House of Representatives stayed out of session for more than a month during the government shutdown, which helped to shield Trump from this vote. After Trump ultimately endorsed the bill he had previously opposed, there was near-unanimity  when the House voted on it Tuesday .\n \n\n   \n  It now appears to be on a glide path to Trump’s desk.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not clear that Trump will appear in the remainder of the files as he did in  emails from Epstein’s estate  released by the House Oversight Committee last week. But it’s definitely clear that Trump has no interest in continuing to talk about Epstein. When a reporter asked Trump in the Oval Office Tuesday why he doesn’t just release the files, he shot back that she was a bad reporter.\n \n\n   \n  “Quiet, piggy,” was how he sternly reacted with a pointed finger to another reporter last week on Air Force One when she asked about the Epstein files.\n \n\n   \n  The argument that seems to have convinced Republicans to break with Trump on releasing the Epstein files and vote was best expressed by Rep. Thomas Massie, the Kentucky Republican who has tangled with the administration on multiple issues.\n \n\n   \n  “The deal for Republicans on this vote is that Trump will protect you if you vote the wrong way,” Massie told CNN’s Manu Raju last week. “In other words, if you vote to cover up for pedophiles, you’ve got cover in a Republican primary. But I would remind my colleagues that this vote is gonna be on your record for longer than Trump is gonna be president.”\n \n\n   \n  Pair that sentiment with Trump’s recent acknowledgment that he will not be on the ballot in 2028, which means he won’t be president in 2029, and you have the makings of a lame-duck presidency.\n \n\n   \n  There are other issues dividing the GOP, as  CNN’s Aaron Blake noted Tuesday.  In addition to the Epstein files, Republicans are grousing about Trump’s foreign focus; his apparent  lack of understanding of the issue of  affordability  and how it relates to his tariff policy; the destruction of the White House East Wing; and the way his family is appearing to enrich itself.\n \n\n   \n  Pretty much all of these issues were on display at Trump’s Oval Office appearance Monday, when he sat next to and defended  Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman .\n \n\n   \n  None of this means that Republican lawmakers are going to turn on Trump en masse in the near future. But it does mean you will hear that term, lame duck, with more frequency.\n \n\n   \n    What is a lame duck?\n \n\n   \n  Believe it or not, “lame duck” is a technical term in US politics. Historians in both the House and Senate track lame-duck terms.\n \n\n   \n  To them, it refers to a politician in the period after their successor has been elected, but before that person is sworn in. The outgoing politician still technically has power, but is no longer really accountable to voters.\n \n\n   \n    Is Trump a lame duck now?\n \n\n   \n  From a technical standpoint, no. US voters will vote twice before Trump leaves office: in midterms next year and the general election to replace him in 2028. His presidency will play a factor in both of those elections. The government will have to be funded each year, and natural disasters and other events will require leadership.\n \n\n   \n  But the term also has a more colloquial meaning that refers to anyone who can’t be reelected. That included Trump starting on Day 1 of his second term. But his superpower in recent years has been his hold over the Republican Party. That power, at least in theory, will fade a smidge every time he asks Republican lawmakers to do something voters will not like.\n \n\n   \n    Lame-duck presidencies can be dangerous times\n \n\n   \n  Just because a president is losing power does not mean there is nothing important going on. The ultimate lame-duck disaster occurred in 1860, after the election of Abraham Lincoln but before he was sworn in. That’s when Southern states started seceding from the union,  starting with South Carolina in December .\n \n\n   \n  George W.

and Abbas Al Lawati, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:01 AM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Iran is willing to resume  nuclear talks with the United States  if they are conducted respectfully, a senior Iranian official told CNN on Tuesday, while insisting Tehran will not move from the position it held before the  US and Israel attacked it in June. \n \n\n   \n  “They have to make the first move to show that they are ready to engage with us on the conditions that we put… it has to be based on equal footing and mutual respect,” said Kamal Kharrazi, foreign policy adviser to Supreme Leader  Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , in an exclusive interview with CNN from Tehran. “The agenda would be prepared in advance to ensure the clarity of substance and the process of discussions.”\n \n\n   \n  “Unfortunately, President (Donald) Trump does not believe in diplomatic engagement but rather prefers to use force to achieve his objectives,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Later on Tuesday, Trump said that Iran is “very much” signaling interest in striking a deal with the US over its nuclear program.\n \n\n   \n  “They’d like very much to make a deal with us, and they call us, and we’ll end up probably doing that, that’s Iran,” Trump said in a room filled with high-profile guests at a White House dinner honoring Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n \n\n   \n  The president’s comments echoed remarks he made earlier in the day, when he indicated he was open to pursuing negotiations.\n \n\n   \n  Kharrazi indicated that Iran’s conditions for a rapprochement with Washington have not changed since the US and Israel struck its nuclear facilities in June, adding that uranium enrichment will continue because the country needs the fuel for its power plants and for medical purposes. Tehran’s ballistic missile program, which he said is expanding, will also be off the negotiating table. “It is only the nuclear issue we will discuss with the United States,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration and Iran were in the middle of talks to settle their dispute in June when Israel launched a surprise attack on Iran, eventually drawing in Washington, which carried out strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, the first direct US attack inside Iran.\n \n\n   \n  Almost five months on, the damage to Iran’s nuclear facilities has yet to be assessed, Kharrazi said.\n \n\n   \n  On Sunday, Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister Saeed Khatibzadeh told CNN that despite serious damage to “infrastructure, machineries” and “buildings,” the country’s nuclear program  remained “intact.”  On the same day, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said that no uranium enrichment was taking place “right now” because the country’s facilities had been attacked.\n \n\n   \n  During the Iran-US talks in the summer, Washington had insisted that Iran stop enriching uranium altogether, while Tehran was adamant about continuing domestic enrichment to a purity that cannot be used to build nuclear bombs. Highly enriched uranium is a key component of a nuclear weapon.\n \n\n   \n  Kharrazi said the “degree of enrichment,” not enrichment itself, would be the focus of potential negotiations with the US.\n \n\n   \n  Asked if he is concerned about another military confrontation with the US or Israel, he said: “Everything is possible. But we are ready for that.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN reported in June that Washington had made a proposal for a nuclear deal under which the US would invest in Iran’s civilian nuclear power program and  join a consortium  that would oversee the enrichment of low-level uranium inside Iran for an unspecified amount of time. That potential consortium would be expected to include Middle Eastern nations and the UN’s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\n \n\n   \n  At the time, Iranian officials repeatedly said they are open to the idea of an enrichment consortium but insisted Iran must be able to keep control of its own enrichment capabilities.\n \n\n   \n  Asked by CNN if there is room to reach an understanding with the US on Iran’s nuclear program, including on a potential consortium, Kharrazi said, “I think so.”\n \n\n   \n  “If there would be genuine negotiations between Iran and the United States, there are ways and means (of) how to ensure that Iran can continue its enrichment and at the same time assure the others that it’s not going to look for nuclear weapons.”\n \n\n   \n  Kharrazi also had a message for Trump.\n \n\n   \n  “Start with a positive approach with Iran. If it will be positive, certainly it will be reciprocated. But for that, they (the US) have to refrain from any force against Iran,” he said. “They have tried that and they now understand that it’s not acceptable and it’s not workable.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/business/stimulus-check-trump-tariff-dividend","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"4 Reasons You Probably Won’t Get a $2,000 Check from Trump Soon (and 1 Scary Reason You Might)","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has promised $2,000 tariff rebate checks for middle-income Americans, citing revenue from new tariffs as the source.

probably won’t get a $2,000 check from Trump soon (and 1 scary reason you might) \n       \n  Analysis by Matt Egan, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump has promised to deliver $2,000 tariff rebate checks next year, raising hopes of a lifeline for millions of Americans  struggling to make ends meet .\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve taken in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariff money. We’re going to be issuing dividends…probably the middle of next year, a little bit later than that, of thousands of dollars for individuals of moderate income, middle income,”  Trump said  Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Although Trump has suggested  these checks  are essentially a done deal, the reality is there are major, perhaps insurmountable,  obstacles standing in the way .\n \n\n   \n  Experts tell CNN it is improbable the federal government will  send out $2,000 checks  next year – unless it looks like the US economy needs to be rescued from an imminent recession.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s highly unlikely there is some sort of stimulus check sent out next year. I would be pretty shocked,” Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics at the Cato Institute, told CNN in a phone interview.\n \n\n   \n  Bettors on prediction platform Polymarket seem to agree. They  place just an 11% chance  that Trump creates a tariff dividend by March 31.\n \n\n   \n     The math doesn’t math \n \n\n   \n  Perhaps the biggest obstacle is that the numbers don’t add up.\n \n\n   \n  Tariffs are undoubtedly generating gobs of money for the federal government.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s new tariffs are projected to raise $158.4 billion in total revenue in 2025, and another $207.5 billion in 2026, according to  estimates  from the Tax Foundation.\n \n\n   \n  It’s hard to say exactly how much tariff dividend checks will cost because virtually no details have been released.\n \n\n   \n  Still, the Tax Foundation modeled three designs for tariff dividends – and all of them would cost more than the new tariffs are projected to bring in this year.\n \n\n   \n  For instance, if the checks went out only to tax filers and spouses, and had a hard cut off at $100,000 in individual income, they would still cost $279.8 billion, according to the analysis. That’s $121 billion more than projected new tariff revenue this year.\n \n\n   \n  At the high end of the scenarios analyzed, tariff dividends could go out to tax filers and non-filers as well as spouses and dependents. That would cost up to $606.8 billion – or nearly double the combined 2025 and 2026 projected new tariff revenue.\n \n\n   \n  That’s a problem because the Trump administration has already held up tariff revenue as a way to offset the cost of the sweeping tax and spending package Trump signed into law earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  “This is like the magic money tree. You just go to it anytime you need money. Of course, that’s not reality,” said Lincicome.\n \n\n   \n     The votes may not be there \n \n\n   \n  Another major problem is Congress would need to sign off on dividend checks – and it’s far from clear there are the votes for that.\n \n\n   \n  Deficit hawks were already reluctant to back the president’s tax law and this would only magnify budget worries.\n \n\n   \n  “I find it extremely implausible that Republican budget hawks are just going to be okay with blowing another $300 billion to $600 billion,” Lincicome.\n \n\n   \n  After topping $34 trillion for the first time in January 2024, the national debt has continued to mount,  hitting $38 trillion  late last month.\n \n\n   \n     Dividend checks could backfire \n \n\n   \n  There’s no doubt many Americans could use $2,000 checks from Uncle Sam as they struggle to catch up to high prices at the grocery store, on car insurance and elsewhere.\n \n\n   \n  However, some economists warn that stimulus checks could backfire by worsening the affordability crisis.\n \n\n   \n  The problem is that while some people may use the money to pay down debt, others would likely spend it, and that would increase demand. As the last inflation crisis demonstrated, boosting demand without increasing supply drives up prices.\n \n\n   \n  In fact, many Republicans blamed former President Joe Biden’s 2021 stimulus checks for causing the inflation crisis. That could make it difficult for those same lawmakers to support Trump-era stimulus checks.\n \n\n   \n  Academic research has found those  stimulus checks contributed  to the four-decade high in inflation, though they were hardly the only factor. Trillions of dollars in other stimulus, including Trump’s 2020 stimulus checks and the Paycheck Protection Program also contributed.\n \n\n   \n  Even some Trump-friendly economists are highly skeptical.\n \n\n   \n  “Sending out checks to people is a bad way to stimulate the economy,” Stephen Moore, co-founder of Unleash Prosperity and a former Trump economic adviser, told CNN in an email. “If there is tariff revenue, that should be used to cut income taxes across the board. Stimulus checks only stimulate inflation.”\n \n\n   \n  Additionally, redeploying tariff revenue to pay for dividend payments risks sparking a  revolt among the so-called bond vigilantes  that drives up Treasury yields that set a benchmark for a number of loan rates. That in turn would make it even more expensive for small businesses to borrow and homebuyers to get a mortgage.\n \n\n   \n  “What Congress and Trump are trying to do with stimulus, the bond market could take away instantly,” said Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James.\n \n\n   \n  That’s one reason stimulus checks are normally reserved for actual emergencies like the 2008 financial crisis or the 2020 pandemic.\n \n\n   \n     Supreme Court could wipe out tariff revenue \n \n\n   \n  Beyond the budget, political and economic obstacles, there are legal ones, too.\n \n\n   \n  Most Supreme Court justices during oral arguments earlier this month  sounded skeptical  about Trump’s reliance on emergency powers to impose his global tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  The Tax Foundation estimates the tariffs that could get struck down account for about 75% of the new tariff revenue coming in.\n \n\n   \n  “If the Supreme Court says the bulk of the tariffs are illegal, that could throw a wrench in the tariff rebate plan,” said Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation.\n \n\n   \n  For all these reasons, investors and economists on Wall Street are hardly counting on the arrival of $2,000 tariff dividend checks in 2026.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve learned that late night Truth Socials are not a direct line to reality,” said Bob Elliott, CEO and chief investment officer at alternative investment firm Unlimited.\n \n\n   \n     ‘Break-the-glass’ moment? \n \n\n   \n  However, one way Trump’s $2,000 dividend checks could become a reality is if they become a necessity.\n \n\n   \n  If trouble in the job market intensifies and the unemployment rate climbs significantly, then the White House could argue direct payments are necessary to prevent a recession or minimize the damage of one.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s almost like we shouldn’t want stimulus checks to happen,” Mills said, “because it would be an indicator of something wrong. This is a break-the-glass, use in case of emergency tool.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/europe/denmark-asylum-immigration-system-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00-05:00","title":"Denmark’s hardline immigration laws have caught Britain’s eye.

Here’s why \n       \n  By Christian Edwards, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:32 AM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   Denmark’s  biggest exports include  Ozempic , Carlsberg and Lego. But now, European leaders think it has something more valuable to sell: an immigration system tough and effective enough to neuter the hard right and keep mainstream parties in power.\n \n\n   \n  Mette Frederiksen, the Danish prime minister, has achieved what many center-left governments of recent years have found impossible: getting reelected. In an age when incumbents keep getting hammered at the ballot box, many in Europe are looking to the asylum policies of Frederiksen’s Social Democrats – which won elections in 2019, 2022, and, polls show, are on course to win again in 2026 – as a model to imitate.\n \n\n   \n  Britain’s  Labour government  – which has been hounded by the  populist Reform UK party  over its struggle to control  illegal immigration  – has been so impressed by the Danish model that it sent officials to find out how the system works.\n \n\n   \n  Announcing a  radical overhaul  of Britain’s asylum system on Monday, Shabana Mahmood, the home secretary, said while Britain had “held rigidly to the old model, other countries have tightened theirs.” She singled out Denmark as a poster child.\n \n\n   \n  The old model referenced by Mahmood is a creature of Europe’s post-war milieu. The United Nations Refugee Convention of 1951 applied only to Europe and sought to settle wartime refugees – primarily Jews who survived the Holocaust, ethnic Germans expelled from Eastern Europe and dissidents fleeing Soviet regimes. The treaty was expanded in 1967 to apply universally, in part to atone for colonialism.\n \n\n   \n  But the proliferation of conflict and climate disasters – coupled with cheap travel, rising rates of literacy, and the ease of online communication – has put immense strain on the post-war architecture of asylum. At the end of last year, 123 million people worldwide were forcibly displaced according to the UN, up from about 44 million people in 2010. “Our asylum system was not designed to cope with this,” Britain’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer said bluntly Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Britain is now poised to embark on a policy route first charted by Denmark a decade ago. In 2015, Europe received its most requests for asylum in a single year since World War II, as civil wars in  Syria  and Libya helped spur around 1.3 million people to travel to the region, mostly from the Middle East. When Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel famously said “Wir schaffen das (We can do it)!” urging Germans to  welcome in refugees , Denmark took a different approach.\n \n\n   \n  Under Lars Løkke Rasmussen, Frederiksen’s predecessor as prime minister who then led the center-right Venstre party, Denmark aimed to reduce the number of asylum seekers, improve integration, and swiftly deport those who arrived illegally.\n \n\n   \n  Rasmussen, who is now the foreign minister, first made refugee status temporary, not permanent. Before 2015, refugees could stay in Denmark for five years, after which their residence permits would automatically become permanent. Now, residence permits last for only one or two years, and refugees must wait for eight years before they can apply for permanent status. Even then, it is not guaranteed: Refugees must be fluent in Danish and have held a full-time job for several years.\n \n\n   \n  Denmark has also made it harder for refugees to be joined by family members. Both must be aged 24 and above and have passed a Danish language test. The refugee must not have claimed government benefits for the past three years, and they must also put up a financial guarantee.\n \n\n   \n  Michala Clante Bendixen, head of the refugee advisory group Refugees Welcome Denmark, said removing the assumption that refugee status will become permanent has been detrimental to integration.\n \n\n   \n  “Attachment to the labor market, learning the language and understanding the society – these are very important things for successful integration,” Bendixen told CNN. But she feared the tightened requirements had “set the bar too high” for many new arrivals, discouraging some from trying at all – particularly older people with lower levels of education.\n \n\n   \n  “It creates a feeling of hopelessness. I’ve met so many refugees who say, ‘No matter what we do, it’s never good enough. I have done everything they require of me, and still it’s not enough,’” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Denmark has also been criticized for its policy on “ghettos” (now termed “parallel societies”), which allows the state to sell off or demolish housing estates where more than 50% of residents are from “non-Western” backgrounds. Successive Danish governments had worried about poor levels of integration in certain neighborhoods. In 2004, then-Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen warned of areas where “the men are unemployed, the women are isolated, and the families speak only the language of their home country.”\n \n\n   \n  A charitable interpretation of the “ghetto” law, introduced in 2018, is that it supports integration by encouraging people from different backgrounds to live together, not merely side-by-side. But not everyone is convinced. In February, a senior adviser to the EU’s top court said the policy amounts to discrimination based on ethnic origin.\n \n\n   \n  Other laws have also been criticized by human rights groups. Under the so-called “jewelry law,” authorities can seize assets worth over 10,000 Danish Krone (around $1,500) to help cover the cost of asylum support. The measure was only applied 17 times over its first six years, but still has dark historical resonances, with some drawing comparisons to confiscations of valuables by the Nazi regime.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Performative cruelty’\n \n\n   \n  Few dispute that Denmark’s policies have achieved their stated aim. In 2014, Denmark granted refugee status to 6,031 people. By 2019, that figure had dropped to 1,737.\n \n\n   \n  While Denmark grants far more residence permits today than it did 30 years ago, the vast majority of these go to students and workers, not refugees. Of the 99,811 residence permits Denmark granted last year, just 859 went to asylum seekers – less than 1%.\n \n\n   \n  “Denmark in recent decades has shown that it is politically and practically feasible to transition to a system of overall higher migration, and more employment- and education-intensive immigration,” according to a report last month from Bruegel, a Brussels-based economic think tank.\n \n\n   \n  Over time, this has deterred refugees from seeking asylum in Denmark. Britain’s Home Office said Denmark’s policies had reduced asylum claims to a 40-year low and resulted in the removal of 95% of those whose claims are rejected. In 2024, there were four new asylum claims per 10,000 people in Denmark, compared to 16 per 10,000 in Britain, and 20 per 20,000 for the European Union as a whole.\n \n\n   \n  Although the Danish model has won the Social Democrats praise abroad, some are growing disillusioned at home. In local elections Tuesday, Frederiksen’s party lost control of Copenhagen for the first time in more than a century. While much of the discontent is over the capital’s high housing costs, analysts say the party’s hardline stance on immigration has alienated its more progressive urban base.\n \n\n   \n  Whether the Danish model can be imported wholesale by other governments remains to be seen. Britain plans to quadruple the wait for permanent settlement from five years to 20 – much longer than the eight-year wait for refugees in Denmark. A refugee’s status will be reviewed every two-and-a-half years; if their home country is deemed to have become safe during that time, they will be deported. Those seeking asylum could also be stripped of assets including jewelry to cover the costs of their accommodation.\n \n\n   \n  Bendixen warned the new 20-year path to permanent settlement would destroy refugees’ sense of the future and make them “feel like they are second class citizens forever.”\n \n\n   \n  “Integration fails when you give young people the feeling that they don’t belong. That’s where you see gangs and crime and areas where people have their own rules. That’s because they don’t feel like they’re part of society. A rule like this would make (that feeling) much, much stronger,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Many UK Labour Party politicians would agree. Although Starmer, like Frederiksen, insists that a more stringent asylum system is compatible with the progressive values of compassion and tolerance, others say the proposals are needlessly cruel and will not have the desired effect.\n \n\n   \n  “Plans to leave refugees in a state of perpetual uncertainty about where and if they can rebuild their lives are not just performative cruelty, they are counterproductive to integration and the economy,” Stella Creasy, a Labour MP, said Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Alf Dubs, a Labour member of the House of Lords who came to Britain on the Kindertransport in 1939 fleeing the persecution of Jews in Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia, told the BBC that he was “depressed” by Labour’s hardline turn, and called the new measures “a shabby thing.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/politics/gop-failed-censure-vote-plaskett-mills","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"13:15:00Z","title":"Failed effort to censure Democrat over texts with Epstein sparks recriminations in the GOP","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A failed effort to censure Democrat Stacey Plaskett over her text exchanges with Jeffrey Epstein during a 2019 hearing sparked intense recriminations within the Republican Party.

Respers France, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:36 AM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   Nicki Minaj  addressed those gathered for a special event in New York on Tuesday meant to draw attention to what some are saying is the  plight of Christians in Nigeria .\n \n\n   \n  The rapper was introduced by President Donald Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations Mike Waltz and began her remarks by expressing her nervousness and thanking both Waltz and Trump. She then said it was “an honor” to be present “to shine a spotlight on the deadly threats faced by thousands of Christians in Nigeria.”\n \n\n   \n  “I stand here as a proud New Yorker with a deep sense of gratitude that we live in a country where we can freely and safely worship God regardless of one’s creed, background, or politics,” she said. “No group should ever be persecuted for practicing their religion, like I recently stated on social media. And we don’t have to share the same beliefs in order for us to respect each other.”\n \n\n   \n  The US president  recently sparked alarm in Nigeria  after he said he was considering military action there and would cease aid over what he claimed was the Nigerian government’s failure to protect Christians from a  “mass slaughter” by Islamist insurgents in the African nation.\n \n\n   \n  Experts have said the situation is  more nuanced than presented by the US president , with both Christians and Muslims being victims of violence by Islamic extremists.\n \n\n   \n  The Nigerian government also rejected Trump’s comments. “We are shocked that President Trump is mulling an invasion of our country,” Nigerian presidential spokesperson Bayo Onanuga told CNN after the US president instructed the Pentagon to prepare for possible military action.\n \n\n   \n  Calling Nigeria “a beautiful nation with deep faith traditions,” Minaj noted in her address on Tuesday that some of her devoted fanbase, known as the Barbz, live there.\n \n\n   \n  “I am joined here today by peace builders, by faith leaders, by those who saw violence, saw intolerance, saw the threats clearly before us and chose not to look the other way,” Minaj said. “I am inspired by their work to build interfaith ties, to see the humanity across the lines which might divide us and to vie and to fight for security and liberty for all those who pray.”\n \n\n   \n  Waltz shared how Minaj’s invitation to speak at the US mission in New York came about in an interview on Fox News on Tuesday morning, saying she was asked to speak after expressing support of a Truth Social post from Trump in connection with the Nigeria issue. “To our astonishment, she accepted,” Waltz said. “She is reaching a whole other swath of people who may not follow these issues, and it’s going to be a great day.”\n \n\n   \n  Waltz  wrote earlier this week  that the rapper “is not only arguably the greatest female recording artist, but also a principled individual who refuses to remain silent in the face of injustice.”\n \n\n   \n  “I’m grateful she’s leveraging her massive platform to spotlight the atrocities against Christians in Nigeria, and I look forward to standing with her as we discuss the steps the President and his administration are taking to end the persecution of our Christian brothers and sisters,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Minaj  posted about her gratitude  for the invitation on X.\n \n\n   \n  “Ambassador, I am so grateful to be entrusted with an opportunity of this magnitude,” she wrote. “I do not take it for granted. It means more than you know.”\n \n\n   \n  She also referenced her fanbase.\n \n\n   \n  “The Barbz & I will never stand down in the face of injustice,” Minaj wrote. “We’ve been given our influence by God. There must be a bigger purpose.”\n \n\n   \n  Minaj, who recently made headlines because of an explosive online beef with fellow rapper Cardi B, has offered her admiration for Trump before.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, she  shared a screenshot on X  of Trump’s Truth Social post about Nigeria and his plans to act, writing, “Reading this gave me a deep sense of gratitude.”\n \n\n   \n  “We live in a country where we can freely worship God,” she wrote. “No group should ever face persecution for practicing their faith. We don’t have to share the same beliefs to respect one another.”\n \n\n   \n  The White House TikTok account this month joined the viral “Beez In The Trap x What’s Up?” remix, which combines the 1992 4 Non Blondes hit “What’s Up?” with Minaj’s 2012 “Beez In The Trap.”\n \n\n   \n   The White House video  featured scenes of Trump and first lady Melania Trump along with the remix.\n \n\n   \n  Minaj responded in the comments on the video by thanking the Trumps and saying, “This is pretty incredible.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/politics/trump-epstein-files-release-house-senate-analysis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"12:00:00-05:00","title":"A Washington Humiliation Leaves Trump More Politically Exposed on Epstein Than Ever Before","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A bipartisan legislative effort in the U.S. House and Senate passed a bill requiring the Justice Department to release files related to the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, with only one vote against it.

12:00 AM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  To paraphrase a perennial Washington question: What is the president going to release and when is he going to release it?\n \n\n   \n  Donald Trump is reeling from a spectacular defeat, easily his worst from his own party on Capitol Hill during two turbulent presidencies, after every step he took to stall and deflect  the Jeffrey Epstein saga  blew up in his face.\n \n\n   \n  No one would have believed as recently as this past weekend that a bill requiring the Justice Department to release files related to the convicted sex offender would  race through the GOP Congress  with only  one vote against it  by Tuesday evening.\n \n\n   \n  But such can be the power of suddenly unleashed political justice.\n \n\n   \n  Now, Trump and his Attorney General Pam Bondi, who both triggered the political uproar by pledging to open the Epstein files, only to then refuse to do so, are back where they started. Only in a much more vulnerable political position.\n \n\n   \n  And they have unappetizing political choices at a moment when Trump’s presidency appears damaged,  his popularity is falling  and a crush of other intractable issues bogs down his White House. Speculation is growing about whether a president who many were recently warning was a dictator is close to becoming a lame duck.\n \n\n   \n    Vindication for victims\n \n\n   \n  The overwhelming House and Senate moves to release the Epstein files are a stunning triumph for Epstein’s victims after they became more visible earlier this summer. A president who believes he enjoys unfettered power and who disdains democracy was defeated by grassroots political campaigning in combination with a handful of courageous lawmakers from both parties.\n \n\n   \n  But Haley Robson, a survivor of Epstein’s abuse,  told CNN’s Erin Burnett  that Tuesday’s moves were not the end for women who long ago lost trust the government would protect them. “We have to be very honest with ourselves. … We do have a long road in front of us,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  But the pressure of the survivors’ campaign now threatens to bear down on Trump alone, after the House and the Senate moved with extraordinary speed to dump a radioactive political issue on the White House. Their pace might at least momentarily weigh on the mind of a president who was twice saved from conviction in an impeachment trial by pliant Republican senators.\n \n\n   \n  In one of the most startling developments, House Speaker Mike Johnson, who’d long opposed the bill before Trump’s reversal, insisted the Senate must make changes to the bill. But senators ignored him and passed it up to the White House in an instant.\n \n\n   \n  Unless Trump and Bondi release the Epstein files immediately, the question that’s been haunting Trump for months will now become even more acute: What is he hiding?\n \n\n   \n  A bid by the DOJ to play for time — perhaps by arguing documents cannot be released because of ongoing investigations — might obstruct the hopes of survivors. But it might also mean Trump never escapes a storm that, judging by his  eruptions at reporters , is driving him to distraction. Another DOJ strategy could be to release countless pages of Epstein files but with details, names and other information blacked out to avoid incriminating people. But that would only prolong the controversy.\n \n\n   \n  There’s been no evidence of criminal wrongdoing by Trump in relation to his former friendship with Epstein, who killed himself in prison in 2019. Trump again branded the drama a Democratic “hoax” on Tuesday. But  multiple mentions of the president  in emails sent by Epstein recently released by Congress raise the possibility that he’s also referenced in documents held by the DOJ.\n \n\n   \n  One option for Bondi could be a vast document dump that casts suspicion on multiple prominent men who victims say maintained ties to Epstein in the hope that any minor mentions of Trump might be swept away in a deluge of scandal. But as president, he’s under the harshest spotlight and would be sure to attract the most interest, even though he has said he always knew Epstein was a creep.\n \n\n   \n  Of course, Trump has turned his DOJ into an arm of his political movement. So it would not be a surprise to see partial disclosures that do not satisfy his critics. But such is the intrigue around the drama, that there is no guarantee people would believe that he’d released everything. And conspiracists who’ve obsessed about the Epstein issue will never be satisfied.\n \n\n   \n  “The next question is, will Trump use some other maneuvers in an effort to deny the information to the public that’s required by the statute?” Vermont Democratic Sen. Peter Welch said Tuesday. “We’ll see, but I don’t trust Trump on that.”\n \n\n   \n  Kentucky Republican Rep. Thomas Massie, who broke with Trump to force through the bill demanding the release of the Epstein files, warned after the vote that he would act if there was an attempt to thwart disclosure of the Epstein evidence. As a last resort, he said, he might read aloud the names of alleged associates of the accused sex trafficker in the House. But he added that was only “if we hit all of the walls — but so far, we’re making it through the walls and over the walls, and we’re getting this done.”\n \n\n   \n    What wider damage has Trump sustained?\n \n\n   \n  Beyond the difficulty of next steps for Trump, there are the questions of how much political damage he’s suffered in recent days, both within his own party and personal power base and in the country more broadly.\n \n\n   \n  Ever since returning to the White House, Trump has wielded massive power through dominance, or at least the perception that he’s all-powerful. He never followed his party; it followed him. But the myth of total power was shattered on Sunday night when he reversed his adamant position that the House should block the attempt to release the Epstein files.\n \n\n   \n  The flip-flop was an attempt to defuse a looming political loss. But if his myth of omnipotence frays, it’s likely only to encourage further challenges to his authority. Of course, Trump’s instinct might be to lash out with constitutionally questionable conduct.\n \n\n   \n  This is an unusual moment for Trump. Could it presage a new phase of his presidency where the GOP does not move in lockstep on his orders? Or is the Epstein issue — which, at least to begin with, was disproportionately important to the conservative base — a one-off?\n \n\n   \n  One test might come soon for Trump over whether GOP lawmakers revolt over another matter: the expiration of enhanced Obamacare subsidies, which triggered the government shutdown. Some GOP lawmakers want to compromise with Democrats on the issue, but  the president reiterated  on Tuesday that he opposed any solution that sends more money to insurance firms.\n \n\n   \n  The US political calendar is relentless. And following larger-than-expected victories by Democrats in governor’s races in Virginia and New Jersey this month, Republicans are wary about midterm elections next year. And onetime Trump ally  Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s  recent attacks on Trump’s globetrotting and lack of empathy over high prices suggest that frustration with him  cuts deeper than Epstein alone .\n \n\n   \n  Yet Trump is a survivor, and not just of two assassination attempts. He pulled off the greatest political comeback in history in 2024 despite a criminal conviction and after leaving power in disgrace in 2021 after refusing to accept the results of an election. No modern president has ever had such an unshakable connection with his base.\n \n\n   \n  Still, Trump’s most potent political strategy has been to claim he’s been persecuted. That’s not an approach that seems likely to work as he’s faced with victims of Epstein offering their testimony in public.\n \n\n   \n    Trump’s rough patch\n \n\n   \n  Stunning developments on the Epstein files are not happening in isolation. It’s been a terrible few weeks for Trump. His polling numbers have slumped, especially over his handling of the economy. In another potential blow to his aura of invincibility, a federal judge this week  raised grave questions  about the viability of the DOJ’s prosecution of one of his enemies, former FBI Director James Comey.\n \n\n   \n  The Supreme Court recently  seemed skeptical  about Trump’s tariff policy ahead of a seismic pending ruling on presidential authority. And a federal court on Tuesday  blocked Texas  from using new congressional maps drawn at the president’s behest to aid the GOP’s bid to hold on to its House majority in next year’s elections. (Texas plans to appeal to the US Supreme Court.)\n \n\n   \n  This leaves Trump needing a political rebound — a tough ask for a White House organized on the principle of the president’s infallibility and for a commander in chief who will be 80 on his next birthday.\n \n\n   \n  It’s possible Trump no longer controls his own political fate. Presidents often get overtaken by events in second terms — most recently George W. Bush, whose political capital was consumed by the Iraq war and Hurricane Katrina.\n \n\n   \n  And the symbolic might of Epstein’s long-overlooked victims has the look of a political force with unstoppable momentum.\n \n\n   \n  Epstein’s death deprived many of his victims of justice.\n \n\n   \n  But on Tuesday, Jess Michaels, an Epstein survivor, spoke about watching House members add their votes to a 427-1 victory that she told CNN’s Jake Tapper represented a commitment not to “stay silent about powerful predators.”\n \n\n   \n  There’s no evidence of criminal conduct by Trump. But his handling of the Epstein crisis now threatens to consume his presidency.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/us/texas-judge-blocks-ten-commandments-law","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"20:40:00-05:00","title":"Texas Judge Temporarily Blocks Law Requiring Ten Commandments in Schools","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal judge in Texas, Orlando L.

is trying to prevent another major bridge collapse \n       \n  By Alexandra Skores, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:00 AM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore could be repeated across the country if recommendations aren’t followed, the National Transportation Safety Board said Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  The board issued 17 safety recommendations this week to prevent an accident like the one last year, where the 213-million-pound cargo vessel Dali lost engine and electrical power as it was leaving the port and struck a pillar of the Key Bridge causing it to collapse.\n \n\n   \n  The NTSB recommended Synergy Marine, the ship’s operator, use thermal imaging to find lose wires on its other vessels, make sure the right pumps are being used, and that engines won’t automatically shut down in situations like this crash.\n \n\n   \n  Other recommendations include new rules for wire labeling, a warning system for drivers crossing bridges in case of emergency, and better recoding systems to capture data on ships in case of a crash.\n \n\n   \n  “In order to see safety change, we need our recommendations implemented,” NTSB chairwoman Jennifer Homendy told reporters after a nearly five hour public meeting. “That’s the next step. We’ve issued the safety recommendations now we need to make sure that they’re implemented, and so we will work diligently.”\n \n\n   \n  The NTSB held the public meeting Tuesday to determine the probable cause of the container ship Dali crashing into the Francis Scott Key Bridge, and its subsequent collapse, killing six people.\n \n\n   \n  The 984-feet long vessel operated in the container liner trade, carrying truck-sized boxes of cargo between Asia and the US East Coast. The bridge was owned and operated by the Maryland Transportation Authority and opened to traffic on March 23, 1977.\n \n\n   \n  The last time the bridge was inspected was in 2024 when it was given a satisfactory rating. Yet the Key Bridge had nearly 30 times the acceptable level of risk for critical bridges of collapse if it were hit, based on guidance established by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, the NTSB said. But no one knew that before the collapse, because the owner of the bridge, the Maryland Transportation Authority, never evaluated that risk.\n \n\n   \n  The agency says all of the blame for the bridge collapse is the fault of the ship.\n \n\n   \n  “The MDTA maintains that the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge and the tragic loss of life were the sole fault of the DALI and the gross negligence of its owners and operators,” it said in a statement to CNN Tuesday.  “The Key Bridge was approved and permitted by the federal government and complied with those permits.”\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, Synergy thanked the NTSB for its “professionalism and technical rigour” throughout this investigation and said it and Grace Ocean Investment Limited, the company that owns the ship, have cooperated fully with the board.\n \n\n   \n  “We note the Board’s findings, including its observations regarding the vulnerability of the Key Bridge’s main support pier, as well as the comments relating to aspects of the vessel’s electrical arrangements. These matters will be reviewed in detail with our technical teams, the vessel owner and counsel,” the statement said.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, the NTSB recommended risk assessments also be conducted on 68 other bridges in 19 states spanning waterways frequented by cargo ships that, like the Key Bridge, were built before 1991 and do not have a current vulnerability assessment.\n \n\n   \n  Among those on the list are the Golden Gate Bridge in California; Brooklyn, Manhattan, Williamsburg, George Washington and Verrazzano-Narrows bridges in New York City; the Walt Whitman and Benjamin Franklin bridges in Pennsylvania; the Sunshine Skyway in Florida and the Mackinac Bridge in Michigan.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, Homendy noted that despite its recommendations, some of those bridges still have not been evaluated for risk of collapse if a ship like the Dali were to hit them.\n \n\n   \n    One loose wire, among thousands\n \n\n   \n  The NTSB said Tuesday it believes the probable cause of the power outage that led to the crash was a label was put in the wrong place on a signal wire when the ship was built. That sticker, identifying the line, kept the wire from getting a good connection in a circuit breaker – which in turn ultimately caused the first blackout.\n \n\n   \n  As a result, according to Marcel Muse, the NTSB’s investigator in charge, the vessel lost steering, the ability to operate the bow thruster, key water pumps, and most of the vessel’s lighting and equipment essential for operations. That first outage lasted 58 seconds.\n \n\n   \n  There were thousands of wires on the Dali, and one loose wire would not have been easily found by the crew.\n \n\n   \n  “The Dali is almost 1,000 feet, and it’s as long as the Eiffel Tower,” Homendy said. “It’s high with miles of wiring and thousands of electrical connections. Locating a single wire that is loose among thousands of wires is like looking for a loose bolt in the Eiffel Tower.”\n \n\n   \n  The crew onboard the Dali quickly found the tripped breaker, the NTSB said. Power came back within 58 seconds, but restarting a key pump that would have provided fuel to generators had to be done manually, and that didn’t happen. When the generators ran out of gas in their lines, the result was a second blackout.\n \n\n   \n  “To restart it, you would have to go two levels down in near total darkness with a flashlight from the engine control deck to the purifier room on the fourth deck,” Homendy said.\n \n\n   \n  The pump the Dali was using was designed for maintenance and was not intended for use while the ship was underway, so there was no backup system.\n \n\n   \n  At the time of the second blackout, the Dali was just three ships’ lengths from the bridge and despite the pilots reacting properly, they couldn’t regain control in time to avoid hitting it, the NTSB said.\n \n\n   \n  About 10 hours earlier, while the ship was still moored, it experienced two onboard blackouts, one caused by a crew error, according to the NTSB.\n \n\n   \n  Last year, Grace Ocean and Synergy reached  a settlement  with the Justice Department to pay nearly $102 million to resolve a civil claim alleging that the companies’ cost-cutting and negligence in the ship’s maintenance led to the disastrous collision.\n \n\n   \n  In its filing last month, the Justice Department said that the “tragedy was entirely avoidable,” pointing to alleged failures in the ship’s infrastructure.\n \n\n   \n    Black boxes didn’t give up information easily\n \n\n   \n  Investigators also encountered many issues extracting information from the vessel’s recorders, which are similar to black boxes on airplanes.\n \n\n   \n  Voyage data recorders, known as a VDRs, are electronic systems that continuously record navigational and location data, radar images, basic engine operations, alarm status, bridge audio recordings and VHF radio communications, according to the NTSB.\n \n\n   \n  Sean Payne, an investigator in the NTSB’s vehicle recorder division, said during the investigation, the NTSB encountered several problems that made it hard to extract and use the data efficiently.\n \n\n   \n  “Key issues included unrecorded data during the vessel’s first underway blackout, the lack of recording of communications between the Dali’s bridge and the Dali’s engine room, the digitally destructive mixing of recorded bridge audio channels, inadequate VDR playback software, the inability to download the full data set on board the Dali, and the complex workflow for processing proprietary VDR data in the common formats,” he explained.\n \n\n   \n    Final report coming soon\n \n\n   \n  The final report on the incident will be revised and issued in several weeks and the 17 recommendations will be formally issued and finalized by the NTSB.\n \n\n   \n  “We have a really big voice, and we’re not afraid to use it,” Homendy said. “While we don’t have enforcement power, certainly, we have had a lot of success with voluntary adoption of our recommendations. We’re usually at an 83% closure rate.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Michelle Watson contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/americas/venezuelan-propaganda-conflict-us-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"12:00:00.000Z","title":"Venezuela’s propaganda machine lashes back with jokes, cartoons and sarcasm as US pressure ramps up","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In response to escalating U.S. military presence and threats—such as airstrikes and calls for troop deployment—Venezuela has intensified its domestic propaganda campaign.

   \nUpdated: \n        12:00 AM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  It’s a bird! It’s a plane! It’s…not Superman?\n \n\n   \n  No, it’s Super Mustache, Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro’s cartoon alter-ego, here to save the South American country from peril. \n \n\n   \n  “ Super Mustache ,” which has aired on Venezuelan state TV since 2021, is just one piece of the country’s propaganda push as  US warships amass  near the Venezuelan coast and US President Donald Trump  muses  about sending troops to depose Maduro.\n \n\n   \n  In  a September episode  of “Super Mustache,” aired shortly after Trump began his campaign of airstrikes on alleged drug boats off the Venezuelan coast, the cartoon superhero doffed his usual costume in favor of a military uniform, wielding a  sheathed sword  and declaring that Venezuela doesn’t have a “warmongering culture.”\n \n\n   \n  Yet despite Super Mustache’s new look, the Venezuelan government has sent mixed messages since tensions increased with the US, simultaneously urging citizens to prepare for action while insisting that everything is fine.\n \n\n   \n  The dissonance between the gravity of the crisis in the Caribbean and the regime’s messaging is visible on the streets of Caracas. Unlike in previous nationwide campaigns, CNN teams in Venezuela have not seen any billboards, banners, murals, or graffiti in the national capital calling for support for the regime’s war footing, even in neighborhoods considered government strongholds.\n \n\n   \n     Different strategies \n \n\n   \n  Maduro, who prior to August was more commonly seen in enclosed spaces, has been making speeches and public appearances almost daily since tensions began to rise with the United States, often seen surrounded by a significant security detail, according to Venezuelan researcher and journalist Andrés Cañizález.\n \n\n   \n  Maduro hasn’t taken on the job of projecting Venezuela’s military might in the face of Trump’s threats. He has instead portrayed himself as a peacemaker, even  singing John Lennon’s song “Imagine”  at a public event, urging Trump to come to the table for talks face-to-face. As he waded through the crowd at a rally on November 13, Maduro  told  CNN’s Stefano Pozzebon that the US should unite with Venezuela for peace in the Americas.\n \n\n   \n  Cañizález believes the Maduro government’s communication strategy has gone through different stages: initially, tensions with the US were downplayed, but as the US military presence in the Caribbean increased, the discourse shifted “to a more threatening, more retaliatory tone.”\n \n\n   \n  Maduro’s counterpoint in Venezuela’s propaganda machine is Diosdado Cabello, the interior minister and host of one of the country’s most popular talk shows on state TV – “ Con el Mazo Dando, ” Spanish for “Hitting it with a Club.” In a typical four-hour episode, Cabello meanders between attacking opposition politicians, telling jokes and promoting the government’s position.\n \n\n   \n  Chief among those positions is that US actions in the Caribbean have nothing to do with drugs, despite what the  Trump administration insists .\n \n\n   \n  “There are no tensions here between Venezuela and the United States. Here there is an aggression by the United States against Venezuela,” Cabello declared on his episode last week. “And the aggression has nothing to do with drugs, or terrorism, or criminal gangs, it has to do with taking control of Venezuela’s natural resources.”\n \n\n   \n  On every episode, the interior minister reads out criticisms of the Maduro government, usually from Republican politicians in the US, then responds with a recording of the late President Hugo Chavez daring the United States to try and invade Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  Political scientist Javier Corrales, who often writes about Venezuelan politics, told CNN that Cabello has long cultivated an aggressive reputation as part of the regime’s old guard.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s a bully,” Corrales said. “There is a certain aspect of Cabello that we recognize in other autocracies, the need to have somebody not just praising the president, but trashing the opposition - and Cabello is amazing.”\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks, Venezuela’s military has also posted numerous videos on social media showing soldiers preparing for war, usually set to dramatic music. Footage shows troops conducting shooting drills, anti-tank fortifications in Caracas, and militia members posing with weapons.\n \n\n   \n     Going easy on Trump \n \n\n   \n  Yet, in their different approaches, Maduro and Cabello share one feature: a reluctance to criticize Trump too harshly. Both men have a lot to say about US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n \n\n   \n  In Cabello’s telling, Rubio, whom the interior minister often calls “the Crazy Cuban,” is intent on leading a reluctant Trump to declare war on Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  “This move to seek a change of government in Venezuela isn’t even to satisfy the interests of…Trump or MAGA, but rather those of Rubio and the Cuban American mafia,” Cabello announced to his live studio audience during last week’s episode.\n \n\n   \n  Corrales explained that Rubio is a perfect foil for the Maduro regime, being perhaps the most prominent critic of Latin American leftism in the US government. The secretary’s Cuban heritage and Florida origins also provide fodder for Cabello, who often claims that Rubio is aiming to please an electorate of anti-communist Cuban exiles in Miami.\n \n\n   \n  Cañizález told CNN that while Trump might be criticized, Rubio is a useful “external enemy” for the regime’s most loyal supporters.\n \n\n   \n  Rubio “is presented as the direct enemy of the revolution,” Cañizález said. “This tactic seeks to sow divisions in US domestic politics and reinforce the idea of a personalized external enemy, useful for uniting the Chavista base.”\n \n\n   \n  Even after Trump ordered strikes on alleged drug boats directly off the Venezuelan coast in September, Cabello claimed in his show on September 3   that Rubio is “leading Trump to the slaughter, because Rubio is trying to fracture Trump’s MAGA base and…sell himself as a new hawk within the Republican Party.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the US State Department about Cabello’s claims.\n \n\n   \n  Even   though Cabello often talks about preparing for all scenarios, including possible military conflict, he occasionally downplays Trump’s announced actions against Venezuela. Shortly after Trump publicly authorized the CIA to conduct covert actions in the country, Cabello mocked as ridiculous the idea that the CIA had ever been inactive in Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  “Yes, (the CIA) has been formally authorized to act,” Cabello said sarcastically. “It never acted here before.”\n \n\n   \n  Herein lies the dilemma for Venezuela’s leadership: mobilizing support against external enemies while avoiding the panic of a country under siege.

Every time someone new arrived, there was an eruption of hugs and cheerful greetings.\n \n\n   \n  The scene could have easily been a joyful reunion of old friends.\n \n\n   \n  But the group was made up of the  survivors of Jeffrey Epstein , forever bonded by their trauma and abuse at the hands of the convicted pedophile. The women had once again descended on Washington, DC, to hold a press conference and plead with lawmakers to  vote to release the Epstein files .\n \n\n   \n  Dani Bensky, who met Epstein when she was a young ballerina, said she had managed to get just a few hours of sleep the previous night. She had spent the evening with the family of the late Epstein victim  Virginia Giuffre , making the most out of the fact that they are rarely in the same place at the same time. It was past midnight when she realized she still hadn’t written out the remarks she would need to make at a press conference just hours later.\n \n\n   \n  “Who writes a speech at one o’clock in the morning the night before? Ai yai yai, rookie mistake on my part,” Bensky said lightheartedly after the press conference, as she quickly made her way to a meeting that was scheduled with a lawmaker. Her fellow survivors, walking alongside her, were quick to reassure her that she had done just fine.\n \n\n   \n  Throughout the day, the women stayed close together much like this — there to offer each other pep talks and reminders to drink water and eat; quietly squeezing one another’s hands; and making sure nobody got lost in the maze of hallways on Capitol Hill as they hoped for good news.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Can we give you a hug?’\n \n\n   \n  In the late morning, the women found themselves consoling Republican Rep. Nancy Mace.\n \n\n   \n  The South Carolina congresswoman walked out into the foyer of her office in the Longworth building in tears. She has been ensnared in a legal battle of her own after  accusing her ex-fiancé  of crimes including physical assault, rape and sex trafficking — allegations he strongly denies.\n \n\n   \n  “You’ve given me hope that one day I might get justice,” Mace told the Epstein survivors. “It’s very raw for me.”\n \n\n   \n  “Can we give you a hug?” one woman jumped in to ask.\n \n\n   \n  “Yes, I would love a hug,” Mace responded, which prompted several women to take turns embracing the lawmaker.\n \n\n   \n  Mace was one of only four House Republicans to support a discharge petition to force a House vote on the Epstein files. When an Epstein survivor told the congresswoman that the group had been holding their breath and hoping Mace wouldn’t cave to political pressure and abandon her support for the bill, Mace responded: “Yeah, I ran out of fucks to give a long time ago.”\n \n\n   \n  “We rarely get this chance. This moment is historic,” she said. “Women never get this chance.”\n \n\n   \n  Annie Farmer, who said she was 16 when Epstein and his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell abused her, told CNN it was impossible for her now to imagine going through this experience alone.\n \n\n   \n  “Every time a large group gathers, it completely changes the dynamic and the experience,” Farmer said. “It really does move us from feeling fearful to feeling like we are feared. We have power together.”\n \n\n   \n  Her sister, Maria, is one of the earliest known Epstein accusers. As Farmer made her way from meeting to meeting on Tuesday, more than once, she was on the phone, keeping her sister apprised of developments.\n \n\n   \n  At 2:43 p.m., the gavel came down in the House — the  Epstein bill had passed  on an overwhelming 427-1 vote.\n \n\n   \n  As soon as she stepped out of the House gallery after passage, Farmer was back on her phone, calling Maria to share the news.\n \n\n   \n  “It was just incredible to hear her voice and to be able to tell her it passed and it happened and you were such a big part of it,” Annie said.\n \n\n   \n    ‘It kills me that she’s not here’\n \n\n   \n  One Epstein victim was not present on Capitol Hill on Tuesday but her presence could be felt everywhere that the group of survivors went.\n \n\n   \n  Giuffre, one of the most prominent victims of Epstein’s sex-trafficking ring, died by suicide in August. In her  posthumously published memoir  released last month, she wrote about having been lent out to an endless stream of wealthy and powerful people. “I believed that I might die a sex slave,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  When Giuffre’s brother, Sky Roberts, spoke at the survivors’ press conference and credited his sister for having helped to advance the fight for accountability and transparency, tears streamed down the faces of Giuffre’s fellow victims standing behind Roberts.\n \n\n   \n  “Sissy,” Roberts said. “You didn’t just make a small dent. You made a monumental impact, a resounding statement that echoed across the world. You built an unbreakable wall, a barrier that will protect future generations from the horrors of abuse.”\n \n\n   \n  Bensky, who credits Giuffre for having shaped her own decision to go public with her Epstein story, said she has wondered what Giuffre would have made of this moment.\n \n\n   \n  “It kills me that she’s not here to see it,” Bensky said. “It’s so wrong that she’s just not here. It’s kind of devastating to think that we’re doing this without her.”\n \n\n   \n  Many of the other survivors wore brightly colored butterfly pins on their lapels on Tuesday in Giuffre’s memory. For Bensky and Farmer, their green and pink jeweled brooches were all the more meaningful because they were gifts given to them by Roberts.\n \n\n   \n  “Virginia chose the symbol of the butterfly because of the metamorphosis and this real belief she had that there could be post-traumatic growth — that you could go through something like this and come out the other side and have so much to give and share,” Farmer told CNN. “And that’s what she did.”\n \n\n   \n  After the passage of the House’s Epstein bill, the women gathered in the early evening to hold a vigil honoring all of Epstein’s victims, including those who have passed. It was right around when Farmer was paying tribute to Giuffre that Bensky got a whisper in her ear: The Senate had decided to pass the Epstein bill immediately.\n \n\n   \n  Many of the survivors had assumed that the bill’s path through the Senate — and to President Donald Trump’s desk — could be long and arduous and had been preparing for another major battle.\n \n\n   \n  “Words will never ever be able to describe this day,” Bensky said. “We just feel like we never have gotten the win, and we got the win. And that feels so good.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/tech/cloudflare-down-outage-cause","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"10:02:00-04:00","title":"Why it feels like your favorite websites keep going down","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explains how a technical failure at web infrastructure provider Cloudflare on November 18, 2025, disrupted major online services such as Spotify, ChatGPT, and Truth Social, highlighting a broader trend of increasing frequency and impact of outages in cloud-based digital services.

\n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Having problems with your favorite websites lately? It’s not just you.\n \n\n   \n  Web infrastructure provider Cloudflare experienced a disruption on Tuesday that temporarily impacted a swath of online services – from Spotify to ChatGPT and even President Donald Trump’s Truth Social platform – marking the latest in a string of high-profile internet outages.\n \n\n   \n  An  Amazon Web Services issue  disrupted the daily routines of millions of people last month, in some cases preventing them from doing even simple tasks like ordering coffee or managing smart home appliances. Just days later,  Microsoft’s Azure service  was hit with an outage.\n \n\n   \n  According to experts, it’s a sign of the times – a combination of society’s  increased reliance on digital services , the consolidation of critical cloud infrastructure between just a few companies and the proclivity of people to complain about tech mishaps online.\n \n\n   \n  It also shows that no one, not even major tech companies, are immune to tech malfunctions.\n \n\n   \n  “It really almost doesn’t matter how well-situated the provider is in these cases, or even how sophisticated the IT organization and infrastructure is for a private business,” said Eileen Haggerty, area vice president of product and solutions marketing for IT and cybersecurity firm Netscout. Tech disruptions like these are “very, very common problems.”\n \n\n   \n    What happened at Cloudflare\n \n\n   \n  Cloudflare’s outage was the result of a technical issue, not a cyberattack or malicious behavior, the company said in a statement to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The company said the outage was caused by a “configuration file” that was meant to manage “threat traffic.”\n \n\n   \n  “The file grew beyond an expected size of entries and triggered a crash in the software system that handles traffic for a number of Cloudflare’s services,” the statement said.   \n \n\n   \n  Dane Knecht, chief technology officer at Cloudflare, shared additional details  in a post on X  on Tuesday afternoon. In short: a routine configuration change caused a bug to crash, which “cascaded into a broad degradation to our network and other services.”\n \n\n   \n  “Work is already underway to make sure it does not happen again, but I know it caused real pain today,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  The Amazon outage similarly  involved a bug , which kicked off when two automated systems tried to update the same data simultaneously.\n \n\n   \n  IT outages are relatively common, tech experts say.   Twenty years ago, it was typical   for IT services to down “all the time,” said Mike Chapple, an IT professor at the University of Notre Dame and former computer scientist for the National Security Agency.\n \n\n   \n  “It would not be unusual to go a week at work having at least one outage of some IT service,” he said, noting that now everyone relies on the same large providers.\n \n\n   \n  The impacts can be widely felt when they happen at the major providers, such as Amazon, Microsoft and Google, that serve as the backbone of the web.   \n \n\n   \n  Issues submitted to Downdetector, a website that tracks user-reported problems with popular online platforms, surpassed 2.1 million on Tuesday, according to data provided to CNN by Downdetector parent company Ookla.\n \n\n   \n  Cloudflare says it handles 81 million HTTP requests – or when web browsers need certain data to trigger an action, such as loading a webpage – per second on average.\n \n\n   \n    Are there really more outages happening lately?\n \n\n   \n  That there have been three widespread outages in less than a month is a coincidence. But Haggerty acknowledged that it certainly feels like these outages are happening more often, mostly because of the scale of their impact.\n \n\n   \n  The number of service outages has “remained consistent,” but the “number of sites and applications dependent on these services has increased, making them more disruptive to users,” Angelique Medina, head of internet intelligence for Cisco ThousandEyes, told CNN in an emailed statement.\n \n\n   \n  Cisco’s network monitoring service has logged 12 major outages in 2025 so far, according to  a timeline published on its website , not counting Tuesday’s Cloudflare disruption.\n \n\n   \n  That compares to 23 in 2024, 13 in 2023 and 10 in 2022. A  sweeping Crowdstrike outage  upended businesses, flights and hospitals around the world in 2024.\n \n\n   \n  There are some common trends between outages that occurred in the first half of 2025,  according to Cisco . A string of outages were linked to systems accidentally spreading tech failures, systems that appeared to be functioning properly despite silent issues occurring and configuration changes that cascaded.\n \n\n   \n  While these trends aren’t new, Cisco’s blog post says it’s been “seeing more of these types of disruptions with more far-reaching consequences.”\n \n\n   \n  And it’ll likely happen again.\n \n\n   \n  “They aren’t something you’d say, ‘Well, thank God that would never happen to us,’” said Haggerty. “All of these could actually happen to any business.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Hadas Gold contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/us/roman-surovtsev-ukraine-deportation-hope","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"20:26:00-11:18","title":"A Dallas Dad Came to Terms with His Imminent Deportation.

In a Monday post on X, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin called Surovtsev a “criminal illegal alien” with “a history of violence,” citing carjacking and burglary charges alongside a number of other offenses of which he hasn’t been convicted.\n \n\n   \n  On Sunday night, he used the center’s tablet to call his wife, family and in-laws to say what he believed were his final goodbyes. Immigration officials wouldn’t tell Surovtsev, his attorneys or Samantha when or where specifically he was being removed, citing security concerns, his wife said.\n \n\n   \n  All they could do now was wait.\n \n\n   \n  Monday passed in agonizing quiet. Samantha sat by the phone for hours, waiting for confirmation that the worst had happened, that Surovtsev had been officially deported.\n \n\n   \n  His immigration attorney finally called at 3:29 p.m. She stepped outside, away from the sounds of her young daughters playing inside.\n \n\n   \n  “The stay has been granted,” the attorney told her. The flight full of detainees would still leave for Ukraine, but he wouldn’t be on it.\n \n\n   \n    ‘God’s timing is perfect’\n \n\n   \n  Roman Surovtsev was born in the former Soviet Union in 1984 and fled to the US legally with his mother and two siblings when he was 4 years old. Although they found relief from Soviet rule in their new country, he grew up in poverty and instability.\n \n\n   \n  In 2003, at 19 years old, Surovtsev began serving a 13-year sentence after helping some friends commit an armed carjacking of a motorcycle in California. In prison, he was baptized, a turning point that transformed him, his wife said.\n \n\n   \n  He met Samantha in 2017 while jet skiing with mutual friends in Orange County, and the two eventually married, bought a home outside Dallas, launched a painting business and started a family. Surovtsev has never violated the terms of his supervision order, his lawyers wrote in court filings.\n \n\n   \n  When Samantha hung up with the attorney on Monday, her heart racing, she rang the tablet at the detention center.\n \n\n   \n  “Are you listening?” she asked Surovtsev when he picked up. “They issued the stay, and they’re reopening your case.”\n \n\n   \n  His lawyers thought it would take two to three months to hear from a judge about the motion to reopen his case, which they filed November 4.\n \n\n   \n  Surovtsev wept. “God’s timing is perfect,” he told her.\n \n\n   \n  “We had accepted that Roman would be on that plane, and I was thinking about what our lives are going to look like and if we could ever get to him again,” Samantha said. “And suddenly, it’s all reversed, because there’s still hope.”\n \n\n   \n  She spent the rest of the day telling family and friends the news.\n \n\n   \n  That night, as Samantha tucked their daughters into bed, her 5-year-old asked if they could call dad. For months, Samantha had told the girls that their father was simply “at work.”\n \n\n   \n  When he picked up the tablet, the two talked excitedly about all the things they planned to do when Surovtsev came home. He promised her he would build a massive Barbie dollhouse to go into the attic playroom he made for his girls.\n \n\n   \n  His daughter squealed with excitement.\n \n\n   \n    Decades of legal battles, time served and reform led to the stay\n \n\n   \n  Surovtsev was released early on good behavior in 2014 when an immigration court judge ordered him to be deported. He lost his green card, and he was placed into ICE custody, but the agency ran into trouble removing him from the country.\n \n\n   \n  Having been born in the former Soviet Union, the Russian Consulate told the US government in early 2015 it had no records of Surovtsev, his lawyers wrote in court filings. The Ukrainian government also said at the time it couldn’t confirm his citizenship given that Surovtsev was from a region of Ukraine that’s at war and not readily reachable, and therefore could not issue him Ukrainian travel documents.\n \n\n   \n  Subsequently, Surovtsev was released from ICE custody in May 2015 on an order of supervision without his green card but with an employment authorization document, a work permit, and was required to wear an ankle monitor for six months. He checked in with ICE every other week before his visits became quarterly, then annual.\n \n\n   \n  For years, he checked in at the kiosk of the Dallas ICE office, confirming details like his address and any travel plans in between starting his own business and building a family.\n \n\n   \n  His unexpected detainment during a routine check-in on August 1 mobilized Samantha, who rallied a team of lawyers to represent him.\n \n\n   \n  His counsel was able to successfully vacate Surovtsev’s carjacking charge, essentially wiping it from his record, on the grounds that he received ineffective counsel back in 2014, Surovtsev’s immigration lawyer Jennifer Rozdzielski said. This empowered his attorneys to file a motion earlier this month to reopen his old criminal case in hopes of getting it dismissed.\n \n\n   \n  In the 11th hour on Monday, just before he was to board the deportation flight bound for Ukraine, a court in California agreed to hear his case and ordered a stay of his removal, barring the US government from deporting him.\n \n\n   \n  “Respondent has demonstrated new, material evidence to warrant reopening of these proceedings,” the order, reviewed by CNN, reads. “His convictions were vacated pursuant to California Penal Code 1473.7(a)(1), specifically due to constitutional defects in the underlying criminal proceedings, so Respondent met his ‘heavy burden’ to show that his evidence ‘would likely change the result’ in his case.”\n \n\n   \n  Surovtsev will remain in detention while the court proceedings play out.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re just thankful that plane took off without him, and that the judge ruled the way she did, because all we wanted was time for our case to be heard. And we got it,” Samantha said.\n \n\n   \n  But Surovtsev’s team has acknowledged that the fight isn’t over.\n \n\n   \n  “What’s next is making sure that not a single other Ukrainian who’s in detention is sent back to that country,” said Eric Lee, one of Surovtsev’s attorneys.\n \n\n   \n    The flight carrying dozens of detainees still took off for Ukraine, attorneys said\n \n\n   \n  Surovtsev’s relief while his court proceedings play out comes at a bittersweet moment for his legal team and other families. Some deportees boarded Monday’s flight and are now in Ukraine, his attorneys said.\n \n\n   \n  “However many people were ultimately successfully deported to Ukraine are probably fighting for their lives right now,” said Lee. “We’re glad at least one person was prevented from going on that flight, but we’re very upset about all the others and very, very sorry for their families.”\n \n\n   \n  Samantha has been in contact with several other families with loved ones who were deported on Monday’s flight. None of them have been able to get ahold of them yet, she said.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to DHS for comment on the flight to Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  One family is tracking their deportee’s phone, with an app showing it on the move inside Ukraine, Samantha said. But he’s not answering their calls, and they’re not sure if he still has his phone.\n \n\n   \n  Another detainee has a background similar to Surovtsev – a USSR child refugee who got into trouble as a teenager, served his sentence and moved through adulthood with a supervision order from ICE, his attorney Ann Peters said. Her client, who also narrowly missed being deported Monday, is the primary caretaker of his brother, a paralyzed Marine Corps veteran.\n \n\n   \n  As Samantha and other detainees’ families sit in legal limbo during what feels like an endless pursuit to see their loved ones again, Samantha said the Bible verse Romans 8:31 is keeping her warm.\n \n\n   \n  “If God is for us, who can be against us?”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/americas/venezuela-maria-corina-machado-freedom-manifesto-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"19:57:00-05:00","title":"Venezuela’s opposition leader publishes ‘freedom manifesto’ from hiding as Maduro opens door to dialogue with Trump","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Venezuela’s opposition leader María Corina Machado publishes a 'freedom manifesto' from hiding, outlining a vision for a democratic Venezuela free from Nicolás Maduro’s authoritarian rule.

publishes ‘freedom manifesto’ from hiding as Maduro opens door to dialogue with Trump \n       \n  By Michael Rios, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:57 PM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Venezuela’s opposition leader  María Corina Machado  has published a “freedom manifesto” outlining her vision of a “new era” for the country without its strongman Nicolás Maduro.\n \n\n   \n  The four-page document, dated November 9 but made public on Tuesday, lays out the democratic pillars she says all Venezuelans are entitled to, including the rights to vote, assemble and exercise free speech.\n \n\n   \n  Borrowing language from other democratic frameworks, such as the US Declaration of Independence, the text calls for decentralizing power from the government and restoring it to the public. “Every Venezuelan is born with inalienable rights that have been conferred upon them by our Creator, not by men,” part of the document reads.\n \n\n   \n  Machado, who read the entire manifesto in a 15-minute video from an undisclosed location, declared that Maduro’s tight grip on power was coming to an end. Machado was driven into hiding after a disputed election last year, in which government-controlled electoral authorities declared Maduro the winner.\n \n\n   \n  “A new Venezuela is emerging from the ashes, renewed in spirit and united in purpose, like a phoenix reborn – fierce, radiant, and unstoppable,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the Venezuelan government for comment.\n \n\n   \n  David Smilde, a Venezuela expert at Tulane University, said that Machado likely published the manifesto to bring attention back to Venezuelans’ democratic struggle and assure supporters she has a plan for the country if Maduro eventually steps down.\n \n\n   \n  He said the manifesto resembles a “proto-constitution” but noted that Machado didn’t mention whether she would suspend the current constitution, impose a new one, or call a constitutional assembly. “So the natural question is: What is the status of this?” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Machado’s declaration comes as Maduro is confronting a US military build-up off Venezuela’s Caribbean shores. The US has amassed more than a dozen warships and some 15,000 troops in the region as part of what the Pentagon says is a mission to disrupt drug trafficking from Latin America.  It’s considered the  largest US military presence  in the region since the invasion of Panama in 1989.\n \n\n   \n  US officials say President Donald Trump is still  weighing  whether to carry out an attack inside Venezuela, though he has hinted that a diplomatic window may be opening.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said Monday he would be open to speaking directly with Maduro at a “certain time,” suggesting he sees a pathway in the country that doesn’t involve dropping bombs or sending commandos to take Maduro out.\n \n\n   \n  Maduro also suggested Monday night that he would be open to dialogue with his American counterpart. “Anyone who wants to talk to Venezuela will talk face to face,” he said on state TV when asked to respond to Trump’s comments.\n \n\n   \n  Venezuela’s government has condemned the military build-up, calling it an attempt to oust Maduro from power.\n \n\n   \n  Machado, who has welcomed the US pressure, said in her manifesto that Maduro must be held accountable for his actions, claiming he has committed crimes against humanity including torture, killings and forced disappearances. Venezuela in the past has denied such claims.\n \n\n   \n  Smilde, whose research covers Chavismo, the leftist ideology associated with Maduro’s party, noted that in Machado’s call for justice, she didn’t discuss reconciliation among Venezuelans.\n \n\n   \n  “She doesn’t try to reach out to Chavismo at all here and say, ‘We need this process of reconciliation. We’re all Venezuelans.’ Nothing like that. So it tells me this is a document that is basically oriented toward the international community,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  In October, Machado was awarded the  Nobel Peace Prize  for keeping “the flame of democracy burning amid a growing darkness.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5607997","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"02:26:00-05:00","title":"Heard on Morning Edition: Winners of the 2025 National Book Awards","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The 2025 National Book Awards celebrated diverse voices and global perspectives through literary achievements.

employers added 119,000 jobs in September \n         By Scott Horsley \n        \n           Updated Thursday, November 20, 2025 • 9:14 AM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Morning Edition \n        \n      \n\n         Hiring picked up in the early fall after a lackluster summer. An  overdue report from the Labor Department  Thursday showed U.S. employers added 119,000 jobs in September, while the unemployment rate inched up to 4.4%.  The report was released almost seven weeks behind schedule due to the government shutdown. And because the shutdown also delayed data-gathering, there won't be another jobs report until mid-December.   While the newly released information is a bit stale, it may offer some clues about the pace of hiring and firing this fall.  The report paints a mixed picture of the job market.  Hiring was strongest in health care and hospitality in September, while factories and warehouses cut jobs.  Downsizing in the federal government also continued during the month, though state and local governments continued to add jobs. Revised data shows job growth in July and August was even weaker than initially reported, with 33,000 fewer jobs added during those months.  For months now, employers have neither added many new workers nor handed out a lot of pink slips. But Federal Reserve Governor Chris Waller worries that's about to change.  Waller says his conversations with business leaders show the job market is close to stalling.  \"Four to six weeks ago, we were still in this kind of no-hire/no-fire mode,\" Waller told a group of economists in London this week.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Business leaders, he said, are \"starting to talk about layoffs.  They're starting to plan for them in the future.\"  Amazon recently announced  14,000 job cuts  and Verizon is cutting 15,000 workers.  Waller wants the Fed to cut interest rates again when policymakers meet next month, to boost demand and prop up the labor market. But  minutes from the last Fed meeting , released on Wednesday, show considerable disagreement among central bank policymakers.  Many members of the Fed's rate-setting committee suggested it would be appropriate to hold interest rates steady for the rest of the year, noting that inflation has remained stubbornly above the Fed's 2% target. That's partly due to President Trump's tariffs. And some Fed policymakers think the import taxes will continue to put upward pressure on goods prices well into next year.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Ordinarily, the Fed would have jobs numbers for October and November in hand before its next meeting.  But because of the government shutdown, those reports won't be released until after the meeting, and some of the October data won't come out at all.  It's also uncertain when or if the October inflation report will be published. That said, Waller insists he and his colleagues are not flying blind.  They've been listening to businesses like Target and McDonald's that say many of their customers are cautious with their spending right now. That could put more of a squeeze on the job market. \"You just go talk with firms that work with low- and middle-income households, they'll tell you point-blank, they're just not coming in the door,\" Waller said. \"And then these firms are not going to be hiring.\"  While government data on consumer spending has also been held up by the shutdown, anecdotal reports suggest only the wealthiest families are spending freely these days, buoyed in part by the gains in their stock portfolios.   The unemployment rate is driven by two forces: the number of jobs employers want to fill and the number of workers available to fill those jobs.  The Trump administration's crackdown on immigration has limited the number of foreign-born workers, at the same time many native-born baby boomers are retiring.  Some analysts argue the limited supply of workers is largely responsible for the slowdown in hiring.   Waller worries the slowdown is driven more by a declining need for workers, which could result in higher unemployment in the months to come.    \"There's definitely a reduction of supply,\" he said. \"But to me that is masking the reduction in demand and that's what I'm concerned about.\"    \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5612585","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"06:00:00-05:00","title":"Wicked: For Good – This all could’ve been just one good movie","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reviews Wicked: For Good, the sequel to Wicked: Part I, which expands the Broadway musical’s second act into a two-part film.

Our national nightmare — the year-long wait between Jon M. Chu's   Wicked: Part I   and  Wicked: For Good  — has finally come to an end.  When we last left  Chu's splashy, long-awaited adaptation of the Broadway musical juggernaut, green emo outcast Elphaba, soon to be known as the Wicked Witch of the West (Cynthia Erivo), had been radicalized by the discovery that the revered Wizard of Oz (Jeff Goldblum) is a magicless fraud and oppressor of animals; she thus committed to  defying gravity  and becoming a broomstick-riding outlaw. Her polar-opposite enemy-turned-bestie Glinda (Ariana Grande) declined to take up the cause but wished Elphaba well. Songs were belted, hearts were broken, blonde hair was tossed, and since then, the real world we're all existing in only grew more chaotic and distressingly parallel to that of the one depicted in Oz. Wicked: For Good  is based on the show's second act, and ever since it was announced that the two hour and 45-minute production (including intermission) would be sprawled across two separate films totaling an approximate five-hour runtime, people like me have wondered,  What's the (non-capitalistic) point of that?  Having now seen  For Good , I can attest there isn't a point, or at least not a wholly convincing one. This installment is far from a total misfire — thank goodness Erivo and Grande are such captivating performers perfectly-suited to these roles — but the over-padding and stuffing meant to justify this bifurcated packaging soon becomes readily apparent. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       First, however, it starts off with a bang: The exciting opening sequence touches down upon the vast open landscape outside the metropolis of Oz, as the Wizard's human lackeys are forcing animals to do the brutal labor of building his precious yellow brick road; suddenly, Elphaba appears out of the sky like a superhero and wields her mighty powers to disrupt the abuse and send a message. The Wizard's press secretary Madame Morrible (Michelle Yeoh, tasked again with trying to sing, to limited results) has pulled out all the stops to spread hateful propaganda about Elphaba to the people of Oz, and the people are buying it wholesale. A willfully ignorant Glinda is now the bubbly spokesperson for the Wizard's regime, keeping the lie about his wizarding credentials alive. And the formerly apathetic Fiyero ( Sexiest Man Alive  Jonathan Bailey) is now a reluctant guardsman arranged to marry Glinda, even though his heart and political sympathies remain with Elphaba. A lot happens over the next two-plus hours, including the story coinciding with the arrival of that girl from Kansas (glimpsed a few times here, but as far as I can remember, not heard), and it's entertaining enough. The highest notes carry over from  Part 1 , as Erivo and Grande are electric every time they share screentime — their big comical fight, which takes place immediately after a devastating cyclone of events, elicited rapturous engagement from the audience at my screening. And their duet \"For Good\" remains the Act II apex, a stirring meeting of the minds and declaration of friendship, even if lyricist Stephen Schwartz's prose leans toward clunk. (Two decades later, I'm still scratching my head at \" Like a seed dropped by a skybird  /  In a distant wood .\" Huh???) If  For Good  doesn't soar quite as consistently as  Part 1 , this is at least partially by design. A song from the original show like the Wizard's vaudevillian ditty \"Wonderful\" — a more sinister retread of Glinda's far superior ode to the benefits of self-mythologizing, \"Popular\" — can't come close to matching Act I's abundance of bangers. (And unfortunately, the two new songs added here, Elphaba's \"No Place Like Home\" and Glinda's \"The Girl in the Bubble,\" add little beyond runtime.) Act II is also where the show's politics become indecipherable, or — to put it less generously — noncommittal. The story aims to challenge perceptions of what makes someone \"good\" or \"bad,\" but unlike its source material, Gregory Maguire's revisionist novel  Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West , the new movie sands down those provocations to make certain characters more sympathetic than they are. But within the landscape of movie musicals, especially more recent examples, both  Wicked  movies serve as a triumph and tribute to creative fortitude. We've all laughed (and cringed) a lot about Erivo and Grande's peculiar antics throughout this never-ending publicity cycle, but there's something heartwarming about their deep commitment to the spirit of the material. Whatever your feelings about it, this is clearly a spectacle that's been made with love, and that's all for the better. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5612042","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"04:51:00-05:00","title":"Two Senators Want to Hold Big Tech Accountable for Harms Caused by Algorithms","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Two U.S. Senators, John Curtis and Mark Kelly, have introduced legislation to hold social media companies accountable for the harms caused by their algorithms, which are widely accused of fueling political polarization by promoting divisive content.

PM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In 2018, the  CIA under the first Trump administration concluded  that Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the gruesome murder of a US resident and journalist, Jamal Khashoggi.\n \n\n   \n  The GOP-led Senate  voted unanimously to condemn  the crown prince. One Republican senator remarked at the time that if the matter went before a jury, the crown prince “would be convicted in 30 minutes.”\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump has made it abundantly clear that he simply doesn’t care about Khashoggi’s killing all that much. But even by his standards, Trump’s  comments alongside the crown prince  on Tuesday were stunning.\n \n\n   \n  Trump went from downplaying Khashoggi’s murder to vouching for the crown prince (who has denied personal involvement).\n \n\n   \n  While Trump  previously suggested  we’d never know for sure whether the crown prince were guilty, this time he said affirmatively that Prince bin Salman “knew nothing about it.”\n \n\n   \n  While the president previously gestured suggestively at conservative talking points about Khashoggi’s past associations with Islamist movements (a past that the evidence shows  Khashoggi abandoned ), this time Trump all but said the journalist had it coming. He called Khashoggi “extremely controversial,” and said, “Whether you liked him or didn’t like him, things happen” — as if dismembering someone with a bone saw were just a fluke.\n \n\n   \n  And perhaps most strikingly, Trump rebuked a reporter for even asking about this in the crown prince’s presence.\n \n\n   \n  “You don’t have to embarrass our guest by asking a question like that,” Trump said in the Oval Office.\n \n\n   \n  Khashoggi’s widow, Hanan Elatr Khashoggi, responded to Trump’s comments by saying the journalist’s past was “not justification to murder him.”\n \n\n   \n  “Jamal was a good, transparent and brave man,” she added in comments to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Trump is hardly the first president to bow to the strategic and geopolitical importance of keeping good relations with Saudi Arabia;  presidents of both parties  have offered tough talk about the Saudis on the campaign trail and then adjusted course once in office.\n \n\n   \n  But what sets Trump apart is his almost complete lack of interest in even  pretending  that he’s factoring human rights into that equation. In fact, he opened his meeting with the crown prince on Tuesday by saying, “What he’s done is incredible, in terms of human rights and everything else.”\n \n\n   \n  And this has been a constant throughout Trump’s decade in the national spotlight.\n \n\n   \n  Here are some of his more remarkable comments on human rights and alleged human rights abusers, mostly from his first term.\n \n\n   \n    2017: Likening US conduct to Vladimir Putin’s political assassinations\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after Trump first took office, then-Fox News host Bill O’Reilly posited to him that Russian President Vladimir Putin was “a killer.”\n \n\n   \n  “There are a lot of killers,” Trump  said . “You think our country’s so innocent?”\n \n\n   \n  When Russia’s war in Ukraine began in 2022, Trump initially  praised Putin’s “genius” and “savvy”  in launching the unprovoked invasion, even as Western leaders roundly condemned it. (Trump has since said he’s “very disappointed” in the Russian leader amid the ongoing war.)\n \n\n   \n    2018: Making similar comments about North Korea’s Kim Jong Un\n \n\n   \n  When another Fox host noted that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un executed lots of people, Trump responded: “He’s a tough guy.”\n \n\n   \n  When pressed again on Kim  doing “some really bad things,”  Trump  added : “Yeah, but so have a lot of other people done some really bad things. I mean, I could go through a lot of nations where a lot of bad things were done. Now look, with all of that being said, the answer is yes.”\n \n\n   \n    2016: Praising Saddam Hussein for killing alleged terrorists without due process\n \n\n   \n  “He was a bad guy — really bad guy,” Trump, then a presidential candidate,  said  of late Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. “But you know what he did well? He killed terrorists. He did that so good. They didn’t read them the rights. They didn’t talk. They were terrorists — over.”\n \n\n   \n  In fact, Hussein killed lots of people — not just alleged terrorists — without due process. A  2002 State Department report  said he did so “because he believes that their political beliefs, faith, ethnic background, family members or acquaintances are a threat to his power.”\n \n\n   \n    2017: Praising Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte for his drug war\n \n\n   \n  Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte’s drug war featured large numbers of extrajudicial killings and was widely condemned by human rights groups.\n \n\n   \n  And not only did Trump not condemn that; he at one point during his first term praised Duterte.\n \n\n   \n  “I just wanted to congratulate you because I am hearing of the unbelievable job on the drug problem,” Trump told Duterte during an April 29, 2017, phone call,  according to a transcript  whose basic contents were confirmed by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Trump added: “Many countries have the problem, we have a problem, but what a great job you are doing, and I just wanted to call and tell you that.”\n \n\n   \n  (A senior US official said at the time that Trump was merely acknowledging the US is combating its own drug problem, not condoning violence and human rights violations.)\n \n\n   \n    2019: Allegedly encouraging China’s Uyghur detention camps\n \n\n   \n  Former Trump national security adviser John Bolton in his 2020 book recounted a scene from a G20 summit. In it, Trump and Chinese leader  Xi Jinping discussed the Chinese government’s detention camps for Uyghur Muslims in western China.\n \n\n   \n  “With only interpreters present, Xi had explained to Trump why he was basically building concentration camps in Xinjiang. According to our interpreter, Trump said that Xi should go ahead with building the camps, which Trump thought was exactly the right thing to do,” Bolton  wrote . “The National Security Council’s top Asia staffer, Matthew Pottinger, told me that Trump said something very similar during his November 2017 trip to China.”\n \n\n   \n  Then-US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer  denied the account , calling it “absolutely untrue” and “completely crazy.”\n \n\n   \n    2025: Praising Belarus’ president\n \n\n   \n  Trump  in a social media post  in August referred to the “highly respected President of Belarus, Aleksandr Lukashenko.”\n \n\n   \n  Lukashenko has long been accused of  egregious human rights abuses  and even  crimes against humanity . He has often been called  Europe’s last dictator  by foreign policy watchers.\n \n\n   \n  What’s more, Trump’s own State Department in 2020  declined to recognize Lukashenko  as the legitimate president of Belarus, citing a rigged election.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5614163","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-05:00","title":"Suleika Jaouad on the clarity that comes with illness, why grief is worth it and defiant love","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Suleika Jaouad, an author and public voice on personal transformation, gained prominence through her 2012 New York Times column about living with leukemia, which became the foundation of her bestselling memoir 'Between Two Kingdoms.'

You can sign up here. The Chinese Exclusion Act is widely considered to be the first significant crackdown on immigration in American history. It's a riveting tale that parallels today and may provide insights into the economic consequences of immigration restrictions and mass deportations. This is Part 2 of that story, which explores the economic and political factors that led to the Act and examines what happened to the American economy after it was passed ( Part 1 can be read here ). Please note: this story includes racist quotes from the 19th century. On May 10, 1869, the eyes of America focused on a makeshift ceremony in the middle of nowhere. Two railroad companies had spent six years on one of the most ambitious infrastructure projects of the 19th century: the construction of the first transcontinental railroad. One company had built from the east. The other from the west. This was the day they finally met up and linked their tracks together. The meeting point was a place called Promontory Summit in the desolate desert of northwest Utah. A thousand people — politicians, journalists, railroad executives and workers — traveled there for the monumental occasion. As we covered in  Part 1 of this story , this historic moment would not have been possible without the sacrifices of Chinese immigrants. They had played a crucial role in constructing the western part of the railroad — the most difficult and dangerous section to build. As many as 1,200 Chinese immigrants died constructing it. However, on this day of celebration, railroad executives decided to exclude their Chinese workers from the official ceremony and photographs. Ouch. But Chinese Americans had reason to be hopeful in the wake of the transcontinental railroad's completion. Since they began arriving in America a couple decades before, they had been the target of discriminatory laws and violence. But now national news reports praised them as skilled and productive workers making invaluable contributions to America's economy. \"The Chinaman is a born railroad builder, and as such he is destined to be most useful to California, and, indeed, to the whole Pacific slope,\" read one nationally circulated news report.  The Daily Alta California , then the most popular newspaper in the state, declared that Chinese workers \"do a better, neater, and cleaner job, and do it faster and cheaper than white laborers from the East.\" Political winds also seemed to be blowing in favor of Chinese Americans. In 1868, the United States signed the Burlingame Treaty, which strengthened diplomatic and trade relations with China and encouraged \"free migration and emigration\" between the two countries. In the decade to come, the Chinese population in America would swell by about 50 percent. Even more, this was the post-Civil War Reconstruction era, when Radical Republicans were amending the U.S. Constitution and fighting for the civil rights of freed slaves. Many hoped that new constitutional amendments and civil rights laws would apply to other excluded groups — including Chinese immigrants. Back then, the only immigrants who were allowed to become American citizens and obtain equal rights were \"free white persons.\" In 1870, U.S. Senator Charles Sumner (R-Massachusetts), one of America's leading voices for abolition and civil rights, fought to open up a pathway for Chinese and other non-white immigrants to become citizens. But Western politicians, including in Sumner's own more racially progressive Republican party, saw this proposal as politically radioactive. In making his case against Sumner's bill to open a pathway to citizenship for Chinese immigrants, Senator William Morris Stewart (R-Nevada) warned that the West Coast would be \"overpowered by the mob element that seeks to exterminate the Chinese\" if it passed, and that \"they will be slaughtered before any one of them can be naturalized under your bill.\" The effort to expand citizenship and civil rights to Chinese immigrants failed to pass Congress. But the \"mob element\" — as Senator Stewart called it — would nonetheless make life miserable for Chinese Americans. In an omen of the horrors to come, just one year later, a white mob in Los Angeles lynched 17 Chinese men and boys in a raid on Chinatown. It was one of the largest — if not the largest — mass lynching in American history. It became known as \"the Chinese Massacre of 1871.\" All of this was before \"The Panic of 1873,\" a financial crisis that would plunge America's economy into a long and miserable depression. In the depths of despair, white working-class Americans on the West Coast would rally around a new populist slogan: \"The Chinese must go!\"  The Long Depression And The Rise of Racist Populism The completion of the transcontinental railroad may have, ironically, contributed to the coming populist backlash. For one, excitement over the transcontinental and other railroads led to a speculative bubble. Investors  overestimated  the money-making potential of railroads, and once the transcontinental railroad was up and running, reality began to set in about how much money railroads and related investments would actually make. When the bubble burst in 1873, it took the whole economy with it. The transcontinental railroad also integrated what had been effectively two separate American economies into one. Like  the adoption of container ships  during the globalization era of the 20th and 21st centuries, the transcontinental railroad increased competition in the economy by making it easier and cheaper to distribute and sell products to faraway places. This bigger, more competitive market was great for consumers, economic efficiency, and the nation's long-term economic growth. But, with the railroad now serving as a new pipeline for products, West Coast industries were suddenly forced to compete with the more efficient and mechanized industries of the East Coast. Nancy Qian, an economist at Northwestern University, says this made the economic downturn that followed the Panic of 1873 much worse in the West. Even more, during and after completion of the railroad, Chinese immigrants became a more sought after workforce, which effectively put a target on their backs. Increasing numbers of white workers began to resent them. They saw them as a culturally alien workforce, willing and able to do all sorts of jobs for less pay. And it wasn't just railroads. Chinese immigrants now worked in all sorts of West Coast industries, including manufacturing, agriculture, woodcutting, and mining. \"While the Chinese constituted less than 10 percent of the population of California in 1870, they accounted for approximately 25 percent of the workforce,\" writes Beth Lew-Williams in her book  The Chinese Must Go: Violence, Exclusion, and the Making of the Alien in America. As the economy cratered after the Panic of 1873, a scarcity of jobs led to a zero-sum mindset amongst white workers. Demagogues began to blame the labor competition posed by increasing numbers of Chinese immigrants for the miseries of white joblessness and meager pay. They painted Chinese immigrants as the servile tools of monopolistic corporations, which were becoming increasingly powerful in the rapidly industrializing United States. The mighty railroad companies — which now owned valuable land across the United States thanks to federal legislation that funded the transcontinental railroad — were a prominent example. Populists began to rail against big corporations for employing the cheap labor of Chinese immigrants instead of the labor of white people — many of whom, by the way, were also recent immigrants themselves. In late 1877, an Irish immigrant in San Francisco named Denis Kearney founded The Workingmen's Party of California. Kearney articulated a populist politics that combined pro-labor and anti-corporate rhetoric with virulent anti-Chinese racism. In one famous demonstration, in October 1877, Kearney led a mob to Nob Hill, a fancy part of San Francisco where the West Coast railroad barons had built mansions. Kearney gave a fiery speech to 2,000 people in front of the home of Charles Crocker, an executive at Central Pacific Railroad who had been instrumental in recruiting Chinese workers to build the transcontinental railroad. \"The Central Pacific Railroad men are thieves, and will soon feel the power of the workingmen,\"  Kearney said . \"When I have thoroughly organized my party, we will march through the city and compel the thieves to give up their plunder. I will lead you to the City Hall, clean out the police force, hang the Prosecuting Attorney, burn every book that has a particle of law in it, and then enact new laws for the workingmen. I will give the Central Pacific just three months to discharge their Chinamen.\" In another speech, in front of a crowd in Boston, Kearney said, \"The capitalist thief and land pirate of California, instead of employing the poor white man of that beautiful and golden State, send across Asia, the oldest despotism on earth, and there contracting with a band of leprous Chinese pirates, brought them to California, and now uses them as a knife to cut the throats of honest laboring men in that State.\" In rabble-rousing speech after speech, it was Kearney who popularized the slogan, \"The Chinese must go!\" Kearney and the Workingmen's Party would fail to achieve lasting political power, but their ideas proved to be popular on the West Coast. By the late 1870s, the writing was on the wall for both national political parties: if they wanted to win elections in West Coast states, they would need to clamp down on Chinese immigration. The Rise of Chinese Exclusion Back in those days, Washington — which didn't have much experience actually trying to regulate immigration — viewed immigration policy as something you cordially worked out with the origin countries of immigrants. American political elites also hoped to remain friendly with China, which they viewed as economically and geopolitically important. And so, in 1880, the administration of President Rutherford B. Hayes delicately worked with China to amend the Burlingame Treaty, which had encouraged the free flow of immigration between the two countries. This new treaty,  the Angell Treaty , allowed the United States to \"regulate, limit, or suspend\" the flow of Chinese laborers to the country. Congress could now act. In 1882, after a presidential election, they did just that. Congress passed a forceful bill halting immigration of Chinese workers for twenty years and requiring Chinese immigrants already in the United States to register with the government and obtain \"passports\" so they could prove their legal status (similar to a \" green card \" today). However, President Chester A. Arthur — who had only recently been elevated to the presidency after James Garfield was assassinated — objected to the law and decided to veto it. He believed it was too harsh. In  his veto message , Arthur said the law would damage diplomatic and trade relations with China, which he and many others believed were vital to American interests. He objected to provisions requiring Chinese Americans to register with the government and obtain documents to prove their legal status, calling it \"undemocratic and hostile to the spirit of our institutions.\" Even more, Arthur said, America \"profited\" from the work of Chinese immigrants — a belief held by many of the West Coast's business elites. \"They were largely instrumental in constructing the railways which connect the Atlantic with the Pacific,\" President Arthur said. \"The States of the Pacific Slope are full of evidences of their industry. Enterprises profitable alike to the capitalist and to the laborer of Caucasian origin would have lain dormant but for them.\" Arthur contended that the Chinese immigrants could continue to help develop and enrich America and, basically, do jobs that white people didn't want to do. Arthur's veto, however, proved to be a political disaster. Many Americans erupted with anger. The Knights of Labor, a growing national labor union, organized thousands of workers to protest it. Across California, townspeople burned and hanged President Arthur's effigy. Members of Arthur's own Republican party worried his veto meant that they would fail to win elections on the West Coast for the foreseeable future. Facing a national outcry, Congress went back to the drawing board a few weeks later. And they passed a watered-down version of the bill, which President Arthur signed into law on May 6, 1882. This 1882 law is now popularly known as \"the Chinese Exclusion Act.\" It banned both skilled and unskilled Chinese laborers from immigrating to the US for ten years. Symbolically and politically, this bill was a big deal: it was the first significant crackdown on immigration in American history, a message that the federal government opposed Chinese immigration, and a reaffirmation that Chinese immigrants already in America could never become citizens. However, the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was just one in a series of federal laws against Chinese immigrants — and, as Beth Lew-Williams makes clear in  The Chinese Must Go , this 1882 law was actually quite ineffective. Basically, President Arthur and Congress threw a bone to the insurgent anti-Chinese movement, but they provided few resources for federal enforcement against Chinese immigration and introduced a bunch of loopholes that allowed Chinese immigrants to continue coming in. In the years after the Act's passage, West Coast newspapers and populist agitators grew angry that Chinese immigrants were still entering the country and demanded that the government do more. This was the beginning of what you might call the national fight against \"illegal immigration\" — because before this virtually all immigration to the United States was legal. But the growing discontent with the first iteration of the Chinese Exclusion Act wasn't just about its lack of enforcement and loopholes. For many white Americans, simply preventing the flow of new Chinese immigrants wasn't enough. They wanted expulsions and deportations of the Chinese people who already lived here — even though the vast majority of them were here legally. And soon white vigilantes would take matters into their own hands. Vigilante Expulsion By 1885, anti-Chinese forces in the West had become emboldened by the federal government's actions declaring that Chinese immigration was, in fact, a problem that needed to be solved. But they were also frustrated that Chinese workers seemed to keep coming into the country. Even more, they were angry about the continued presence of Chinese people in their communities and workplaces. The first purges of Chinese Americans in towns across the West began spontaneously in response to inciting incidents. But what began as a movement characterized by sporadic outbursts of violence would soon morph into a premeditated political strategy of ethnic cleansing. In Eureka, California, on February 6, 1885, two Chinese men got into a dispute and began firing guns at each other. One of them accidentally shot a white city councilman crossing the street. Shortly after, a mob of white residents stormed into the city's Chinatown chanting \"Hang all the Chinamen!\" and \"Burn Chinatown!\" City leaders, including the mayor, sheriff, and a Christian minister, intervened to prevent arson and murders, but white gangs looted Chinatown. And, within about 48 hours, local vigilantes rounded up Chinese residents — hundreds of people — forced them onto steamships bound for San Francisco and told them to never return again. It became known as \"the Eureka method\" of expulsion and was soon copied by neighboring cities. Later that year, in Rock Springs, Wyoming,  a fight broke out  between some Chinese and white miners that quickly exploded into horrific violence. Both groups were employed by the Union Pacific Coal Company (the same Union Pacific that built half of the transcontinental railroad). White miners, themselves immigrants, had grown to resent Chinese miners.  On numerous occasions , Union Pacific had brought in Chinese workers after white workers went on strike for better wages, leading the white miners to view their Chinese counterparts as low-wage scabs. (Union Pacific, however, had also brought in Scandinavian immigrants in a similar way, but that didn't seem to elicit the same level of rage.) This particular fight was over whether Chinese or white workers would get to work in a particularly lucrative mine. It got very ugly very fast. After the dispute, a white mob descended on Chinatown, murdered 28 Chinese miners and wounded 15 others, drove the whole Chinese community out, and set their homes and stores ablaze. The incident was dubbed \"The Rock Springs Massacre.\" In Tacoma, Washington, a couple months later, residents took a more methodical, premeditated approach. \"The violence of Tacoma differed from incidents at Eureka and Rock Springs,\" writes Lew-Williams. \"The Tacoma expulsion was not a spontaneous act by a mob angered by a triggering incident. Rather, it was cold and deliberate collective action that was publicly announced well in advance.\" Nonetheless, while it may have been more orderly and less sudden, it resembled \"the Eureka method.\" White vigilantes — including Mayor Jacob Weisbach and other local political leaders — forcibly expelled all of Tacoma's Chinese residents, this time putting them on a train instead of boats. They then demolished Tacoma's Chinatown. Truckee, California, took a different approach to Chinese expulsion. Truckee sits in the basin underneath the Sierra Nevada peaks where Chinese rail workers had painstakingly built tunnels to allow passage for the transcontinental railroad ( see Part 1 of this story ). It boomed in population during and after the railroad's construction, and many Chinese rail workers made it their home. By 1870, around a third of Truckee's population was of Chinese descent. It had one of the biggest Chinatowns in the United States. White residents of Truckee had long made life difficult for its Chinese residents. In 1876, for instance, white militants — part of a secretive group called \"The Caucasian League\" — murdered a Chinese woodcutter and wounded others and then, despite a trial, were found innocent (these types of acquittals for racist thugs and vigilantes were common in the West back then). Over the years, Truckee's Chinatown was burned in a series of mysterious — but actually not so mysterious — fires. In fact, after one such fire, the town forced their Chinese residents to build a new Chinatown across the Truckee River. This new Chinatown had no bridge, so they had to cross the river by ferry. But this wasn't enough for the white residents of Truckee. They wanted Chinese people gone from the area completely. In the winter of 1885-86, a local lawyer and newspaper owner named Charles McGlashan was inspired by the cascade of purges across the West Coast. However, by then, there seemed to be some growing political and legal blowback for these extralegal expulsions. The town of Eureka, for example, was being sued by their former Chinese denizens for reparations. National politicians condemned violence in places like Rock Springs. It was within this context that McGlashan pioneered what became known as \"The Truckee Method,\" a relatively non-violent — but still violent — boycott and harassment campaign against Chinese businesses and white businesses that employed Chinese people. The aim was to starve the Chinese out by eliminating their local economic opportunities and making their lives miserable. The campaign proved successful in ridding the town of Chinese residents and was copied by numerous other towns up and down California. McGlashan became a leader in an anti-Chinese boycott movement across the state. Over the course of 1885 and 1886, more than 160 communities across the West Coast would expel their Chinese inhabitants. And they made it abundantly clear to national politicians: many Western voters were not satisfied with the 1882 law. In 1888, President Grover Cleveland — hoping to carry Western states in his upcoming reelection battle — signed into law another Chinese Exclusion Act that had more teeth than the first one. This one prohibited all Chinese laborers from coming into the country — whether or not they had resided in the United States previously. It was a policy that was easier to enforce and administer. It was also quickly implemented, leaving thousands of Chinese immigrants who had traveled abroad stranded and unable to return. It was also a policy that angered China and marked the beginning of an age in which the United States set restrictive immigration policy unilaterally. After President Cleveland signed this legislation into law, many white westerners took to the streets to celebrate. This was only two years after the unveiling of the Statue of Liberty, which proclaimed that America was a refuge for \"your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.\" Four years later, with the Geary Act, Washington renewed Chinese exclusion for another ten years, expanded the power of the federal government to enforce anti-Chinese immigration laws, and implemented the registration and \"passport\" system that President Arthur had called \"undemocratic and hostile to the spirit of our institutions.\" The Chinese Exclusion Acts — and the mob violence, pogroms, boycotts, and other forms of expulsion — had their intended effect. In 1890, the US Census Bureau recorded 107,488 Chinese people living in the United States. In 1900, that number dropped to 89,863. And by 1910, it was 71,531. The restrictions on Chinese immigration would not begin to be lifted until World War II.  The Economic Effects of Chinese Exclusion Historians have found that the economies of towns suffered after they kicked out their Chinese residents. Eureka, California faced all sorts of economic problems. \"For most white residents, the financial loss was immediate,\" writes Jean Pfaelzer in her book  Driven Out: The Forgotten War Against Chinese Americans . Businesses lost workers. \"Some went into debt to pay higher salaries to new white employees.\" Landlords lost tenants. Stores lost customers. Chinese entrepreneurs had run the laundries in the town, and now people were stuck with dirty clothes. Chinese vegetable growers had provided the town with its produce and their disappearance meant no more fresh veggies. \"White residents tried their hands at growing their own vegetables but complained about their poor results, the lack of variety of food, and the rotting produce that was shipped north from San Francisco,\" writes Pfaelzer. It was similar in Truckee. \"The Chinese were renters, shoppers, and low-paid laborers, and white agents made money from their legal, real estate, and commercial transactions,\" writes Pfaelzer. Charles McGlashan, the leader of the anti-Chinese boycott, sought to replace Chinese laundromats with an \"expensive steam laundry,\" but it was \"simply too large and expensive for the needs of the small railroad town, and the Truckee Laundry Association was sued by its major investors.\" Truckee businesses desperately recruited white workers with advertisements, but \"cheap white labor did not emerge, and mountain inns and hotels faced a summer season without food, while lumber camps could not staff their cookhouses.\" Across California, near the start of the spring of 1886, \"large-scale farmers, food processors, and cannery owners realized that they would not be able to carry on their businesses without the Chinese,\" writes Pfaelzer. Of course, all of these are just anecdotes about local effects. And, until recently, we've had no rigorous economic study of the effects of Chinese exclusion on the American economy. But in a new study, economists Nancy Qian, Joe Long, Carlo Medici, and Marco Tabellini provide just that. The title of their working paper is \"The Impact of the Chinese Exclusion Act on the economic development of the Western United States,\" but Nancy Qian, an economist at Northwestern University, says their study's estimated effects really include all the anti-Chinese laws, discrimination, and purges that affected Chinese Americans after 1882. \"If vigilante violence and discrimination had been milder, then the anti-Chinese legislations would have probably had a smaller negative effect on the US economy,\" Qian says. Namely, these laws would have reduced the inflow of Chinese immigrants, but they would not have caused as many Chinese Americans to flee communities, workplaces, and, more broadly, the United States. In this way, Qian and her colleagues' study may provide some insight into the effects not only of the restricted inflow of immigration — the official intent of the Chinese Exclusion Act — but also of mass deportations since many Chinese were forced out of communities and ultimately left the country. Chinese immigrants had been vital to many West Coast industries. \"By 1882, the Chinese had spread out across a lot of different sectors, and they were taking the skills that they had learned, mining, building the railroad, and also the ones they brought from China — they were applying it to lots of different things,\" Qian says. This, she says, made the economy better for just about everyone. \"The sad punchline\" of their study, Qian says, \"is that very few people benefited from the Chinese Exclusion Act\" and later laws and community actions. Western businesses suffered, and cities and towns across the West that saw their Chinese populations decline or disappear became less economically vibrant. For example, Qian and her colleagues find there was a slowdown in Western manufacturing, a sector in which many Chinese immigrants had worked. The crackdown against Chinese immigrants, Qian says, hurt most of the white population in the West. And, further, it made West Coast towns and cities that had large Chinese populations in 1882 less of a magnet for white workers from the East because economic opportunities in these places shriveled. The economists find that Chinese exclusion, in its many 1882 and post-1882 incarnations, slowed down the economic growth and development of the West. But Qian and her colleagues find there was at least one clear group of workers who benefited from Chinese exclusion: local white miners. It's interesting because the first wave of Chinese immigrants who came here, after 1849, came to America with the hope of finding gold. And the first discriminatory laws they faced were at the local level and aimed to discourage Chinese immigrants from mining. It also provides more context for the resentment and rage of white miners that exploded in the Rock Springs massacre. Mining is maybe more zero sum than other parts of the economy. There's a fixed level of stuff in the ground and one person's gain in finding valuable minerals is another person's loss. But Qian's study suggests most of the economy didn't work this way. It was not zero sum. Chinese workers actually improved the economic lives of most white workers and businessmen. As a concrete example, she points to Chinese woodcutters. \"So the Chinese workers — who were chopping down trees and making them into planks for the railroad — were now chopping down trees and making them into planks for the construction of houses and bars and hotels in western towns,\" Qian says. \"This is a very valuable skill. Now, all of a sudden, they leave. That doesn't just affect the lumber mill. But you have to think about all the people who are relying on using the wood. So now the doctor's office, the barmen, the hotel men, the railroad, everyone now has to pay more for wood. I mean, this is just a very important material for the whole economy.\" So, if there's a lesson from Qian's study, it's that, yes, maybe immigration restrictions and expulsions or deportations can actually help some native workers. But, really, the cost is tremendous — not just for the immigrants themselves but also for almost everyone else.  The Recent Movement To Honor Chinese Victims The story of what happened to Chinese immigrants is horrific. And in recent years, towns on the West Coast that purged their Chinese populations have begun to memorialize this dark period of history and honor the Chinese people who were kicked out of their towns. For example, the city of Tacoma worked with the Chinese Reconciliation Project Foundation, a nonprofit, to create a park, which is called  Tacoma Chinese Reconciliation Park . Since 2021, an organization called  the Eureka Chinatown Project  has done various projects around Eureka to \"honor the history and culture of the first Chinese people in Humboldt County, California\" (the county Eureka is in). Earlier this year, Truckee  unveiled a plaque  to commemorate the two Chinatowns that once existed in the town. Many Americans remain ignorant of this history, and the organizers behind these projects want to educate them about it — with the hope history won't repeat itself. When researching this history, we read a number of illuminating books. We thank the historians for their work.

Spread throughout the  roughly 23,000 documents  released by the House Oversight Committee last week, emails and texts show Epstein courted prominent politicos from both sides of the aisle, impressed academics and used his connections to push back on negative stories about his alleged crimes. Epstein's career as a wealthy financier who gave money to universities and other causes put him in many elite circles. Those circles did not entirely close to him after  he pleaded guilty  to state charges of solicitation of prostitution and of solicitation of prostitution with a minor under the age of 18 in 2008. Reading through the text messages and emails released, the people who consulted with Epstein rarely acknowledged the severity of the crimes that required him to register as a sex offender, though simply corresponding with Epstein does not implicate individuals in his criminal activities, convicted or accused. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       There's an  apparent letter of recommendation  for Epstein from linguist Noam Chomsky, calling him a \"highly valued friend,\" that recalled how Epstein connected him with former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak — another frequent Epstein correspondent. \"Jeffrey constantly raises searching questions and puts forth provocative ideas, which have repeatedly led me to rethink crucial issues,\" the letter reads. There's advice Epstein gave to Steve Bannon, Trump's former strategist, about ways to build a far-right political movement overseas. \"If you are going to play here, you'll have to spend time, [E]urope by remote doesn't work,\" Epstein wrote in 2018. \"Lots and lots of face time and hand holding. Europe can be a wife not a mistress.\" Former Harvard University president and onetime Treasury Secretary Larry Summers is documented numerous times having intimate personal chats with Epstein, including asking for romantic advice and joking about women's intelligence. \"I yipped about inclusion,\"  wrote Summers in 2017 . \"I observed that half the IQ [in the] world was possessed by women without mentioning they are more than 51 percent of population....\" Summers resigned as Harvard's president in 2006 after arguing that women may be innately less capable in math and science. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In the week since the latest Epstein emails release, he has resigned from the board of OpenAI and  abruptly left his teaching role  at Harvard, as the university  announced a probe  of \"information concerning individuals at Harvard included in the newly released Jeffrey Epstein documents to evaluate what actions may be warranted.\" Summers isn't the only high-profile Democrat who found themself in varying degrees of Epstein's orbit. Kathryn Ruemmler, former White House counsel in the Obama administration and current chief legal officer for Goldman Sachs, messaged with Epstein before and during Trump's first term. \"Trump is living proof of the adage that it is better to be lucky than smart,\" she wrote in August 2015. \"I regret ever knowing Jeffrey Epstein,\" Ruemmler told  The Wall Street Journal  in 2023. More than a thousand mentions of Trump Trump promised to release the Epstein files on the campaign trail but largely stonewalled the effort this year since he returned to office, frequently calling the push for more transparency around the Epstein case a \"hoax\" perpetrated by Democrats. In a Wednesday Truth Social post announcing the signing of the Epstein Files Transparency Act, Trump said Democrats were using the issue to distract from what he says are victories for his administration. \"Perhaps the truth about these Democrats, and their associations with Jeffrey Epstein, will soon be revealed, because I HAVE JUST SIGNED THE BILL TO RELEASE THE EPSTEIN FILES!\" he  posted . The president has the authority to release the files without congressional action. Trump is a frequent subject of emails and text messages in the latest file tranche — well over a thousand different mentions — though mainly the subject of Epstein's near-obsession with his presidency, as the latter positioned himself as a Trump whisperer of sorts to his powerful associates. This week, after an abrupt reversal that led to the near-unanimous approval of the  Epstein Files Transparency Act , the president has now called for Democrats mentioned in Epstein's communications to be investigated by the Justice Department. \"I will be asking A.G. Pam Bondi, and the Department of Justice, together with our great patriots at the FBI, to investigate Jeffrey Epstein's involvement and relationship with Bill Clinton, Larry Summers, Reid Hoffman, J.P. Morgan, Chase, and many other people and institutions, to determine what was going on with them, and him,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. Other Republicans are going on the offensive too — highlighting revelations that Epstein was texting Democratic Del. Stacey Plaskett of the U.S. Virgin Islands during a  House Oversight Committee hearing  with Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen in 2019. Comparing the newly released messages with the video of the hearing, minutes after Epstein suggested Plaskett ask Cohen things about the Trump Organization, Plaskett posed similar questions. An effort to censure Plaskett in the House failed Tuesday. In a floor speech, Plaskett defended her actions as receiving information from a constituent and said it was \"not public knowledge at that time that he was under federal investigation.\" Amid the partisan finger-pointing around the Epstein files, some of Epstein's accusers are imploring the president not to make things partisan and focus on the other powerful people that they say haven't faced scrutiny — regardless of political party. What's next for the government's Epstein files? Within 30 days of Trump signing the Epstein Files Transparency Act, the attorney general is supposed to make \"all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials\" available in a searchable and downloadable format. That includes information that relates to Epstein, his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell and \"individuals named or referenced in connection with Epstein's criminal activities.\" There's also a focus on information regarding plea deals and decisions not to charge Epstein for other alleged crimes, as well as documents pertaining to his 2019 death by suicide in federal custody. Over the summer, the  FBI put out a memo  that said their files include \"a significant amount of material, including more than 300 gigabytes of data and physical evidence.\" Some of that includes photos and videos of Epstein's accusers, including minors, and disturbing material that will not be made public. The bill from Congress also says anything \"that would jeopardize an active federal investigation or ongoing prosecution\" can be withheld or redacted, too. With Trump's ordering of the investigation into Democrats and financial institutions mentioned in the Epstein correspondence, it is unclear how much of the Justice Department's files will be released, to what extent they will be redacted and when they ultimately will be made public. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5606922","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Who Are Afrikaners, the Group at the Center of Trump's Dispute with South Africa?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. is boycotting the upcoming G20 meeting in South Africa due to President Donald Trump's false claims that South Africa is committing a 'white genocide' against Afrikaners, a white ethnic group descended from Dutch, German, and French settlers who historically dominated South African politics under apartheid.

\n         By Joe Hernandez \n        \n           Thursday, November 20, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         When the G20 meeting kicks off in South Africa this weekend, one member country will be conspicuously absent: the United States. President Trump has decided that the U.S. will completely boycott the conference over what he considers the discriminatory treatment of Afrikaners by the South African government. They are the largest subset of the country's white minority, and Afrikaners ran South Africa's government for much of the 20th century and famously oversaw the racist system of apartheid until 1994. Trump has  repeated false claims  that the South African government is stealing land from white farmers and that there is an ongoing \"white genocide\" and \"extermination\" of Afrikaners, even taking the unprecedented step of offering refugee status to Afrikaners who want to flee. The first 59 Afrikaner refugees  arrived in the U.S.  in May. South African officials — including President Cyril Ramaphosa — have said Trump's claims are untrue and point to official government data showing that attacks against rural Afrikaners are rare, and that the country's Black majority bear the brunt of South Africa's rampant crime. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Lindie Koorts, a historian at the University of Pretoria, said the false narrative has strained some of the progress made in post-apartheid South Africa, as Afrikaners whose ancestors perpetrated apartheid adjust to being a political minority. \"This is a minority that used to be protected by apartheid laws\" who now don't have the same job security and other economic benefits, said Koorts, who is an Afrikaner. \"It turns into something of existential dread, and that is very, very easily manipulated by the right wing.\" Here's what to know about the history of the Afrikaners. Who are Afrikaners? Afrikaners descend from colonists of mostly Dutch but also German and French origin who landed on the tip of Africa in the 17th century. Many passed through the  resupply station established  by the Dutch East India Company in present-day Cape Town, an ideal midpoint along the sea routes between Europe and Asia. Some Afrikaners later moved inland to form large farming colonies as their population grew on the continent. They also became known as Boers, which translates to \"farmers.\" Disputes between British colonists and the Boer settlers who spoke Afrikaans led to the  Boer War , which occurred at the turn of the century. The British forces won, but Afrikaners remained the majority of South Africa's white population after the war and gained control of South Africa's government in the early 20th century. In 1948, the Afrikaner-led government began to implement apartheid, a system of institutionalized racial segregation that benefited whites. Black people and other non-white South Africans were displaced and dispossessed. Apartheid ended in 1994 with the formation of a new, democratic government led by anti-apartheid activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner Nelson Mandela. Apartheid helped consolidate wealth among several generations of South Africa's white minority, but its fall stripped them of their political power and has shifted race relations in the country, said Daniel Magaziner, a professor of African history at Yale University. \"Afrikaners — as white people — do quite well since 1994, but they do lose their political privileges, and so there is a rise in a sense of grievance and nostalgia for what has been lost since they lost their political control over the territory,\" he said. Magaziner said there remains in South Africa a strong cultural association of Afrikaners with farming, even though most Afrikaners now live in the suburbs or urban areas. \"But this idea that they're being targeted on farms is something that has a very big afterlife and is one of the reasons the Trump administration claims that these are people worthy — uniquely worthy — of being granted refugee status,\" he said. Some Afrikaners say they're facing discrimination Some Afrikaners say they are at risk of having their land stripped away or even facing physical violence and death because they are white, a claim that's been widely disputed by other Afrikaners, South African officials and Ramaphosa. Right-wing South African groups such as AfriForum  have attacked  a new federal land expropriation law, which replaces another law from the apartheid era. Critics say the new law lets the government take land from private citizens without compensation. Under the law , the government can only seize land without paying for it in limited circumstances, such as if the land is not in use. The government must also first attempt to strike a deal with the owner. Most commercial farmland in South Africa is still owned by the country's white minority, who make up about 8% of the population. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       AfriForum has also claimed there are widespread murders of white Afrikaner farmers, which it says law enforcement is doing too little to combat, though South Africa's government denies this.   And the group has slammed  politicians who've continued to sing  the apartheid-era song, \"Kill the Boer,\" something Ramaphosa said does not represent the policy of the government. AfriForum CEO  Kallie Kriel told Newzroom Afrika  that he wanted the South African government to condemn the song and recognize \"that we are seeing tortures that accompany these murders and declare it a priority crime.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The claims have been boosted by some of Trump's allies in the U.S., including Elon Musk, who is from South Africa. In a  dramatic Oval Office meeting  in May, Trump surprised Ramaphosa with a video montage and news clippings showing what Trump claimed was widespread violence and discrimination against white farmers. \"You do allow them to take land — when they take the land, they kill the white farmer, and when they kill the white farmer, nothing happens to them,\" Trump said to Ramaphosa, who immediately disputed it. This year the Trump administration began offering refugee status to Afrikaners, even as the administration  cut the total number of refugees it would admit  to an all-time low. How South Africa is responding to claims of discrimination against whites Ramaphosa and other South African officials say attacks on farming communities are rare. National police data shows that there were  six murders on farms  in South Africa during the first three months of this year. Most crime victims in South Africa  are Black  — not white — officials say. Of the six farm murders from January to March,  five of the victims were Black  and one was white. South Africa's police minister  said earlier this year  that farm murders have a history of being \"distorted and reported in an unbalanced way.\" Many Afrikaners  have also disputed the idea  that they're being persecuted. A number of Afrikaner journalists, professors and others  signed a public petition , saying they rejected the idea that Afrikaners were \"victims of racial persecution in post-apartheid South Africa\" and didn't want to be \"pawns\" for American politicians. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The group said South Africans of all races were facing a slew of problems. \"To cherry-pick white suffering and elevate it above others is dishonest and harmful,\" the petition reads. \"It feeds extremist ideologies that perpetuate division and have inspired real-world violence, including mass shootings.\" Koorts, one of the signatories, said the allegations of a \"white genocide\" are not true and that Afrikaners have had to do a lot of work to reckon with the violent and racist history of apartheid. \"What we now see is our story being taken out of context, being twisted for an American audience to make Americans fearful of multiculturalism, of multiracialism, of making Americans fearful of essentially becoming a white minority,\" she said. \"Don't. Please don't. That is not our story. That is a twisted version of our story.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-98477","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"12:07:00.000Z","title":"Trump Signs Bill to Release Epstein Files After Bipartisan Support","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has signed a bipartisan bill requiring the Justice Department to release all case files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell, including internal communications, records of investigations, and materials surrounding Epstein’s 2019 death in prison.

Trump has signed a bill releasing the Epstein files \n         By The Associated Press \n        \n           Thursday, November 20, 2025 • 12:07 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has signed a bill to compel the Justice Department to make public its case files on the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, a potentially far-reaching development in a yearslong push by survivors of Epstein's abuse for a public reckoning. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Both the House and Senate passed the bill this week with overwhelming margins after Trump reversed course on his monthslong opposition to the bill and indicated he would sign it. Now that the bill has been signed by the president, there's a 30-day countdown for the Justice Department to produce what's commonly known as the Epstein files. \"This bill is a command for the president to be fully transparent, to come fully clean, and to provide full honesty to the American people,\" Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said Wednesday. Schumer added that Democrats were ready to push back if they perceive that the president is doing anything but adhering to \"full transparency.\" In a social media post Wednesday as he announced he had signed the bill, Trump wrote, \"Democrats have used the 'Epstein' issue, which affects them far more than the Republican Party, in order to try and distract from our AMAZING Victories.\" The swift, bipartisan work in Congress this week was a response to the growing public demand that the Epstein files be released, especially as attention focuses on his connections to global leaders including Trump, former President Bill Clinton, Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, who has already been stripped of his royal title as Prince Andrew over the matter, and many others. There is plenty of public anticipation about what more the files could reveal. Yet the bill will most likely trigger a rarely seen baring of a sprawling federal investigation, also creating the potential for unintended consequences. What does the bill do? The bill compels Attorney General Pam Bondi to release essentially everything the Justice Department has collected over multiple federal investigations into Epstein, as well as his longtime confidante and girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for luring teenage girls for the disgraced financier. Those records total around 100,000 pages, according to a federal judge who has reviewed the case. It will also compel the Justice Department to produce all its internal communications on Epstein and his associates and his 2019 death in a Manhattan jail cell as he awaited charges for sexually abusing and trafficking dozens of teenage girls. The legislation, however, exempts some parts of the case files. The bill's authors made sure to include that the Justice Department could withhold personally identifiable information of victims, child sexual abuse materials and information deemed by the administration to be classified for national defense or foreign policy. \"We will continue to follow the law with maximum transparency while protecting victims,\" Bondi told a news conference Wednesday when asked about releasing the files. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The bill also allows the Justice Department to withhold information that would jeopardize active investigations or prosecutions. That's created some worry among the bill's proponents that the department would open active investigations into people named in the Epstein files in order to shield that material from public view. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a longtime Trump loyalist who has had a prominent split with Trump over the bill, said Tuesday that she saw the administration's compliance with the bill as its \"real test.\" \"Will the Department of Justice release the files, or will it all remain tied up in investigations?\" she asked. In July, the FBI said in a memo regarding the Epstein investigation that, \"we did not uncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties.\" But Bondi last week complied with Trump's demands and ordered a federal prosecutor to investigate Epstein's ties to the president's political foes, including Clinton. Still, Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican who sponsored the bill, said \"there's no way they can have enough investigations to cover\" all of the people he believes are implicated in Epstein's abuse. \"And if they do, then good,\" he added. The bill also requires the Justice Department to produce reports on what materials it withheld, as well as redactions made, within 15 days of the release of the files. It stipulates that officials can't withhold or redact anything \"on the basis of embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity, including to any government official, public figure, or foreign dignitary.\" Who could be named? There's a widely held expectation that many people could be named in case files for investigations that spanned over a decade — and some concern that just because someone is named, that person would be assumed guilty or complicit. Epstein was a luminary who kept company with heads of state, influential political figures, academics and billionaires. The release of his emails and messages by a House Oversight Committee investigation last week has already shown his connections with — and private conversations about — Trump and many other high-powered figures. Yet federal prosecutors follow carefully constructed guidelines about what information they produce publicly and at trial, both to protect victims and to uphold the fairness of the legal system. House Speaker Mike Johnson raised objections to the bill on those grounds this week, arguing that it could reveal unwanted information on victims as well as others who were in contact with investigators. Still, Johnson did not actually try to make changes to the bill and voted for it on the House floor. For the bill's proponents, a public reckoning over the investigation is precisely the point. Some of the survivors of trafficking from Epstein and Maxwell have sought ways to name people they accuse of being complicit or involved, but fear they will face lawsuits from the men they accuse. Massie said that he wants the FBI to release the reports from its interviews with the victims. Those reports typically contain unvetted information, but Massie said he is determined to name those who are accused. He and Greene have offered to read the names of those accused on the House floor, which would shield their speech from legal consequences. \"We need names,\" Massie said. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5584087","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-05:00","title":"This Frida Kahlo Painting Could Break Records at Auction on Thursday","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Frida Kahlo's 1940 painting 'El sueño (La cama)' is set to be auctioned by Sotheby's in New York on November 19, 2025, with an estimated sale price of $40 to $60 million — potentially becoming the most expensive artwork ever sold by a woman.

The sale of the 1940 painting, called  El sueño (La cama) , is widely anticipated to set a record for the most expensive artwork made by a woman. \" El sueño  stands among Frida Kahlo's greatest masterworks — a rare and striking example of her most surrealist impulses,\" said Anna Di Stasi, Sotheby's head of Latin American art, in a statement. \"Kahlo fuses dream imagery and symbolic precision with unmatched emotional intensity, creating a work that is at once deeply personal and universally resonant.\" Sotheby's estimates that  El sueño (La cama)  will sell for between $40 and $60 million. The final price could easily outstrip the 2014 record set by Kahlo's friend and contemporary Georgia O'Keeffe, when O'Keeffe's 1932 work  Jimson Weed/White Flower No. 1  sold at auction for $44.4 million. The last time Frida Kahlo broke an auction record was in 2021, when her 1949 work  Diego y yo  sold for $34.9 million; then the highest price for a Latin American artwork. It is also Kahlo's highest sale to date. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       At a moment when art sales have dramatically softened,  museums face massive financial restructuring  and a number of leading galleries have shuttered, the buzz around this painting is significant but not surprising. Surrealist women artists are currently  in vogue among collectors , and Kahlo is among a small handful of superstar artists with a seemingly bulletproof brand — think Andy Warhol, Jean-Michel Basquiat and Gustav Klimt. A Klimt painting auctioned by Sotheby's on Tuesday sold for $236.4 million, making it the second-most expensive painting ever auctioned. Kahlo's mystique erupts in part from her psychologically complex self-portraits that focus on her disabilities, her politics, her heritage and her deep connection to the world shimmering around her. \"Her paintings tell stories — intimate, engaging, terrifying and tragic ones,\" wrote art historian Sharyn R. Udall in her 2003 article,  \"Frida Kahlo's Mexican Body: History, Identity and Artistic Aspiration,\"  published in  Woman's Art Journal.  \"When Kahlo looked into death's dark mirror, she saw herself. In the act of painting and in the resulting canvases, she documented her own attempts to survive pain, to make sense of it, to act out through images layered with irony, fantasy and allegory. Her work is searingly candid, overlaid with the unreality of an endless nightmare.\" And her work seems to only grow in power. Just within the past year, more than a dozen museums around the world exhibited shows dedicated to Kahlo. An  immersive experience  that brought audiences inside some of them has been traveling internationally. The Museum of Fine Arts in Houston will soon open a vast retrospective called  Frida: The Making of an Icon.  It's scheduled to transfer to the Tate Modern in London next June. And a new Frida Kahlo museum that explores the artist's early life opened in Kahlo's neighborhood in Mexico City in September. It's the third museum that centers Kahlo's life and art in the city. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5611148","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"05:15:00-05:00","title":"Eating just a handful of plastic can be fatal for marine animals, a study finds","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reveals that even small amounts of plastic can be fatal to marine animals.

Balloons. Grocery bags. Every day, the equivalent of 2,000 full garbage trucks worth of plastic gets dumped in the world's oceans. Scientists have long known that plastic waste is harmful to marine life. A new study, published in the journal  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , shows much plastic a marine animal has to eat for it to be lethal. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"What surprised me the most is how little it takes to become deadly,\" said Britta Baechler, a co-author of the study and director of Ocean Plastics Research at the Ocean Conservancy. Less than three sugar cubes' worth of plastic could kill an Atlantic puffin. Two baseballs' worth would do in a sea turtle. The equivalent of a soccer ball is enough to off a seal or dolphin. \"For seabirds, ingesting just six tiny pieces of rubber, each smaller than about the size of a pea, can result in a 90 percent chance of death,\" Baechler said. To determine the amounts and the kinds of plastic that marine animals were eating, researchers compiled the autopsy data of more than 10,000 deceased animals from 53 studies that had been conducted around the world. Among the victims: an albatross with an entire plastic bottle in its digestive tract. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"In another instance, there was a sperm whale that had died from eating an entire bucket that broken up in its gut and caused an obstruction,\" Baechler said. The study focused on macroplastics, debris that can be seen with the naked eye. It didn't look at microplastics, which can be microscopic and have been found even in  the deepest parts  of the ocean. Nor did it look at  entanglements , the other primary way plastics impact marine animals. Greg Merrill, a researcher who focuses on plastics and marine animals and wasn't involved in the study, said scientists have known for years that marine animals are eating plastic, often because it looks like their natural food. \"Like if you are a sea turtle, for example, and you eat jellyfish, a plastic grocery bag is pretty similar,\" he said. \"It's fluid. It's not got a lot going on with it.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       He published a study last year that found whales, which use sonar to prey on food in the blackness of the deep ocean, can even be confused by plastic. The acoustic signature — the strength of the echo — a whale would hear coming off of a piece of plastic waste  was similar  to what they'd hear coming off of their natural prey. \"So it kind of suggested that perhaps they're mistaking their acoustic cues and ingesting plastic that way,\" he said. The new study, Merrill said, is the kind of research that's needed to show policymakers and the general public how plastic is negatively affecting the health of marine animals. He and the authors of the new study said policy changes are needed internationally to reduce the production of plastic products — particularly single-use plastics, like soda bottles and food packaging, that have a long life after their single use. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"I think it's pretty obvious but plastic pollution is not just unsightly,\" Baechler said. \"It really does represent a serious immediate threat to marine life and we need urgent action.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5612793","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Trump's National Guard deployments face mounting legal pushback","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Trump has continued to push for National Guard deployments in U.S. cities such as Portland, Oregon, and Memphis, Tennessee, citing public safety and federal personnel protection.

In his second term, Trump has continued to push the boundaries of military involvement in domestic matters, whether it comes to addressing public safety, quelling protests or safeguarding federal buildings and personnel, including ICE agents. In response, local and state Democratic leaders have forcefully pushed back and made strides in the courts, where judges have deemed the use of military force as unnecessary or unlawful. Some judges have also expressed wariness around having the military get involved in civilian affairs. \"This principle has been foundational to the safeguarding of our fundamental liberties under the Constitution,\" U.S. District Court Judge Karin Immergut wrote in her ruling freezing Trump's deployment to Portland, Ore. earlier this month. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The latest court to push back was in Tennessee, where a judge temporarily blocked the state's use of the Guard in Memphis. That deployment was ordered by the governor at the behest of Trump. As the legal challenges mount, the Defense Department over the weekend ordered hundreds of troops in Chicago and Portland to return to their home states after federal courts stalled deployments,  NPR previously reported . Some legal and military experts view the recent events as minor setbacks for the Trump administration. But others see the court decisions as proof of checks and balances at work, at least to some degree. \"There's a pretty common theme that deploying the military into U.S. cities is not something that can be done lawlessly,\" said David Janovsky, a senior policy analyst at the Project on Government Oversight, a watchdog group. \"It is a good sign that the courts are standing up and saying that.\" Breaking down the Memphis ruling  In Tennessee, a group of Democratic lawmakers and officials filed a lawsuit against Republican Gov. Bill Lee and others, challenging the deployment of the state's National Guard. The plaintiffs argued that Memphis did not face a \"rebellion or invasion,\" which was the criteria for sending the Guard under the state's constitution. Unlike the governors of Illinois, Oregon and California, who have opposed Trump's deployment of Guard forces, the governor of Tennessee approved and directed the deployment in Memphis.  Still, on Monday, Davidson County Chancellor Patricia Head Moskal sided with the plaintiffs. In her opinion, she wrote, \"The power committed to the Governor as commander-in-chief of the Army and Militia is not unfettered.\" Benjamin R. Farley, an attorney with the National Immigration Law Center, which   was part of a coalition that provided legal representation to the plaintiffs,   said Moskal's ruling showed that the Tennessee governor does not have blanket authority to deploy troops.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"It's one more victory in a line of victories for the law against executive overreach, whether that's the president or as is the case here, the governor of Tennessee,\" he said. White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told NPR that the administration disagreed with the ruling. \"This state court judge fundamentally misunderstood the law and is attempting to act as a policy-maker, not a judge,\" she said in an email. Now, it's important to note that the pause on the deployment has not taken effect, as the chancellor gave the state a few days to appeal. In a statement, Lee spokesperson Elizabeth Lane Johnson said the state will appeal and the Guard will continue to operate in the city. \"Memphians know their city is facing a violent crime emergency that the state must address, and we're confident higher courts will ultimately recognize this as well,\" she said. Janovsky from the Project on Government Oversight said allowing the Guard operations to continue is one way the courts tend to fall short. \"That sort of misreads the stakes of the situation,\" he said. \"If it is presumptively illegal to have troops on the streets, it seems completely backwards to let the troops stay on the street until there's a final determination.\" As federal courts block troop deployments, will SCOTUS have final say? A Defense Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, told NPR that the holidays may have influenced the decision to  withdraw out-of-state troops from Illinois and Oregon  in the coming days. But retired Maj. Gen. William Enyart, who led the Illinois National Guard from 2007 to 2012, believes the federal courts, which have repeatedly blocked the deployments in Chicago and Portland from moving forward, also played a role. \"This shows the relative strength of the system and of the founding fathers in designing that system, where we had a separation of powers as well as a balancing of powers,\" he added. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The Trump administration is challenging the rulings that block the use of troops and in the case over the deployment in Chicago, the administration has asked the Supreme Court to weigh in. Some legal experts say it could have a ripple effect — to a degree — depending on how broadly the justices rule. \"The more broadly they construe their opinion, the more broad of an effect we're going to see,\" said Chris Mirasola, a national security law professor at the University of Houston Law Center. Even as debates over the mobilizations play out in various courts, Trump has  suggested sending troops  to about half a dozen other cities, and warned of invoking the Insurrection Act to pave the way. Mirasola said there are limits to how much the courts can restrict the president's use of the military, and ultimately the public serves as a stronger check on power. \"It's always going to be public sentiment that I think is especially consequential,\" he said. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/immigration-courts-deportations-trump-administration-8b9fab5475c0da4c0f13f3381de91448","dateOfPublication":"2023-04-15","timeOfPublication":"14:30:00Z","title":"Economic Policy Change Drives Up Consumer Spending, Slows Business Investment","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A recent economic policy change introduced on April 10, 2023, has significantly influenced consumer spending and business investment.

Hearings repeatedly ended with cases dismissed by the government, allowing agents to arrest immigrants in courthouse hallways. AP reporters also reviewed internal records and spoke to judges, clerks and lawyers for the departments of Justice and Homeland Security to gain insight about the scope of the administration’s effort. The government lawyer knew what was coming as she stood inside a courtroom and texted an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent waiting in a corridor a few feet away. “I can’t do this,” the lawyer said in a text message as she looked at her docket of cases. “This is a new emotional load.” “I understand,” the agent responded. “Hopefully we meet again in a better situation.” Nearby, a Cuban man who had lived in the United States for years stepped from an elevator and into the courtroom where the government lawyer was waiting for what the man thought was a routine hearing. Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel. Follow on The man was doing what the law required, and brought along his wife, a legal resident, and their 7-month-old infant. Then the lawyer quickly moved to have the man’s asylum claim dismissed and a judge agreed, making the man eligible for “expedited removal.” As he left the courtroom, the man was swarmed by plainclothes immigration agents who had been surveilling him. A struggle ensued and the wife’s shouts could be heard from the hallway as the lawyer moved on to the next case. The agent replied four minutes later: “Got him.” Similar scenes of courthouse arrests , part of a makeover of the immigration courts under President Donald Trump, are playing out across the United States as his call for mass deportations of migrants is executed with unusually aggressive tactics.

Now that Americans have seen how the plan is being implemented, there are signs that many think he has gone too far. About 57% of adults disapprove of Trump’s handling of immigration, according to a survey this month by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research . Over several months, reporters for The Associated Press observed immigration court proceedings in 21 cities. Hearings repeatedly ended with cases dismissed by the government, allowing plainclothes federal agents to carry out arrests in courthouse hallways in close coordination with attorneys from the Department of Homeland Security. Screenshots of the text messages were obtained by The Associated Press from a government official who feared reprisal and provided them on condition of anonymity. The messages offer a rare look at how the nation’s 75 immigration courts are churning out rulings in an assembly-line like fashion and how, for many people, the courtrooms have become deportation traps.

Due process seemingly is an afterthought. “When Americans picture a courtroom, there are a few core expectations” of fairness, dignity and impartiality, said Ashley Tabaddor, a former immigration judge in Los Angeles and past president of the National Association of Immigration Judges. “That’s what makes a court — not a room with a bench or person with a robe,” she said. “But what we have here is a vision completely turned on its head.” Over the past nine months, the Trump administration has fired almost 90 immigration judges seen by Trump’s allies as too lenient, directed masked officers to handcuff migrants at closed asylum hearings and sent memos instructing judges to fall into line. Unlike federal courts, where there are strict rules of procedure and judges have lifetime tenure, the Justice Department runs immigration courts and the attorney general can fire the judges with fewer restraints. Nine current officials spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. Most expressed deep misgivings about punishing people who had followed the rules and showed up for court hearings. “As a government attorney, my duty is to uphold the law and protect the public interest — not to secure removal or detention outcomes by default,” a government lawyer wrote to the American Bar Association seeking professional guidance. But that is not how cases are often unfolding. Courthouse arrests are coordinated days in advance to meet quotas with little regard for the particulars of a case, according to several of the U.S. officials. According to one official, Homeland Security lawyers note on a spreadsheet which cases are “amenable” to dismissal, allowing an asylum-seeker to be immediately rearrested and placed in expedited removal proceedings. Most of those detained are men without lawyers who entered the U.S. alone and are expected to appear in court in person. Contrary to Trump’s claims that he is targeting the ‘worst of the worst,’ most don’t have a criminal conviction, according to a Cato Institute analysis of ICE data . ICE reviews the spreadsheet and selects which people it wants to pursue if cases are dismissed. On the hearing date, federal agents communicate directly with DHS lawyers, who act as prosecutors in immigration courts. The lawyer often provides near verbatim updates of the proceedings over text message to agents waiting outside the courtroom. “Black shirt? Let me know if the judge dismissed,” an ICE agent texted during one hearing.

The courts were established in 1952, but it was not until 1973 that “special inquiry officers” were given the “judge” title and allowed to wear judicial robes. The Executive Office for Immigration Review, or EOIR, was created in 1983. But that agency remained a part of the Justice Department, giving the attorney general authority to override decisions. “We were a legal Cinderella,” said Dana Leigh Marks, who retired as an immigration judge in 2021 after a 34-year career. “No other court in the nation functions like this.” The first Trump administration undertook a series of changes to reduce the case backlog, including instructing judges to deny entire categories of asylum claims such as for victims of gang or domestic violence. It also set up a dashboard that would become the bane of many judges: Red, yellow and green gauges measure each judge’s performance on goals ranging from completed cases — a minimum of 700 annually, regardless of complexity — to how many custody cases were decided on their first hearings. To meet the metrics, judges must race through dockets, sometimes devoting mere minutes to evaluate asylum-seekers’ claims. “It’s like deciding death penalty cases in a traffic court setting,” Marks said.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More Administration refers to immigration judges as ‘inferior officers’ When Trump returned to the White House in January, his allies took direct aim at the court. Since then, the Justice Department has issued 52 policy memos — more than the previous six years combined — making it easier to hire and fire judges and warning against pro-migrant bias. The memos highlight the courts’ weakened status by referring to judges as “inferior officers” — a rarely used term taken from the Constitution. In early September, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said he would lend 600 military lawyers to the immigration courts , about equal to the current number of judges. The goal, according to the administration, is to more effectively reduce caseloads by widening the pool of potential judges to include people already steeped in administrative law. But many migrant advocates are concerned the incoming judges lack the necessary experience to decide asylum cases. “It makes as much sense as having a cardiologist do a hip replacement,” said Ben Johnson, executive director of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. The administration has pushed back against criticism it is co-opting the courts to accelerate its deportation goals. In a statement, Justice Department spokeswoman Natalie Baldassarre said DHS decides whether to arrest migrants and that most judges consider it an “honor rather than an insult” to be called an inferior officer empowered by the Constitution and serving at the will of the attorney general. Baldassarre likened a record surge of asylum seekers during the Biden administration to an “improper conspiracy between DHS and the Immigration Courts to effectuate an unlawful amnesty for hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens.” The Justice Department, she said, had “restored the integrity, impartiality, and independence of the Courts.” DHS did not respond to repeated email and phone requests for comment.

Fear prevails. Resumes are being updated. One DHS lawyer described being haunted at night by the sound of jangling shackles of migrants the lawyer helped arrest. The lawyer joined the government after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, believing that protecting America’s borders was a patriotic duty. The lawyer still cherishes a signed copy of Nobel Prize winner Elie Wiesel’s memoir “Night,” which was handed out at a work seminar. “Think higher, feel deeper,” reads the author’s inscription of the book, which is marked DHS “Training Material.” Today, its message torments. “This isn’t what any of us signed up for,” the lawyer said. After a turbulent summer, the courthouses are starting to look lonely, too. With word spreading that a trap had been laid, many migrants, fearing arrest, are asking to appear online or are skipping hearings altogether. Meanwhile, ambitious managers are publicly upbraiding those who raise doubts about the legality of locking up migrants with no criminal record in packed facilities. In a recent town hall with DHS principal legal adviser Charles Wall, several lawyers complained about the pressure, confusing orders and lack of resources, according to notes from the meeting shared with AP. Wall said the pace is likely to continue for years, the notes say. When one federal employee asked about bringing firearms to work for fear of harassment by activists inside courthouses, Wall said that judges should not hesitate to kick out the public. Wall could not be reached for comment.

That is more than the previous five years combined. The number is almost certainly an undercount because most migrants do not withdraw their asylum claim before self-deporting. At immigration court in Tacoma, Washington, the detainees came up one after the other with the same plea. “I want to go back to my country,” a Venezuelan man told Judge Theresa Scala. “I want to leave the country,” said a man from Mexico. Immigrants know what they face: detention centers with ominous names — “Alligator Alcatraz,” “Louisiana Lockup” and “Speedway Slammer” — as well as workplace raids and neighborhood dragnets.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More Fired judges targeted as too liberal Tania Nemer believes she was cut out to be a judge. From the bench at immigration court in Cleveland, she prided herself on listening carefully to each person’s asylum claim. “There’s a simplicity about it that I just loved,” she told the AP. “If you can provide justice in an efficient manner, you can really help a lot of people.” The decision to apply to become an immigration judge in 2023 was deeply personal. Her father fled turmoil in Lebanon and arrived in Ohio at 16 with $6 in his pocket. He washed cars, learned English and eventually opened a namesake bar — Manny’s Pub — that allowed him to provide for his family. When Nemer married, her wedding gift was the unspent dollar bills, so she would never forget her roots. But Nemer’s fondness for the law came crashing down Feb. 5. In the middle of a hearing, her supervisor opened the door of her packed courtroom and told her she needed to come with him. “As soon as he said ‘Grab your ID,’ I knew I was being terminated,” she said. Still in shock, she was handed a two-paragraph letter, digitally signed by Sirce Owen, the acting director of the Executive Office for Immigration Review. It said she was being removed because the agency “has determined that retaining you is not appropriate, and we thank you for your service.” No justification was given. But she thinks she knows some of the reasons: her Arab-sounding name, a history of previously representing migrants and diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, course work from Cornell University. She filed a discrimination claim with the Justice Department to find out why she was fired; the complaint was dismissed. Nemer was the first judge fired after Trump returned to the White House. But 86 have been sacked since. Dozens more took the Department of Government Efficiency’s “Fork in the Road” resignation offer. The majority were hired under Democratic President Joe Biden and are still serving two-year probationary periods, according to a list of the fired judges obtained by the AP. It is unclear who ordered the firings or how they were selected. But those removed granted asylum at markedly higher rates than their peers — in about half of all cases since August 2023 compared with 34% nationwide, according to Mobile Pathways. Among those purged were all 10 that appeared on the DHS Bureaucrat Watch List , a website created last year with funding from The Heritage Foundation, whose Project 2025 was a blueprint for the Trump administration’s policies and personnel decisions. The list includes names, Facebook photos, salaries and campaign donations for what it calls “America’s most subversive immigration bureaucrats.” One target was Emmett Soper, a judge in northern Virginia who worked at EOIR headquarters during the Biden administration. “As soon as I saw that, I knew the rules were changing, that I was under some kind of microscope that didn’t exist before,” he said. Tom Jones, the conservative creator of the website, declined to be interviewed. Baldassarre, the Justice Department spokeswoman, said the department is not targeting specific individuals for firing but does continually evaluate all judges. “All judges have a legal, ethical, and professional obligation to be impartial and neutral in adjudicating cases,” Baldassarre said. “If a judge violates that obligation by demonstrating a systematic bias in favor of or against either party, EOIR is obligated to take action to preserve the integrity of its system.” The wave of firings and new directives from the Justice Department has had a chilling effect. Denial of motions to appear for hearings online tripled after a March memo repealing Biden-era guidelines instructing judges to generally grant such requests, according to Mobile Pathways data. Denial of continuances, which allow migrants extra time to seek legal counsel, have also spiked as have the number of cases classified as abandoned. Nemer returned to immigration court in October for the first time since being fired to represent a Mexican client she has known for 20 years and who was picked up by unidentified agents. While the man was jailed, his girlfriend, who was five months pregnant, miscarried. Word of the former judge’s return quickly spread and a stream of former colleagues came to the courtroom to hug her and express their dismay over her firing. “By the third hug I couldn’t hold it in and just started crying,” she said.

This is the new office of American Gateways. In April, the administration eliminated programs worth $30 million to provide free legal assistance to migrants, the vast majority of whom represent themselves in court. But lawyers for American Gateways keep coming, four times a week, setting up in a parking lot. The conference room they once occupied inside the courthouse is now used as a break room for ICE agents. Assistance ranges from helping immigrants file motions to rehearsing what they will say to judges. When they can, they sign people up for virtual appearances to minimize the risk of arrest.

Since May 15, when courthouse sweeps began, migrants have filed more than 3,000 habeas corpus petitions — to determine if someone is lawfully held in custody — seeking release. The flood of claims threatens to clog the already crowded federal docket, which has little authority in immigration cases. “The administration is attempting to press the gas at such an unreasonable speed without considering due process,” said Annelise Araujo, a Boston-based immigration attorney. One petition, filed in Miami, was from a Cuban man detained the same day he and his American wife and 10-month-old daughter were moving into their first home. Several petitioners said they had survived torture at the hands of gangs in Mexico, Ecuador and Venezuela. Another legal challenge was introduced by an HIV-positive man from Brazil taken into custody four days after his husband died of a heart attack. With the body of Frederico Abreu’s husband still at the funeral home, ICE officials knocked on his door stating they had documents belonging to the deceased man.

One was a man from Honduras who showed up at the northern Virginia immigration court with his wife and their infant baby. Another child, a son, unable to walk, pushed himself in a wheelchair studded with flashing, colorful lights. The family, fearful of further immigration problems, did not want to be identified. The judge denied a government request to deport the man. But seconds later, as the family stepped from the courtroom, they were stopped by four ICE agents. The wife sobbed, hanging on her husband’s arm as she pleaded: “Por favor, Por favor.” The husband clutched the sleeping infant’s carrier. Their son sat playing with a cell phone. “I need you to go ahead and say goodbye,” an agent told the man. Crying, the man knelt to hug his son, who clung to his father, yelling repeatedly: “Papa! Papa!” Finally, the father managed to pull himself away and started to leave with the ICE officers. The boy tried to chase them. But the ICE agent was holding the back of the wheelchair as the boy futilely pumped his arms. The Department of Homeland Security confirmed his July arrest. The family said he was later deported. Homeland Security said he voluntarily agreed to leave the country and returned to Honduras on Oct. 8 after three months in detention. __ Goodman reported from Cleveland and Sullivan from Minneapolis; AP reporters who contributed are: Cedar Attanasio in New York; Martha Bellisle in Seattle and Tacoma, Washington; Jacques Billeaud in Phoenix; Kate Brumback in Atlanta; Eric Gay in San Antonio, Texas; Valerie Gonzalez in Harlingen, Texas; Aaron Kessler in Washington; Gisela Salomon in Miami; Rebecca Santana in Annandale and Sterling, Virginia; Lea Skene in Baltimore; Hannah Schoenbaum in Salt Lake City; Colleen Slevin in Denver; Elliot Spagat in San Diego; Sophia Tareen in Chicago and Indianapolis; Amy Taxin in Santa Ana, California; Julie Watson in San Diego."},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-50605","dateOfPublication":"2025-02-26","timeOfPublication":"15:39:00.000Z","title":"How a son spent a year trying to save his father from conspiracy theories","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A son, Zach Mack, enters into a year-long bet with his father to challenge his father's belief in a series of politically catastrophic conspiracy theories, including predictions about the removal of political leaders, martial law, and election fraud.

his father from conspiracy theories \n         By Zach Mack \n        \n           Wednesday, February 26, 2025 • 3:39 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         This story is an accompaniment to a podcast series released by NPR's  Embedded  called  Alternate Realities . You can listen to  all three episodes here  or wherever you listen to podcasts. About a year ago, my dad bet me $10,000 that he could foretell the future. It all started when he texted me a picture of a list. Writing in barely legible cursive, he had scribbled 10 politically apocalyptic predictions. My dad was foreshadowing verdicts of treason for Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi, Joe Biden and the Clintons, who would go down for murder as well. Biden would ultimately be removed from office, and so would the governor of New York and the mayor of New York City. It went on. Donald Trump, who was seeking reelection, would have all charges leveled against him at the time dropped, all while being reinstated as president without the need for November's election. He also thought that the U.S. would come under nationwide martial law. For all his catastrophizing, I wouldn't describe my father as a paranoid person — I tend to think of him as an optimist. He's very friendly, the kind of father who cracks a lot of dad jokes with strangers. But like so many Americans, Dad had gotten swept up in conspiracy theories. Chemtrails, Biden body doubles, the idea that a shadowy cabal he calls \"the globalists\" is secretly running the world — these are just a few secret plots my father believes in. The list, however, was something new. My father was now predicting the biggest shake-up in the country's history, and he was absolutely certain that it would happen within a year. At the bottom of the page was a challenge: $1,000 for each of the 10 predictions that were supposed to happen sometime in 2024. My father is not a betting man; nor is he rich. This was easily more money than either of us had ever wagered. Shortly after seeing the list, I called him to discuss the terms. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"When all these things happen,\" he told me, \"you will realize I'm not as big a crackpot as you think I am. These are not conspiracy theories — these are reality.\" The bet seemed over-the-top, but I was intrigued by the opportunity it presented. My dad and I have never been particularly close. Unless we are discussing our favorite college football team, the Ohio State Buckeyes, we disagree on just about everything. Our family dinners had been dissolving into heated arguments for some time. Instead of quarreling until the end of time, we were actually going to settle the single biggest source of tension between us: our diametrically opposed senses of reality. Either he was right or I was. Jan. 1, 2025, would be our deadline. I accepted. A year seemed like the right amount of time to bring him back from the rabbit hole, before his beliefs tore our family apart. A house divided  When I was growing up in the Bay Area, Dad was often the lone Christian conservative, not just within our family but in our broader social circle as well. My mother is a fairly liberal Jewish woman; my sister, Kira, and I tend to be on the same page as she. For years, my dad's views were easy to overlook. He usually kept pretty quiet, but I always knew that he was skeptical of vaccines and that he hated the Clintons. Dad grew up in a deeply Christian household, but at some point in his younger years he rebelled. And when my parents met in the 1980s, neither of them was interested in religion. Sometime after I was born, that began to change. As the years passed, his faith deepened. Back in 2019, my dad, who has never been particularly tech savvy, got an iPad. Kira and I had left home by then. I had gone on to work in media in New York City, and whenever I went back home to visit, I could see that Dad was becoming increasingly interested in  self-proclaimed Christian prophets . I've seen some of the videos he watches on a regular basis. They're full of dark premonitions that echo the predictions in our bet. Once the COVID-19 pandemic hit, he started bristling at mask-wearing, and he refused to get vaccinated. Eventually, he came to believe the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Trump, whom he didn't even vote for in 2016. Two years ago, my sister came out to our dad. My mom and I had known for years, but Kira was always afraid to tell him, because she thought he'd disapprove. It didn't go well. He said he'd always love her, that she'd forever be welcomed in the house, but he thought that being gay was a choice, one he doesn't agree with. \"He told me that I was wrong about myself,\" Kira said when I called her to talk about the state of our family. \"And I don't understand how he could know that.\" These past two years have not been easy for the family, especially for Kira. It's unclear how we can move forward when my sister doesn't feel supported. And then there's all the conspiracy stuff, which has been increasingly hard on my mom. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"I have been very clear that I'm not sure how much more I can take,\" she told me last year, when she and I started having candid conversations about life with Dad. She's 69, on the cusp of retiring, and my dad's behavior was pushing her to reconsider their 40-year marriage. \"This is not the life I had planned for myself.\" Over the summer, Dad began stockpiling survivalist supplies. Their house suddenly filled up with multiple generators, flats of water and cans of food they'd never eaten before. He even moved some money from their joint account to buy precious metal without telling her. When Dad initially proposed the bet, Mom was a little irritated that she wasn't consulted first. After all, the money I'd win for each prediction that proved wrong would come from their shared finances. But now she was warming up to the idea of having a deadline. \"I want a date. And then when that date happens, the precious metals get returned to cash, the flats of water go back to Costco. You do something else with the two generators. And you move on.\" This experiment was starting to feel like more than just a friendly wager. I was starting to worry that by accepting it, I had put the entire family on a collision course. Independent research After receiving my dad's list with 10 predictions, I began thinking about an argument he and I had several years ago. It must have been about politics. I was visiting my parents, and we'd gone out to eat at one of our favorite restaurants. Even though I can't recall the specifics, I've never forgotten how it ended. \"You don't really know me,\" my father told me, getting the last word. I'm 38, and my father has been part of my life since I was born. Despite this shared history, I remember thinking that maybe he was right. Now, as our yearlong bet was playing out, I realized I had a lot to learn about the person I was trying to change. I started with his friends. In my efforts to learn more about my father, I reached out to people he had known for decades. They mostly wondered where Dad was getting his information. Even friends who share in some of Dad's conspiracies thought he was going too far. \"He's watching too many of  The X-Files ,\" one of them told me. Dad's friends clearly thought he was going the wrong way. He seemed to be on his own with his beliefs. I had seen this sort of thing play out before in the family — I was struck by the parallels with the story of his own father. My grandfather was a chiropractor. Like Dad, he was also opposed to vaccines. He believed in what he called the body's natural immunities — so much so that my father was held out of school in the 1960s due to a new vaccine mandate at the time. \"He was stubborn, very opinionated, hardheaded at times,\" my dad said when I asked him to describe what my granddad was like. \"He was very embittered against the medical society, because they literally ran him out of business.\" Back in 1969, the Ohio State Medical Board filed charges against my grandfather for practicing without a license. He even spent a couple of days in jail.   My dad says he was never able to fully recover after his business dissolved. My first memories of my granddad are of a tall, thin man. One day, when he came to visit us, his body had completely changed. He had gained over a hundred pounds in a short amount of time and was going through mental health issues that the family never fully understood. It's hard to know, because he wouldn't see a doctor, but he started falling asleep at odd times. He'd be in the middle of a conversation or at dinner, and he'd start snoring. Minutes later, he'd wake up and carry on. This also happened while he was driving. My granddad got into a number of car accidents; he totaled several cars and nearly killed my grandmother, but he refused to admit that anything was wrong. My father tried to talk to him several times. When that didn't work, he tried something else. \"I wrote him a long letter. And I said, 'Dad, I love you. I'm not trying to say anything damaging about you, but your whole family is concerned. Can't you recognize that we would all like to see you live to a ripe old age?'\" When I was 10 years old, my parents called my sister and me into the kitchen. Their grave faces told me all I needed to know. My grandfather was dead. Earlier that day, his vehicle had veered off the road and crashed. Our best guess is that he fell asleep behind the wheel. When I think about my grandfather, I think about the way his death may have been caused by stubbornness, a refusal to listen to those around him. I was starting to see a direct correlation with Dad's stubbornness, his deep distrust in institutions and the attitude that no matter what, he knows best. As we reached the fall, I reached out to experts. I had to know why he seemed willing to give up so much, including his own family, for his beliefs. So I called up researchers who study conspiracy theories and the people who believe them, and I documented my journey in a  series I did for NPR's  Embedded . One piece of advice I kept getting was to try to see things from his perspective. Among our family and friends in the Bay Area, my dad has always been an outsider. We'd been rejecting his beliefs for years, but as time went on, they'd become more extreme. I was starting to realize that, from his vantage point, we were the intolerant ones, the ones who don't understand. When I asked my dad whether he feels like the odd man out, he answered somberly, \"It's painful at times. It's very sad for me.\" So what happens when your family and your friends don't respect your beliefs? Perhaps you reach for a higher purpose — something existential. This came up in a conversation with Charlie Safford, a researcher who designs therapeutic techniques for people who believe in far-right conspiracy theories. He believes that conspiracy theories are fundamentally emotional coping mechanisms. \"Even if your father doesn't put the pieces together, there is some awakening of his own mortality that might be contributing to all of this,\" he told me. \"One of the ways that you come to terms is to look back and say, 'Did my life have meaning?'\" Safford asked me how old my grandfather was when he died. I wasn't sure, so I asked my father. He told me that he was 68, the same age my father was when he challenged me to the bet. I had never considered this angle before, but Dad has. \"Yep, I've thought about that a million times. Now I'm the age he was when he died.\" I sat back down with my father after digging deep into our family history. Winter was approaching, and the bet wouldn't come due for another two months, but I had to know what he thought about his own views. Was he aware of how radical they'd gotten? \"It's not that they've gotten more extreme,\" he told me. \"I've become more in tune with who I really am.\" I reminded him of that argument we had in the restaurant years ago, when he insisted I hardly knew him. I asked him whether he felt like I knew him a little better. \"Oh, absolutely,\" he replied. \"These conversations, talking about my dad and all the rest. … Yeah, you know me.\" I felt the same way. Our Jan. 1 deadline was fast approaching. Now that we were closer, I allowed myself to hope for the best. Maybe I would be able to change his mind after all. Time to settle up When the day finally arrived, Dad and I sat down across from each other, at the same table where we shared countless family dinners growing up. He pulled out his handwritten list; I had my laptop open to a document full of questions and fact checks. I ran through all 10 items on the list, ready to push back against any hint that his predictions had somehow come true. There was no need for it. Dad kept saying that, yes, he had hoped that they would take place before the end of 2024, but he knew that none had come to pass. \"I'm very happy that it didn't happen,\" he told me as we reached the final prediction, the one about martial law being imposed all over the country. \"In terms of convincing you, I struck out big time.\" I wish I could say that Dad changed his mind and the family was finally able to heal. For a brief instant, that seemed to be the ending that was playing out between us. It didn't last. \"However,\" Dad pushed on, \"I guarantee that all 10 of these have legs. You will see by the end of 2025.\" The bet was over, but we still needed to assess the damage. Because at that point, our family had already hit an all-time low. Days before, as I was getting ready to fly home for the holidays, I arranged a call with my mom and sister. I wanted to see whether they had any requests for my father, like seeing a therapist or attending a church with more inclusive views on sexuality. Given our newfound closeness, I had the feeling that Dad would be open to hearing me out. Minutes before our call, my sister sent a text. \"I feel the conversation and the interview would cause me more harm and pain at this point,\" she wrote. \"Please continue today without me.\" Kira was out. She wasn't interested in teaching Dad how to accept her without conditions. Turns out, my mom had reached the same conclusion. She called me later that same day to let me know about her decision. \"I don't see a path where this marriage can continue. I don't see a path for me,\" she said. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       At that point, their 40-year marriage was hanging by a thread. Back in November, my father echoed false claims about Jan. 6 rioters being paid actors. My mom asked him to move out of their room on the day after Trump's victory in the presidential election. They were now agreeing to take the next step. Their marriage was officially ending. By the time I sat down to settle the bet, it was down to just Dad and me. I knew it was finally time to press him. \"I just see an unwillingness for you to be wrong,\" I told him.  \"I'm going to admit I was wrong about the timeline on all 10 things,\" he assured me.  \"See how you prefaced it?\" I said. \"You're just saying that you're wrong about the timeline.\"  \"Why am I going to abandon the truth?\" he insisted. \"I can't abandon the truth.\"  As I watched him double down, I kept thinking of all the unvetted information he'd continue to take in, the survivalist gear and precious metals he'd buy, the people he'd surround himself with in the absence of our family. As the conversation wound down, I finally let go of any notion that I could convince him of anything he didn't already believe. I don't know what comes next. Things fell apart so quickly, but also slowly; as the years passed, cracks started opening up, eventually turning into a chasm. In the end, we didn't make it. When I asked my dad where he thought we would be as a family when the next Christmas rolled around, the confidence in his ability to predict the future came crashing down. \"I have no idea,\" he told me, releasing a heavy sigh. \"I can't even think that far ahead.\" In many ways, I'm the one who got off the easiest. I'm still in good standing with everyone, which makes me feel a mixture of relief and guilt, maybe a splash of gratitude. And for those of you wondering, yes, I took the money. Absolutely. But on New Year's Day, when my dad officially lost the bet, I took him to the Rose Bowl, to see our beloved Ohio State football team in the national championship game. After the year we just had, it felt good to treat Dad with his own money. The Buckeyes won, and as we cheered their victory, I felt a deep sense of connection. The day was a reminder of how good things could be between us and, at the same time, of everything we couldn't be anymore. As I watched the clock run down, I knew the game would be over soon, and so would be that brief moment in which we got to share the same reality.

2025-11-19T16:54:21+00:00\n\nBillionaire businessman and activist Tom Steyer, who once self-financed an unsuccessful White House campaign and spent his own money advocating for President Donald Trump’s impeachment, has launched his bid for California governor as a Democrat. The 68-year-old’s tremendous wealth immediately makes him a notable contender in a free-for-all that includes more than a half-dozen Democrats and two Republicans competing in an all-party June primary, with the top two vote-getters advancing to a November general election to succeed term-limited Gov. Gavin Newsom. Steyer announced his candidacy with a pledge to improve economic conditions and by framing his political record as friendly to consumers, working-class voters and the environment . “Californians deserve a life they can afford,” he said in a video released Wednesday morning. “But the Californians who make this state run are being run over by the cost of living.” The approach puts Steyer on a collision course with other candidates like progressive Congresswoman Katie Porter, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and former U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra.

Steyer’s personal fortune could give him an advantage in reaching voters through television and digital advertising in an expansive state with nearly 40 million people and multiple media markets. Still, tremendous wealth has not necessarily translated to statewide electoral success in California: Carly Fiorina, a former Hewlett-Packard CEO, could not unseat Democratic U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer in their 2010 matchup. Meg Whitman, a onetime CEO of eBay, spent more than $100 million of her own money in a losing governor’s campaign that same year. Steyer’s money quickly became a target for rivals in the race. “Tom Steyer tried to buy the presidency — and he failed. The California governorship is not going to be his consolation prize,” said Democrat Betty Yee, a former state controller. Steyer nodded to his wealth Wednesday, noting his business enterprises made “billions of dollars.” But he also sounded populist tones. “The richest people in America think that they earned everything themselves,” he said, before dismissing that notion with an expletive for bovine excrement. “That’s so ridiculous.” Steyer said he would “make corporations pay their fair share again,” and his campaign cited his previous work on ballot initiatives with similar aims. Steyer was a leading advocate for a 2012 ballot initiative that made it harder for corporations to avoid certain taxes. The new revenue was steered to energy improvements in the state’s public schools. In other referendum work, Steyer helped lead the 2016 campaign that yielded a $2 per-pack tax hike on tobacco products. The money was steered to state health care programs, including tobacco-prevention efforts. And Steyer was a top opponent of a 2010 ballot initiative that would have rolled back California’s clean air and climate law, which has been viewed as a national standard on climate policy. In another development Wednesday, Villaraigosa launched a digital ad spotlighting Becerra’s connection to an unfolding Sacramento scandal as the two skirmish over votes, including those of Latinos. Prosecutors allege longtime Becerra aide Sean McCluskie was at the center of a plan that siphoned money from one of Becerra’s dormant state campaign accounts to pad his salary after he accepted a job as Becerra’s chief of staff in Washington. Becerra is not implicated in the indictment but the ad attempts to raise doubts about his judgment and features clips from a TV interview in which Becerra said he knew payments were being made from his account but didn’t know they were being improperly used. Steyer spent millions of his own money touring the country and pushing for Trump’s impeachment during the Republican president’s first term. He then ran for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, spending more than $200 million of his fortune and receiving no pledged delegates. After distant finishes in the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary, Steyer doubled-down with an expensive push in South Carolina, only to finish a distant third behind eventual nominee and President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Steyer then ended his presidential bid, and he financially supported Biden’s reelection in 2024 before the Democrat bowed out in favor of then-Vice President Kamala Harris, another Californian. Steyer’s latest campaign comes amid some Democrats questioning Porter’s candidacy after her combative exchanges with a TV journalist spread online in October. He has long been mentioned, along with Harris and U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla, as a potential heavyweight candidate who could join the field. Harris, who is on a national tour promoting her 2024 campaign memoir, has said consistently that she has no plans to run — suggesting instead that any future campaign would be for the presidency. “I will be voting,” she told The Associated Press on Oct. 17 when asked about entering the governor’s race. Asked whether she was satisfied with the field as Porter faced her most intense criticism, Harris said only that she wanted Democrats to have “the best and the brightest running and winning” and that she was “not actively involved.” Padilla has said he will remain in the Senate."},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5522341","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Dawnita Brown: The Black Daughter Who Cares for Her Parents and Builds a Support Community","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Dawnita Brown, a 43-year-old woman from Baltimore, left her government job in 2016 to volunteer with the Peace Corps in Eswatini, an experience that shaped her resilience and independence.

That requires taking care of herself, too \n         By Juana Summers, Alejandra Marquez Janse, Sarah Handel \n        \n           Thursday, November 20, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         At age 43, Dawnita Brown made a life-changing pivot. She took leave from her secure government job, winnowed down her possessions, resolved her financial responsibilities, and in 2016, signed up for the Peace Corps. Volunteering in Eswatini was \"amazing,\" she says — so much so that she planned to extend her time abroad in a paid position with the Peace Corps after her service ended. She didn't know she was about to make another pivot. In 2018, her mom, Joan Cain, had a stroke in her brain stem. Brown rushed home to Baltimore, preparing herself to say goodbye. Instead, her mom recovered, but with a challenging prognosis. \"So, I became her proxy,\" Brown says, and she stayed by Cain's side through rehabilitation and nursing facilities. Eventually, concerns about the quality of her mother's care led Brown to step away from her job, take her mom home and care for her herself, full time. A huge number of today's 65-year-olds — more than  two-thirds  — will likely need some kind of long-term care as they age, whether it's in-home care, assisted living or a nursing home. Those services can  easily  cost more each year  than what the  average American  makes. And health insurers — both government and private — may not provide the necessary coverage. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       That leaves many people to rely on unpaid family caregivers whose care  AARP valued at $600 billion  in 2021. That's more than half a trillion dollars worth of work done by people like Dawnita Brown. As a household, Brown makes caregiving financially feasible through a patchwork of coverage, including Medicare, supplemental insurance and her mom's pension. And she's debt free thanks to the work she put in readying herself for the Peace Corps. \"I haven't had a steady income in almost 10 years,\" says Brown. \"I haven't paid into retirement. But I don't want for anything.\" 'It's a gift' Brown's   home is warm and inviting, much like herself. The brick row house is tastefully appointed with meaningful family artifacts and photographs, meticulously clean without feeling sterile. On the day we visited, Brown had just returned from taking her dad, Bill Lee Brown, to physical therapy. She cares for him, too. Although Bill and Joan are not a couple, he moved into the home in 2024 after complications from his multiple myeloma diagnosis made it hard for him to live alone. So, while her mom's upstairs, her dad is downstairs. Between them, doing countless flights of stairs a day, Dawnita Brown is holding it all together. Meting out prescriptions, preparing meals, scheduling appointments and calling for help when it's more than one person can handle. Caregiving is a role she didn't expect, but one she has leaned all the way into. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In 2021, Brown founded a community for fellow caregivers called the  Binti Circle . The name comes from the word for daughter in Swahili. \"I started Binti because it was the community I needed and did not have,\" she says. They meet monthly, have outings and events, all with the goal of making a difference in the lives of caregivers, reducing stress and providing safety in community. That way, Brown says, \"you have more skills and tools that you need for this gift of caregiving, because it's a gift to be able to care for your parent, even though it's hard.\" She says it was especially important to her to focus on Black daughters in caregiving roles. \"The daughter holds it together,\" says Brown, even in difficult situations. \"Looking at the fragility of your parent, processing the grief of losing the parent that you knew … that your mom doesn't know you.\" She adds, \"and you know what's even more challenging are those daughters that are caring for parents that did not parent them.\" In the Binti Circle, she has gathered \"a community of daughters that understand and can empathize, with no judgment.\" One of Binti's — and Brown's — core values is the importance of respite for caregivers. \"You know, most people think about self-care as nails and hair and massages,\" she says. Brown does those things, but taking care of herself also  includes regular doctor's appointments and therapy, and simpler things, too. \"It's breathing, just sometimes laying in my bed and breathing. And my devotionals, I always set the tone before I get out of bed.\" And as positive and motivated as Brown is, she does feel down sometimes. \"Yesterday I was feeling kind of yucky,\" she says. \"And so I got up and I found a … 'boost your mood' yoga workout.\" She has also built herself her own little getaway at home — an outdoor deck space furnished with thrifted and upcycled finds, succulents and a fire pit. She calls it her oasis. \"You are responsible for people,\" says Brown, so, \"if you're no good, they're no good. And so, that's why I work very hard to take care of myself.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5508871","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"08:44:00-05:00","title":"Trump Makes the Epstein Files Public: A Timeline of His Shifting Stance","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump initially opposed the release of files from the investigation into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, citing a lack of wrongdoing and calling the controversy a 'Democrat hoax.'

Trump makes the Epstein files public. Here's a timeline of his shifting stance \n         By Rachel Treisman, Bill Chappell \n        \n           Updated Thursday, November 20, 2025 • 8:44 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         President Trump has signed off on  releasing the files  of the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, a whirlwind few days after he reversed his long-held opposition to the matter under mounting pressure from both Democrats and Republicans. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The  measure , which Trump signed Wednesday, gives the Justice Department 30 days to \"make publicly available in a searchable and downloadable format\" all unclassified materials related to its investigation into the disgraced financier, with some exemptions. Epstein was found dead in 2019 in the Manhattan facility where he was being held on charges that he  operated a sex-trafficking ring  preying on young women and underage girls. Officials later concluded he died by suicide. But public skepticism about his death — and allegations that his wealthy, powerful network helped facilitate and cover up his crimes — persist, dogging the Trump administration in particular. The names of a number of powerful figures have appeared in already-released documents related to Epstein's case, including Trump and former President Bill Clinton, both of whom socialized with Epstein. Appearing in Epstein's flight logs and other records, however, is not an indication of wrongdoing. Trump had long resisted the release of additional files from the Justice Department's investigation into Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell, despite promising on the campaign trail that he would do so if reelected. That unfulfilled promise has been the center of growing public controversy, conspiracy theories and pressure from Congress in the months since he took office. Prominent Republicans from House Speaker Mike Johnson to former Vice President Mike Pence have called for more transparency on the Epstein case, along with influential right-wing conspiracy promoters, including media figures such as Tucker Carlson and Laura Loomer. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       And Democrats on the House Oversight Committee continued to apply pressure by subpoenaing and releasing thousands of pages of records from the Justice Department, many of which spotlight Epstein's onetime friendship with Trump — and his later criticism of the president. The White House has consistently downplayed the relationship — which Trump says ended before Epstein was indicted for soliciting prostitution in 2006 — and dismissed the controversy as a hoax pushed by Democrats. But after months of opposing the files' release, Trump  said on Sunday  that \"we have nothing to hide\" and that it was time to move on from what he says is a \"Democrat hoax … to deflect from the Great Success of the Republican Party.\" Congress moved quickly from there. The House voted 427-1 on Tuesday to  advance the measure . Less than three hours later, the Senate set up a process to approve the House measure, without a formal vote, as soon as it received it.   Trump confirmed in a Wednesday night  Truth Social post  that he had \"JUST SIGNED THE BILL TO RELEASE THE EPSTEIN FILES,\" and once again accused Democrats of using the issue to try to distract from Republicans' policy accomplishments. \"This latest Hoax will backfire on the Democrats just as all of the rest have!\" he wrote. Here's a timeline of the Trump administration's shifting tone and actions on the Epstein case. Feb. 21:  Attorney General Pam Bondi says the Epstein client list is \"sitting on my desk\" in an appearance  on Fox News , in response to a question from John Roberts. \"The DOJ may be releasing the list of Jeffrey Epstein's clients? Will that really happen?\" Roberts asks Bondi. \"It's sitting on my desk right now to review. That's been a directive by President Trump. I'm reviewing that,\" the attorney general replies. Bondi later says she was referring to the Epstein files, not a client list. But her remark has echoed through discussions of the Epstein story so far this year. Feb. 27:  The White House gives  binders to far-right influencers  bearing a Department of Justice seal and labels reading, \"Epstein Files: Phase 1\" and \"Declassified.\" But much of the information turns out to have been released before, and Republican Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida, chairwoman of the Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets,  calls it \"old info.\" July 7:  The Justice Department  releases a memo  saying it has found \"no incriminating 'client list'\" for Epstein, contradicting Bondi's February statement. The agency says it turned up more than 300 gigabytes of data and physical evidence. It also states that \"Epstein harmed over one thousand victims.\" But the DOJ says those victims' sensitive information is \"intertwined\" in the materials and it concludes \"no further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The memo  addresses several hot topics on social media. In addition to rebutting the notion of a client list, it says there's no credible evidence that Epstein blackmailed prominent figures or that his death was anything other than a case of suicide. July 12:  \"We're on one Team, MAGA, and I don't like what's happening,\" Trump  says on Truth Social  in response to his supporters' criticisms of Bondi. The president accuses critics of trying to hurt his administration, \"all over a guy who never dies, Jeffrey Epstein.\" People should let Bondi do her job, Trump says, \"and not waste Time and Energy on Jeffrey Epstein, somebody that nobody cares about.\" July 15:  Bondi  refuses to address questions  about her handling of the Epstein files. Trump voices his support, saying his attorney general has \"really done a very good job.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Trump also suggests people who are fixated on Epstein should move on: \"He's dead for a long time. He was never a big factor in terms of life. I don't understand what the interest or what the fascination is, I really don't. And the credible information's been given.\" July 16:  Trump  lashes out at fellow Republicans  for fixating on Epstein, calling it a hoax. \"It's all been a big hoax. It's perpetrated by the Democrats and some stupid Republicans and foolish Republicans fall into the net. And so they try and do the Democrats' work,\" Trump tells reporters in the Oval Office. Trump also  suggests he would approve  of Bondi releasing some Epstein documents if they meet a standard: \"Whatever's credible, she can release. If a document is credible, if a document's there that is credible, she can release.\" As NPR's Dominico Montanaro  later reports , it's one of many instances of Trump emphasizing that \"credible evidence\" from the Epstein records should be shared. July 17:  Trump  slams  The Wall Street Journal  after the  paper publishes what it says  is a risqué birthday note Trump wrote to celebrate Epstein's 50th birthday, stating, \"the supposed letter they printed by President Trump to Epstein was a FAKE.\" \"These are not my words, not the way I talk. Also, I don't draw pictures,\" Trump  writes on Truth Social . July 18:  Trump files a  defamation lawsuit against  The Wall Street Journal   over its coverage of his relationship with Epstein, including the birthday note that Trump says he didn't write. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       On the same day, the DOJ  files a motion in the Southern District of New York  to unseal grand jury testimony related to Epstein's 2019 indictment charging him with sex trafficking offenses, citing \"extensive public interest\" following the agency's July 6 memo. The DOJ later asks to unseal related exhibits, including a PowerPoint presentation and four pages of call logs. The agency files similar motions in New York regarding the criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's longtime partner who was sentenced to a 20-year prison term, as well as in Florida, where Epstein  agreed to a plea deal  with U.S. prosecutors in 2007 over the abuse of minor girls. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       July 19:  Trump  posts on Truth Social  about his administration's grand jury request, saying he \"asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to produce any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, subject to Court approval.\" July 22:  Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche  says he is talking with Maxwell's   lawyer  and expects to meet with her, at Bondi's direction. Trump  says he thinks the plan  \"sounds appropriate.\" July 23:  The Wall Street Journal  reports  that Bondi and other Justice Department officials told Trump in May that his name \"is among many in the Epstein files.\" The newspaper says the officials feel the files contain \"unverified hearsay\" about hundreds of people, including Trump, who were in the same social orbit as Epstein. The same day, federal judge Robin Rosenberg in Florida  denies release  of grand jury transcripts related to Epstein. July 24:  Blanche meets with Maxwell in prison for two days, according to  Democratic senators . The DOJ says it's mulling whether to release transcripts of their meeting. July 29:  Trump says he and Epstein  had a falling out  over Epstein hiring girls from his Mar-a-Lago resort, resulting in Epstein being kicked out. A prominent Epstein accuser, the late Virginia Giuffre,  had said  she was a teenager working at Mar-a-Lago when she first met Maxwell and Epstein. Aug. 1 : The Bureau of Prisons says it has moved Maxwell from a low-security prison in Tallahassee, Fla., to a women's minimum-security prison camp in Bryan, Texas. Aug. 5:  The House Oversight Committee  subpoenas the Department of Justice  for records related to Epstein and Maxwell. It seeks \"all documents and communications relating or referring to\" the pair and their respective court cases, setting a deadline of Aug. 19. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Aug. 11:  Federal judge Paul Engelmayer in New York  denies Bondi's request  to unseal grand jury materials from the Maxwell case, saying most of the records are already public. In a rebuke to the DOJ, the judge adds that an observer \"might conclude that the Government's motion for their unsealing was aimed not at 'transparency' but at diversion — aimed not at full disclosure but at the illusion of such.\" Aug. 18:  House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky.,  says the DOJ will send the first batch  of Epstein documents to the panel on Aug. 22, three days after the committee's original deadline. \"It will take the Department time to produce all the records and ensure the identification of victims and any child sexual abuse material are redacted,\" Comer says. Aug. 20:  Federal judge Richard M. Berman denies Bondi's request to unseal records related to the Epstein case in New York, citing longstanding precedents of keeping grand jury proceedings secret and stating that the government did not prove \"special circumstances\" that might justify unsealing the records. Aug. 22:  The House Oversight Committee  receives the first batch  of thousands of Epstein-related files from the Justice Department's investigation, some of which it says will eventually become public. Sept. 8:  House Democrats release a copy of Epstein's 50th birthday book with notes from friends and associates, including the tawdry note — framed by a hand-drawn outline of a woman's body —  that appears to bear Trump's signature , despite his denial in July. The White House again dismisses that claim, calling it \"FAKE NEWS to perpetuate the Democrat Epstein Hoax!\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Sept. 23:  A  statue of Epstein and Trump skipping  hand-in-hand, above a satirical plaque honoring their friendship, appears on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson tells NPR that \"it's not news that Epstein knew Donald Trump, because Donald Trump kicked Epstein out of his club for being a creep.\" U.S. Park Police abruptly removed the statue for what the Department of Interior later said was permit noncompliance. The protest group behind the bronze installation has since displayed it two more times,  on the Mall in October  and  in front of a D.C. restaurant  in November. Oct. 6:  On the same day that the Supreme Court declines to hear Ghislaine Maxwell's appeal of her 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking, Trump leaves the door open to potentially granting her a pardon — which he  previously told reporters  he was \"allowed\" to do. \"I haven't heard the name in so long. I can say that, that I'd have to take a look at it,\"  Trump said . \"I will speak to the DOJ.\" Nov. 12:  White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt rules out a Trump pardon of Maxwell,  telling reporters , \"It's not something he's talking about or even thinking about at this moment in time.\" That same day, the federal government reopens after a record 43-day shutdown. The House returns to session to swear in Democratic  Rep. Adelita Grijalva  of Arizona, seven weeks after she won a special election to succeed her late father. Grijalva had promised to support forcing a vote on the Epstein files' release, and became the decisive final signature that same day. Democrats on the House Oversight Committee release  three new emails  from Epstein's estate that specifically mention Trump. In one from 2011, Epstein referred to Trump as \"the dog that hasn't barked\" and says he spent \"hours at my house\" with one of the alleged sex trafficking victims. The White House downplays the emails, with Leavitt saying they were \"selectively leaked\" and \"prove absolutely nothing other than the fact that President Trump did nothing wrong.\" Later that day, Republicans release another 20,000 documents, which include emails from Epstein expressing displeasure with Trump and his presidency. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Nov. 14:  At Trump's public urging,  Bondi confirms  that the Justice Department will investigate Epstein's alleged \"involvement and relationship\" with banks and several prominent Democrats, including Clinton. That same day, Trump  withdraws his support  of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., a longtime ally of the president who publicly broke with him over the Epstein issue. She was one of three Republican women to sign the petition to force a vote on the files' release. Another, Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado, had  met with White House officials  earlier in the week,  apparently about Epstein , but was not persuaded to change course. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Nov. 16:  In a late-night  Truth Social post , Trump says House Republicans should vote to release the files. He stresses that the Justice Department has already turned over tens of thousands of pages of records and opened an investigation into Epstein's links to Democrats, and urges Republicans to get \"back on point.\" \"Nobody cared about Jeffrey Epstein when he was alive and, if the Democrats had anything, they would have released it before our Landslide Election Victory,\" he adds. Nov. 17:  Trump tells reporters that Congress \"can do whatever they want\" on the matter, and that he will sign the bill if it reaches his desk.  \"I'm all for it,\" Trump said from the Oval Office, but maintained it was a \"hoax\" that he didn't want to \"detract\" from his party's success. Nov. 18:  The House  passes the measure  by a 427-to-1 margin, with the lone opposition vote coming from Republican Rep. Clay Higgins of Louisiana, a staunch Trump ally. Hours later, the Senate passes the same measure by unanimous consent.  Nov. 19:  Congress sends the measure to Trump's desk for his signature. In an evening  Truth Social post , Trump takes credit for urging lawmakers to act, and says he has signed it. \n         \n         Correction \n         Nov. 18th, 2025 \n         A previous version of this story incorrectly said U.S. Rep.

special agent was fired last month for displaying at his workspace an LGBTQ+ flag, which had previously flown outside a field office, according to a lawsuit filed in federal court. David Maltinsky had worked at the FBI for 16 years and was nearly finished with special agent training in Quantico, Virginia, when he was called into a meeting last month with FBI officials, given a letter from Director Kash Patel and told he was being “summarily dismissed” over the inappropriate display of political signage, Maltinsky’s lawsuit said. The suit, filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Washington, said Maltinsky had been a decorated intelligence specialist working in the Los Angeles field office and most recently was pursuing a longtime dream of becoming a special agent. In June 2021, the Los Angeles field office displayed a “Progress Pride” flag, which consists of a rainbow-colored horizontal stripes and a chevron with black, brown, pink, light blue, and white colors. It’s meant to represent people of color, as well as the LGBTQ+ community. Maltinsky was given that flag after it had come down and was then displayed at his Los Angeles field office workstation with the support and permission of his supervisors, according to the lawsuit. In April, he began training at the FBI Academy to become a special agent and had successfully completed 16 of the 19 weeks of training at the time of his firing, the lawsuit stated.

Maltinsky’s attorney Christopher M. Mattei called the firing an unlawful attack. “This case is about far more than one man’s career — it’s about whether the government can punish Americans simply for saying who they are,” Mattei said in a statement. Other lawsuits challenging the bureau’s personnel moves have been filed since President Donald Trump’s second term began. In September, three high-ranking FBI officials said in a lawsuit they were fired in a “campaign of retribution” carried out by a director who knew better but caved to political pressure from the Trump administration."},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5246200","dateOfPublication":"2025-01-08","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-05:00","title":"A looming 'demographic cliff': Fewer college students and ultimately fewer graduates","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores a looming 'demographic cliff' in the United States, driven by a sustained decline in births since the Great Recession, resulting in fewer high school graduates and, consequently, fewer college students.

graduates \n         By Jon Marcus \n        \n           Wednesday, January 8, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n        \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Pickup trucks with trailers and cars with yawning trunks pulled up onto untended lawns in front of buildings from which people lugged books, furniture, mattresses, trophy cases and artwork. Anything else of value had already been sold by a company that specializes in auctioning off the leftover assets of failed businesses. At least one of the buildings was soon to be demolished altogether, its red-brick walls dumped into its 1921 foundation. This was the unceremonious end of Iowa Wesleyan University, a 181-year-old institution that closed in 2023 after financial losses due in part to discounts it gave out as it struggled to attract a shrinking pool of students. When a college closes, \"all the things that are mementos of the best four years of a lot of people's lives are sold to the highest bidders,\" says Doug Moore, founding partner of a firm that has helped handle the logistics of shutting down four colleges in the last few years, including Iowa Wesleyan. The outlook, Moore and other experts say, is that there will likely be many more such scenes in the years ahead. That's because the current class of high school seniors scheduled to graduate this spring will be the last before an expected long decline begins in the number of 18-year-olds — the traditional age of students when they enter college. A \"demographic cliff\" with big implications for the economy This \"demographic cliff\" has been predicted ever since Americans started having fewer babies at the advent of the Great Recession around the end of 2007 — a falling birth rate that  has not recovered since , except for a slight blip after the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Demographers say it will finally arrive nationwide in the fall of this year. That's when recruiting offices will begin to confront the long-anticipated drop-off in the number of applicants from among the next class of high school seniors. But the downturn isn't just a problem for universities and colleges. It's a looming crisis for the economy, with fewer graduates eventually coming through the pipeline to fill jobs that require college educations, even as international rivals increase the proportions of their populations with degrees. \"The impact of this is economic decline,\" Jeff Strohl, director of the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce, says bluntly. As fresh data emerges, the outlook is getting only worse. An analysis by the higher education consulting firm Ruffalo Noel Levitz, using the latest available census figures, now projects  another drop  in the number of 18-year-olds beginning in 2033, after a brief uptick. By 2039, this estimate shows, there will likely be 650,000, or 15%, fewer of them per year than there are now. These findings sync up with another new report, released in December by the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education (WICHE), which says that the number of 18-year-olds nationwide who graduate from high school each year — and are therefore candidates for college —  will erode by 13% , or nearly half a million, by 2041. \"A few hundred thousand per year might not sound like a lot,\" Strohl says. \"But multiply that by a decade, and it has a big impact.\" Fewer students means fewer colleges This comes after colleges and universities already collectively experienced a 15% decline in enrollment between 2010 and 2021, the most recent year for which figures are available, according to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). That includes a drop-off of more than 350,000 during the first year of the pandemic alone, and it means there are already  2.7 million  fewer students than there were at the start of the last decade. In the first half of last year, more than one college a week announced that it would close. Still more new research, from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, projects that the pace of college closings  could now accelerate . The news is not all bad. For students, it means a buyer's market. Colleges and universities, on average, are  admitting a larger proportion of their applicants  than they did 20 years ago, new research by the think tank the American Enterprise Institute finds. And tuition, when adjusted for inflation,  is declining , according to College Board. (Housing and dining charges  continue to increase .) Ripple effects through the economy The likely closing of more colleges is by itself a threat to the economy. Nearly 4 million people work in higher education, the NCES reports. Though the most imperiled colleges tend to be small, every one that closes translates to, on average, a  loss of 265 jobs and $67 million a year in economic impact , according to the economic software and analysis company Implan. While the falloff in the number of 18-year-olds has been largely discussed in terms of its effects on colleges and students, the implications are much broader, however. \"In an economy that depends on skilled labor, we're falling short,\" says Catharine Bond Hill, an economist, a former president of Vassar College and the managing director of the higher education consulting firm Ithaka S+R. She points out that, based on NCES data, the United States has fallen to ninth among developed nations in the  proportion of its 25-to-64-year-old population with any postsecondary degree . \"We should be aiming for No. 1, and we're not,\" she says. The diminishing supply of young people will contribute to \"a massive labor shortage,\" with an  estimated 6 million fewer workers  in 2032 than jobs needing to be filled, according to the labor market analytics firm Lightcast. Not all of those jobs will call for a college education. But many will. Forty-three percent of them will  require at least a bachelor's degree  by 2031, according to the Georgetown center. That means more jobs will demand some kind of postsecondary credentials than Americans are now projected to earn. Still-unpublished research underway at Georgetown forecasts major shortages in teaching, health care and other fields, as well as some level of skills shortfalls in 151 occupations, Strohl says. \"If we don't keep our edge in innovation and college-level education,\" he says, \"we'll have a decline in the economy and ultimately a decline in the living standard.\" A scarcity of labor is already complicating efforts to  expand the U.S. semiconductor industry , for instance, the consulting firm McKinsey & Company warns. It's a major reason that production at a new $40 billion semiconductor processing facility in Arizona has  been delayed , according to its parent company. A worker shortage of the magnitude projected for the coming one hasn't happened since the years immediately after World War II, when the number of young men was reduced by death and disability, Strohl and others say. And this worker shortage coincides with a wave of retirements among experienced and well-educated baby boomers. A host of complex demographic factors \"It's kind of a remarkable moment in our history,\" says Luke Jankovic, an executive vice president and general manager at Lightcast. \"We have a lot of people moving from economic producers to economic consumers, and there just aren't enough people coming up behind them to replace them.\" The falling number of 18-year-olds is compounded by other issues, including a sharp drop in the proportion of Americans in the labor market — particularly baby boomers who retired early and men derailed by substance abuse or incarceration. The proportion of men 20 and older in the workforce has declined from around 76% at the start of the Great Recession to  around 70% today , the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports. The decline in high school graduates through 2041 is projected to be most severe in the Northeast, Midwest and West, where fertility rates have been generally lower than in other regions, and to which fewer families have moved. In all,  38 states will see declines , WICHE estimates, some of them much steeper than the national average: 32% in Illinois, 29% in California, 27% in New York, 20% in Michigan, 17% in Pennsylvania. In places where the number of high school graduates remains stable or increases, meanwhile, it will be largely because of one group: Hispanic students. The proportion of high school graduates who are Hispanic, nationwide, is expected to rise from 26% to 36% by 2041. But Hispanic college-going is below the national average and  has been going down , U.S. Department of Education statistics show. All of these things present \"a combination of factors that we haven't seen before,\" says Emily Wadhwani, a senior director at credit-rating agency Fitch who works on higher education. Concerns about the value of a college education Falling enrollment, meanwhile, has been made worse by a decline in perception of the value of a college or university degree.  One in four Americans  now says having a bachelor's degree is extremely or very important to get a good job, the Pew Research Center finds. Among high school graduates, the proportion going straight to college has fallen, from a  peak of 70% in 2016 to 62% in 2022 , the most recent year for which the figure is available. The only thing that will restore stability in the higher education sector, says Wadhwani, \"is a renewed sentiment that it's worth it.\" Demarée Michelau, the president of WICHE, calls these trends, \"the most perplexing set of issues to face higher education planners and administrators in a generation.\" There are other customers for colleges, of course, including international students, students who are older than 18 and graduate students. But these other sources may not be enough to make up for the coming declines, experts say. Now that Donald Trump is about to start a second presidential term, 58% of European students say they are  less interested in coming to the United States , according to a survey conducted in October and November by the international student recruiter Keystone Education Group. And despite colleges' attempts to recruit students over 25, their numbers have  fallen by half  since the Great Recession, the Philadelphia Fed calculates. Many older students say they are discouraged by the cost or have families and jobs, which colleges don't always accommodate, or they started college but dropped out and  have little inclination to go back . On the campus of Iowa Wesleyan, the old gym was stripped of its wood flooring and whatever else had value and was then ripped down. The cornerstone fell into the pile of rubble. It bore the date of the college's founding: 1842. \"In so many of these towns, their identity is inextricably linked to the college that's been there forever,\" says Doug Moore, the man who oversaw the liquidation. \"It's a huge source of local pride. It's also a big source of good-paying jobs that are not replaceable.\" The process of shutting it down, he adds, \"is brutal and painful.\" And yet he knows that in the coming years, more colleges and universities will likely go under the auctioneer's gavel and the wrecking ball: \"You have a staggering number of variables\" facing colleges and universities. \"It's supply and demand. You've got to evolve and adjust, or die.\" This story was produced by  The Hechinger Report , a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/immigration-border-patrol-surveillance-drivers-ice-trump-9f5d05469ce8c629d6fecf32d32098cd","dateOfPublication":"2023-10-25","timeOfPublication":"20:30:00Z","title":"Policy Reforms in Asylum Procedures and Refugee Resettlement: A New Chapter in Immigration Rights","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article highlights a recent policy shift in immigration, focusing on reforms to asylum procedures and the introduction of a new legislative proposal aimed at improving refugee resettlement rights.

The predictive intelligence program has resulted in people being stopped, searched and in some cases arrested. A network of cameras scans and records vehicle license plate information, and an algorithm flags vehicles deemed suspicious based on where they came from, where they were going and which route they took. Federal agents in turn may then flag local law enforcement. Suddenly, drivers find themselves pulled over — often for reasons cited such as speeding, failure to signal, the wrong window tint or even a dangling air freshener blocking the view. They are then aggressively questioned and searched, with no inkling that the roads they drove put them on law enforcement’s radar. Once limited to policing the nation’s boundaries, the Border Patrol has built a surveillance system stretching into the country’s interior that can monitor ordinary Americans’ daily actions and connections for anomalies instead of simply targeting wanted suspects. Started about a decade ago to fight illegal border-related activities and the trafficking of both drugs and people, it has expanded over the past five years.

Instead, it was a deportation trap Multicultural New Orleans awaits arrival of ‘Swamp Sweep’ immigration crackdown Judge tosses DOJ lawsuit challenging a New York law barring immigration agents from state courts The Border Patrol has recently grown even more powerful through collaborations with other agencies, drawing information from license plate readers nationwide run by the Drug Enforcement Administration , private companies and, increasingly, local law enforcement programs funded through federal grants. Texas law enforcement agencies have asked Border Patrol to use facial recognition to identify drivers, documents show. Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel. Follow on This active role beyond the borders is part of the quiet transformation of its parent agency, U.S. Customs and Border Protection , into something more akin to a domestic intelligence operation. Under the Trump administration’s heightened immigration enforcement efforts, CBP is now poised to get more than $2.7 billion to build out border surveillance systems such as the license plate reader program by layering in artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies. The result is a mass surveillance network with a particularly American focus: cars. This investigation, the first to reveal details of how the program works on America’s roads, is based on interviews with eight former government officials with direct knowledge of the program who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak to the media, as well as dozens of federal, state and local officials, attorneys and privacy experts. The AP also reviewed thousands of pages of court and government documents, state grant and law enforcement data, and arrest reports. The Border Patrol has for years hidden details of its license plate reader program, trying to keep any mention of the program out of court documents and police reports, former officials say, even going so far as to propose dropping charges rather than risk revealing any details about the placement and use of their covert license plate readers. Readers are often disguised along highways in traffic safety equipment like drums and barrels. The Border Patrol has defined its own criteria for which drivers’ behavior should be deemed suspicious or tied to drug or human trafficking, stopping people for anything from driving on backcountry roads, being in a rental car or making short trips to the border region. The agency’s network of cameras now extends along the southern border in Texas, Arizona and California, and also monitors drivers traveling near the U.S.-Canada border. And it reaches far into the interior, impacting residents of big metropolitan areas and people driving to and from large cities such as Chicago and Detroit, as well as from Los Angeles, San Antonio, and Houston to and from the Mexican border region. In one example, AP found the agency has placed at least four cameras in the greater Phoenix area over the years, one of which was more than 120 miles (193 kilometers) from the Mexican frontier, beyond the agency’s usual jurisdiction of 100 miles (161 kilometers) from a land or sea border. The AP also identified several camera locations in metropolitan Detroit, as well as one placed near the Michigan-Indiana border to capture traffic headed towards Chicago or Gary, Indiana, or other nearby destinations.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More Border Patrol’s parent agency, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said they use license plate readers to help identify threats and disrupt criminal networks and are “governed by a stringent, multi-layered policy framework, as well as federal law and constitutional protections, to ensure the technology is applied responsibly and for clearly defined security purposes.” “For national security reasons, we do not detail the specific operational applications,” the agency said. While the U.S. Border Patrol primarily operates within 100 miles of the border, it is legally allowed “to operate anywhere in the United States,” the agency added. While collecting license plates from cars on public roads has generally been upheld by courts, some legal scholars see the growth of large digital surveillance networks such as Border Patrol’s as raising constitutional questions. Courts have started to recognize that “large-scale surveillance technology that’s capturing everyone and everywhere at every time” might be unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment, which protects people from unreasonable searches, said Andrew Ferguson, a law professor at George Washington University. Today, predictive surveillance is embedded into America’s roadways. Mass surveillance techniques are also used in a range of other countries, from authoritarian governments such as China to, increasingly, democracies in the U.K. and Europe in the name of national security and public safety. “They are collecting mass amounts of information about who people are, where they go, what they do, and who they know … engaging in dragnet surveillance of Americans on the streets, on the highways, in their cities, in their communities,” Nicole Ozer, the executive director of the Center for Constitutional Democracy at UC Law San Francisco, said in response to the AP’s findings. “These surveillance systems do not make communities safer.” ‘We did everything right and had nothing to hide’ A license plate reader stands along the side of a road, Wednesday, Oct. 15, 2025, in Stockdale, Texas.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More In February, Lorenzo Gutierrez Lugo, a driver for a small trucking company that specializes in transporting furniture, clothing and other belongings to families in Mexico, was driving south to the border city of Brownsville, Texas, carrying packages from immigrant communities in South Carolina’s low country. Gutierrez Lugo was pulled over by a local police officer in Kingsville, a small Texas city near Corpus Christi that lies about 100 miles (160 kilometers) from the Mexican border. The officer, Richard Beltran, cited the truck’s speed of 50 mph (80 kph) in a 45 mph (72 kph) zone as the reason for the stop. But speeding was a pretext: Border Patrol had requested the stop and said the black Dodge pickup with a white trailer could contain contraband, according to police and court records. U.S. Route 77 passes through Kingsville, a route that state and federal authorities scrutinize for trafficking of drugs, money and people. Gutierrez Lugo, who through a lawyer declined to comment, was interrogated about the route he drove, based on license plate reader data, per the police report and court records. He consented to a search of his car by Beltran and Border Patrol agents, who eventually arrived to assist. Image recognition analysis overlaid on drivers and vehicles on Texas roads. (AP video Marshall Ritzel) They unearthed no contraband. But Beltran arrested Gutierrez Lugo on suspicion of money laundering and engaging in organized criminal activity because he was carrying thousands of dollars in cash — money his supervisor said came directly from customers in local Latino communities, who are accustomed to paying in cash. No criminal charges were ultimately brought against Gutierrez Lugo and an effort by prosecutors to seize the cash, vehicle and trailer as contraband was eventually dropped. Luis Barrios owns the trucking company, Paquetería El Guero, that employed the driver. He told AP he hires people with work authorization in the United States and was taken aback by the treatment of his employee and his trailer. “We did everything right and had nothing to hide, and that was ultimately what they found,” said Barrios, who estimates he spent $20,000 in legal fees to clear his driver’s name and get the trailer out of impound. Border Patrol agents and local police have many names for these kinds of stops: “whisper,” “intel” or “wall” stops. Those stops are meant to conceal — or wall off — that the true reason for the stop is a tip from federal agents sitting miles away, watching data feeds showing who’s traveling on America’s roads and predicting who is “suspicious,” according to documents and people interviewed by the AP. In 2022, a man from Houston had his car searched from top to bottom by Texas sheriff’s deputies outside San Antonio after they got a similar tipoff from Border Patrol agents about the driver, Alek Schott.

They knew he stayed overnight in a hotel about 80 miles (129 kilometers) from the U.S.-Mexico border. They knew that in the morning Schott met a female colleague there before they drove together to a business meeting. At Border Patrol’s request, Schott was pulled over by Bexar County sheriff’s deputies. The deputies held Schott by the side of the road for more than an hour, searched his car and found nothing. “The beautiful thing about the Texas Traffic Code is there’s thousands of things you can stop a vehicle for,” said Joel Babb, the sheriff’s deputy who stopped Schott’s car, in a deposition in a lawsuit Schott filed alleging violations of his constitutional rights.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More According to testimony and documents released as part of Schott’s lawsuit, Babb was on a group chat with federal agents called Northwest Highway. Babb deleted the WhatsApp chat off his phone but Schott’s lawyers were able to recover some of the text messages. Through a public records act request, the AP also obtained more than 70 pages of the Northwest Highway group chats from June and July of this year from a Texas county that had at least one sheriff’s deputy active in the chat. The AP was able to associate numerous phone numbers in both sets of documents with Border Patrol agents and Texas law enforcement officials. The chat logs show Border Patrol agents and Texas sheriffs deputies trading tips about vehicles’ travel patterns — based on suspicions about little more than someone taking a quick trip to the border region and back. The chats show how thoroughly Texas highways are surveilled by this federal-local partnership and how much detailed information is informally shared. In one exchange a law enforcement official included a photo of someone’s driver’s license and told the group the person, who they identified using an abbreviation for someone in the country illegally, was headed westbound. “Need BP?,” responded a group member whose number was labeled “bp Intel.” “Yes sir,” the official answered, and a Border Patrol agent was en route. Border Patrol agents and local law enforcement shared information about U.S. citizens’ social media profiles and home addresses with each other after stopping them on the road. Chats show Border Patrol was also able to determine whether vehicles were rentals and whether drivers worked for rideshare services.

He added: “I just know that they have a lot of toys over there on the federal side.” After finding nothing in Schott’s car, Babb said “nine times out of 10, this is what happens,” a phrase Schott’s lawyers claimed in court filings shows the sheriff’s department finds nothing suspicious in most of its searches. Babb did not respond to multiple requests for comment from AP. The Bexar County sheriff’s office declined to comment due to pending litigation and referred all questions about the Schott case to the county’s district attorney. The district attorney did not respond to a request for comment. The case is pending in federal court in Texas. Schott said in an interview with the AP: “I didn’t know it was illegal to drive in Texas.” ‘Patterns of life’ and license plates A license plate reader used by U.S. Border Patrol is hidden in a sand crash barrel along the state Highway 80, Thursday, Oct. 23, 2025, in Douglas, Ariz.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More Today, the deserts, forests and mountains of the nation’s land borders are dotted with checkpoints and increasingly, surveillance towers, Predator drones, thermal cameras and license plate readers, both covert and overt. Border Patrol’s parent agency got authorization to run a domestic license plate reader program in 2017, according to a Department of Homeland Security policy document. At the time, the agency said that it might use hidden license plate readers ”for a set period of time while CBP is conducting an investigation of an area of interest or smuggling route. Once the investigation is complete, or the illicit activity has stopped in that area, the covert cameras are removed,” the document states. But that’s not how the program has operated in practice, according to interviews, police reports and court documents. License plate readers have become a major — and in some places permanent — fixture of the border region. In a budget request to Congress in fiscal year 2024, CBP said that its Conveyance Monitoring and Predictive Recognition System, or CMPRS, “collects license plate images and matches the processed images against established hot lists to assist … in identifying travel patterns indicative of illegal border related activities.” Several new developer jobs have been posted seeking applicants to help modernize its license plate surveillance system in recent months. Numerous Border Patrol sectors now have special intelligence units that can analyze license plate reader data, and tie commercial license plate readers to its national network, according to documents and interviews.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More Border Patrol worked with other law enforcement agencies in Southern California about a decade ago to develop pattern recognition, said a former CBP official who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. Over time, the agency learned to develop what it calls “patterns of life” of vehicle movements by sifting through the license plate data and determining “abnormal” routes, evaluating if drivers were purposely avoiding official checkpoints. Some cameras can take photos of a vehicle’s plates as well as its driver’s face, the official said. Another former Border Patrol official compared it to a more technologically sophisticated version of what agents used to do in the field — develop hunches based on experience about which vehicles or routes smugglers might use, find a legal basis for the stop like speeding and pull drivers over for questioning. The cameras take pictures of vehicle license plates. Then, the photos are “read” by the system, which automatically detects and distills the images into numbers and letters, tied to a geographic location, former CBP officials said. The AP could not determine how precisely the system’s algorithm defines a quick turnaround or an odd route. Over time, the agency has amassed databases replete with images of license plates, and the system’s algorithm can flag an unusual “pattern of life” for human inspection.

In documents obtained by the AP, a Border Patrol official boasted about being able to see that a vehicle that had traveled to “Dallas, Little Rock, Arkansas and Atlanta” before ending up south of San Antonio. Documents show that Border Patrol or CBP has in the past had access to data from at least three private sector vendors: Rekor, Vigilant Solutions and Flock Safety. Through Flock alone, Border Patrol for a time had access to at least 1,600 license plate readers across 22 states, and some counties have reported looking up license plates on behalf of CBP even in states like California and Illinois that ban sharing data with federal immigration authorities, according to an AP analysis of police disclosures. A Flock spokesperson told AP the company “for now” had paused its pilot programs with CBP and a separate DHS agency, Homeland Security Investigations, and declined to discuss the type or volume of data shared with either federal agency, other than to say agencies could search for vehicles wanted in conjunction with a crime. No agencies currently list Border Patrol as receiving Flock data. Vigilant and Rekor did not respond to requests for comment. Also from AP’s investigation into the use of surveillance technology: U.S. tech firms to a large degree designed and built China’s surveillance state , playing a far greater role in enabling rights abuses than known before. Across five Republican and Democratic administrations, the U.S. government has repeatedly allowed and even actively helped American firms to sell technology to Chinese police . Where Border Patrol places its cameras is a closely guarded secret. However, through public records requests, the AP obtained dozens of permits the agency filed with Arizona and Michigan for permission to place cameras on state-owned land. The permits show the agency frequently disguises its cameras by concealing them in traffic equipment like the yellow and orange barrels that dot American roadways, or by labeling them as jobsite equipment. An AP photographer in October visited the locations identified in more than two dozen permit applications in Arizona, finding that most of the Border Patrol’s hidden equipment remains in place today. Spokespeople for the Arizona and Michigan departments of transportation said they approve permits based on whether they follow state and federal rules and are not privy to details on how license plate readers are used. Texas, California, and other border states did not provide documents in response to the AP’s public records requests. CBP’s attorneys and personnel instructed local cities and counties in both Arizona and Texas to withhold records from the AP that might have revealed details about the program’s operations, even though they were requested under state open records laws, according to emails and legal briefs filed with state governments. For example, CBP claimed records requested by the AP in Texas “would permit private citizens to anticipate weaknesses in a police department, avoid detection, jeopardize officer safety, and generally undermine police efforts.” Michigan redacted the exact locations of Border Patrol equipment, but the AP was able to determine general locations from the name of the county. One page of the group chats obtained by the AP shows that a participant enabled WhatsApp’s disappearing messages feature to ensure communications were deleted automatically.

CBP has quietly amassed access to far more information from ports of entry, airports and intelligence centers than other local, state and federal law enforcement agencies. And like a domestic spy agency, CBP has mostly hidden its role in the dissemination of intelligence on purely domestic travel through its use of whisper stops. Border Patrol has also extended the reach of its license plate surveillance program by paying for local law enforcement to run plate readers on their behalf.

Stonegarden grant funds also pay for local law enforcement overtime, which deputizes local officers to work on Border Patrol enforcement priorities. Under President Donald Trump, the Republican-led Congress this year allocated $450 million for Stonegarden to be handed out over the next four fiscal years. In the previous four fiscal years, the program gave out $342 million. In Cochise County, Arizona, Sheriff Mark Dannels said Stonegarden grants, which have been used to buy plate readers and pay for overtime, have let his deputies merge their mission with Border Patrol’s to prioritize border security. “If we’re sharing our authorities, we can put some consequences behind, or deterrence behind, ‘Don’t come here,’” he said. In 2021, the Ward County, Texas, sheriff sought grant funding from DHS to buy a “covert, mobile, License Plate Reader” to pipe data to Border Patrol’s Big Bend Sector Intelligence Unit. The sheriff’s department did not respond to a request for comment. Other documents AP obtained show that Border Patrol connects locally owned and operated license plate readers bought through Stonegarden grants to its computer systems, vastly increasing the federal agency’s surveillance network.

One former Border Patrol agent who worked on the license plate reader pattern detection program in California said the program had an 85% success rate of discovering contraband once he learned to identify patterns that looked suspicious. But another former official in a different Border Patrol sector said he was unaware of successful interdictions based solely on license plate patterns. In Trump’s second term, Border Patrol has extended its reach and power as border crossings have slowed to historic lows and freed up agents for operations in the heartland. Border Patrol Sector Chief Gregory Bovino , for example, was tapped to direct hundreds of agents from multiple DHS agencies in the administration’s immigration sweeps across Los Angeles, more than 150 miles (241 kilometers) from his office in El Centro, California. Bovino later was elevated to lead the aggressive immigration crackdown in Chicago. Numerous Border Patrol officials have also been tapped to replace ICE leadership.

Several police reports and court records the AP examined cite “suspicious” travel patterns or vague tipoffs from the Border Patrol or other unnamed law enforcement agencies. In another federal court document filed in California, a Border Patrol agent acknowledged “conducting targeted analysis on vehicles exhibiting suspicious travel patterns” as the reason he singled out a Nissan Altima traveling near San Diego. In cases reviewed by the AP, local law enforcement sometimes tried to conceal the role the Border Patrol plays in passing along intelligence. Babb, the deputy who stopped Schott, testified he typically uses the phrase “subsequent to prior knowledge” when describing whisper stops in his police reports to acknowledge that the tip came from another law enforcement agency without revealing too much in written documents he writes memorializing motorist encounters. Once they pull over a vehicle deemed suspicious, officers often aggressively question drivers about their travels, their belongings, their jobs, how they know the passengers in the car, and much more, police records and bodyworn camera footage obtained by the AP show. One Texas officer demanded details from a man about where he met his current sexual partner. Often drivers, such as the one working for the South Carolina moving company, were arrested on suspicion of money laundering merely for carrying a few thousand dollars worth of cash, with no apparent connection to illegal activity. Prosecutors filed lawsuits to try to seize money or vehicles on the suspicion they were linked to trafficking.

responsibilities to other federal agencies, an early look at how President Donald Trump could fulfill his campaign pledge to close the department entirely. Offices that serve the nation’s schools and colleges would go to departments ranging from Labor to Interior. Education officials say the moves won’t affect the money Congress gives states, schools and colleges. They didn’t say whether current department staff would keep their jobs. Since he took office, Trump has called for the dismantling of the Education Department, saying it has been overrun by liberal thinking. Agency leaders have been making plans to parcel out its operations to other departments, and in July the Supreme Court upheld mass layoffs that halved the department’s staff. In recent days, Education Secretary Linda McMahon has started a public campaign for the end of her department, making the case on social media that Education’s grantmaking and question-answering functions could be better handled by states and other federal agencies.

The department sends billions of dollars to schools and colleges and helps decipher complex federal laws. It will be a test for the administration: Can the department be shut down smoothly, or will rural and low-income kids and students with disabilities — the populations that most rely on federal education support — be impacted? Here’s what the Education Department currently handles, where its responsibilities will go to other federal agencies and what will stay the same. Money for schools and colleges While American schools are funded primarily by state and local money, the Education Department serves as a conduit for billions of dollars of federal aid going to state and local education agencies. Education officials say that money will continue to be awarded as allocated by Congress, but much of it will flow from another federal agency. Most notably, the Department of Labor will oversee some of the largest federal funding streams for schools and colleges, including Title I money for schools serving low-income communities. Adult education programs already were moved to Labor in June. Another deal will put Health and Human Services in charge of a grant program for parents who are attending college. The State Department will take on money to fund foreign language programs. Interior will oversee programs supporting Native American education. Federal student loans One of the department’s major roles is management of the $1.6 trillion federal student loan portfolio. Student aid so far will be largely unaffected, although McMahon and Trump have suggested it could be better handled by a different federal department. Pell Grants and federal loans will continue to be disbursed, and student loan borrowers must continue making payments on their debts. The website for the Free Application for Student Aid, or FAFSA , remains open — a key piece of how colleges and universities provide aid packages to incoming students. The Education Department will continue to handle support for people navigating the complicated form. The Education Department also will continue to oversee another major part of higher education: accreditation, which allows colleges to accept students’ federal financial aid. Students with disabilities For now, the department will continue to distribute money to schools to provide educational support for students with disabilities, though McMahon has suggested this function could move to the Department of Health and Human Services. The Education Department also oversees investigations into schools and universities alleged to have violated disability rights law, along with other civil rights violations such as discrimination involving sex, race and shared ancestry. Those responsibilities will remain with the department for now, although McMahon has suggested sending them to the Department of Justice. In any case, since the mass layoffs in March, the Office for Civil Rights has operated under a significantly reduced footprint. The department’s civil rights branch lost about half of its staff. The cuts raised questions about whether the office would be able to shrink a backlog of complaints from students who allege they have experienced discrimination on the basis of race, sex or disability status. The department’s own data has shown a decline in resolving civil rights cases, while new complaints from families have increased. ___ The Associated Press’ education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

diplomatic spat with China as the Central American country tries to navigate the turbulent waters between the Asian superpower and the United States. On Wednesday, Panama’s Foreign Relations Ministry and the U.S. ambassador to the country criticized China’s diplomats in Panama for asking the lawmakers to cancel their trip to Taiwan, with the ministry accusing the Chinese Embassy of “meddling” in internal Panamanian affairs. This followed comments from Panama President José Raúl Mulino a week earlier saying that the planned Taiwan trip did not have the approval of his administration and reminding the lawmakers that the executive branch was responsible for Panama’s foreign policy. China claims Taiwan, a self-governing island off its coast, as its territory and has staged threatening military drills in the surrounding waters in recent years. China has also been embroiled in a spat with Japan after new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said on Nov. 7 that a Chinese naval blockade or other action against Taiwan could be grounds for a Japanese military response. Her comments drew a warning from China against any interference in Taiwan. Related Stories Labubu and ‘KPop Demon Hunters’ to dazzle at Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade.

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel. Follow on Panama established relations with China in 2017 after breaking them off with Taiwan. The Trump administration has brought the weight of the U.S. government to bear on the issue this year, starting with accusations that China could influence the operations of the strategically important Panama Canal because a Hong Kong-based conglomerate held the long-term concession to operate ports at either end of the canal. The canal’s administration and the Panamanian government have denied that China had any sway over canal operations. On Wednesday, Panama’s Foreign Relations Ministry said in a statement that “as a sovereign country, it does not accept restrictions, nor pressure that tries to influence the legitimate decisions of its subordinates.” The statement did not name China, but came a day after one of the country’s largest newspapers, La Prensa, reported that 10 lawmakers were asked by the Chinese Embassy to immediately cancel the trip because it “seriously violates the principle of one China” and constitutes “an intervention in Chinese internal affairs.” The Chinese Embassy referred a request from The Associated Press to the reporting from La Prensa. Mulino has lamented that Panama has been drawn into the U.S.-China tensions. When Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited Panama on his first trip as the U.S. top diplomat in February, he made China’s influence a top issue. Mulino said then that Panama would not be renewing its agreement with China’s Belt and Road Initiative when it expires. The initiative promotes and funds infrastructure and development projects that critics say leave poor member countries heavily indebted to China. In August, U.S. Ambassador to Panama Kevin Marino Cabrera gave public backing to Panamanian lawmakers who joined the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, a group of hundreds of lawmakers from dozens of countries concerned about how democracies approach Beijing. In September, the Trump administration said it was restricting visas “for Central American nationals who, while in Central American countries and intentionally acting on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), knowingly direct, authorize, fund, provide significant support to, or carry out activities that undermine the rule of law in Central America.” Some of the lawmakers who planned to make the Taiwan trip later this week defended their decision. Some said the trip would expose them to models and experiences that could help Panama’s modernization, others cited opportunities for investment and cooperation. On Wednesday, Cabrera addressed the controversy, saying that China’s Embassy “shouldn’t be involved in those issues.”"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/brandon-lake-christian-grammys-cmas-charlie-kirk-85651b4d0f140415fc99d47f3b2e2ace","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"15:30:24+00:00","title":"Brandon Lake at the Center of a Christian Music Crossover Movement","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Brandon Lake, a Christian musician known for blending pop, rock, country, and hip-hop into genre-defying music, has achieved significant mainstream success with his 2025 album 'King of Hearts,' which peaked at No. 7 on the Billboard 200.

south of Sin City, Brandon Lake is seated backstage at a packed arena in Henderson, Nevada. In a matter of hours, he will perform an energetic, “family-friendly” show, as he tells The Associated Press, for thousands of people. He’s on the road with his latest album, 2025’s “King of Hearts,” a Christian music release that spans genre — pop, rock, country, hip-hop — a mixture not always associated with worship music. Its eclecticism is one of the many reasons why his music is connecting. The album peaked at No. 7 on the all-genre Billboard 200 chart, an undeniable feat for a contemporary Christian music (CCM) release, and earned Lake his first Top 40 hit: “Hard Fought Hallelujah” with country singer Jelly Roll . “It’s the marriage of awesome production with an awesome message. A message of hope,” says Lake. “There is strength that can be found, and hope that can be found, in the midst of the hell that you are walking through. And then you pair that with like an awesome sound and it’s like, who’s not going to love that?” More coverage Utah campus where Charlie Kirk was shot provided less security than other venues as he toured nation A timeline of Charlie Kirk’s assassination and the arrest of a suspect Charlie Kirk’s AI resurrection ushers in a new era of digital grief Lake’s award-winning moment Earlier this month, Lake was nominated for three Grammys at the 2026 award show in February; he already has five trophies to his name and a total 15 career-nods. “Being recognized, that is to me, that’s recognizing the millions of people’s lives that have been impacted by this music and the message,” he says of the nominations. “It’s definitely a pinch-me moment.” This year, he was nominated for his first Country Music Association Award as well: for musical event of the year, for “Hard Fought Hallelujah.” It’s not a Christian category — he found himself competing against secular artists. (Lake did not win: The category was announced ahead of the CMAs on Wednesday.) “I think it is a crossover moment and I pray that it is. I’m trying to cross over, into any and every space that God will allow that is authentic to who I am,” Lake says. “I grew up on country music; I grew up on Christian music. ... And if you listen to my music, it is very diverse, you know? Quote-unquote Christian music, worship music ... it doesn’t really make sense having a genre, because it’s what we do with our lives. It’s not a sound.” It’s a contemporary approach that reflects modern listening habits, too. Holly Zabka, president of Provident, a Sony subsidiary dedicated to Christian music, uses her daughter as an example to explain the trend. “She doesn’t define her musical taste by genre. I think that’s what we’re seeing. She’ll go from a Luke Combs song to a Brandon Lake song to Harry Styles, that’s how she listens. She’s a fan of everything. And I think that’s where Christian music is finding its footing as well. It can exist alongside every other genre.” A Christian crossover movement Lake is at the forefront of a new musical movement in the U.S., where Christian artists are growing in popularity. According to a midyear report from Luminate, the industry data and analytics company, streams of new music — recordings released in the last 18 months — are slightly down from the same time last year, except in the case of Christian/gospel music. Jaime Marconette, Luminate’s vice president of music insights and industry relations, attributed the genre’s growth to “younger, streaming-forward fanbase,” which is 60% female and 30% millennial. Artists like Lake, Forrest Frank and Elevation Worship are leading the charge. “I pray it’s just the beginning, and I pray that it takes over,” Lake says. “And not the genre of Christian music, but songs — whatever genre they are — that carry the message of the gospel.” He’s also got a few theories on the music’s growing popularity. “The reason why people are turning their ear towards those kinds of songs right now is because that’s what they were made for,” he explained. “Music doesn’t just have to be entertainment. They can have a spiritual experience. They can be educated on who they were made to be. They can receive hope and life and faith. ... I love all kinds of music, but if you have a song that carries that kind of message, it’s just super charged, you know? It does something deeper.” That is especially crucial, Lake says, in a divided world. “I think people are waking up — especially the state of our world and all the craziness that’s going on — everyone’s like, ‘We need to choose love.’ Well, the greatest demonstration of love is the gospel.” The Charlie Kirk connection In September, Lake performed at a memorial service for the late conservative personality Charlie Kirk, who was shot and killed at a Utah college event. His death was one of an escalating number of attacks on political figures, from the assassination of Democratic state lawmaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark Hortman, in Minnesota to last summer’s shooting of Donald Trump, that have roiled the nation. “I didn’t know him at all. And so, the invitation really came out of nowhere,” Lake said of his decision to perform at the ceremony. Lake said his team told him that the Kirk family “listened to my music and, you know, it was a soundtrack of their faith,” and when Lake’s wife urged him to perform, there was no hesitancy. “We quickly said we are not going there to make a political statement.

Trump could have chosen to release many of the files on his own months ago. “Democrats have used the ‘Epstein’ issue, which affects them far more than the Republican Party, in order to try and distract from our AMAZING Victories,” Trump said in a social media post as he announced he had signed the bill. Now, the bill requires the Justice Department to release all files and communications related to Epstein, as well as any information about the investigation into his death in a federal prison in 2019, within 30 days. It allows for redactions about Epstein’s victims for ongoing federal investigations, but DOJ cannot withhold information due to “embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity.” It was a remarkable turn of events for what was once a farfetched effort to force the disclosure of case files from an odd congressional coalition of Democrats, one GOP antagonist of the president, and a handful of erstwhile Trump loyalists. As recently as last week, the Trump administration even summoned one Republican proponent of releasing the files, Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado, to the Situation Room to discuss the matter, although she did not change her mind.

He insisted the Epstein matter had become a distraction to the GOP agenda and indicated he wanted to move on. “I just don’t want Republicans to take their eyes off all of the Victories that we’ve had,” Trump said in a social media post Tuesday afternoon, explaining the rationale for his abrupt about-face. The House passed the legislation on a 427-1 vote, with Rep. Clay Higgins, R-La., being the sole dissenter . He argued that the bill’s language could lead to the release of information on innocent people mentioned in the federal investigation. The Senate later approved it unanimously, skipping a formal vote. It’s long been established that Trump had been friends with Epstein, the disgraced financier who was close to the world’s elite. But the president has consistently said he did not know of Epstein’s crimes and had cut ties with him long ago. Before Trump returned to the White House for a second term, some of his closest political allies helped fuel conspiracy theories about the government’s handling of the Epstein case, asserting a cover-up of potentially incriminating information in those files."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/medicaid-community-health-centers-new-hampshire-2b2b3e676980b419c9d8d3539b953339","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"12:06:49+00:00","title":"Ammonoosuc Clinic Closure in Franconia Sparks Widespread Concerns Over Rural Healthcare Sustainability","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The closure of the Ammonoosuc Community Health Services clinic in Franconia, New Hampshire, marks a significant blow to rural healthcare access, driven by Medicaid funding cuts and the failure to extend Affordable Care Act tax credits.

N.H. (AP) — For more than two decades, Susan Bushby, a 70-year-old housekeeper from a rural ski town in New Hampshire’s White Mountains, took comfort in knowing she only had a short drive to reach the community health center. The lodge-like medical building, which sits on a hill overlooking town, was like a second home for Bushby and many other patients. The front desk staff knew their names and never missed a chance to celebrate a birthday or anniversary. Staff photos of the wilderness that makes the place such a draw hung on the walls, and bumping into a neighbor in the waiting room was routine. But last month, the Ammonoosuc Community Health Services location in Franconia, a town of around 1,000 people, closed for good .

It’s a relationship that you can talk to people and you tell them something and you go, yeah, well, I’ve had cancer. Oh, let’s see. Oh, yeah. There it is in your chart. Do you know what I mean?” Demise of rural health care More than 100 hospitals closed over the past decade, according to the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform, a policy and advocacy group, and more than 700 more hospitals are at risk of closure. A branch of the HealthFirst Family Care Center, a facility in Canaan, New Hampshire, also announced it was closing at the end of October due in part to “changes in Medicaid reimbursement and federal funding” for these facilities. “Because of these Medicaid cuts, we’re going to see rural hospitals, in particular, hit hard,” New Hampshire Sen. Maggie Hassan, a Democrat, told The Associated Press. “And obviously, the failure to extend the ACA tax credits right now is going to compound the problem. … These providers are going to see more and more uninsured patients. And that means they’re going to have to make really difficult decisions.” The sustainability of the centers is critical because they serve as the nation’s primary care safety net, treating patients regardless of insurance coverage or ability to pay.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More Though federally-funded community health centers like the one in Franconia have expanded their reach in recent years, treating 1 in 10 Americans and 1 in 5 rural Americans, they’ve often done so in the face of major financial constraints, according to data from the National Association of Community Health Centers. On average, the centers are losing money — relying heavily on cash reserves, making service changes and sometimes closing locations to stay afloat, NACHC found. Nearly half have less than 90 days’ cash on hand, according to the association. The future is even more bleak, with at least 2 million community health center patients expected to lose Medicaid coverage by 2034 and 2 million more who are newly uninsured turning to the centers for care. “There’s nothing left to trim without cutting into care itself,” said Peter Shin, the chief science officer at the association. Tough choices for Ammonoosuc When President Donald Trump’s bill passed this summer, Ed Shanshala, the CEO of Ammonoosuc, knew he was in trouble. A meticulous planner and strategist, Shanshala projected that his network of five New Hampshire health centers — which relies on more than $2 million in federal funding out of a $12 million budget — would face a $500,000 shortfall partly due to Medicaid funding cuts. He also expected work requirements in the bill and spikes in health insurance premiums to have an impact. Shanshala knew he needed to make cuts to save his centers and zeroed in on Franconia because the building was leased, whereas Ammonoosuc owns the other facilities. “We’re really left with no choice,” Shanshala said, adding the closure would save $250,000. Finding additional cuts is hard, given that the centers provide services to anyone under 200% of the federal poverty line, he said. If he cuts additional services, Shanshala fears some patients will end up in a hospital emergency room or “stop engaging in health care period.” “To have to pull out of a community is devastating on a relational level,” he said. “People still have access to health care. We’ll help them with transportation, but it’s clearly a grieving process. Whenever a business leaves a community, regardless if it’s health care or something else, there’s an emotional fabric tear.” Sense of loss The closure has brought little controversy. Just a lot of grief. Most of the patients come from the small towns of Franconia, Easton, Lincoln and Sugar Hill, communities whose economies rely on hikers, skiers and leaf peepers. Many are older, sicker and more spread out than the rest of the state. Luce, who volunteers at the local Head Start program and delivers food to schools in Franconia, said the closure has her mostly frustrated with politicians, adding that she wished lawmakers in Washington could “just live the way regular people live” for a few months. “They would have a much different idea of what goes on in the real world,” she added. More closures coming? Patients like Jill Brewer, the chair of the Franconia Board of Selectmen whose family has been going there for decades, worry about the future and whether the closure signals the gradual collapse of the health care system in this part of the state. “Is this kind of the first domino to fall?” said Brewer, noting how disbanding the town’s volunteer ambulance service in 2023 angered many residents. “It definitely leaves you feeling pretty anxious that this is going to continue to kind of snowball and become an even bigger issue,” she added.

has underscored the need for greater cooperation to tackle the climate crisis.\n\nLula and United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres met with key figures at the  climate summit  in Belem, Brazil, on Wednesday, seeking a deal that would bridge contentious issues.\n\n“We need to show society that we want this without imposing anything on anyone, without setting deadlines for each country to decide what it can do within its own time, within its own possibilities,”  Lula  told reporters, saying countries must find a shared “roadmap” on climate action.\n\nBut the Brazilian leader, who has positioned himself as a chief advocate of both climate action and greater collaboration between non-Western countries, has struggled to bridge divides on issues such as fossil fuel use and climate finance.\n\nScientists have warned that a failure to quickly transition away from the use of fossil fuels could bring disastrous changes to the planet’s ecosystem and result in dangerous increases in extreme weather across the globe with poor countries  more vulnerable  to severe impacts.\n\n“A road map is not a workshop or a ministerial meeting.

Theater owners, including Daniel Loria of The Boxoffice Company and Max Friend of Filmbot, are deeply concerned that a consolidation could lead to fewer theatrical films and less support for indie and experimental cinema. While Warner Bros. has recently released critically acclaimed films such as 'Sinners,' 'Weapons,' and 'One Battle After Another,' there is uncertainty about whether future owners will maintain creative risk-taking. The article also notes that Warner Bros. Discovery is a financial supporter of NPR, and the sale could significantly reshape Hollywood’s cinematic landscape.","keyTakeAways":["Warner Bros.

Discovery is up for sale has Hollywood buzzing.   The legendary film studio, which has grown to include streaming services and cable channels, is currently accepting non-binding bids until Thursday. According to company spokesperson Robert Gibbs, they expect to have a decision about the sale by Christmas. It's become something of a Hollywood parlor game to guess who will ultimately take over   the business, which was  founded in 1923 by four brothers : Harry, Albert, Sam and Jack Warner. They owned a movie theater in Pennsylvania before coming to Hollywood to make movies. Warner Brothers Pictures found one of its first silent picture stars in a German shepherd named Rin Tin Tin. By 1927, the studio made history with its feature-length \"talkie\" picture:  The Jazz Singer,  starring Al Jolson. Over the years, Warner Brothers has made or distributed countless iconic films including:  Casablanca, The Big Sleep  and  The Maltese Falcon  in the 1940's .  The list goes on, with titles like  A Clockwork Orange ,  Goodfellas, Barbie,  as well as Bugs Bunny and all the Looney Tunes cartoons. Warners Brothers has had multiple owners over the decades. Three years ago, Warner Media, as it was called, merged with Discovery. And in June, the company announced it would split in two, with film, TV and streaming studios in one camp, and in the other, mostly legacy cable channels, including CNN. The planned split has not yet happened, and a new buyer might get the entirety of Warner Bros. Discovery and its film and TV libraries.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       As the film industry continues to consolidate, there's speculation that Warner Brothers' old rival Paramount could take over. Having just merged as Paramount Skydance, CEO David Ellison has already made several overtures. The idea of streaming giant Netflix buying the company has raised  antitrust concerns on Capitol Hill . In an earnings call last month, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos told investors, \"We've been very clear in the past that we have no interest in owning legacy media networks. There is no change there.\" Industry watchers suggest other suitors could be Comcast, Amazon, or an investor who's not already in the entertainment business. Regardless of whoever does end up buying the company, theater owners say they hope making movies for cinemas will be a priority. \"As long as we have more movies,\" says Daniel Loria, senior vice president at  The Boxoffice Company , which analyzes data from studios and theaters. \"That doesn't mean the same amount, doesn't mean less, but more movies. I think you're going to find folks in the movie theater industry support any business decision that gets us there.\" Loria recalls that after Disney purchased Fox and Fox Searchlight, their combined studios significantly reduced the number of films they released in the theaters. Crunching the numbers, Loria says in 2016, a year before the merger announcement, Disney and Fox released a total of 38 theatrical films. This year, the consolidated studios released 18. That's a problem for theater owners who've been struggling to bring audiences back to cinemas after the COVID-19 pandemic shut them down; they're competing with movie-watching on TVs, computers and phones. Some theater owners and cinephiles also fear studio conglomerates will only greenlight a few big-budget blockbusters, leaving the lower budget indies behind. \"The concern is you're going to see less of that risk taking, less of that experimentation and less of that embracing new directors, new filmmakers in the future,\" says Max Friend, the CEO of  Filmbot , the ticketing platform for independent cinemas in the U.S. \"It's really important that there are studios that are funding and supporting, cultivating that kind of work.\" He points out that this year, Warner Brothers made a string of critical hits, including Ryan Coogler's  Sinners , the horror film  Weapons  and Paul Thomas Anderson's  One Battle After Another . Friend wonders if the next owner will take similar risks with future original, creative films. Warner Bros.

The legendary film studio, which has grown into streaming services and cable channels, is accepting bids until this Thursday, according to reports. It's become something of a parlor game, though, to guess who will ultimately buy the house that Jack Warner built, and theater owners are watching closely. Here's NPR's Mandalit del Barco. (SOUNDBITE OF CARY GRANT'S \"OPENING/END TITLE FROM 'ARSENIC AND OLD LACE'\") MANDALIT DEL BARCO, BYLINE: Warner Brothers has been in business since 1923, founded by four brothers, Harry, Albert Sam, and Jack Warner. They owned a movie theater in Pennsylvania before coming to Hollywood to make movies. Warner Brothers Pictures found one of its first silent picture stars in a German shepherd named Rin Tin Tin. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"THE JAZZ SINGER\") AL JOLSON: (As Jakie Rabinowitz) Wait a minute. You ain't heard nothing yet. DEL BARCO: And in 1927, the studio made history with its feature-length talkie picture, \"The Jazz Singer,\" starring Al Jolson. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"THE JAZZ SINGER\") JOLSON: (As Jakie Rabinowitz, singing) Toot, toot, tootsie. Goodbye. DEL BARCO: Over the years, Warner Brothers has made so many iconic films, including \"Casablanca.\" (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"CASABLANCA\") HUMPHREY BOGART: (As Rick Blaine) Here's looking at you, kid. DEL BARCO: From \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" to \"Barbie,\" to all those \"Looney Tunes\" cartoons. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"LOONEY TUNES\") UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As Bugs Bunny) Eh, what's up, Doc? DEL BARCO: Over the decades, Warner Brothers had several owners. Three years ago, Warner Media, as it was called, merged with Discovery, and last June, the company announced it would split into two, with film, TV and streaming studios on one side and on the other side, mostly legacy cable channels, including CNN. The split hasn't happened, and a new buyer might get the entirety of Warner Brothers Discovery. As the film industry continues to consolidate, there's speculation that Warner Brothers old rival, Paramount, could take over.

Industry watchers suggest other suitors could be Comcast, Amazon or an investor who's not already in the entertainment business.

DANIEL LORIA: As long as we have more movies - that doesn't mean the same amount, that doesn't mean less, but more movies - I think you're going to find folks in the movie theater industry support any business decision that gets us there. DEL BARCO: That's Daniel Loria, senior vice president at the Boxoffice Company, which analyzes data from studios and theaters. He says when Disney purchased Fox and Fox Searchlight, their combined studios significantly reduced the number of films they released in the theaters. That's a problem for theater owners who have been struggling to bring audiences back to cinemas after the COVID-19 pandemic shut them down. They're competing with movie watching on TVs, computers and cellphones, and some fear studios will only greenlight a few big-budget blockbusters. Max Friend is the CEO of Filmbot, the ticketing platform for independent cinemas in the U.S. MAX FRIEND: The concern is that we're going to see less of that risk-taking, less of that experimentation and less of that embracing new directors, new filmmakers in the future.

However, multiple sources, including the White House and PolitiFact, indicate that Trump spent the day in Mar-a-Lago, Florida, attending military events and hosting a family dinner, with no verified evidence of a meeting with Epstein.

While the email references individuals like David Fizel, Hanson, and Glenn, their identities and relevance remain unclear.

first became president in 2016.\n\nRepresentative Sean Casten, a Democrat from Illinois, highlighted one email exchange and said in a November 12 post on X: “Trump spent his first Thanksgiving after

PolitiFact, however, did not find any  proof  that he met Epstein that day.\n\nThere are different accounts of when Trump and Epstein had their falling out, with  periods  ranging from 2004 to 2007. The Miami Herald reported that Trump barred Epstein from Mar-a-Lago in October 2007, a decade before the Thanksgiving Day in question.\n\nIn 2008, Epstein pleaded guilty to state charges of soliciting prostitution and soliciting prostitution from a minor.\n\nTwo of the three people Epstein mentioned in his 2017 email as being “down there” are people who had property in South Florida at the time. It is unclear who he was referring to when he mentioned “Hanson”. It is possible Epstein was not foretelling a specific Thanksgiving Day plan but answering another New Yorker’s question about who among the people in their social circle would also be in the Florida area during that period.\n\nTrump arrived in West Palm Beach, Florida, on November 21, 2017, and stayed there for several days, according to the president’s public schedules documented in Roll Call’s FactBase.\n\nOn Thanksgiving morning, he spoke to members of the military via video conference and visited coastguard members at the Lake Worth Inlet Station in Riviera Beach, Florida. The White House published transcripts of Trump’s remarks to both groups. Trump also issued a Thanksgiving message to the country and went to the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach.\n\nPhotographers for The Associated Press news agency, The Palm Beach Post and Getty Images, among others, captured photos of Trump’s activities.\n\nA CNN report said Trump held an “opulent” dinner at the Mar-a-Lago members-only club. PolitiFact did not find reports listing who was in attendance, but the White House told CNN the first family would be having “a nice Thanksgiving dinner with all the family”.\n\nTrump was also active on social media. In a November 22, 2017, post on X, then known as Twitter, he said he “will be having meetings and working the phones from the Winter White House in Florida [Mar-a-Lago]”. He did not specify whom he would be meeting. On Thanksgiving morning, he said in part: “HAPPY THANKSGIVING, your Country is starting to do really well.”\n\nHAPPY THANKSGIVING, your Country is starting to do really well.

triggering northern lights: What we know\n\nScientists have issued alerts for approaching solar or geomagnetic storms, which are set to hit Earth this week and will produce bright, stunning displays of light known as auroras over parts of the United States, Canada and Europe, while also temporarily disrupting some communications.\n\nOn Tuesday, forecasters at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said significant geomagnetic disturbances had been recorded in the past few days, specifically in the form of several “coronal mass ejections” (CMEs), which occur when the sun issues bursts of energy. The agency issued a “G4” geomagnetic storm watch signal on a five-level scale, implying that severe storms could be expected.\n\nSome US residents have already shared videos online of northern lights – also known as aurora borealis – which will continue to appear over several US states on Wednesday.\n\nDid you catch the light show between the breaks in the clouds this evening?  #NorthernLights\n\nSpace Weather Center:  https://t.co/M5cIvJxUr1   pic.twitter.com/RiDXgF3BqI\n\n— NWS Reno (@NWSReno)  November 12, 2025\n\nHere’s what we know about the geomagnetic storms and why they occur.\n\nSolar storms occur as a result of sudden, eruptive disturbances on the sun.  A solar storm becomes a geomagnetic storm when it reaches the Earth.\n\nSolar storms can occur in two ways. One way is in the form of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which are sudden swellings of gases on the sun that burst from the sun and travel at more than 1 million mph (1.6 million km/h) towards Earth. Depending on how fast they travel, these can reach the Earth anytime between 15 hours and several days.\n\nSolar storms can also emerge in the form of solar flares, which are sudden eruptions of electromagnetic radiation reaching the Earth from the sun. These travel at the speed of light, reaching Earth in approximately eight minutes, and can last for several minutes or even hours.\n\nBoth phenomena happen when magnetic fields on the sun realign. They often, but not always, occur together.\n\nWhile CMEs can appear through solar telescopes as immense clouds of particles being hurled in a single direction, solar flares appear as bright flashes of light moving in multiple directions. As NASA describes it, think of it as the difference between a cannonball shot in one direction and the flash of a muzzle.\n\nThe NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center said on Tuesday that at least three CMEs would pass over Earth, most likely between Tuesday and Thursday.\n\nIn an update early on Wednesday, the agency noted that two of the CMEs, which first erupted on November 9 and 10, had already impacted Earth. They “packed quite a punch”, Shawn Dahl, a scientist with the agency, said in a video update posted on X.\n\nDahl said the storms were “profoundly more strong than we anticipated” and that while the agency had initially forecasted a G2-level storm, the storms were two levels stronger, at G4.\n\nA third, energetic CME, moving faster than the others, is now set to hit Earth on Wednesday, approximately at midday Eastern Time (17:00 GMT), the space agency said. That one erupted early on November 11 and caused temporary radio blackouts across Africa and Europe, according to Space.com, a leading space exploration publication.\n\nWhen strong bursts of energy erupting from the Sun’s surface as solar flares or CMEs hurtle towards Earth, the highly charged particles they carry collide with gases in the Earth’s upper atmosphere and transfer energy to them, causing the gases to glow and resulting in stunning displays of colourful lights, from emerald greens to intense pinks.\n\nKnown as aurora borealis, those displays can be seen from the Northern Hemisphere, hence the term “northern lights”. “Southern lights” or aurora australis are displays which can be seen in the Southern Hemisphere, although far fewer people inhabit the areas from which they are visible. The lights are only visible close to the poles because the Earth’s magnetic fields, which are strongest at the poles, guide the sun’s charged particles towards them.\n\nLight displays have become more common in recent months because the sun is currently at the maximum phase of an 11-year activity cycle.\n\nEvery 11 years, the sun’s poles swap places, causing intense magnetic activity. This period, called solar maximum, can last for several months. Scientists speculate that the end of the current cycle began last year and will continue at least through to the end of this year.\n\nIn May 2024, the strongest geomagnetic storm in two decades hit Earth and caused dazzling light displays across the US, the United Kingdom and Germany.\n\nThe northern lights shot with my iPhone (just this second) in Boulder, Colorado. This is a very impressive event!  pic.twitter.com/vkHS00PMLt\n\n— Dr. Ryan French (@RyanJFrench)  November 12, 2025\n\nSeveral countries have issued aurora alerts, with some residents already reporting brilliant colours in the sky on Tuesday night.\n\nBrightness and visibility usually depend on what time of day the solar bursts arrive in the Earth’s atmosphere and how they interact with it. Experts recommend leaving brightly-lit areas to see the lights better.\n\nAccording to NOAA, the lights have already appeared or are likely to appear above several areas in the US, including the states of Illinois (Chicago), Colorado, Massachusetts (Boston), Washington (Seattle), California (San Francisco, Los Angeles), Oregon (Portland), Texas (Dallas), Georgia (Atlanta), North Dakota (Bismarck), New York, Wyoming (Cheyenne), North Carolina (Raleigh) and Iowa.\n\nJust keeps going and these are just holding phone in long exposure mode of 3 seconds. Amazing display of Northern Lights captured in Carlow.  pic.twitter.com/ws2JQWUcs3\n\n— Carlow Weather (@CarlowWeather)  November 12, 2025\n\nOther sightings are expected or have been reported in\n\nNot directly to humans, because Earth’s atmosphere protects us from radiation.\n\nHowever, the bursts of energy could temporarily disrupt communication systems, potentially affecting GPS navigation, radio communications, and satellites, including air traffic control radio and satellites in space. The intense activity could also temporarily disrupt power grids.\n\nOn rare occasions, solar eruptions can be damaging. A severe solar storm in September 1859 caused sparks and fires in telegraph stations across Europe and North America. Known as the Carrington Event, those storms were the most intense in recorded history.\n\nIn August 1972, powerful geomagnetic events caused widespread electric and communications disruptions in the US and accidentally detonated US naval mines positioned in Vietnam.\n\nAccording to Dahl of the NOAA, the agency has alerted US air traffic officials, and a planned space launch, the details of which have not been disclosed, is likely to be cancelled. Power grid officials have also been alerted, he said."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/asia-nvidia-earnings-us-stocks-71372f3476dd13c33d316819bf902b17","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"04:41:59+00:00","title":"Wall Street Rallies After Nvidia Earnings and Mixed Job Market Data","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Wall Street experienced a significant rally on Thursday, November 20, 2025, driven by Nvidia’s blockbuster profit report and mixed U.S. job market data.

The market had been shaky for weeks coming into Thursday, largely because of twin worries: Stocks caught up in the frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology may have simply shot too high, and the Fed may be done delivering the cuts to interest rates that Wall Street loves. But Nvidia helped quiet worries about a potential bubble for AI stocks after it reported another big profit for the summer that topped analysts’ expectations, while also giving a forecast for coming revenue that easily cleared analysts’ estimates. By delivering big profits and indicating more are coming, Nvidia and other stocks can justify their stocks’ price gains and make them look less expensive.

Because it’s the biggest company in the U.S. market by value, Nvidia’s stocks has more effect on the S&P 500 than any other company’s. And given the forecasts that Nvidia gave late Wednesday, “it is very hard to see how this stock does not keep moving higher from here,” according to analysts at UBS led by Timothy Arcuri. They also said “the AI infrastructure tide is still rising so fast that all boats will be lifted.” Nvidia’s chips are powering the move into AI, which is feeding into growth for a range of other companies, and AI-linked businesses were toward the front of the market. Palantir Technologies rose 3.3%, and Broadcom gained 4.8%, for example. For the second worry that’s been dogging Wall Street, Thursday’s jobs report from the U.S. government also offered some relief. Financial markets seemed to pick the data apart for encouraging signals, according to Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. It showed that hiring by U.S. employers was stronger in September than economists expected, which may suggest the economy remains solid. But it also said the unemployment rate worsened slightly, which could give the Fed reason to cut its main interest rate at its next meeting in December. Traders still see a December rate cut as relatively unlikely, giving it a roughly 44% probability, but that’s better than the 30% chance they saw a day earlier, according to data from CME Group. What the Fed does is critical for the stock market because prices ran to records in part because of expectations for continued cuts to rates. Lower rates can give a boost to the economy and to prices for investments, but they can also worsen inflation, which has stubbornly remained above the Fed’s 2% target. Elsewhere on Wall Street, Walmart rallied 5.5% after the retailer delivered another standout quarter . It reported strong sales and profits that blew past Wall Street expectations as it continues to lure cash-strapped Americans who have grown increasingly anxious about the economy and prices. With other retailers dialing back projections, the nation’s largest retailer raised its financial outlook Thursday after its strong third quarter, setting itself up for a strong holiday shopping season. In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury eased to 4.11% from 4.13% late Wednesday. In stock markets abroad, indexes rallied across much of Europe and Asia. Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped 2.6%, and South Korea’s Kospi rose 1.9% for two of the bigger gains. ___ AP Writers Teresa Cerojano and Matt Ott contributed."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/15/thousands-march-for-climate-action-outside-cop30-summit-in-brazil","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"16:17:00+00:00","title":"Thousands march for climate action outside COP30 summit in Brazil","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Thousands of people, including Indigenous activists and youth leaders, marched in Belem, Brazil, during the COP30 climate summit to demand greater recognition of Indigenous voices and protection of the Amazon rainforest from deforestation and fossil fuel expansion.

for climate action outside COP30 summit in Brazil\n\nThousands of people have marched through the streets of the Brazilian city of Belem, calling for the  voices of Indigenous peoples  and environmental defenders to be heard at the United Nations COP30 climate summit.\n\nIndigenous community members mixed with activists at Saturday’s march, which unfolded in a festive atmosphere as participants carried a giant beach ball representing the Earth and a Brazilian flag emblazoned with the words “Protected Amazon”.\n\nIt was the first major protest outside the conference, which began earlier this week in Belem, bringing together world leaders, activists and experts in a push to tackle the worsening climate crisis.\n\nIndigenous activists previously  stormed the summit , disrupting the proceedings as they demanded that Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva take concrete action to ensure their territories are protected from growing threats.\n\nAmnesty International warned in a recent report that  billions of people  around the world are threatened by the expansion of fossil fuel projects, such as oil-and-gas pipelines and coal mines.\n\nIndigenous communities , in particular, sit on the front lines of much of this development, the rights group said.\n\nBranded the “Great People’s March” by organisers, Saturday’s rally in Belem came at the halfway point of contentious COP30 negotiations.\n\n“Today we are witnessing a massacre as our forest is being destroyed,” Benedito Huni Kuin, a 50-year-old member of the Huni Kuin Indigenous group from western Brazil, told the AFP news agency.\n\n“We want to make our voices heard from  the Amazon  and demand results,” he said. “We need more Indigenous representatives at COP to defend our rights.”\n\nYouth leader Ana Heloisa Alves, 27, said it was the biggest climate march she has participated in. “This is incredible,” she told The Associated Press. “You can’t ignore all these people.”\n\nThe COP30 talks come as  the UN warned  earlier this month that the world was on track to exceed the 1.5C (2.7F) mark of global warming – an internationally agreed-upon target set under the Paris Agreement – “very likely” within the next decade.\n\nIf countries do as they have promised in their climate action plans, the planet will warm 2.3 to 2.5C (4.1 to 4.5F) by 2100, a report by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) found.\n\n“While national climate plans have delivered some progress, it is nowhere near fast enough, which is why we still need unprecedented emissions cuts in an increasingly tight window, with an increasingly challenging geopolitical backdrop,” said UNEP chief Inger Andersen.\n\nDespite that urgency, a nalysts and some COP30 participants have said they don’t expect any major new agreements to emerge from the talks, which conclude on November 21.\n\nStill, some are hoping for progress on some past promises, including  funding to help  poorer countries adapt to climate change."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/20/eu-says-any-peace-plan-must-consult-ukraine-europe-doubts-russian-intent","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"10:05:39+00:00","title":"EU

intent\n\nEuropean leaders are adamant that any plan to end Russia’s war in Ukraine will need support from both the European Union and Ukraine amid speculation of a potential  United States-backed plan  that would heavily favour Moscow’s demands and narrative.\n\nArriving for a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels on Thursday, EU foreign policy head Kaja Kallas told reporters that Europeans have always supported “long-lasting and just peace, and we welcome any efforts to achieve that”.\n\n“Of course, for any plan to work, it needs Ukrainians and Europeans on board,” she added.\n\nOther top diplomats from Germany, Spain and Poland echoed Kallas, with Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski saying that Europe – whose security is “at stake” – expects to be consulted on any potential deal.\n\n“I hope it’s not the victim that has restrictions on its ability to defend itself put on, but it’s the aggressor,” he said.\n\nRussia, however, appeared to push off the idea of negotiations, saying again on Thursday that a deal with Ukraine would have to eliminate the root causes of the conflict and that there are no negotiations ongoing with Washington on such a plan.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined to comment on whether Russian President Vladimir Putin had been briefed on the details of the reported Ukraine peace plan, Reuters news agency reported.\n\nEuropean nations have been increasingly concerned that the war may spill into their borders, and there have been numerous accusations and instances of the Kremlin undertaking actions of shadow war, testing the EU and the United Kingdom’s mettle with aggressive cyberattacks and drone intrusions.\n\nThe UK on Wednesday  warned it is ready to use “military options”  if necessary after a Russian spy ship that has spent weeks on the edge of British waters directed lasers at British pilots sent to monitor the vessel.\n\nWord of the US proposal came as a deadly wave of Russian attacks  killed at least 26  people in Ukraine’s city of Ternopil on Wednesday, including three children.\n\nAnother 22 people were still missing as of Thursday morning, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wrote on X, with more than 230 first responders deployed in search and rescue efforts.\n\n“Once again, the Russians have killed innocent, peaceful people who were simply sleeping in their homes,” the president said.\n\nUkrainian Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko separately welcomed Secretary of the US Army Daniel Driscoll to Ukraine on Thursday, writing on X that the visit was “an important opportunity for the senior military officials accompanying the secretary to assess the situation on the ground and to witness firsthand the consequences of Russian aggression”.\n\nNews reports released on Wednesday, quoting unnamed officials, meanwhile, said the US proposal was created in consultation with Russian officials and closely hews to Russia’s vision for ending the war.\n\nThe Financial Times reported the 28-point plan was delivered by US envoy Steve Witkoff in a meeting with Rustem Umerov, secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defence Council, in Miami, Florida, in the US earlier this week.\n\nIt would require Ukraine to give up the rest of the eastern region of Donbas – long  eyed by Russia  for its industrial history and strategic location, and where fierce fighting rages – including territory under Kyiv’s control. The proposal would also demand cuts to Ukraine’s military, several outlets reported.\n\nUkraine’s Zelenskyy – who  sparred with  US President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance in a dramatic meeting in February – has been clear since Russia’s 2022 invasion that potential peace talks ought not sideline Ukraine, a viewpoint shared by much of the EU’s leadership.\n\n“We, as a sovereign country, simply will not be able to accept any agreements without us,” Zelenskyy  said ahead of that contentious meeting.\n\nHe has since repeatedly made clear several red lines that neither the Ukrainian government nor its constitution would permit, including ceding its territory.\n\nStill, some European leaders have offered less enthusiasm. Hungary’s Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said the EU should stop sending money to Ukraine in seeming reference to an  ongoing corruption probe  involving an alleged $100m energy kickback scheme.\n\nLast week, Ukraine’s Justice Minister German Galushchenko and Energy Minister Svitlana Hrynchuk submitted their resignations as anticorruption authorities said they had detained five people suspected of an alleged plot to control procurement at nuclear agency Energoatom.\n\n“There’s a war mafia, a corrupt system working in Ukraine, and then the European Commission president … instead of stopping the payments and demanding for immediate financial clearance, she wants to send another 100 billion to Ukraine. That is insane,” Szijjarto said.\n\nHungary’s right-wing populist leader Victor Orban, who counts Russian Putin as an ally, has been  blocking Ukraine’s EU bid,  received an  exemption  on Russian energy sanctions from Trump and a “ financial shield ” to safeguard its economy in recent weeks.\n\n“The time is not on the side of Ukraine. It is an illusion to say that the time is on the side of Ukraine,” Szijjarto said, adding that he would support Trump’s peace initiatives."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/20/nigerias-tinubu-delays-g20-trip-amid-search-for-24-abducted-schoolgirls","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"10:22:28+00:00","title":"Nigeria’s Tinubu delays G20 trip amid search for 24 abducted schoolgirls","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Nigeria’s President Bola Tinubu has postponed his G20 summit trip to South Africa following the abduction of 24 schoolgirls from a secondary school in Maga, Kebbi State, and a separate church attack in Eruku that killed two people.

conflict between bears and humans is playing out across Japan, where authorities have deployed the military to protect locals who are using drone-based alert and surveillance systems to track the bears.\n\nSince April this year, at least 13 people have been  killed  and more than 100 have been injured in bear attacks in the country, according to an October report by the Ministry of Environment. The ministry added that the death toll is the highest since Japan began keeping records of bear attacks in 2006.\n\nJapan is home to big brown bears, which can weigh more than 450kg (1,000 pounds) and live in the country’s Hokkaido region, one of Japan’s northernmost islands known for its hot springs and volcanoes. It is also home to Asiatic black bears – also known as Moon bears – which are smaller in size, weighing between 80-200kg (176-440 pounds), and are found on the mainland, which is more densely populated.\n\nBoth types of bear have been involved in incidents this year, and both are dangerous to humans to varying degrees. Asiatic bear attacks are more frequent, but brown bear attacks are more dangerous.\n\nShota Mochizuki, associate professor at Fukushima University, told Al Jazeera: “This is largely because black bears are widely distributed across Honshu and Shikoku, where many people live, while brown bears inhabit only Hokkaido, resulting in fewer opportunities for encounters with humans.”\n\n“However, attacks by brown bears are far more severe. Brown bears are significantly larger and stronger, and their attacks much more often lead to serious injuries or fatalities,” he added.\n\nBut why is there an increase in bear attacks this year and how is Japan responding?\n\nHere’s what we know:\n\nAccording to Japan’s public broadcaster, NHK, the country’s northern prefectures – districts under the control of a prefect or governor – have been the worst affected by bear attacks.\n\nEarlier this week, NHK said five people had been killed in Iwate, two in Hokkaido, one each in Nagano and Miyagi, and four in Akita so far this year.\n\nBear sightings in Akita prefecture have risen sixfold this year, and bears have attacked more than 50 people since May. Most of the attacks in Akita have been by Asiatic black bears and have taken place in residential areas.\n\nAccording to NHK, on November 9, a bear assaulted a 78-year-old woman in Gojome Town and then attacked a 50-year-old woman who came to help when she heard the older woman screaming. Both were admitted to a hospital in Akita City and are still alive. An elderly woman in Akita city was killed after encountering a bear while working on a farm in late October.\n\nIn an Instagram post last month, the Kenta Suzuki, the governor of the mountainous region, said that “the situation has already surpassed what the prefecture and municipalities can handle on their own”.\n\n“Exhaustion on the ground is reaching its limit,” he added.\n\nIn an interview last month, Billy Halloran, who is from Auckland, New Zealand, and currently lives in Japan, told CNN about a serious black bear attack he had experienced in the woods of Myoko in northern Japan when he went for a run in early October.\n\nHe said he saw two bears staring at him from bushes nearby and, when he tried to back away, one bear started moving towards him. “It was around my size, it was an adult, it was at least 60 or 70 kilos (about 132 to 154 pounds),” he told CNN.\n\nHe held up his arm in front of his face, but the bear seized it and pushed him to the ground. “Then in one bite, my arm was done,” he said.\n\nThe bear attack has left him with a broken arm and an injured leg, Halloran said. He has required three surgeries, and metal plates have been inserted into his arm.\n\nAttacks have also taken place in central Japan. Last month, a bear entered a supermarket in Numata city and attacked shoppers, according to NHK. While nobody was killed, police officials said some people sustained injuries, although they did not say how serious they were.\n\nThe surge in attacks has prompted some countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, to issue travel advisories to citizens living or travelling to Japan.\n\nIn a “wildlife alert” issued on Wednesday, the US Department of State said: “Bear sightings and attacks have increased in parts of Japan, especially in municipalities close to or adjacent to populated zones.\n\n“In Sapporo, authorities closed Maruyama Park in Sapporo, which is adjacent to the US Consulate General, for two weeks following a bear sighting in the park.\n\n“Although the Consulate is located outside of the park, we encourage all visitors for routine or other services to be diligent and aware of your surroundings.”\n\nIn late October, the UK’s Foreign Office warned British travellers not to venture alone into forest areas and to avoid leaving litter and food waste if they do.\n\nMochizuki said one reason is a food shortage for bears in the mountainous regions of the country. He said bears mainly feed on acorns and beech nuts, which have not been abundant this year.\n\n“In years when natural food is scarce, bears are more likely to venture into human settlements in search of food,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Environment, there was a surge of attacks in 2023 following poor acorn yields. Some experts say climate change is a reason for the low production.\n\nMochizuki noted that bear populations have also expanded in the country “due to long-term conservation and reduced hunting pressure” and said that this factor has increased bears’ “contact zones with humans”. According to the government, the overall bear population is currently more than 54,000.\n\nIn 2012, the Environment Ministry’s biodiversity centre said the number of black bears was about 15,000, while brown bear numbers have doubled since 1990, although it did not give numbers.\n\nMochizuki said that another reason bear attacks are rising is rural depopulation, caused by young people leaving their villages and moving to cities for better job opportunities.\n\n“As rural areas age and decline, unmanaged fields and village edges create easy access routes for bears,” he added.\n\nLast week, Japan’s military and riot police were deployed to the scenic mountainous region of Akita to try to contain the surge in bear attacks.\n\nBut while riot police are authorised to shoot the bears, military personnel are not and must work alongside private hunters.\n\n“The Japan Self-Defense Forces are legally restricted to national defence and disaster relief, and therefore have no legal authority to kill wildlife,” Mochizuki said.\n\n“Hunters, by contrast, hold official hunting licences and firearm permits under Japan’s Wildlife Protection and Management Law. They can be formally authorised by prefectural governments to conduct nuisance control, including the shooting of bears when necessary,” he added.\n\nSo the military has been helping the region’s local community by setting up bear traps or removing carcasses of the bears shot by hunters they are working with.\n\nResidents of affected areas, especially Akita, have been using AI-surveillance systems and drones to alert them to the presence of bears, according to Akita’s mayor.\n\nNHK reported that people have also been advised not to leave food around when they go on picnics in the forest, and also to cut down any nut-bearing trees that may attract bears.\n\nMochizuki said three main measures can prove effective.\n\n“Firstly, food sources around human settlements should be eliminated,” he said. “Proper management of garbage, abandoned fruit trees, and garden produce is the most effective preventive measure.”\n\nHe added that physical barriers such as electric fencing around farms or village perimeters “can significantly reduce bear entry”.\n\n“Thirdly, early detection through camera traps, sensors and GPS data, rapid communication through mobile alerts can help communities respond quickly to bear presence,” he said.\n\nMochizuki acknowledged that while the military and police have been deployed to assist bear hunters, the country faces a shortage of hunters and wildlife personnel due to its ageing population.\n\n“Recruiting younger members and increasing municipal staff capacity is essential,” he said.\n\nLast, Mochizuki highlighted the importance of educating residents and tourists about the bears.\n\n“Many people, including international visitors, are unfamiliar with bear behaviour and safety practices and need better guidance,” he said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/20/gaza-girl-orphaned-in-israeli-strike-rebuilds-her-life-with-severe-burns","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"08:58:03+00:00","title":"Gaza girl orphaned in Israeli strike rebuilds her life with severe burns","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Elham Abu Hajjaj, a nine-year-old girl from Gaza City’s al-Saffaweh neighborhood, survived a devastating Israeli airstrike that killed her parents and left her with severe third-degree burns.

He didn’t answer me.”\n\nThe Israeli attack in Gaza City’s al-Saffaweh area had killed both her parents and left Abu Hajjaj – who is nine years old – with third-degree burns.\n\nShe is not alone in the horrific fallout from  Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza . Nearly 42,000 people – about 2 percent of Gaza’s population – have received “life-changing” injuries, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated in September. As many as a quarter of them are children.\n\nMore than 3,350 people have experienced major burns, making them among the most common injuries the WHO has recorded. Children are “clearly disproportionately affected”, the organisation added. About 70 percent of people receiving burn surgery in Gaza were children, mostly aged under five, and many were burned during bomb blasts.\n\n“When I look in the mirror, I say to myself: ‘Oh God, look at these wounds, they are very bad wounds,'” Abu Hajjaj said, scrolling through photos of heavy scarring on her neck, her arm and her leg. “I have wounds here and here, and on my hand as well.”\n\nStill, she found it difficult to imagine the loss of her parents. Even when her grandfather explained that they were waiting for her in paradise, Abu Hajjaj said, she kept telling herself they must be alive.\n\n“I finally understood they were not when my grandfather took me to live with him,” she said. “Then I realised that my father and mother had died and I started crying.”\n\nMore than 39,000 children in Gaza have  lost one or both  of their parents, the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics said in April, about 17,000 of whom have been parentless since Israel started its war on Gaza in October 2023.\n\nAbu Hajjaj now lives with her grandparents and other relatives who survived, including her brother.\n\nSpeaking from outside the family home – surrounded by rubble from destruction to the neighbourhood – she said she felt “some joy” when she realised her brother was still alive.\n\n“I also found my grandmother, my aunt and my grandfather. They are by my side,” she said. “When we met and I saw my brother, I felt a little happy, but my heart was sad for my father and mother who passed away.”\n\nNow, the little girl has turned to drawing to express her feelings about the loss of her parents and childhood home.\n\n“It helps me forget everything that happened,” she said. “The last drawing I did was of the house that was destroyed.”\n\nShe did not draw her home in its final state, however.\n\n“I rebuilt it in the picture, and I put in a swing and a tree,” Abu Hajjaj said. “I drew the tree because my father had planted a tree.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/20/explosive-weapons-caused-record-child-deaths-last-year-save-the-children","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"09:26:39+00:00","title":"Explosive weapons caused record child deaths last year: Save the Children","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In 2024, nearly 12,000 children globally were killed or injured in conflicts, with 70% of deaths attributed to explosive weapons.

children were killed or injured in conflicts worldwide last year, of which 70 percent were a result of explosives, the United Kingdom-based charity Save the Children has said, with those in Gaza suffering the most from Israeli attacks.\n\nThis was the highest number since records began in 2006 and was up by 42 percent on the 2020 total, the group said in a new report published on Thursday.\n\nExplosive weapons killed or injured children at record levels last year, as wars increasingly move into urban areas, the report, called Children and Blast Injuries, revealed.\n\n“The world is witnessing the deliberate destruction of childhood – and the evidence is undeniable,” said Narmina Strishenets, senior conflict and humanitarian advocacy adviser at Save the Children UK.\n\n“Children are paying the highest price in today’s wars … Missiles are falling where children sleep, play and learn – turning the very places that should be the safest, like their homes and schools, into death traps.”\n\nPreviously, children in war zones were more likely to die from malnutrition, disease or failing health systems.\n\nBut as conflicts take place more frequently in urban areas, children are being caught up as bombs and drones strike hospitals, schools and residential areas, Save the Children said.\n\n“Actions once condemned by the international community and met with global outrage are now brushed aside as the ‘cost of war.’ That moral surrender is one of the most dangerous shifts of our time.”\n\nThe conflicts that claimed the most casualties among children in 2024 were in the Palestinian territories of  Gaza and the occupied West Bank , Sudan, Myanmar, Ukraine and Syria.\n\nThe deadliest conflict in recent years for children is in Gaza, where 20,000 children have been killed in  Israel’s genocidal war  on the coastal enclave since October 7, 2023.\n\nThe United Nations children’s agency UNICEF estimates that more than 64,000 children have been killed or injured in Gaza by Israel. Homes, hospitals and schools have been destroyed, while essential medical services have collapsed.\n\nAccording to Save the Children’s report, Gaza now has the “largest cohort of  child amputees  in modern history”.\n\nDespite a ceasefire taking effect on October 10, Israeli attacks have continued,  killing hundreds of Palestinians  across the enclave. According to Gaza’s Health Ministry, at least 46 children have been killed in Israeli attacks since the ceasefire.\n\n“In 2024, the use of explosive weapons in Gaza left an average of 475 children each month with potentially lifelong disabilities such as amputations, severe burns, complex fractures and hearing loss,” the report said.\n\nIn  war-ravaged Sudan , the UK charity revealed some 10 million children were living within 5km (3.1 miles) of “active conflict zones”.\n\n“Explosive weapons have caused devastating child casualties: over 1,200 children were killed or injured in 2023, rising to 1,739 in 2024 – a near-40 percent rise in just one year,” the report said.\n\nIn  Ukraine , the number of children injured or “maimed” by explosive weapons increased by 70 percent – from 339 children in 2023 to 577 in 2024, it added.\n\nChildren’s smaller bodies and developing organs mean injuries from blasts can be much more severe, and recovery can be more complex and prolonged.\n\n“Children are far more vulnerable to explosive weapons than adults,” Paul Reavley, a consultant paediatric emergency physician and cofounder of the Paediatric Blast Injury Partnership, a coalition between Save the Children UK, Imperial College London and other partners, said in a statement.\n\n“Their anatomy, physiology, behaviour and psychosocial needs make them disproportionately affected.”\n\nMeanwhile, Anthony Bull, director of the Centre for Paediatric Blast Injury Studies at Imperial College London, said treating injuries from bomb blasts was “far from straightforward”.\n\n“It takes specialised knowledge and continued research to ensure children can not only recover but grow after amputation or surgery,” he said.\n\nThe report warned that the impact of explosives will last well beyond periods of active bombardment, whether “through explosive remnants of war that continue to threaten lives or the lasting mental health impacts on affected communities”."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/20/iaea-passes-resolution-demanding-nuclear-access-from-iran-tehran-rejects","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"14:08:10+00:00","title":"IAEA passes resolution demanding nuclear access from Iran; Tehran rejects","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) passed a resolution demanding full access and information from Iran regarding its nuclear program, particularly at sites attacked by Israel in June.

demanding nuclear access from Iran; Tehran rejects\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency adopted a resolution that called on Iran to provide it with access and information regarding its  nuclear programme , as required under UN resolutions.\n\nThe vote on Thursday came a day after the head of the United Nations global nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, renewed his call for Tehran to allow inspections at key nuclear sites attacked by Israel and the United States in June.\n\nIsrael started attacking Iran on June 13, a day after the agency  found Iran noncompliant  with its commitments to international nuclear safeguards, prompting Tehran to accuse the watchdog of paving the way for the 12-day war that killed more than 1,000 people and inflicted damage estimated at billions of dollars across Iran.\n\n“Iran must … provide the Agency without delay with precise information on nuclear material accountancy and safeguarded nuclear facilities in Iran, and grant the Agency all access it requires to verify this information,” the draft resolution text submitted to the board and seen by the Reuters news agency said.\n\nThe resolution passed with 19 votes in favour, three against and 12 abstentions, diplomats said. Russia, China and Niger were the countries that opposed it.\n\n“I’m afraid the resolution will have its own consequences,” Iran’s ambassador to the IAEA, Reza Najafi, told reporters after the vote. Asked what those were, he said, “We will announce the consequences later.”\n\n“We have performed a number of inspections, but we have not been able to go to the attack sites. I hope we will be able. Indeed, we have to go because this is part of Iran’s commitments,” Grossi told reporters on Wednesday, after opening the regular board meeting of the Vienna-based agency.\n\n“I hope we’ll be able to move in a constructive manner.”\n\nIran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi on Wednesday evening rejected any cooperation with the IAEA “regarding the bombed sites”.\n\n“We only cooperate regarding nuclear facilities that have not been affected, in compliance with IAEA regulations,” he stated on Telegram.\n\nThe tensions between Iran and the IAEA have repeatedly flared in recent years. They were further inflamed after the  12-day war  in June. Iran has been infuriated by the IAEA’s refusal to condemn the attacks.\n\nSince the war, agency inspectors have not been granted access to sites such as Fordo and Natanz, which were hit in the strikes, but they have been able to visit other sites.\n\nGrossi reached an agreement with Araghchi in Cairo in early September to resume inspections.\n\nHowever, later that month, the deal faded in significance after the United Kingdom, France and Germany – all signatories to the 2015 nuclear accord –  triggered  the return of UN sanctions, accusing Iran of breaching its commitments, claims which Tehran has rejected.\n\nThe move drew an angry response from Tehran, leading it to halt implementation of the Cairo agreement.\n\nThe snapback mechanism reactivated six UN Security Council resolutions that address Iran’s nuclear and ballistic missile programme, reinstated economic sanctions against Iran and contained other restrictions, such as halting all uranium enrichment.\n\nNevertheless, France’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson on Thursday said his country, the United Kingdom and Germany – the E3 – want to re-open the door of diplomacy with Iran over its nuclear programme.\n\nSpokesperson Pascal Confavreux told reporters that despite the Europeans pushing for the return of UN sanctions, those three powers had always wanted to maintain dialogue with Iran.\n\nMeanwhile on Tuesday, US President Donald Trump claimed Tehran is seeking a diplomatic resolution with Washington, which has sought the dismantlement of its nuclear programme.\n\n“I am totally open to it, and we’re talking to them,” Trump said.\n\n“And we start a process. But it would be a nice thing to have a deal with Iran. And we could have done it before the war, but that didn’t work out. And something will happen there, I think.”\n\nIn 2018, Trump unilaterally withdrew the US from the 2015 nuclear accord, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), effectively torpedoing it, and imposed strict sanctions on Iran."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/7/james-watson-who-co-discovered-dna-double-helix-dies-at-97","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"22:44:26+00:00","title":"James Watson, who co-discovered DNA double helix, dies at 97","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"James Watson, the co-discoverer of the DNA double helix structure with Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins, has died at age 97.

in the study of human genetics, has died at the age of 97.\n\nWatson, a brilliant but controversial figure who later prompted outcry with his promotion of debunked racist ideas, shared the 1962 Nobel Prize in medicine with fellow scientists Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins for discovering the double helix structure of deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA.\n\nIn a statement announcing his death, the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, where Watson previously worked, called the discovery a “pivotal moment in the life sciences”. Watson’s son said that he died in hospice care after struggling with a brief illness.\n\nWatson’s discovery helped pave the way for important developments in the alteration of the genetic makeup of living beings and treating diseases through the insertion of genes into patients, along with the increased use of DNA samples in criminology.\n\n“Francis Crick and I made the discovery of the century, that was pretty clear,” he once said, later writing that he could not have anticipated the “explosive impact of the double helix on science and society”.\n\nThe image of the double helix, taking the form of a long, twisting ladder, became an iconic symbol of science. Upon first visualising how pieces of DNA could form “rungs” on a ladder, Watson is reported to have reacted by saying, “It’s so beautiful.”\n\nBut the famous scientist saw his reputation tarnished by his embrace of long-discredited racist theories.\n\nHe stated in 2007 during an interview that he believed the genetics of Black people made them less inherently intelligent than white people, in remarks that sparked an international outcry and resulted in the loss of his position as chancellor of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.\n\nIn a television interview in 2019, he said that his beliefs on the matter had not changed. The lab released a statement at the time calling his remarks “reprehensible” and “unsupported by science”.\n\nThe long history of pseudo-scientific theories of racial inferiority being used as a pretext for policies of discrimination or even violent subjugation and elimination makes suggestions of genetic differences based on race and ethnicity especially controversial.\n\n“His outbursts, particularly when they reflected on race, were both profoundly misguided and deeply hurtful,” Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said in 2019.\n\n“I only wish that Jim’s views on society and humanity could have matched his brilliant scientific insights.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/20/trumps-new-28-point-plan-what-does-it-want-ukraine-to-concede-to-putin","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"12:55:40+00:00","title":"Trump’s new 28-point plan: What does it want Ukraine to concede to Putin?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 28-point peace plan, allegedly drafted by US and Russian officials and reportedly conveyed to Ukraine via Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff, demands that Ukraine concede control over Crimea and most of the Donbas region, withdraw all military forces from the region, and face strict limits on its military size and long-range weapons.

2025-11-20T12:55:40+00:00\n\nTitle: Trump’s new 28-point plan: What does it want Ukraine to concede to Putin?\n\nThe United States and Russia are believed to have drafted a  new framework  to end the Russia-Ukraine war, according to multiple international news outlets.\n\nUnder the plan, which covers 28 points, Kyiv would be required to concede weapons and territory.\n\nThe news comes one day before Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is due to meet US army officials in Kyiv on Thursday.\n\nHere is what we know so far about the plan, and what concessions Kyiv would have to make.\n\nNo. The US has not yet officially announced it, and Russia has even denied the existence of such a peace plan.\n\nHowever, multiple news outlets have reported its existence, citing unnamed sources. US digital news outlet Axios and the United Kingdom’s Financial Times newspaper were the first to report details of the plan on Wednesday.\n\nReuters later quoted two unnamed sources familiar with the matter, reporting that the US has “signalled” to Zelenskyy that Ukraine must accept the US plan, which involves Ukraine ceding territory and weapons. Other reports have suggested that this would be in exchange for US security guarantees.\n\nThe Financial Times quoted an unnamed official saying the proposal is “heavily tilted towards Russia” and “very comfortable for [Russian President Vladimir] Putin”. It does not say where the official is from. The Financial Times also reported claims that only US and Russian officials had participated in drafting the plan.\n\nThe newspaper added that the US had informed Ukraine of the plan via Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, this week.\n\nCiting an unnamed US official with “direct knowledge”, Axios reported that the plan would give Russia parts of eastern Ukraine that Moscow does not currently control, in exchange for a US security guarantee for Ukraine and Europe against future Russian aggression.\n\nHowever, Keir Giles, a Russian military expert at London think tank Chatham House, said the proposal may not originate from the US at all. He described the way news of the plan had emerged as a “Russian information operation rather than the basis of reality, which Western media has willingly bought into yet again” in an interview with Al Jazeera.\n\nIn a response to a post on X with the link to the Axios story, Witkoff said on Wednesday: “He must have got this from K.” He did not explicitly confirm or deny the existence of the 28-point plan.\n\nThe post, which Witkoff may have “thought was a direct message” to someone else, Giles said, has since been deleted.\n\nGiles said that “K” could refer either to Putin ally and head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), Kirill Dmitriev; or Keith Kellogg, Trump’s special envoy for the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nThe Financial Times report names Dmitriev as one of the “architects” of the new proposal.\n\nThe White House has declined to comment on the matter.\n\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio wrote on X that the US “will continue to develop a list of potential ideas for ending this war based on input from both sides of this conflict”.\n\nRubio added: “Ending a complex and deadly war such as the one in Ukraine requires an extensive exchange of serious and realistic ideas. And achieving a durable peace will require both sides to agree to difficult but necessary concessions.”\n\nZelenskyy, who was  holding talks in Turkiye  with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday, has also not commented on the alleged proposal.\n\n“The main thing for stopping the bloodshed and achieving lasting peace is that we work in coordination with all our partners and that American leadership remains effective, strong,” Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram after his meeting with Erdogan in Ankara.\n\nZelenskyy said that only the US and Trump “have sufficient strength for the war to finally come to an end”.\n\nAccording to Axios, the plan spans 28 specific but unknown points. Overall, it would give Russia full control over both Crimea in the south – which Russia seized from Ukraine in 2014 but which remains in dispute – and the Donbas region, which is made up of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine.\n\nIn Donbas, Russia currently controls all of Luhansk and most of Donetsk. According to the Institute for the Study of War, overall, Ukraine still controls 14.5 percent of the territory in the Donbas region including parts of Donetsk around the cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk.\n\nUkraine would be required to withdraw its troops from the Donbas altogether, and it would become a demilitarised zone, with Russia also unable to place its troops there.\n\nAxios quoted an unnamed Ukrainian official saying the plan also imposes longer-term limits on the size of Ukraine’s military and its possession of long‑range missiles.\n\nIn addition to Crimea and the majority of the Donbas region, Russia also now controls 75 percent of  Zaporizhia  and  Kherson  in southern Ukraine, bordering the Black Sea. According to the plan, the existing battle lines in these two areas would be frozen in place. The return of any of this territory to Ukraine would be subject to later negotiations.\n\nAnalysts said, on face value, this plan does not favour Ukraine at all. “If the plan, as has been suggested to media were implemented, this would leave Ukraine defenceless against the next Russian attack,” Giles said.\n\nHe added that a reduction in the size of its army and limitations on its long-range weapons would leave Ukraine too vulnerable. He described the plan as “catastrophic to European security”.\n\n“It seems that Ukrainian armed forces will have to be reduced by 2.5 times [reduced by 60 percent] of its size – that means Ukraine cannot have more than 400,000 personnel,” Marina Miron, a postdoctoral researcher at the defence studies department at King’s College London, told Al Jazeera, based on what she has read about the plan. “It also says Ukraine shouldn’t have any long-range capabilities that would be able to strike Russia. Then the territories under Russian control would be officially recognised as well as Crimea.”\n\n“This plan seems to obviously favour Russia, and it is interesting to see whether the United States can exert enough leverage on Ukraine and on Zelenskyy to accept this plan,” Miron said.\n\nTrump has flip-flopped on the issue of Ukraine ceding land to Russia several times this year.\n\nLate last month, Trump suggested  freezing the war  in Ukraine at its current battle lines.\n\n“You leave it the way it is right now. They can … negotiate something later on down the line,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One in October. This plan was rejected by Russia, which has made clear it is determined to achieve its war goal of the withdrawal of Ukraine’s military from the eastern regions that Moscow lays claim to.\n\nUkraine and its European allies  supported this plan  at the time. “The current line of contact should be the starting point of negotiations,” they said in a joint statement. This marked a shift for Ukraine, which had previously insisted on reclaiming all of its land.\n\nIt was also a change in stance by Trump, who on September 23, said Ukraine could  win back all its territory  captured by Russia since the beginning of the  war  with help from the European Union and NATO.\n\n“With time, patience, and the financial support of Europe and, in particular, NATO, the original Borders from where this War started, is very much an option,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform back then.\n\nBefore that, on August 11, Trump said both Russia and Ukraine would have to cede territory to end the war. He told reporters that Russia had taken some of Ukraine’s “very prime territory” and “we’re going to try to get some of that territory back”. At this point, Zelenskyy rejected the idea of conceding any land.\n\nIn February this year, Trump met with Zelenskyy in the Oval Office. Trump and his vice president, JD Vance, berated Zelenskyy during this meeting for not being “grateful” enough for American support in the war so far.\n\nTrump indicated that ending the war would require Ukraine to give up some territory, telling Zelenskyy: “You should be grateful. You’re not in a strong position – you’re trapped there, your people are dying, and you’re running out of soldiers.”\n\nOn the campaign trail ahead of the US election last year, Trump promised to end the Ukraine war in the first 24 hours of his presidency. Trump was inaugurated in late January this year, and about 11 months later, all his attempts at peace talks have been unsuccessful.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has been dragging on since February 2022. On Wednesday, a Russian  aerial attack on Ternopil  in western Ukraine killed at least 26 people and injured several others, according to Ukrainian Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko.\n\nMiron said she believes that if this plan is presented, Ukraine and Europe will reject it due to its heavy favouring of Russia.\n\n“We will get into another cycle of rewriting the plan, and Ukraine and Europe will have their own demands. Allegedly, Zelenskyy had a plan of his own in Turkiye which was put together with his European allies,” Miron said.\n\nIf the reports about the plan are true, the plan will likely set off a “diplomatic game”, she added.\n\n“If Ukrainians and Europeans reject the plan, then Trump can always say, ‘Well, we came with a plan to you and you rejected it. And so you are in the way to achieve a lasting peace’.”\n\nMiron added: “The Europeans plus Ukraine and the Russians have been playing this game, each of them kind of presenting something that they know the other side will reject. So then the ball will be in Europe’s and Ukraine’s court.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/20/india-says-cop30-should-be-about-climate-adaptation-but-dries-up-key-fund","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"05:08:16+00:00","title":"India wants COP30 to focus on climate adaptation, but dries up own fund","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"India faces a growing climate crisis, with more than 32 million people displaced from climate-related disasters between 2015 and 2024, including over 160,000 in the first half of 2025.

September 2, Shabir Ahmad’s home was swallowed by mud and swept into the river after relentless rains triggered a landslide in Sarh village in Indian-administered Kashmir’s Reasi district.\n\n“I had been building my house brick by brick since 2016. It was my life’s work. Only less than a year ago, I had finished constructing the second floor, and now there is nothing,” the 36-year-old father of three children told Al Jazeera.\n\nAhmad’s was among nearly 20 houses in Sarh lost to the Chenab River that night, including one belonging to his brother, as dozens of families helplessly watched their farmlands, shops and other properties worth millions of rupees vanish without a trace.\n\n“We don’t even have one inch of land left to stand on,” said Ahmad from a government school in Sarh, where his family and other villagers were sheltering after the deluge.\n\nThe tragedy at Sarh was among the latest of increasingly frequent climate disasters across India that destroy lives and livelihoods, and displace millions of people to an uncertain future.\n\nAccording to the Geneva-based Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC), climate-related disasters forced more than 32 million people from their homes in India between 2015 and 2024, with 5.4 million displacements recorded in 2024 alone – the highest in 12 years. This makes India one of the three nations most affected by  internal displacements  due to climate change in that period, with China and the Philippines being the top two.\n\nMoreover, in the first six months of 2025, more than 160,000 people were displaced across India due to natural disasters, as the country received above-average rainfall, triggering huge floods and landslides, and submerging hundreds of villages and cities.\n\nTo help millions of people like Ahmad who are vulnerable to the climate crisis, India’s Ministry for Environment, Forest and Climate Change launched a National Adaptation Fund on Climate Change (NAFCC) in 2015. Its goal was to finance projects that help communities cope with floods, droughts, landslides, and other climate-related stresses across India.\n\nManaged by the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), the flagship scheme supported interventions in agriculture, water management, forestry, coastal protection, and climate-resilient infrastructure. Between 2015 and 2021, it financed more than two dozen projects, benefitting thousands of  vulnerable households .\n\nDuring a roundtable in Brazil’s Belem city last month – before the 30th United Nations climate change conference, or COP30, which officially opened on November 17 – India’s minister for environment, forest and climate change, Bhupender Yadav, said the global meet should be the “COP of adaptation”.\n\n“The focus must be on transforming climate commitments into real-world actions that accelerate implementation and directly improve people’s lives,” he said, according to a statement released by the Indian government on October 13. He highlighted “a need to strengthen and intensify the flow of public finance towards adaptation”, said the statement.\n\nIn another statement last Tuesday, a day after COP30 opened, India said climate “adaptation financing needs to exceed nearly 15 times current flows, and significant gaps remain in doubling international public finance for adaptation by 2025”.\n\n“India emphasised that adaptation is an urgent priority for billions of vulnerable people in developing countries who have contributed the least to global warming but stand to suffer the most from its impacts,” said the statement.\n\nBut the actions of the Indian government back home do not match those words at the climate summit.\n\nGovernment records show NAFCC received an average of $13.3m annually in the initial years of its launch. But the allocation steadily declined. In the financial year 2022-2023, the fund’s spending was just $2.47m. In November 2022, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change moved NAFCC from the category of a government “scheme” to a “non-scheme”, providing no clear outlay for funds.\n\nSince the financial year 2023-2024, zero money has been earmarked for the crucial climate adaptation fund.\n\nAs a result, several climate adaptation projects in areas prone to floods, cyclones and landslides have been stalled even as widespread climatic devastation continued to kill and displace people. While presenting the federal budget in parliament in February this year, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman did not even include the words “climate change” and “adaptation” in her hour-long speech.\n\n“Announcing lofty adaptation goals abroad while starving the fund that safeguards our own citizens is misleading and a moral failure,” Raja Muzaffar Bhat, an environmental activist in Indian-administered Kashmir, told Al Jazeera, calling Yadav’s statements in Brazil “a gross distortion of reality and a dangerous distraction”.\n\nAl Jazeera reached out to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change for their comments on cutting NAFCC funds, but has not received any response.\n\nAn official in the Environment Ministry, however, defended the government’s shift in funding priorities, claiming the authorities have not abandoned climate adaptation efforts.\n\n“Funds are now being channelled through broader climate and sustainability initiatives rather than standalone schemes like the NAFCC,” the official told Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media.\n\nMeanwhile, climate crises continue to kill and displace people across India.\n\nIn the Darbhanga district of Bihar, India’s poorest state, 38-year-old Sunita Devi has been displaced five times in seven years as floods in the nearby Kosi River repeatedly destroyed her mud house built on bamboo stilts.\n\n“We live in fear every monsoon. My children have stopped going to school because we shift from camp to camp,” she said, holding on to the family’s only lifeline: A government ration card that allows them to buy food grains at subsidised rates or get them for free.\n\nThis year saw one of the worst monsoons across India, as above-average rains killed hundreds and displaced millions. In Bihar alone, floods affected more than 1.7 million people, killed dozens and submerged hundreds of villages.\n\nIn Odisha, another impoverished eastern state, fisherman Ramesh Behera*, 45, watched his house in Kendrapara district’s Satabhaya village collapse into the Bay of Bengal in 2024, as rising seas continue to erase entire hamlets. “The sea swallowed my home and my father’s fields. Fishing is no longer enough to survive,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nBehera was forced to give up his family’s traditional livelihoods – fishing and farming – and was driven into distress migration to survive. He now works as a manual labourer in Srinagar, the main city in Indian-administered Kashmir.\n\nIn West Bengal state’s Sundarbans Islands, one of the largest mangrove forests in the world, rising seas and coastal erosion have consumed lands and homes, forcing thousands of families in the fragile ecosystem to relocate.\n\nIn the southern state of Tamil Nadu’s Nagapattinam district, 29-year-old Revathi Selvam says saltwater intrusion from the Bay of Bengal has poisoned her farmland and their paddy harvest has collapsed.\n\n“The soil is no longer fertile. We cannot grow rice any more. We may have to leave farming altogether,” she told Al Jazeera, adding that many in her village are considering migrating to the state capital, Chennai, to work as construction workers.\n\nIn the Himalayan state of Himachal Pradesh, 27-year-old hotel worker Arjun Thakur saw his livelihood vanish when a cloudburst in 2024 buried the small tourist lodge where he worked. “The mountain broke apart. I saw houses collapse in seconds,” he recalled.\n\nThakur now stays with his relatives in the state capital Shimla, unsure if he can ever return to his native place.\n\nYet, with funds for NAFCC gone, people like Devi, Behera, Selvam and Thakur have no access to a government scheme that helps them cope with their tragedies.\n\nA government official, who previously worked with NAFCC, told Al Jazeera several schemes approved by the government under NAFCC were never implemented after funds began to dry up as early as 2021, exposing thousands of households to a recurring climate crisis.\n\n“The fund was created to help vulnerable communities adapt before disasters struck, and to reduce the kind of repeated displacement we are now witnessing,” the official said on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media.\n\n“Once the allocations stopped, states lost a key channel to protect people living on the front lines of floods, landslides, and droughts. Now, these families are left to rebuild on their own, again and again.”\n\nActivist Bhat said the government’s attitude to the NAFCC “signals that adaptation is no longer a priority, even as India faces record internal displacement from climate extremes”.\n\n“People are losing homes, farms, and livelihoods, and the government has left them entirely to their fate. If this continues, the next generation will inherit a country where climate refugees are a daily reality,” he said.\n\n“This is climate injustice at its most blatant.”\n\nClimate Action Network South Asia is a Dhaka-based coalition of about 250 civil society organisations, working in eight South Asian countries to promote government and individual action to limit human-induced climate change. Its estimate says roughly 45 million people in India could be forced to migrate by 2050 due to the climate crisis – a threefold increase over current displacement figures.\n\n“We are a vast nation with hot and cold deserts, long coastlines, and Himalayan glaciers. From tsunamis on our shores to flash floods, cloudbursts, and landslides in the mountains, we face the entire spectrum of climate extremes,” Bhat told Al Jazeera.\n\nBhat said it is not just nature causing displacement, but also unchecked “development” of vulnerable areas.\n\n“Earlier, floods or cloudbursts were occasional, and population density was low.

Australia over the location of the top United Nations climate meeting.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced on Thursday morning that Australia had reached an arrangement with Turkiye to host negotiations in the lead-up to the 2026 UN climate meeting along with Pacific nations while Turkiye will assume the presidency of the official meeting.\n\n“What we’ve come up with is a big win for both Australia and [Turkiye],” Albanese told the Australian public broadcaster ABC Radio Perth.\n\nThe announcement comes as  this year’s COP30 climate summit  in the Brazilian city of Belem is due to close on Friday.\n\nAustralia had been pushing to host COP31 next year as a “Pacific COP” alongside low-lying South Pacific nations, which are increasingly threatened by rising seas and climate-fuelled disasters.\n\nDespite Australia’s efforts, Turkiye refused to back down in its bid to host the summit.\n\nTurkiye had said that as an emerging economy, it would promote solidarity between rich and poor countries at its summit, which would have a more global rather than regional focus.\n\nTurkiye will now have just 12 months to plan the meeting at the Antalya Expo Center due to the unusually long process to secure hosting duties and the lack of procedures in place to handle a situation in which two countries wanted to host at the same time.\n\nThe presidency of the  Conference of the Parties (COP)  to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change traditionally rotates among five regions: Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, Central and Eastern Europe, and Western Europe and others.\n\nAustralia and Turkiye both fit within the latter category of Western Europe and others, meaning that Australia will now have to wait another five years until it can bid to host the meeting again.\n\nEthiopian Minister for Planning and Development Fitsum Assefa Adela announced last week that her country had already secured the support of African negotiators to host COP32 in 2027.\n\nPapua New Guinea (PNG) quickly voiced frustration with Australia for dropping its bid to cohost the COP with its Pacific island neighbours.\n\n“We are all not happy and disappointed it’s ended up like this,” PNG Foreign Minister Justin Tkatchenko told the AFP news agency.\n\n“What has COP achieved over the years? Nothing,” Tkatchenko said. “It’s just a talk fest and doesn’t hold the big polluters accountable.”\n\nAustralian Senator Steph Hodgins-May from the Australian Greens party said Australia’s withdrawal from hosting the meeting reflected the current Labor government’s “continued coal and gas approvals” as Australia continues to increase its exports of  fossil fuels .\n\n“This is extremely disappointing, but it shows that the world recognises Australia’s significant role in making dangerous climate change worse,” May said.\n\nAccording to the International Energy Agency, both Australia and Turkiye are heavily dependent on coal, oil and gas for energy, but both countries have also been making progress in renewable energy.\n\nAustralia’s federal Labor government had hoped to showcase renewable energy progress in the state of South Australia by hosting the conference in the state’s capital, Adelaide.\n\nHowever, the proposal was complicated by the city’s struggle to cope with a significant toxic algal bloom that has been taking place offshore for eight months.\n\nAlgal blooms are one of many complications caused by warming oceans, an aspect of climate change that climate scientists and other experts said can be improved only by rapidly reducing dependence on fossil fuels."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/20/sudan-has-vast-oil-gold-and-agricultural-resources-who-controls-them","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"13:17:03+00:00","title":"Sudan has vast oil, gold and agricultural resources.

oil, gold and agricultural resources. Who controls them?\n\nSudan’s civil war, now in its  third year , has pitted the army against the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in a devastating struggle for power.\n\nThe conflict has unleashed the world’s  largest displacement crisis,  with more than 9.5 million people forced from their homes across Sudan’s 18 states and millions facing starvation.\n\nSudan has large natural resources, including oil, gold and agricultural land that could help feed its people, but the fighting and shifting control of these resources make that impossible.\n\nHere are eight maps and charts to show you what resources Sudan has and who controls them:\n\nThe army holds much of the north and the east, including the capital, Khartoum, as well as other key cities along the Nile and the strategic Port Sudan on the Red Sea.\n\nThe RSF has consolidated its grip on the western region of Darfur, after it captured el-Fasher, the capital of North Darfur state, on October 26, having besieged it for nearly 18 months.\n\nThree sectors lead: Oil, gold, and agricultural products.\n\nIn 2023, Sudan’s exports worth $5.09bn were mainly crude oil ($1.13bn), gold ($1.03bn), animal products ($902m), oilseeds ($709m, of which $613m was sesame), and gum arabic ($141m).\n\nSudan is the world’s largest exporter of sesame seeds and gum arabic, which is used as a stabiliser and emulsifier by the global food and beverage industry and goes into pharmaceuticals, supplements, and cosmetics.\n\nThe country’s geography is shaped largely by the Nile River, which floods annually, watering the agricultural lands.\n\nThe White Nile meets the Blue Nile in Khartoum and continues northwards into Egypt as the Nile.\n\nAbout half (51.4 percent) of Sudan is covered in grazing land, mostly across the southern part of the country, ending roughly at Khartoum.\n\nGrazing lands, or rangelands, are coveted because they can support the herding and animal husbandry industries – control is divided roughly equally between the army and the RSF.\n\nThe northern sector of rangeland is a strip known as the “gum arabic belt” where the acacia trees that produce the valuable resin are planted.\n\nSudan’s croplands are mostly concentrated between the Blue and White Niles, where Gezira state lies, an area controlled by armed forces.\n\nOil exports are Sudan’s primary source of revenue.\n\nProduction expanded between 2001 and 2010, from 200,000 barrels per day to nearly 500,000bpd. In 2011, it collapsed when South Sudan seceded, taking 75 percent of Sudan’s oil reserves with it.\n\nBy 2023, output had fallen to 70,000bpd, according to the United States Energy Information Administration.\n\nThe Observatory of Economic Complexity estimated that crude oil remained one of Sudan’s top exports that year, valued at $1.13bn, making it the world’s 40th-largest crude exporter.\n\nIts top buyers were Malaysia ($468m), Italy ($299m), Germany ($125m), China ($105m), Singapore ($80.3m) and India ($51.4m).\n\nAs of 2024, Sudan’s oil reserves were estimated at 1.25 billion barrels, while natural gas reserves stood at 3 trillion cubic feet. Sudan, however, neither produces nor consumes gas in significant quantities.\n\nMost of Sudan’s oilfields are in the south near the South Sudan border, and the two countries’ oil sectors remain closely linked. Many of these fields are currently under RSF control.\n\nThe industry is supported by five refineries in the central and northern regions. The largest is the Khartoum refinery, which can process 100,000bpd and, as of late January 2025, is held by SAF.\n\nThe army also controls the smaller Port Sudan refinery.\n\nPipelines carry crude from the southern fields to the Bashayer export terminal south of Port Sudan, a crucial route for Sudanese and South Sudanese oil. The line from el-Obeid to Port Sudan remains mostly under army control.\n\nSudan is one of Africa’s leading gold producers, with deposits across the northeast, centre and the south.\n\nMost of the deposits in eastern Sudan are controlled by the Sudanese army, while the central and southwestern goldfields are largely under RSF control.\n\nMuch of the gold is extracted through artisanal and small-scale mining, which employs hundreds of thousands of people but operates largely outside government regulation.\n\nSince the war began in 2023, control over gold mines and trade routes has become a critical source of funding for both sides in the conflict.\n\nLocal news  agencies  reported in July that, despite the conflict, Sudan’s gold production surged to 64 tonnes in 2024, up 53 percent from 41.8 tonnes in 2022, generating $1.57bn in legal export revenues. An unquantified black-market trade continues, fuelled by the instability.\n\nAccording to the Observatory of Economic Complexity, the United Arab Emirates bought more than 99 percent of the $1.03bn in Sudanese gold exports in 2023.\n\nSome 80 percent of Sudan’s exports are to Asia, followed by 11 percent to Europe and 8.5 percent to Africa.\n\nIn 2023, the UAE was Sudan’s top trade partner, importing $1.09bn, or 21 percent of Sudan’s total exports, almost entirely in gold. China ranked second, importing $882m (17 percent), primarily in vegetable products.\n\nIt was followed by Saudi Arabia, with $802m (16 percent) worth of mostly livestock; Malaysia, with $470m (9 percent) of primarily crude petroleum; and Egypt, with $387m (7.6 percent) of a mix of goods.\n\nThese five countries account for more than two-thirds of Sudan’s exports.\n\nSudan is the third-largest country in Africa, about 1.9 million sq km (718,000sq miles).\n\nAs of 2024, its population was 50.5 million, with most residents concentrated  along the Nile River  and in urban centres. The Greater Khartoum area has a population of about seven million, and Nyala in South Darfur has almost 1.15 million people.\n\nOther main cities are el-Obeid (560,000), Port Sudan (547,000), Kassala (411,000), Gadarif (364,000), el-Daein (265,000), el-Fasher (253,000), ad-Damazin (186,000), Geneina (163,000), Gereida (120,000), and Atbara (108,000)."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/tag/science-and-technology/","dateOfPublication":"1911-11-19","timeOfPublication":"19:00:00Z","title":"Science and Technology | Today's latest from Al Jazeera","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"This article covers a broad range of global developments in science, technology, and public policy.

Pregnant women are advised to consult a doctor before taking the medication.\n\nThe World Health Organization reiterated the point in September, noting that “no consistent association has been established” between the medication and autism, despite “extensive research”.\n\nBut claims to the contrary have already prompted efforts to limit the availability of Tylenol, a popular brand of acetaminophen, a fever- and pain-reducing medication.\n\nOn Tuesday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton launched a lawsuit accusing Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue, the companies behind the over-the-counter pain reliever, of deceptive practices.\n\nIn doing so, he reiterated misinformation shared by President Donald Trump and government officials like Kennedy.\n\n“By holding Big Pharma accountable for poisoning our people, we will help Make America Healthy Again,” Paxton said in a statement, giving a nod to Kennedy’s MAHA slogan.\n\nThe suit alleges that Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue violated Texas consumer protection laws by having “deceptively marketed Tylenol as the only safe painkiller for pregnant women”.\n\nIt was the latest instance of scientific misinformation being perpetuated by top officials. Both Trump and Kennedy have repeatedly spread scientific misinformation throughout their political careers.\n\nTrump linked autism and the painkiller during a news conference in September, without providing reputable scientific findings to back the claim.\n\n“[Using] acetaminophen – is that OK? – which is basically, commonly known as Tylenol, during pregnancy can be associated with a very increased risk of autism,” Trump said on September 22. “So taking Tylenol is not good. I’ll say it. It’s not good.”\n\nKennedy has offered his own sweeping statements about Tylenol and its alleged risks, despite having no professional medical background.\n\n“Anyone who takes this stuff during pregnancy, unless they have to, is irresponsible,” he said in a cabinet meeting on October 9.\n\nKennedy also mischaracterised studies on male circumcision earlier this month. He  falsely  said the studies showed an increase in autism among children who were “circumcised early”.\n\n“It’s highly likely because they’re given Tylenol,” he added.\n\nKenvue stressed in a statement on Tuesday that acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women, noting that high fevers and pain are potential risks to pregnancies if left untreated.\n\n“We stand firmly with the global medical community that acknowledges the safety of acetaminophen and believe we will continue to be successful in litigation as these claims lack legal merit and scientific support,” Kenvue said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/17/landslides-kill-dozens-as-heavy-rains-lash-southeast-asia","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"09:47:57+00:00","title":"Landslides kill dozens as heavy rains lash Southeast Asia","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Heavy rains during the Southeast Asian rainy season have caused devastating landslides in Indonesia and Vietnam, killing at least 24 people and injuring 19.

light from massive black hole\n\nScientists have documented the most energetic flare ever observed emanating from a supermassive black hole, a cataclysmic event that briefly shone with the light of 10 trillion suns.\n\nThe new findings were published on Tuesday in the journal Nature Astronomy, with astronomer Matthew Graham of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) leading the study.\n\nThe phenomenal burst of energy was likely triggered when an unusually large star wandered too close to the black hole and was violently shredded and swallowed.\n\n“However it happened, the star wandered close enough to the supermassive black hole that it was ‘spaghettified’ – that is, stretched out to become long and thin, due to the gravity of the supermassive black hole strengthening as you get very close to it. That material then spiralled around the supermassive black hole as it fell in,” said astronomer and study co-author KE Saavik Ford.\n\nThe supermassive black hole was unleashed by a black hole roughly 300 million times the mass of the sun residing inside a faraway galaxy, about 11 billion light years from Earth. A light year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km).\n\nThe star, estimated to be between 30 and 200 times the mass of the sun, was turned into a stream of gas that heated up and shined intensely as it spiralled into oblivion.\n\nAlmost every large galaxy, including our Milky Way, has a supermassive black hole at its centre. But scientists still aren’t sure how they form.\n\nFirst spotted in 2018 by the Palomar Observatory, operated by the Caltech, the flare took about three months to reach its peak brightness, becoming roughly 30 times more luminous than any previously recorded event of its kind. It is still ongoing, but diminishing in luminosity, with the entire process expected to take about 11 years to complete.\n\nBecause of how far away the black hole is located, observing the flash gives scientists a rare glimpse into the universe’s early epoch.

2025-11-07T07:49:12+00:00\n\nTitle: Why are scientists rushing to study a comet from deep space?\n\nAstrophysicists are scrambling to study an ancient comet from another star system that entered the solar system this year, and which has already swung past Mars.\n\nDubbed 3I/ATLAS, the comet poses no threat to Earth or its neighbouring planets, but has aroused immense interest as space agencies train their sights on what is only one of three interstellar objects detected by scientists.\n\nHere is what we know about the object that is intriguing scientists:\n\nThe comet is only the third interstellar object ever recorded to pass through Earth’s solar system from another star. Comets are celestial bodies made of ice, dust and gas which orbit the sun. They are considered remnants from when the solar system formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago.\n\n3I/ATLAS was first discovered in July by scientist Larry Dennau of the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope team, located in Rio Hurtado, Chile. The project is funded by NASA and is operated by researchers at the University of Hawaii’s Institute for Astronomy.\n\nBefore this, 1I/’Oumuamua, a rocky, cigar-shaped object, was discovered by Canada’s Robert Weryk using the Pan-STARRS telescope at Haleakala Observatory, Hawaii, in October 2017.\n\nIn August 2019, 2I/Borisov, a “rogue comet” – one that is not bound by gravity to any particular star system, so is travelling freely through space – was discovered by the Crimean astronomer and telescope maker Gennadiy Borisov at the MARGO Observatory in Crimea.\n\nComets are typically named after their human or station founders. The “I” in their names stands for “interstellar”, meaning that it has originated from another solar system.\n\nIt zipped past Mars earlier in October, coming within 29 million km (18 million miles) of the red planet at a breakneck speed of 310,000km/h (193,000mph).\n\nThe comet made its closest approach to the sun at the end of October and is expected to pass closest to Earth in December, when it will be about 270 million km (170 million miles) away, according to NASA. It will still be farther from Earth than the sun, which is 150 million km (93 million miles) away.\n\nA host of spacecraft and other assets have already set eyes on the celestial visitor, particularly as its current trajectory has hidden it behind the sun, making it untrackable from Earth for now. NASA notes that it will reappear on the other side of the sun by early December 2025.\n\nScientists are eager to understand more about the comet’s actual size and physical properties.\n\nAside from the Hubble telescope, other space assets owned by NASA will track, or are already tracking, the comet and relaying information about it, including:\n\nSeparately, the ESA’s Juice spacecraft, launched in 2023 and heading to Jupiter and its icy moons, will also keep an eye on the zipping interloper throughout November.\n\nUsing these multiple resources, researchers have been able to capture clear enough images of the object to determine that the object is indeed a comet, as indicated by the hyperbolic shape of its orbital path, that is, the fact that the object does not follow a closed orbital path around the sun, according to NASA.\n\nThe NASA Hubble Space Telescope first captured images in July showing that the comet has a teardrop-shaped cocoon of dust coming off its solid, icy nucleus, according to the agency.\n\nObservations by the Hubble Space Telescope put the comet’s nucleus at no more than 5.6 km (3.5 miles) across. It could be as small as 440 metres (1,444 feet), according to NASA.\n\n3I/Atlas’s coma – the fuzzy halo which appears around comets – is full of carbon dioxide, meaning it must have formed somewhere very cold, and therefore quite far from its star, Darryl Seligman, a planetary scientist at Michigan State University, told US Magazine, Scientific American."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/longform/2025/11/20/franco-legacy-fifty-years","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"08:13:33+00:00","title":"Amnesia, nostalgia, healing: Spain grapples with Franco legacy 50 years on","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Fifty years after Franco’s death, Spain continues to confront the legacy of his authoritarian regime, marked by the execution of tens of thousands of civilians during the Spanish Civil War.

on\n\nGranada, Spain -  This summer, Marina Roldan, a lawyer from Granada in southern Spain, finally got the phone call her family had waited decades for.\n\nThe body of Fermin Roldan Garcia, her grandfather, who was one of tens of thousands of people killed by General Francisco Franco’s death squads in the 1936-1939 Spanish Civil War, had finally been located and identified.\n\nHis remains were found in a ravine in the village of Viznar, a few kilometres outside Granada.\n\n“My brother Juan called me. He’d been the family contact with the archaeological team carrying out the excavation,” Roldan told Al Jazeera. \"When Juan told me my grandfather had been found, my first thoughts were for my [late] father.\"\n\nHer father, Jose Antonio Roldan Diaz, was just 10 months old when his father was killed at the age of 41.\n\nRoldan Garcia was a tax inspector, a trade unionist and a member of the Socialist Party who stood unsuccessfully for parliament in the February 1936 elections in Granada.\n\nAs Marina remembers them, her voice falters with the emotion of it all. The noise of passing trams echoes through an open window of her office.\n\n“I thought of [my father] and I thought of my late uncles, who would have liked to have heard the news, and my grandmother too. ... I think they all deserved their husband, their father, to be found.”\n\nOn Thursday, Spain marks 50 years since the end of Franco's dictatorship - four decades that ended with his death on November 20, 1975.\n\nAfter Spain's first fully fledged modern democracy and Second Republic began in 1931 despite ferocious opposition from hardline conservatives, Franco began a right-wing military rebellion on July 18, 1936, to put an end to its political and social reforms.\n\nDespite backing from fascist Italy and Nazi Germany, his uprising encountered greater resistance than expected from a makeshift pro-Republican coalition of left-wing trade unionists, political parties, some parts of the armed forces and pro-democracy activists, leading to a full-scale, brutal Civil War lasting three years.\n\nThe republic finally surrendered on April 2, 1939, leading to his regime.\n\nSince the earliest days of the war, a brutal repression of suspected civilian rivals and their families had begun in the Franco-controlled areas of Spain. It was designed to silence and intimidate any possible opposition.\n\nThe number of victims who were summarily executed is estimated at 130,000 to 200,000.\n\nIn the half-century since Franco's demise, exhumations have been slow and beset by logistical, financial and legal challenges. There are an estimated 6,000 unmarked mass graves dotted around the country, including everywhere from wells and woodlands to gardens, cemeteries and remote hillsides.\n\nBut as Spain remembers the era's victims and analyses exhumation efforts, it is grappling with the steady recent rise of a far-right party, Vox, and nostalgia for the ideals of the dictatorship among young people who did not endure it.\n\nA recent CIS poll suggested that 20 percent of those aged 18 to 24 believed the dictatorship was \"good\" or \"very good\".\n\nAccording to secondary schoolteachers, social media is driving pro-Franco support among teenagers.\n\n“They talk like they are really in favour of the dictatorship and of obligatory military service as well,” Jose Garcia Vico, a secondary school economics teacher in Andalusia, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“The majority of the teachers I know are very worried because even if we’ve explained the difference between dictatorship and democracy, the students are so overrun with content from TikTok and they’re so p***** off with the world in general, they don’t know what they want.”\n\n“The content they get from the hard-right parties on social media aimed at adolescents is considerable, and it has a lot of effect on how they relate to each other.”\n\nWhile emphasising “not everybody in the class” is attracted to the far right, Garcia Vico points to a parallel sharp rise in Islamophobic and anti-transgender comments.\n\n“Above all, it’s the boys who feel superior to the rest. But it’s a problem which involves some of the parents as well. A couple of years ago, some parents told me that it was OK that their child had interrupted me by shouting, 'Viva Franco!’ ['Long Live Franco!'] because that was freedom of expression.”\n\nHundreds of kilometres north in the capital, Madrid, Sebastian Reyes Turner, a 27-year-old teacher, said he has also noticed the impact of hard-right social media influencers.\n\n“In schools, people only see Franco’s dictatorship as one of several topics to mindlessly memorise to pass a history exam they don’t really care about to begin with.\n\n“On the other hand, details are cherry-picked by the far right to make them think it was a better time in which they didn’t face problems like they do today - like how hard it is to find jobs even if they’ve been studying well into their 20s or the housing crisis.”\n\nPolitical analysts said Vox's attitude to the Franco dictatorship shows underlying sympathies for the former regime without any sense of embarrassment.\n\nLast year, Vox lawmaker Manuel Mariscal boasted in parliament that “thanks to social media, many young people are discovering that the post-Civil War era in Spain was not some dark time but a period of progress and reconciliation towards national unity.”\n\n“There is a type of mythification of the Franco years that works well on social media, and it has a big impact on young men in particular. They are told there were no problems in that era because there was no radical feminism and no migrants out there on the streets,” said Oriol Bartomeus, a research professor at the Institute of Political and Social Science at the Autonomous University of Barcelona and author of a book on generational change in Spain, El peso del tiempo, or The Weight of Time.\n\n“You can hear the same kinds of claims now in the United Kingdom, the USA, Germany and Italy - that a return to a simpler past where the white men were in charge of the ship is possible.”\n\nHowever, none of these countries had a dictatorship as recently as Spain, where Vox commands nearly 20 percent of the vote and is steadily rising in polls.\n\nBartomeus noted a generational shift in the right-wing electorate from the traditional Partido Popular (PP) - “it’s increasingly becoming a party for old people” - towards Vox.\n\nOn the other side of the political spectrum, left-leaning voters have a critical stance towards the regime.\n\nAfter democracy returned, there was a \"tendency to keep looking forward, forgetting the past and concentrating on integration into Europe - a kind of collective amnesia”, he said\n\n“It’s only when the generation of Spanish baby boomers, born between 1960 and 1965, starts to impact politically that there’s a clear shift in the Socialist Party to overcome that amnesia. They are the generation who argue the dictatorship can’t be ignored. They’re the ones who say, 'Let’s open up the roadside graves.'\n\n“It started with [Socialist] President Rodriguez Zapatero and his law of 'historic memory' in 2007” - Spain’s first law that fully addressed the Franco regime and began an ongoing process of removing the hundreds of dictatorship-era symbols and architecture from its streets and squares.\n\n“They’re the people that open up the can of worms. And that in turn has created the reaction you’re getting from the neo-Francoists of today.”\n\nSince Franco died, Spain has witnessed massive social progress.\n\nTo take women’s rights as an example, in 1975, the last year of the regime, married women had equivalent legal status to the mentally ill and illiterate and were banned from signing contracts. They could not travel, work or open a bank account without their husbands' permission.\n\nBy 1981, there was a divorce law. By 1985, abortion was decriminalised, and by 2005, same sex marriage was legalised.\n\nBut at the same time as Spain moved away from the dictatorship, the PP was one of the few mainstream parties in Europe that failed to categorically condemn the regime.\n\n“The problem is that unlike Germany's or Italy’s 20th century dictatorships, Franco’s government doesn’t get overthrown. It simply ends,\" Bartomeus said.\n\n“That absence of a formal rejection permits a kind of sociological Francoism to remain in place, and that’s why there can still be a lot of people inside the PP who, even today, are still pro-Franco.”\n\nSpain is only now taking concrete action to ban the Francisco Franco National Foundation, founded in 1976 to, as its website puts it, “promote the study of the life, legacy and work in its human, political and military aspects” of the man who “governed the fate of Spain between 1936 and 1977”.\n\nMeanwhile, Vox opposes exhumations. The party is also furious that Franco himself was  exhumed  from his own specially built mausoleum outside Madrid, previously known as the Valley of the Fallen, and given a more discreet burial in 2019.\n\nThis month, architectural plans were approved for Franco’s former tomb to be remodelled as a politically neutral Civil War heritage museum.\n\nAlthough excavations like the one in Viznar are proceeding at an unprecedented pace, archaeologists are concerned that at some point, a new right-wing government would cut off financing and threaten projects that reckon with the past.\n\n“It has already happened once,” said Francisco Carrion, an archaeology professor at the University of Granada who has overseen the regional and state-backed Viznar investigation and exhumations for the past five years.\n\n“The previous PP government with Mariano Rajoy didn’t suspend the 2007 law of historic memory. But during his time in power, he did cut off absolutely all funding for the exhumations. They cut it right down to nothing.”\n\nLikening the massacres and executions in Franco’s era to the current Israeli attacks on the  Palestinian civilian population  in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, he said among those killed - like Marina Roldan’s grandfather - were trade unionists, teachers, seamstresses and artists.\n\nIn Viznar, his team have even discovered the executed remains of a child aged 11 to 14.\n\nA few metres away from the exhumation site, in the converted mill that acts as the headquarters for Carrion's investigation, his colleague Jose Francisco Munoz Molina, a forensic anthropologist, is working on two of the 166 skeletons that have been exhumed so far.\n\nOne has traces of a bullet wound in the arm, he explained, and the other was shot in the head.\n\n“It’s a complicated process emotionally. It can affect you a lot,” Munoz Molina said. “You’re dealing with people who were very close to our own ages, who were very young in many cases. It’s hard to understand how this all happened.\n\n“My own great-grandparents were executed against the walls of the city cemetery in Granada during the Civil War.\"\n\nAbout 3,400 people in the early part of the Civil War were reportedly executed against Granada's cemetery walls.\n\n\"I’m doing something for families who have been looking for them for such a long time, and it’s going to help heal them, so it’s healing me a little bit as well.”\n\nThe latest series of excavations this autumn produced 12 more bodies, Carrion said.\n\nAlthough it’s much too early to say, he said cautiously, they hope to have found evidence of one of the bigger mass executions of October 1936, including of the rector of Granada University, Salvador Vila.\n\nAs for the still undiscovered remains of Federico Garcia Lorca, Spain’s most famous modern-day poet, Carrion is less hopeful. There are several theories as to where exactly in the hills of Granada he could have been killed.\n\n“It’s true that Garcia Lorca is dead but also that he lives on too, in his books across the world, in so many different translations. On a human level and regardless of his poetic contribution, the 166 other people we’ve so far exhumed are just as important too.”\n\nThe moment of handing over remains to relatives “is the best part of our work. They are very emotive ceremonies. It’s almost magical because we’ve given them closure after so many years,” Carrion said.\n\nHe recalled the case of two daughters, aged 92 and 93, who were both suffering from Alzheimer’s disease but who were somehow able to have brief moments of mental clarity when the box containing the remains of their relative was handed over.\n\n“When they held the box, they knew what was happening. It makes you cry. You’d have to be made of stone not to be affected.”\n\nIn the case of Marina Roldan, her only impression of her grandfather for years was from the portrait in the bedroom she shared with her grandmother - “one of those old ones where it looks as if whatever you do, his eyes are following you, so I always had the impression that if I did something wrong, in my head he’d tell me off”, she said with a laugh.\n\n“Now there’s a real story, a real background. But I don’t have the sensation of an open wound being closed, more a kind of calm because I feel that my dad would be happy and that he too is resting now.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/3/how-will-limited-us-nuclear-tests-avoid-any-explosions","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"12:27:39Z","title":"How will ‘limited’ US nuclear tests avoid any explosions?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article discusses the controversy surrounding President Donald Trump’s announcement to restart U.S. nuclear weapons testing, which has been clarified by Energy Secretary Chris Wright as involving only noncritical, non-explosive system tests.

tests will be “noncritical” and will not feature any nuclear explosions for now.\n\nThis clarification on Sunday came three days after President Donald Trump announced he had instructed the Department of Defense to “immediately” restart  testing of US nuclear weapons .\n\n“I think the tests we’re talking about right now are system tests,” Wright said on the Fox News show The Sunday Briefing.\n\n“These are not nuclear explosions. These are what we call noncritical explosions.”\n\nWright explained that for now, only the components of nuclear weapons will be tested to ensure they work properly and can trigger a nuclear explosion. He said these tests will be conducted on new systems to ensure that replacement nuclear weapons are improvements on earlier models.\n\n“With our science and our computation power, we can simulate incredibly accurately exactly what will happen in a nuclear explosion,” Wright said. “Now, we simulate what were the conditions that delivered that and, as we change bomb designs, what will they deliver.”\n\nAccording to the website of the Washington, DC-based nonpartisan organisation Arms Control Association, several nonnuclear explosive techniques can be used for nuclear weapon development, monitoring and maintenance. These can also include “subcritical” experiments, which use plutonium but avoid nuclear chain reactions.\n\n“In this context, ‘noncritical’ nuclear tests involve testing of nuclear weapons delivery systems or components but not the detonation of a nuclear warhead,” Georgia Cole, a research analyst at the International Security Programme at Chatham House, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Noncritical tests typically take place in laboratories or testing facilities, often using advanced computer simulations to assess the safety and reliability of nuclear warheads without detonation. There are also ‘subcritical’ tests, which are nonnuclear explosions carried out underground, often in former nuclear test sites.”\n\nOn Thursday, Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform: “Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis.” Trump signed an executive order in September to rename the Department of Defense the Department of War.\n\nTrump added in his post that while the US has “more Nuclear Weapons than any other country”, China “will be even within 5 years”.\n\nTrump justified his testing decision by citing China’s rapid build-up of its nuclear arsenal. The announcement came minutes before Trump’s  meeting  with Chinese President Xi Jinping which resulted in a truce on tariffs and some Chinese export restrictions of rare earth metals.\n\nOn Sunday, during an appearance on the CBS News programme 60 Minutes, Trump said in reference to nuclear weapons: “Russia’s testing, and China’s testing, but they don’t talk about it. You know, we’re an open society. We’re different. We talk about it. We have to talk about it.”\n\nTrump added: “We’re gonna test because they test and others test. And certainly North Korea’s been testing. Pakistan’s been testing.”\n\nHowever, none of the countries Trump mentioned has openly conducted nuclear weapons tests in recent years, and he did not provide any evidence to support his claims. It is also unclear why he believes China could catch up with the far larger US arsenal of nuclear warheads in just five years.\n\n“There is no credible evidence that Russia, China or Pakistan are conducting explosive nuclear tests. The only country to have tested a nuclear weapon in the 21st century is North Korea, which has observed a self-declared moratorium since 2018,” Cole said.\n\n“While all nuclear-armed states routinely test their delivery systems, such as missiles, there is no indication that any have resumed nuclear detonations.”\n\nNine states have nuclear arms: the US, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel.\n\nAccording to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) yearbook report published in January, Russia has the highest number of total warheads at 4,309.\n\nRussia is followed by the US, which has 3,700 warheads. China has 600. France has 290. The UK has 225. India has 180. Pakistan has 170. Israel has 90, and North Korea has 50.\n\nA SIPRI report from June stated that China’s nuclear arsenal has been growing more rapidly than any other country’s, increasing by about 100 warheads every year since 2023. A report published by the Pentagon in December estimated that China would likely have 1,000 nuclear weapons by 2030.\n\nThe US has retired 1,477 nuclear warheads while Russia has retired 1,150. A retired warhead is one that has been removed from a country’s military arsenal and is awaiting dismantlement. According to a report published in March by the Federation of American Scientists, a US-based think tank, the retired warheads “are still relatively intact”, however.\n\n“In some cases, retired warheads could technically be restored, depending on how far they are through the dismantlement process. However, this can be a lengthy and resource-intensive process. More commonly, states may reuse components from older warheads in the production or refurbishment of a new weapon,” Cole said.\n\nThe US  began testing nuclear weapons  in 1945 with the first detonation taking place over New Mexico’s desert. The last time it tested nuclear weapons was more than 30 years ago in 1992. In total, the US has conducted 1,032 nuclear tests, according to the United Nations.\n\nThe Soviet Union conducted 715 nuclear tests – the last one in 1990. Russia, which inherited the Soviet nuclear arsenal, has not conducted any nuclear tests.\n\nChina has conducted 45 tests and last tested nuclear weapons in 1996.\n\nFrance last tested nuclear weapons in 1996. It conducted 210 tests from 1945 to 1996. The UK conducted 45 nuclear tests from 1952 with the last one conducted in 1991.\n\nMost countries  have ceased nuclear weapons testing after signing the global Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which was introduced in 1996.\n\nSince then, 10 nuclear tests have taken place: two by India and two by Pakistan in 1998 and six by North Korea in 2006, 2009, 2013, 2016 (twice) and 2017, according to the UN. India, Pakistan and North Korea have not signed the CTBT.\n\nThe US did sign the CTBT in 1996 but did not ratify it. Russia signed the CTBT in 1996 and ratified it in 2000, but in 2023, President Vladimir Putin withdrew Russia’s ratification of the treaty.\n\nWhen a country signs a treaty, it signals its general agreement with the treaty’s terms and its intention to adhere to it in the future. Only upon ratification does the treaty become legally binding for that country under international law.\n\nPolitical and scientific authorities in the US have asserted that the US does not need to conduct new nuclear tests.\n\nThe National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) is a semiautonomous agency within the US Department of Energy. The agency oversees nuclear weapons security, maintenance and stockpile stewardship. The NNSA has repeatedly made it clear that the US does not need new tests.\n\nThe agency’s new administrator, Brandon Williams, said during his Senate confirmation hearing in April: “The United States continues to observe its 1992 nuclear test moratorium and since 1992 has assessed that the deployed nuclear stockpile remains safe, secure and effective without nuclear explosive testing.”\n\nWilliams added that every year, national security lab directors and the commander of the US Strategic Command review the nuclear stockpile to decide if underground nuclear testing is necessary. Previous NNSA Administrator Jill Hruby also stated that new testing was not necessary, according to a 2023 interview with the Arms Control Association.\n\nIf the US breaks this moratorium on testing nuclear weapons – rather than just their components – other countries are likely to follow suit, experts said.\n\n“If the US were to resume explosive nuclear testing, other powers would almost certainly respond in kind. Russia has already stated that it would mirror any US tests, and such moves could prompt China and North Korea to follow. The result would be the collapse of a 30-year moratorium on nuclear testing, undoing decades of restraint and sharply increasing global nuclear risks,” Cole said.\n\nShe added that Wright’s clarification about the tests being noncritical is an important one. “Had [Trump] been referring to explosive tests, as many initially assumed, that would represent a dramatic policy shift and a serious escalation in nuclear tensions.”"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3w9wlney23o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"15:17:31.138+00:00","title":"Some migrants to face 20-year wait for settled status","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The UK government, led by Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood, is proposing to extend the qualifying period for permanent settlement to 10 years for migrants arriving legally since 2021, replacing the current five-year standard.

will not apply to people who had already obtained settlement.\n\nMahmood said becoming part of the UK is \"not a right but a privilege - and one that must be earned\".\n\nThe package is the latest in a string of changes to the immigration system announced by Mahmood over the past week.\n\nCurrently, most work and family visa holders can apply for settlement after five years.\n\nUnder the proposed changes the standard wait will be 10 years - with a range of criteria that would lengthen or shorten that period.\n\nAnnouncing the changes in the Commons, Mahmood said: \"Migration will always be a

to social media ban for children under 16\n\nAustralia’s upcoming  social media ban  for children under 16 years old will include the online forum Reddit and livestreaming platform Kick in addition to seven other well-known sites, according to the country’s online safety commissioner.\n\nThe social media ban will go into effect on December 10 and will also restrict access to Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X and YouTube, Communications Minister Anika Wells said on Wednesday.\n\n“Online platforms use technology to target children with chilling control. We are merely asking that they use that same technology to keep children safe online,” Wells said.\n\n“We have met with several of the social media platforms in the past month so that they understand there is no excuse for failure to implement this law,” Wells told reporters in Canberra.\n\n“We want children to have a childhood, and we want parents to have peace of mind,” she said.\n\nSocial media platforms have had 12 months to prepare for the ban since  Australia passed its landmark  online safety legislation in November last year.\n\nInitial discussions focused primarily around Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, X and YouTube, but the list was later expanded, and Wells said the list could continue to change.\n\nWhile more than 140 Australian and international academics signed an open letter to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese last year opposing the age limit ban as a “blunt” instrument,  Canberra’s move  is being closely watched by countries that share concerns about the impacts of online platforms on children.\n\n“Delaying children’s access to social media accounts gives them valuable time to learn and grow, free of the powerful, unseen forces of harmful and deceptive design features such as opaque algorithms and endless scroll,” eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said.\n\nInman Grant said she would work with academics to evaluate the impact of the ban, including whether children sleep or interact more or become more physically active as a result of the restrictions on using social media.\n\n“We’ll also look for unintended consequences, and we’ll be gathering evidence” so others can learn from Australia’s ban, Inman Grant said.\n\nCritics have questioned how the restrictions will be enforced because users cannot be “compelled” to submit government IDs for an age check, according to a government fact sheet.\n\nDiscussions are under way with platforms about how to comply with the new rules, the commissioner said, while failure to comply could lead to civil fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars (US$32.1m).\n\nNews that Australia would add more names to the list of banned platforms came as French authorities said they had opened an investigation into the social media platform TikTok and the risks of its algorithms pushing young people into suicide.\n\nParis prosecutor Laure Beccuau said the probe was in response to a parliamentary committee’s request to open a criminal inquiry into TikTok’s possible responsibility for endangering the lives of its young users.\n\nBeccuau said a report by the committee had noted “insufficient moderation of TikTok, its ease of access by minors and its sophisticated algorithm, which could push vulnerable individuals towards suicide by quickly trapping them in a loop of dedicated content”.\n\nTikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Paris police cybercrime unit will look into the offence of providing a platform for “propaganda in favour of products, objects, or methods recommended as means of committing suicide”, which is punishable by three years in prison.\n\nThe unit will also look into the offence of enabling “illegal transactions by an organised gang”, punishable by 10 years in prison and a fine of 1 million euros ($1.2m).\n\nWith more than 1.5 billion users worldwide, TikTok, owned by China-based ByteDance, has come under fire from governments in Europe and the United States in recent years.\n\nConcerns raised over the platform have included content encouraging suicide, self-harm or an unhealthy body image as well as its potential use for foreign political interference.\n\nA TikTok spokesman told the French news agency AFP in September that the company “categorically rejects the deceptive presentation” by French MPs, saying it was being made a “scapegoat” for broader societal issues."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yl1y5gep8o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"01:12:04.198+00:00","title":"Why trying too hard may be holding you back at work","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores how perfectionism—often viewed positively—can become a psychological burden in the workplace, leading to anxiety, procrastination, and burnout.

It's one of the most common answers used in a job interview to spin the dreaded \"What's your weakness?\" into a humblebrag.\n\nFor many, it's about striving for excellence or working tirelessly to reach the highest standard.\n\nBut what happens when these high (and sometimes unrelenting) expectations of yourself are exactly what's holding you back?\n\n\"I know perfectionism is an illusion, but I am always trying to chase it,\" admits 25-year-old Aswan.\n\nEven in the workplace, she feels the pressure, \"I know that I can make a mistake and I won't lose my job, yet I constantly feel like I'm one strike away from being fired\".\n\nIt's an anxiety shared by many perfectionists, says health psychologist Dr Sula Windgassen. Speaking on  the BBC Sounds podcast Complex with Kimberley Wilson , she explains: \"Poor self-esteem tends to go hand in hand with perfectionism because there is this fear of failing\".\n\nThat fear often fuels procrastination. Aswan remembers taking her driving theory test: \"I got so pent up about passing it first time that when I failed by a couple of points I've never tried to get it back.\" That was almost four years ago.\n\nPerfectionism can be rooted in personality, but childhood experiences, school environments, and parental expectations can also shape what we grow up believing is \"good enough\".\n\nWhile perfectionism isn't a clinical diagnosis, its effects are very real - from anxiety and tiredness to stress-related physical symptoms such as a weakened immune system.\n\nStill, experts say the cycle can be broken. Dr Windgassen suggests beginning what's known in psychology as a behavioural experiment.\n\nIt starts by asking yourself what you think will happen if the outcome isn't perfect - writing down your predictions, and then testing them in real time.\n\nWas the outcome as bad as you expected? And what positive things came from this new approach? It might be that you manage to go to sleep at 10pm rather than 1am, leaving you feeling more refreshed.\n\nFor 26-year-old Dayna, who describes herself as a \"former perfectionist\",   it's a trait she is relieved to have left behind. She once sacrificed her wellbeing in pursuit of flawless results and it's something she never wants to repeat.\n\n\"I kept a journal to gain more self-awareness about my tendencies and read self-help books,\" says Dayna.\n\n\"I had to learn the hard way how to develop coping mechanisms and strategies to not sacrifice everything and that being a perfectionist is not a noble quality as I used to think it might be.\"\n\nAt times, her harsh inner critic took over and eventually the path to perfectionism led to burnout.\n\nLooking back, Dayna remembers feeling chronically anxious and stressed.\n\n\"Right now I have become content with just trying my best and accepting that I can't always get the outcome I want but the outcome I get will be more than good enough and I am at peace with that now.\"\n\nNot all perfectionism is necessarily harmful. One form, known as perfectionistic striving, focuses on setting more ambitious personal goals. When these goals can be adapted in response to changing circumstances, they tend to cause less stress and lead to more positive outcomes. For example, an athlete setting tough goals, but cutting back on training when they're injured.\n\nBut it still has its limitations. A research paper published in July 2025 by the British Psychological Society found that aiming for excessively high goals often leads to long working hours, with only marginal gains in performance.\n\nWorking through these perfectionistic tendencies can be uncomfortable, says Dr Windgassen - but that discomfort is part of the process.\n\n\"That's not a sign that you shouldn't do it - it's a sign that you should,\" she says."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2kpkq90ygno","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"02:03:14.913+00:00","title":"Paris court blocks auction of earliest-known calculator","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Paris court has provisionally blocked the planned auction of La Pascaline, the world’s first known calculating machine developed by Blaise Pascal in 1642, after legal challenges from heritage experts raised concerns about its export.

“elimination” status, which, by default, has caused the overall Americas region to lose its status as well.\n\nIn a statement issued on Monday, the country’s Public Health Agency stated that Canada was experiencing a “large, multi-jurisdictional outbreak of measles” which began in October last year.\n\nOver the past year, the agency has recorded cases in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, Saskatchewan and the Northwest Territories. Overall, 5,000 positive cases of the illness and the deaths of two premature babies have been reported.\n\n“Canada can re-establish its measles elimination status once transmission of the measles strain associated with the current outbreak is interrupted for at least 12 months,” the agency said.\n\nBut Antony Black, a senior lecturer in life sciences at the University of Westminster in England, told Al Jazeera that Canada’s loss of its elimination status represented a “major backwards step on the path towards the control of this highly infectious and serious disease”.\n\nHere’s what we know about the loss of the elimination status:\n\nIt is a highly infectious virus which can be life-threatening if not caught early.\n\nThe illness, which is spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes, begins with cold-like symptoms, including a runny nose, high temperature and sore, red eyes.\n\nA few days after infection, small white spots can appear inside the cheeks and on the back of the lips. A rash then begins on the face and behind the ears before spreading across the body – the main telltale sign of the illness, according to information from NHS England.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, measles can cause pneumonia and become life-threatening. Babies and anyone with a weakened immune system are most at risk.\n\nMeasles is widely prevented through the use of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine, which is administered in two doses to children at one year old and three years old.\n\nAccording to the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), two doses of the vaccine are 97 percent effective in preventing a measles infection.\n\nThe “elimination” designation, which Canada has had since 1998, indicates that no locally transmitted infections or outbreaks have been reported in the past 12 months. This is no longer the case.\n\nMark Joffe, Alberta’s chief medical officer until earlier this year, blamed low take-up of vaccinations and told the Reuters news agency last month that more could have been done in the country to boost immunisation rates.\n\n“If the vaccination rates were high, this would never have happened. There may have been [some spread], but nothing like this,” Joffe said.\n\nAccording to the WHO and the US CDC, the main reason measles is spreading is that  fewer people are taking up vaccines  across the Americas region generally.\n\nOne contributing factor for low vaccination rates is a growing distrust of healthcare providers following the COVID-19 pandemic, in which anti-vaccine misinformation spread.\n\nAccording to Black, the pandemic became a “major challenge to health systems worldwide” whose facilities were overstretched meaning people missed opportunities to be vaccinated.\n\nVaccine hesitancy has also increased in many places, Black explained.\n\n“Vaccine hesitancy has been around in different forms for over 200 years, but the huge success of the COVID-19 vaccines in curbing the COVID-19 pandemic had given some hope that vaccine hesitancy would diminish. However, that has not happened,” he said.\n\n“Instead, we see the rise of mistrust of vaccines in general. The causes of mistrust are many and complex, but a main reason is the spread of misinformation and disinformation…there now needs to be a push to counteract this mistrust, for example by public health outreach and awareness campaigns, in addition to strengthening Canada’s vaccination registry system to allow better and more targeted interventions,” he added.\n\nOne of the most persistent myths driving MMR vaccine hesitancy was the claim that it causes autism. This belief stemmed from a 1998 study, which has since been discredited and retracted. There is no scientific evidence of any link between the MMR vaccine and autism.\n\nIn some US states and Canadian provinces, exemptions for vaccine mandates – giving non-medical reasons for declining vaccines, such as for personal or religious reasons – are becoming more common. This has led to the existence of clusters of unvaccinated people who are more vulnerable to outbreaks when exposed to the virus.\n\nSome communities, such as the Mennonites – Anabaptist Christians who have communities in the US, Canada and Mexico – have low vaccination rates, as conservative branches of the community do not believe in modern medicine.  Several outbreaks  in the past year have been traced to Mennonite communities.\n\nOverall in Canada, according to public health data, measles immunisation also fell during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, when lockdowns made it harder to access general healthcare, and continued afterwards.\n\nIn 2019, 89.5 percent of children in Canada received their first dose of the MMR vaccine. But by 2023, that figure had dropped to 82.5 percent.\n\nIn the US, during the 2024-2025 school year, 92.7 percent of children received the vaccine, according to the CDC.\n\nIn Mexico, according to World Health Organization (WHO) figures, 79.86 percent of children received the first dose of the MMR vaccine.\n\nAt least 95 percent of a population is required to be vaccinated in order to achieve “herd immunity” against measles. Herd immunity means enough people have been vaccinated to make it too hard for the disease to spread.\n\nExperts say the safest way to maintain herd immunity is through vaccination programmes.\n\nAccording to the WHO, measles vaccination prevented an estimated 31.7 million deaths globally between 2000 and 2020.\n\nThe MMR vaccine, widely used around the world, provides about 97 percent protection against the measles virus, according to public health agencies.\n\nThe vaccine is normally given to children in two stages: The first dose at 12 months and the second at about three years and four months of age (when the child is nearing pre-school age), as part of routine immunisation programmes in countries like  the United Kingdom .\n\nBreakthrough cases in vaccinated people are rare and usually mild.\n\nAccording to the Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO), part of the wider World Health Organization, Canada’s loss of its status means that “the Region of the Americas has lost its verification as free from endemic measles transmission”.\n\nOnce the MMR vaccine was approved for distribution in 1963, healthcare practitioners and school programmes were initiated in Canada, pushing for families to receive immunisation.\n\nBy 1998, Canada had achieved its measles elimination status. Two years later, the US achieved its elimination status, as well.\n\nBy 2016, the Americas region was declared free from measles, which meant that every country in the region had reached elimination status.\n\nFollowing an outbreak in Venezuela and Brazil in 2018, the Americas lost its regional elimination status, only to have it reinstated last year once the outbreak was brought under control.\n\nNow, the Americas region has lost its elimination status once again because of the Canadian outbreak. While many individual countries within the region still have their elimination status, measles cases are on the rise, generally.\n\nAs of November 7, the PAHO said, there were 12,596 cases of measles across the region, with about 95 percent reported in Canada, Mexico and the  United States .\n\nThe PAHO said this was a “30-fold increase compared to 2024″.\n\nTwenty-eight deaths have been recorded: 23 in Mexico, three in the United States, and two in Canada.\n\nJarbas Barbosa, director of PAHO, said the region’s loss of its elimination status was a “setback – but it is also reversible”.\n\n“Until measles is eliminated worldwide, our region will continue to face the risk of reintroduction and spread of the virus among unvaccinated or under-vaccinated populations. However, as we have demonstrated before, with political commitment, regional cooperation, and sustained vaccination, the region can once again interrupt transmission and reclaim this collective achievement,” Barbosa said.\n\nCurrently, active outbreaks are occurring in Mexico, the US, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Belize, which have been “mostly triggered by imported cases”, according to PAHO.\n\nMexico had reported 5,019 measles cases by October 31, according to  data  from PAHO. The cases are concentrated in the northern state of Chihuahua.\n\nJust seven cases were reported in the whole of Mexico last year. A 31-year-old unvaccinated man from Ascension, Chihuahua, died from the disease in early April this year and at least 14 deaths have been reported since then, according to PAHO.\n\nIn the US, since January, a measles outbreak has led to 1,681 confirmed cases, according to the CDC last week.\n\nIn February, it reported its first measles death in a decade after an unvaccinated child fell ill amid an outbreak in Texas. The school-aged child died overnight after being hospitalised in Lubbock, northwest Texas, the state’s health department said.\n\nOf those who have tested positive for the disease, 92 percent were unvaccinated or had unknown  vaccination status .\n\nDemetre Daskalakis, a former CDC official, told Reuters that the US has a deadline of January 20 to prove that it has curbed the outbreak if it is to retain its elimination status.\n\nYes. In late 2023 and early 2024, there was a surge in measles cases in the UK, particularly in England.\n\nIn 2024 as a whole, there were 2,911 laboratory-confirmed measles cases in England, the highest number of cases recorded in a year, since 2012, according to the UK Health Security Agency.\n\nIn comparison, there were only two confirmed cases of measles across the whole of the UK in 2021 and 54 one year later.\n\nThere was another surge in cases in April 2025 – particularly in London and the northwest of the country – the agency said, but cases have since been declining. In 2025 so far, there have been 811 confirmed measles cases in England.\n\nWestern Australia, where 54 cases of measles have been recorded since the start of this year, is currently experiencing its worst outbreak of measles since 1997, according to Australian media."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8jrjr4wrr2o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"10:12:36.100+00:00","title":"Woman jailed for 20 years over murder of Australian surfer brothers in Mexico","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 23-year-old woman, Ari Gisell, has been sentenced to 20 years in prison for instigating the murder of three tourists — Australian brothers Jake and Callum Robinson and American friend Carter Rhoad — during a carjacking in Baja California, Mexico in April 2024.

of $12m golden toilet\n\nA gold toilet that fetched $12.1m (£9.3m) at auction was bought by Ripley's Believe It or Not!, after its first casting was stolen from Blenheim Palace in 2019.\n\nAmerica, created by Italian conceptual artist Maurizio Cattelan, is a fully functional toilet, made   from more than 15st 13lb (101.2kg) of solid 18-carat gold.\n\nThe first version of the work was initially installed in a public bathroom at the  Guggenheim museum in New York in 2016 but hit the news again three years later when a  gang of thieves stole it from the Oxfordshire palace .\n\nThe existence of a second golden toilet was later revealed, and went under the hammer at Sotheby's in New York City on Tuesday. The 101 kg toilet received just one bid.\n\nThe auction house said that in a world first, the starting bid would be determined by the exact price of its weight in gold, at about $10m (£7.6m).\n\nWhile it only said it was bought by a famous American brand, Ripley's Believe It or Not! later revealed themselves as the mystery buyer in an  Instagram post , writing \"we're flush with excitement\".\n\nThe entertainment company runs attractions including museums of oddities and aquariums around the world.\n\nIt made headlines in 2022 for allowing celebrity and entrepreneur Kim Kardashian to  wear a dress owned by Marilyn Monroe to the Met Gala .\n\nNow, their team say they are \"exploring possibilities\" as to whether guests will ever be permitted to \"take the ultimate golden seat\".\n\n\"Such an opportunity requires serious planning and someone brave enough to ensure everything keeps flowing in the right direction,\" Ripley's added.\n\nThe artwork achieved the second highest price for a Cattelan piece at auction. His sculpture of  a kneeling Hitler  sold for $17.2m (£11.9m) in 2016.\n\nIt is estimated more than 100,000 people used the first toilet while it was at the Guggenheim before it was moved and exhibited at Blenheim Palace.\n\nIt was there that in the early hours of 14 September 2019,  five men smashed their way in , ripped out the £4.8m solid gold installation and fled in a stolen Volkswagen Golf.\n\nThe heist and the trial that followed made news across the world.\n\nJames Sheen, 40, from Oxford, pleaded guilty to burglary and transferring criminal property in 2024. Michael Jones, 39, from Oxford, was found guilty of burglary in March. Both were  both jailed earlier this year .\n\nFred Doe, 36, from Windsor, was also convicted of conspiracy to transfer criminal property and given a suspended sentence.\n\nSotheby's revealed that Cattelan created three toilets in 2016, with the second version on display in a bathroom at New York's Breuer Building until it went under the hammer.\n\nThe auction house described it as a \"cultural phenomenon\" and an \"incisive commentary on the collision of artistic production and commodity value\".\n\nDavid Galperin, head of contemporary art at Sotheby's New York, called it Cattelan's \"tour de force\".\n\n\"Holding both a proverbial and literal mirror to the art world, the work confronts the most uncomfortable questions about art, and the belief systems held sacred to the institutions of the market and the museum,\" he said.\n\nOn the same evening a portrait by the Austrian artist Gustav Klimt  was sold for $236.4m (£179m) , making it the second most expensive piece ever sold at auction.\n\nYou can follow  BBC Oxfordshire  on  Facebook ,  X (Twitter) , or  Instagram ."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq50nvq8znvo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"10:53:21.069+00:00","title":"When will the Epstein files be released now that the Senate has agreed to make them public?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In November 2025, President Donald Trump signed a bipartisan legislative bill passed by both the House and Senate, mandating the U.S. Justice Department to release all files from its investigation into Jeffrey Epstein within 30 days in a searchable and downloadable format.

Epstein files be released now that the Senate has agreed to make them public?\n\nUS President Donald Trump has signed a bill ordering the justice department to release all its files from its investigation into convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe legislation, which calls for the release of the files \"in a searchable and downloadable format\" within 30 days, was approved overwhelmingly in both chambers of Congress, the House of Representatives and Senate, on Tuesday.\n\nTrump then announced on his Truth Social platform that he had signed it on Wednesday, starting the clock on release of the files.\n\nUnder pressure from Epstein's victims and rank-and-file Republicans, Trump on Sunday made a major reversal in his stance on the files and gave his blessing to passing the legislation. For months, he had resisted unsealing many documents from the federal investigation into the late financier.\n\nCongress' lower chamber began debating the measure on Tuesday morning and voted within hours. Several of Epstein's victims spent the day on Capitol Hill advocating for the bill's passage.\n\nNearly all the House lawmakers voted in favour of the resolution, which passed  427-1. Clay Higgins, a Louisiana Republican, was the only lawmaker who voted against the bill. Two Republicans and three Democrats did not vote. The Senate then passed the resolution.\n\nThe House Oversight Committee has already  made public thousands of documents  from the Epstein estate relating to the late financier, but the resolution covers material currently in the possession of the justice department.\n\nThose records could, in theory, include files about imprisoned Epstein co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell, as well as figures - including government officials - mentioned in the case. It could also include internal justice department documents.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the Senate confirmed that it had passed the Epstein bill and sent it to Trump.\n\nLater that evening, Trump posted on social media that he had signed it into law.\n\nWhile the press and others are often invited to witness Trump's bill-signings, this was done out of public view, and the announcement was included in a long post that also blasted Democrats he claimed were tied to Epstein, touted the president's record during this second term, and addressed the two impeachment trials of his first term.\n\n\"Perhaps the truth about these Democrats, and their associations with Jeffrey Epstein, will soon be revealed, because I HAVE JUST SIGNED THE BILL TO RELEASE THE EPSTEIN FILES!\" he wrote.\n\nHe added that because he had asked Republican lawmakers to support the measure \"the votes were almost unanimous in favor of passage.\"\n\nThe justice department now has 30 days to release its materials on Epstein.\n\nBut there are obstacles to the files being shared.\n\nThe House bill said the justice department can hold back any documents that \"jeapordise an active federal investigation or ongoing prosecution, provided that such withholding is narrowly tailored and temporary\".\n\nThat could potentially lead to delays, given that Trump has called for investigations into Epstein's links with prominent Democrats, such as Bill Clinton  and Larry Summers , \"to determine what was going on with them, and him\".\n\nClinton has strongly denied he had any knowledge of Epstein's crimes, whereas Summers has apologised for his \"misguided decision\" to continue communicating with Epstein until 2019.\n\n\"That's a potential hurdle,\" Jonathan Entin, a constitutional law professor at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio, told the BBC.\n\n\"If, in fact, this is a serious investigation, presumably the prosecutors will not want everything out there while they're sorting out whether they bring charges.\"\n\nFor those who have campaigned for the release of the files, anything short of full disclosure is likely to spark further questions and even outrage.\n\nSeveral Republican lawmakers have expressed worries that Trump's order to the justice department to investigate Epstein's ties could slow the release of the files.\n\nThomas Massie, a Kentucky congressman, vowed that he and fellow Republican dissident Marjorie Taylor Greene, of Georgia, would \"absolutely\" go to the floor of the House and read out the names of \"some of the men\" in the files if the records were not duly released by the justice department.\n\nIn addition to possible delays, the public is also likely to see lots of redactions in any release of new Epstein documents.\n\nIn the tranche of files released by the House Oversight Committee last week, names and phone numbers were frequently blacked out to protect privacy.\n\nThe latest bill says the attorney general can \"withhold or redact\" records that include victims' names, medical files and other personal information that \"would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\".\n\n\"Simply letting anything out could reveal a lot of private information that's not relevant or appropriate for public consumption,\" Prof Entin said.\n\nThe attorney general can also withhold classified material and images of sexual abuse.\n\nThe justice department has already said that a \"large volume\" of its 300 gigabytes of data from Epstein investigations includes images and videos of minors and thousands of downloaded videos and images of child sex abuse.\n\nOther information in the documents could be protected by grand jury secrecy rules, which the latest bill does not explicitly address.\n\nUS Attorney General Pam Bondi said on Wednesday morning when asked about the Epstein files during an unrelated news conference: \"We'll continue to follow the law with maximum transparency, while protecting victims.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c78zy20ydlmo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"00:12:50.970+00:00","title":"The private notes and secret documents that tell the inside story of the UK's Covid response","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article details key private documents and communications from the UK's response to the Covid-19 pandemic, revealing the political, scientific, and emotional turbulence behind major decisions.

the UK's Covid response\n\nIt was the most momentous event in UK history since World War Two. As a new virus took hold, millions of us were told to stay at home and billions of pounds were spent propping up the country's economy.\n\nThe Covid inquiry will publish its second set of findings on Thursday, looking in detail at the huge political choices made at the time - including how lockdowns were introduced, the closure of businesses and schools, and bringing in previously unthinkable social restrictions.\n\n\"Did the government serve the people well, or did it fail them?\" asked the lead counsel at the start of this part of the inquiry in 2023. Since then more than 7,000 documents have been made public from the time, including WhatsApp chats and emails, private diaries and confidential files.\n\nHere, BBC News has picked out some of the urgent messages and scribbled notes that shine a light on how critical decisions were taken in 2020.\n\nOn 2 January 2020  an update appears on ProMed , a service used by health workers to warn of emerging diseases.\n\n\"World Health Organization in touch with Beijing after mystery viral pneumonia outbreak,\" it says.\n\n\"Twenty-seven people - most of them stallholders at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market - treated in hospital.\"\n\nThe next day England's deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van Tam, sends the bulletin on to Peter Horby, a professor at Oxford University and chair of Nervtag, a group that advises the government on new viral threats.\n\nBy the end of January, it's clear the health authorities in Wuhan have a major problem on their hands.\n\nThe deputy ambassador to China, Christina Scott,  sends a cable back to London marked DIPTEL BEJING (Sensitive)  comparing the situation to the outbreak of another virus - SARS - in 2003.\n\n\"Hubei province on lockdown; multiple cities have transport restrictions.

But the challenge of doing so is substantial.\"\n\nThe virus spreads to Thailand and South Korea and then to Iran and northern Italy.\n\nAt lunchtime on Saturday 7 March the UK's then prime minister, Boris Johnson, is  chatting on WhatsApp to his health secretary Matt Hancock  ahead of the England vs Wales game at Twickenham.\n\nDays later, the Cheltenham horse racing festival goes ahead and Atletico Madrid fans are allowed to fly from Spain to Liverpool to watch their team play in the Champions League.\n\nThe government's strategy, backed by its scientific advisers, is to try to contain early outbreaks by isolating those with the virus and tracing any contacts.\n\nThe plan is then to move to a \"delay phase\" as full community transmission is established – using policies like home isolation advice for those with symptoms to \"flatten the curve\" of the pandemic so that hospitals do not become overwhelmed.\n\nBut the virus is spreading much faster than expected and it‘s quickly becoming clear to many scientists that far stronger action will be needed.\n\nOn Friday 13 March, two senior No 10 officials are sitting in a key meeting of scientific advisers in Whitehall.\n\n\"WE ARE NOT READY,\"  one writes in capital letters in his notepad . The other leans over and crosses out \"NOT READY\", replacing it with an expletive.\n\nThat weekend, the prime minister's chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, is locked in a series of meetings with the PM and a handful of select staff as a new strategy takes shape.\n\nGrainy smartphone images show whiteboards in No 10  full of hand-drawn charts  and  scrawled bullet points .\n\nOne graph suggests that, if the virus was allowed to run its course without any restrictions in place, then more than 100,000 people would die \"in [hospital] corridors\" in the coming wave.\n\nOn Sunday 15 March, Cummings  sends a WhatsApp to Johnson :\n\n\"FYI – [Patrick] Vallance [the chief scientific adviser] is on board with what will NEVER be discussed as Plan B.\"\n\n\"[In a] nutshell: we move through the gears to [do] whatever we need to stop NHS collapse and buy time to increase capacity.\"\n\nOver the following week, Covid rules across the UK are tightened.\n\nPeople are advised, but not legally required, to avoid all non-essential contact and work from home where possible. Then schools are closed, followed by pubs, restaurants, gyms and cinemas.\n\nBut still there are concerns that even those measures are not strong enough. On Sunday 22 March, London's mayor, Sadiq Khan,  writes a private letter to Johnson .\n\nThe next evening, in a televised address watched by 27 million people, the prime minister tells the public they must stay at home as he announces the first national lockdown.\n\nIt will now be up to the inquiry to decide if making that call earlier could have saved lives and ultimately reduced the total time that people had to stay locked indoors.\n\nOver the next month some hospitals do come under severe pressure with intensive care units spilling into corridors and side rooms. Pre-planned or elective care is put on hold but at no point does the NHS have to turn away emergency patients.\n\nCovid infections, hospitalisations and deaths start to fall.\n\nBut the cost of lockdown restrictions is huge: education is disrupted, loneliness and mental health problems get worse, and jobs and businesses are impacted.\n\nOn 22 May, Johnson  sends a handwritten note to his officials  asking for a plan to \"start operation BOUNCEBACK\".\n\nThat month some restrictions begin to be lifted – soon groups of six are able to meet outdoors and schools start a phased re-opening.\n\nIn the summer, then-chancellor Rishi Sunak tries to boost the economy with his Eat Out to Help Out scheme - 50% off food and drinks for three days a week in August.\n\nThe idea is well received by the hospitality industry but there are concerns about the health impact.\n\nOn WhatsApp (with spelling mistakes), Hancock warns Simon Case, then the most senior civil servant in Downing Street, that it's  causing problems in intervention areas  - that’s those local authorities with the highest infection rates.\n\nIn his evidence to the inquiry,  Sunak plays down a link between his scheme and the spread of the virus  saying a second wave \"happened in every other country in Europe\".\n\nBut that tension – between controlling Covid and protecting the economy – becomes even more intense through the autumn.\n\nMany scientists advising the government want to see tighter rules. They campaign for a short \"circuit breaker\" lockdown to try to drive down infections.\n\nAt times the documents suggest the prime minister supports tougher restrictions, at others he appears determined to avoid another strict national lockdown at all costs.\n\nOn WhatsApp  Johnson's closest aides complain about his decision-making  – using an emoji of a broken trolley as he appears to swerve from one policy position to another.\n\n\"This government doesn't have the credibility needed to be imposing stuff within only days of deciding not to,\" writes Case, who is now the new cabinet secretary, to Cummings and Lee Cain, No 10 director of communications, on 14 October.\n\n\"We look like a terrible, tragic joke. If we were going hard, that decision was needed weeks ago. I cannot cope with this.\"\n\nIn his testimony to the inquiry, Case later says he regrets expressing his \"at-the-moment frustrations\" with Johnson, whom he \"barely knew\" at the time.\n\nIn his evidence, Johnson defends his own leadership style, saying his views changed with the scientific evidence, and he often adopted certain positions because he wanted to hear the counter arguments.\n\nAs the nights draw in that autumn, it becomes clear that existing restrictions in England - including a 10pm curfew and the so-called tiered system of local controls - are not going to be enough to control the virus.\n\nBy the end of October, the prime minister's frustration is obvious in the long note he  scrawls at the end of a Covid briefing document  marked OFFICIAL/SENSITIVE.\n\nIn tightly spaced handwriting, Johnson pens 22 detailed points over two A4 pages of the document.\n\nHe approves of strengthening some local restrictions but bemoans the \"terrible cost\" and wonders \"for HOW LONG?\"\n\n\"Is NHS T&T [test and trace] actually achieving ANYTHING?\" he asks at one point.\n\nA week later, on 5 November 2020, England does enter its second national lockdown, this time lasting four weeks, although most schools remain open.\n\nBy this point many decisions are being taken independently by the four nations of the UK. Both Wales and Northern Ireland put in place versions of a circuit breaker lockdown, while in Scotland stricter rules are imposed in the central belt.\n\nThe plan is still to allow families and friends to meet up at Christmas.\n\nBut by mid-December a new, more infectious variant of the virus is spreading and millions living in the south-east of England are told at short notice that Christmas mixing will be cancelled.\n\nIn January 2021, a third and final full national lockdown follows across the UK, as the winter wave peaks and the NHS starts rolling out millions of doses of the first Covid vaccines.\n\nFive years on from those dramatic 12 months, the inquiry's findings are long-awaited, particularly by the 235,000 families who lost loved ones in the pandemic.\n\nThe messages and documents highlighted here are just a snapshot - the report due later will run to around 800 pages.\n\nIt will examine some of the key questions in much more detail: the timing of lockdowns, the impact of restrictions on the most vulnerable, and public confidence in the rules amid reports of partying in Downing Street and other alleged rule breaches.\n\nGroups representing thousands of bereaved families want individuals working in government at the time to be held to account for any pandemic failings.\n\nBut - above all - they want the state to learn lessons from any mistakes and be better prepared if and when the next unknown virus arrives on our shores.\n\nSome documents in this article have been recreated.

godfather Yann LeCun to leave Meta and start own firm\n\nJust a couple of weeks ago, one of the \"godfathers\" of artificial intelligence was in St James's Palace being handed  an award from King Charles  for his work in artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nProfessor Yann LeCun was being honoured along with six other recipients for his contributions to the field, which have been credited as advancing deep learning.\n\nBut Mr LeCun is at odds with some of the AI world over the future of the generation-defining technology.\n\nAnd now he is going all-in on his idea of \"advanced machine intelligence\" after announcing he is leaving his role as Meta's chief AI scientist to start a new firm.\n\nDuring his 12 years at the company, Prof LeCun  won the prestigious Turing Award  and witnessed several flurries of excitement around AI - not least the most recent boom in generative AI accelerated by rival OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT in late 2022.\n\nBut his departure comes amid speculation the AI boom could meet an abrupt end should the so-called \"AI bubble\" of ballooning valuations and soaring spending burst.\n\nInvestors, analysts and  even big tech bosses like Google's chief executive Sundar Pichai  have said a market correction to the AI sector would ripple across the wider economy.\n\nProf LeCun announced his planned departure from Meta on Wednesday after more than a week of rumours and reports of his exit.\n\nIn a series of posts on Threads, he thanked the company's founder Mark Zuckerberg and highlighted its Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) lab as his \"proudest non-technical accomplishment\".\n\n\"As many of you have heard through rumours or recent media articles, I am planning to leave Meta after 12 years: 5 years as founding director of FAIR and 7 years as Chief AI Scientist,\" he  wrote .\n\n\"The impact of FAIR on the company, on the field of AI, on the tech community, and on the wider world has been spectacular.\"\n\nThe lab has over the years focused on developing systems and techniques to advance machine learning and translation.\n\nBut, like large parts of the sector, Meta has looked to concentrate much of the company's research and spending on large language models (LLMs) - the systems at the heart of generative AI tools such as chatbots and image generators.\n\nProf LeCun has suggested LLMs will be less useful in attempting to create AI systems that can match human intelligence.\n\nInstead, he wants to pursue what he called \"advanced machine intelligence\".\n\nIt trains AI models primarily by using visual learning - trying to replicate how a child or a baby animal learns.\n\nThat differs to LLMs, which are fed vast amounts of existing data, and then asked to generate a result based on the data and a prompt.\n\nProf LeCun will still have a relationship with Meta once he sets up his new company,  he said -  adding in posts about his departure  it would be a partner of his new firm.\n\nBut reports suggest he has been increasingly moving away from the approach the company wants to take.\n\nUnlike his fellow AI godfathers Geoffrey Hinton and Yoshua Bengio, Prof LeCun has cast doubt on the idea AI might pose an existential threat to humanity.\n\nIn 2023, he called such fears \"preposterously ridiculous\".\n\n\"Will AI take over the world? No, this is a projection of human nature on machines,\"  he told the BBC .\n\nBut some have also questioned Prof LeCun's characterisation as an outlier or visionary in the industry.\n\n\"Yann LeCun has, without a doubt made genuine contributions to AI, and I am pleased to see him speak out again the limits on LLMs,\" said AI expert and professor Gary Marcus  in a recent blog .\n\n\"But he has also systematically dismissed and ignored the work of others for years,\" he added, including himself among those whose work he suggested Prof LeCun had often overlooked.\n\nSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter  to follow the world's top tech stories and trends.

weeks on the US job market is out, and it showed a surprising pick-up in hiring after a lacklustre summer.\n\nEmployers added 119,000 jobs in September,   more than double what many analysts had expected, but the unemployment rate ticked up from 4.3% to 4.4%, the Labor Department figures showed.\n\nThe US government shutdown, which ended last week after more than a month, had delayed publication of the figures for nearly seven weeks, leaving policymakers guessing about the state of the job market at a delicate moment.\n\nJob growth has still barely budged since April, raising pressure on the central bank to cut interest rates to support the economy.\n\nBut policymakers at the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, have been divided about the need for further interest rate cuts. In addition to the health of the job market, they are also monitoring price inflation that ticked up to 3% in September, above the 2% rate the bank wants to see.\n\nLooming over the debate are questions like whether artificial intelligence (AI) will dampen demand for workers over the long term and how a crackdown on immigration is changing labour supply and demand.\n\nBusinesses are also wrestling with cutbacks to government spending, new tariff costs and uncertain consumer demand.\n\nA private report this month by outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas found the number of job cuts in October hit the highest number for the month since 2003, as high-profile companies including   Amazon, Target and UPS announced reductions.\n\nThe announcements have raised concerns about cracks in what has been seen as a \"low-hire, low-fire\" job market.\n\nBut evidence of wider deterioration has been elusive, as claims for unemployment benefits remain stable.\n\nHealth care firms, restaurants and bars led the job gains in September, while transportation and warehousing firms, manufacturers and the government shed jobs.\n\n\"The September jobs report may be backward looking but offers reassurance that the labour market wasn't crumbling before the government shutdown,\" said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead economist at Oxford Economics.\n\nHowever, she noted noting that the data from October is likely to be weaker, due to government layoffs.\n\nLimited hiring has already prompted the ranks of people without work more than six months to swell this year, though their numbers dipped a bit in September.\n\nUnusually, the strains have been particularly pronounced among those with college degrees. The unemployment rate for that group rose to 2.8% in September, up from from 2.3% a year earlier.\n\n\"It's been pretty challenging,\" said Mason Leposavic, who has applied to thousands of jobs since graduating in May 2024 from the Rochester Institute of Technology.\n\nWhile the 24-year-old did eventually find part-time work as a bartender, he has failed to find the kind of office role he hoped for in sales, tech or similar sectors.\n\nHe said the search had been dispiriting - especially when he saw firms repeatedly re-post openings he had been rejected from for lack of experience - and he was not optimistic it would improve soon.\n\nHe is now without work again after switching states to move back in with his mother in Arizona in an attempt to save money.\n\n\"I didn't realise how hard it would be,\" he said. \"I think everything really changed after AI, especially in the tech industry.\"\n\nInformation about the situation has been clouded by the government shutdown, which has limited incoming economic data in recent weeks.\n\nThursday's report is the last official release on the job market before the Fed's next meeting in December.\n\nWhile September's job gains were stronger than expected, the report also showed job growth in July and August was lower than previously estimated. The US added just 72,000 jobs in July and shed 4,000 positions in August.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics will publish its next report on the November job market in mid-December, leaving a gap in some data for October.\n\nAnalysts said the inconclusive nature of the latest figures was likely to bolster the case for the Fed to move cautiously and hold off on cutting in December.\n\n\"The Federal Reserve is still driving in a fog,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist for B Riley Wealth.  \"As Chair Powell said – 'When you are driving in a fog, you slow down.'\"\n\nExecutives from companies such as McDonald's, Coca-Cola and Chipotle have warned in recent weeks that lower-income households are tightening spending as rising prices put pressure on their budgets and confidence in the job market sinks.\n\nBut a strong stock market, bolstered by upbeat reports from many companies,   has helped to sustain higher earners.\n\nThe Fed has cut its key interest rate twice since September, leaving it in a range of 3.75%-4%, its lowest level in three years.\n\nBut Fed chairman Jerome Powell warned last month that another reduction was \"far from\" a foregone conclusion in December.\n\nAt the time he offered reassurance about the job market, saying the mix of data suggested \"that you're seeing maybe continued very gradual cooling, but nothing more than that\"."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgmgddyjl0o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"13:21:10.762+00:00","title":"Trump to meet incoming New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Zohran Mamdani, the newly elected mayor of New York City, is set to meet President Donald Trump at the White House on Friday, marking a rare and symbolic direct engagement between a sitting U.S. president and an incoming mayor.

'AI bubble' concerns\n\nChip giant Nvidia has reported stronger-than-expected revenues, easing investor concerns about heavy artificial intelligence (AI) spending that have unsettled markets.\n\nThe company said revenue for the three months to October jumped 62% to $57bn, driven by demand for its chips used in AI data centres. Sales from that division rose 66% to more than $51bn.\n\nFourth-quarter sales forecasts in the range of $65bn also topped estimates, sending shares in Nvidia about 4% higher in after-hours trading.\n\n\"There's been a lot of talk about an AI bubble. From our vantage point, we see something very different,\" said chief executive Jensen Huang.\n\nIn a statement, Mr Huang said sales of its AI Blackwell systems were \"off the charts\" and that \"cloud GPUs [graphics processing units] are sold out\".\n\n\"We excel at every phase of AI.\"\n\nNvidia, the world's most valuable company, makes chips that are crucial for AI data centres and is seen as a bellwether for the AI boom.\n\nIts latest results were under even more attention than usual on Wall Street amid mounting concern that AI stocks are overvalued - fears that may persist despite the blockbuster results.\n\nThose fears had fuelled four consecutive daily drops in the S&P 500 index leading up to Wednesday, as questions swirl about returns on AI investments. The benchmark index has fallen nearly 3% so far in November.\n\nSome analysts have compared the surge in AI stocks to the dotcom boom of the late 1990s. This saw the values of early internet companies soar amid a wave of optimism over the then-new technology before the bubble burst in early 2000.\n\nThis collapse in share prices led to some companies going bust, and also hit the value of people's savings including their pension funds.\n\nThe bar was high heading into Nvidia's results.\n\nAdam Turnquist, chief technical strategist for LPL Financial, said the question was not whether the company would beat expectations, \"but by how much\".\n\nMatt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"While AI valuations are dominating the news feeds, Nvidia is going about its business in style.\"\n\nHe said valuations for certain areas of the AI sector \"needed to take a breather, but Nvidia is not in that camp\".\n\nMr Huang had previously said he expected $500bn in AI chip orders through next year. Investors were looking for details about when the company expects those revenues will come to fruition, and how it plans to fulfill the orders.\n\nColette Kress, Nvidia's chief financial officer, told analysts the company would \"probably\" be taking more orders on top of the $500bn that had already been announced.\n\nBut she also expressed disappointment about regulatory limits that stymie the company's ability to export its chips to China, saying the US \"must win the support of every developer\" including those in China.\n\nShe said Nvidia was \"committed to continued engagement\" with the American and Chinese governments.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday at the US-Saudi Investment Forum in Washington, Mr Huang joined Elon Musk to announce a massive data centre complex in Saudi Arabia that will have Musk's AI company, xAI, as its first customer.\n\nThe facility will be outfitted with hundreds of thousands of Nvidia chips.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported the US Commerce Department has approved the sale of up to 70,000 advanced AI chips to state-backed companies in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, reversing an earlier decision.\n\nThe agreement was brokered following talks between US President Donald Trump and Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Salman, who visited the White House this week.\n\nThe titans of the technology sector are ramping up their spending on AI, as they rush to reap the benefits of a boom that has pushed stocks to record highs.\n\nEarnings reports from Meta, Alphabet and Microsoft last month  reaffirmed the colossal amounts of money  these firms are shelling out for everything from data centres to chips.\n\nSundar Pichai, the head of Google's parent firm Alphabet,  told the BBC  that while the growth of AI investment had been an \"extraordinary moment\", there was some \"irrationality\" in the current AI boom. His comments came amid other warnings from industry leaders.\n\nSimon French, chief economist at Panmure Liberum, said there were some parallels with the dotcom bubble of 25 years ago.\n\n\"The issue is not so much these big cash generative companies like Nvidia, but it's the wider part of the tech ecosystem, quite a lot of which isn't currently profitable,\" he told the BBC's Today programme.\n\nNvidia is at the heart of a web of deals among key players in the AI space such as OpenAI, Anthropic and xAI.\n\nThe deals have drawn scrutiny for their circular nature, as AI firms increasingly invest in one another. The agreements include Nvidia's  $100bn investment in OpenAI , the firm behind ChatGPT.\n\nEileen Burbidge, a tech investor and founding partner at Passion Capital, told the Today programme: \"A lot of what is fuelling some of the scepticism or concern about a bubble is that there is seen to be a lot of circular deals going on, whereby Nvidia is committing to invest in a company which in turn is committing to invest in Nvidia or is committing to buy Nvidia chips.\n\n\"So it goes round and round, maybe with one or two other people inside the circle, but yes it is about 10 to 20 companies that all seem to have these deals going back and forth.\"\n\nAdditional reporting by Lily Jamali, North America Technology Correspondent, San Francisco"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgdgrqwnq9o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"11:55:36.825+00:00","title":"US military officials in Kyiv as Europe warns against reported Russia peace plan","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Senior US military officials, led by Army Secretary Dan Driscoll, have arrived in Kyiv to discuss efforts to end the war with Russia, amid reports of a proposed 28-point peace plan drafted by US envoy Steve Witkoff and Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev.

Ukraine to \"discuss efforts to end the war\" with Russia, the US military has said.\n\nThe team, led by US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll, held talks with Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko on Thursday morning. They are expected to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky later in the day.\n\nReports began surfacing on Wednesday that the US and Russia had prepared a new proposed framework to end the war, requiring major concessions from Ukraine including giving up territory and dramatically shrinking its military.\n\nIt was reportedly drafted by President Donald Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff and Russian special envoy Kirill Dmitriev.\n\nNeither Washington nor Moscow have officially confirmed the plan.\n\nHowever, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio wrote on X that achieving a \"durable peace will require both sides to agree to difficult but necessary concessions\".\n\nHe said the US was consulting both sides of the conflict to \"develop a list of potential ideas for ending this war\".\n\nDriscoll's team is the most senior military group to travel to Kyiv since Trump took office in January. He is joined by Army chief of staff Gen Randy George, top US army commander in Europe Gen Chris Donahue, and sergeant major of the army Michael Weimer.\n\nDetails of the draft Witkoff-Dmitriev 28-point plan emerged more than three weeks after the two men are said to have spent three days in meetings in Miami, Florida.\n\nCiting people familiar with the matter, Axios, the Financial Times and Reuters reported that the plans call for Kyiv to give up areas of the Donbas in eastern Ukraine that it still controls, to cut significantly the size of its armed forces, and to forego many of its weapons.\n\nZelensky has repeatedly ruled out any territorial concessions to Russia.\n\nKirill Dmitriev's team declined to comment on the reports. The BBC has also asked the White House and a representative for Witkoff to comment.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday that \"contacts\" had taken place with the US, but no \"consultations or negotiations\" were happening.\n\nNeither European nor Ukrainian officials are believed to have been involved in drafting the new proposal, sparking fears it could be overwhelmingly favourable to Russia.\n\nEU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas warned on Thursday that for any plan to work, it would need to have Ukrainians and Europeans on board, and French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot said \"the Ukrainians do not want any form of capitulation\".\n\nAfter meeting US officials, Ukraine's prime minister did not address the rumoured plan - but said their visit provided \"an opportunity for representatives of the American administration to assess the situation on the ground and see the consequences of Russian aggression\".\n\nReports of the plan emerged on Wednesday, the same day Ukrainian officials said  at least 26 people had been killed in a Russian missile and drone attack on blocks of flats in Ukraine's western city of Ternopil . Another 22 people were missing at the site, Zelensky said on Thursday.\n\nZelensky was in Turkey at the time of the Ternopil attack, and unconfirmed Ukrainian reports suggested that talks had been planned with Trump's envoy in Ankara, but were called off.\n\nThere was no mention of the proposed framework when the US army secretary arrived in Kyiv late on Wednesday. Army spokesman Col David Butler said only that Driscoll and his team were there \"on behalf of the [Trump] administration on a fact-finding mission to meet Ukrainian officials and discuss efforts to end the war\".\n\nA Ukrainian official told CBS, the BBC's US media partner, that talks on the trip would focus on the military situation on the ground - as well as plans for a possible ceasefire.\n\nThe unnamed official said: \"Presidents Zelensky and Trump have already agreed to stop the conflict along the existing lines of engagement, and there are agreements on granting security guarantees\".\n\nAfter talks with the US army secretary on Wednesday, Ukrainian Defence Minister Denys Shmyhal posted on X: \"We focused on the next steps for implementing the historic defence agreements reached by President Zelensky and President Trump.\"\n\nKyiv and its Western allies, including the US, have been calling for an immediate ceasefire along the vast front line, but Moscow has ruled that out, repeating demands that Ukraine says amount to its de facto capitulation.\n\nEarlier this month, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow's pre-conditions for a peace deal - including ceding territory, tough curbs on the size of Ukraine's military and the country's neutrality - had not changed since Putin laid them out in 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, a White House official confirmed to the BBC that special envoy to Ukraine Keith Kellogg would leave his post in January.\n\nHe reportedly decided that this would be a natural end to his time in the post, which requires Senate approval beyond 360 days.\n\nKellogg has been seen as an important advocate for Ukraine in the White House during a time when Trump has often appeared to side with Russia in the conflict."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgzge16vkdo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"15:20:12.119+00:00","title":"More than 250 arrested in Charlotte as immigration crackdown escalates","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"More than 250 people were arrested in Charlotte, North Carolina, under a federal immigration crackdown dubbed 'Operation Charlotte's Web,' which is part of President Donald Trump’s broader strategy to target undocumented immigrants.

However, it can withhold files that relate to active criminal investigations or are deemed to invade personal privacy.\n\nIn a major reversal, Trump dropped his opposition to the measure last weekend,  after pushback from Epstein's victims and members of his own Republican Party.\n\nWith his support, the resolution overwhelmingly cleared both chambers of Congress.\n\nUntil recently, Trump had dismissed the need to release the documents, calling it a Democrat-led \"hoax\" to \"deflect\" attention away from his party's work. That position was itself a change from the stance he took ahead of the 2024 election.\n\n\"Perhaps the truth about these Democrats, and their associations with Jeffrey Epstein, will soon be revealed, because I HAVE JUST SIGNED THE BILL TO RELEASE THE EPSTEIN FILES!\" he wrote.\n\nAlthough a congressional vote was not required to release the files - Trump could have ordered the release on his own - lawmakers in the House passed the legislation with a 427-1 vote. The Senate gave unanimous consent to pass it upon its arrival, sending the bill to Trump for his signature.\n\nThe lone vote against the resolution in the House, the lower chamber, was cast by Louisiana Republican Clay Higgins, who objected to the scope of information that could be released. He said it could reveal and threaten \"thousands of innocent people\" who may have talked to investigators about allegations against Epstein.\n\nUnder the law now signed by Trump, Attorney General Pam Bondi must release the documents within 30 days.\n\nThe files subject to release are from criminal investigations into Epstein, including transcripts of interviews with victims and witnesses, and items seized in raids of his properties. Those materials include internal justice department communications, flight logs, and people and entities connected to the late financier.\n\nBut there are exceptions.\n\nThe resolution allows the justice department to withhold any documents related to criminal investigations. After the estate documents were released last week, Trump said he would ask Bondi to investigate Epstein's ties to people who had apparently communicated with him. Bondi promptly said the justice department \"will pursue this with urgency and integrity\".\n\nOne of the bill's architects, Republican Congressman Thomas Massie, said he had worries that the move would lead to some federal files being withheld.\n\n\"I'm concerned that [Trump is] opening a flurry of investigations, and I believe they may be trying to use those investigations as a predicate for not releasing the files. That's my concern,\" he said.\n\nBondi can also withhold information that may identify victims, leading many to speculate that parts of the files will be redacted - although it remains unclear how heavy the redacting could be.\n\nTrump had promised during his 2024 presidential campaign to make the files public, and early in the year his administration released thousands of pages of documents from the Epstein investigation, mostly flight logs. While Trump said more documents were coming, Bondi later announced in July there would be no further releases.\n\nThat prompted lawmakers from both parties to introduce the resolution compelling the files' release. One of the resolution's key proponents was Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, one of Trump's fiercest political allies. She has publicly fought with Trump in recent weeks, as the US president maintained his opposition to the resolution up to a few days before the vote.\n\nAfter the resolution passed, Greene posted to say that she would read the name of any powerful person implicated in any released files aloud on the House floor.\n\nThe anticipated files are different to the more than 20,000 pages of documents from Epstein's estate released by Congress last week, including some that mention Trump.\n\nThose include 2018 messages from Epstein in which he said of Trump: \"I am the one able to take him down\" and \"I know how dirty donald is\".\n\nTrump was a friend of Epstein's for years, but the president has said they fell out in the early 2000s, years before Epstein was first arrested. Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Monday night, Trump said Republicans had \"nothing to do with Epstein\".\n\n\"It's really a Democrat problem,\" he said. \"The Democrats were Epstein's friends, all of them.\"\n\nThe family of Virginia Giuffre, who  died by suicide earlier this year , said in a statement Trump signing the bill was \"nothing short of monumental\", for Giuffre and other survivors.\n\n\"As we look towards the next chapter, we remain vigilant. This work is not finished. Every name must be revealed, regardless of power, wealth, or party affiliation,\" her brother and sister-in-law, Sky and Amanda Roberts, said.\n\nEpstein was found dead in 2019 in his New York prison cell in what a coroner ruled was a suicide. He was being held on charges of sex trafficking. He had been convicted previously of soliciting prostitution from a minor in 2008.\n\nThe once high-flying financier had ties with a number of high-profile figures, including Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, the brother of King Charles and former prince; Trump; Trump's former advisor Steve Bannon; and a cast of other characters from the world of media, politics and entertainment.\n\nOn Wednesday, former Harvard president  Larry Summers took a leave  from teaching at the university while the school investigated his links to Epstein, revealed in a series of chummy email exchanges."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70901djjw8o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"13:20:19.115+00:00","title":"Police arrest alleged mastermind of Mexican mayor's murder","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In November 2025, Mexican police arrested Jorge Amando, known as 'The Graduate', and accused him of being the mastermind behind the assassination of Carlos Manzo, the mayor of Uruapan in Michoacán.

carried out the killing via WhatsApp.\n\nAccording to the official, The Graduate pressured his men to open fire on Manzo even if he was surrounded by people.\n\nThe 40-year-old mayor was attending a Day of the Dead ceremony - which honours deceased family and friends - alongside his relatives when he was shot seven times, sending bystanders running for cover.\n\nManzo had spoken out publicly about how avocado growers in the region were being extorted and threatened by criminal groups.\n\nHe had also demanded that Mexico's federal government, led by President Claudia Sheinbaum, do more to rein in cartels who hold sway in much of the state.\n\nThe Jalisco New Generation Cartel, which Mexico's security minister blamed for the attack on Manzo, engages in drug trafficking as well as kidnapping for ransom and extortion.\n\nIt is also infamous for targeting public officials who refuse to do its bidding.\n\nWhile the CJNG is thought to be the most powerful of the criminal gangs operating in Michoacán, there are many others and their fights for control of drug, arms and fuel smuggling routes often result in deadly confrontations.\n\nThe assassination of Manzo triggered mass protests.\n\nAt one large rally in Mexico City last weekend, many of the protesters carried placards with the photo of the mayor, while other held up banners reading \"we are all Carlos Manzo\".\n\nSome of the protesters clashed with police in Mexico's central Zócalo square."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8r08zmkjlzo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"00:46:01.888+00:00","title":"Ukraine: Teenage saboteurs paid to attack their

17-year-old travelled 500 miles from his home in eastern Ukraine to collect a bomb and a phone hidden in a park in the western city of Rivne.\n\nHe says he was promised $2,000 (£1,520) to plant the bomb in a van used by Ukraine's military conscription service.\n\n\"When I was connecting the wires, I thought it could explode then. I thought I might die,\" he told the BBC.\n\nVlad is one of hundreds of children and older teenagers who the Ukrainian government alleges have been recruited online by Russia, and offered payment to carry out sabotage and other attacks against their own country. His name has been changed to protect his anonymity.\n\nHe says he was told to set up the phone to live-stream the scene to his handler so they could remotely detonate the device when somebody entered the vehicle.\n\nHowever, Ukraine's SBU security service had been watching and foiled the attack. Vlad - now 18 - is awaiting trial on terrorism charges that potentially carry a 12-year prison sentence.\n\nSitting in Rivne's heavily guarded detention centre with his lawyer beside him, he acknowledges that he could have helped kill somebody.\n\n\"I did think about it. But nobody likes conscription officers,\" he says. \"I thought: Well, I'll be like everyone else.\"\n\nThe SBU says that over the last two years more than 800 Ukrainians have been identified as having been recruited by Russia - 240 of them minors, some as young as 11.\n\nHowever, cyber security expert Anastasiia Apetyk, who teaches courses about internet safety in Ukraine, is aware of even younger cases. \"They tried to recruit children aged nine or 10,\" she says.\n\nAndriy Nebytov, Deputy Head of Ukraine's National Police, says there is a deliberate strategy to seek out the vulnerable who can be manipulated.\n\n\"Children do not always fully realise the consequences of their actions,\" he says.\n\n\"The enemy is not ashamed of using minors for making explosives out of household chemicals, planting them in various locations such as army recruitment offices or police stations.\"\n\nThe SBU says recruitment primarily takes place on the Telegram app, but also on TikTok, and even on video game platforms. Officials says those who are recruited are almost always motivated by money rather than pro-Russian sympathies.\n\nVlad says he does not support Russia and had no previous involvement with crime.\n\nHe had joined two Telegram channels and posted that he was looking for remote work. Within half an hour, a man calling himself Roman replied. When they later talked on the phone, Vlad says Roman spoke Russian with a street accent.\n\nVlad says he was initially reluctant but was persuaded to take on a series of increasingly dangerous tasks. First, he was told to collect a grenade but when he reached the designated location it wasn't there. He was paid $30 anyway.\n\nA few days later came another job - to set fire to a van belonging to a conscription centre, film it and run.\n\nFor that attack, Vlad says he received about $100 in cryptocurrency - much less than the $1,500 he'd been promised. Roman told him he would get the rest if he planted the bomb in Rivne.\n\nThe Telegram channels the BBC has seen where recruitment takes place are not explicitly pro-Russian, but they amplify anger felt by some Ukrainians towards the conscription service, which has been  dogged by allegations  of brutality and corruption.\n\nUsing a burner phone and an alias we joined several we were tipped off about.\n\nThe channels contained clips of fires and explosions which they claimed were carried out on their orders. But the BBC has not been able to verify the circumstances surrounding those videos.\n\nOne account we contacted immediately offered payment, either in cryptocurrency or via bank transfer, to carry out arson. We were told to contact a second account for more details and then received a message with a price list detailing how much they offered to pay for different targets.\n\nThe payments ranged from $1,500 for setting fire to a post office to $3,000 for a bank. Banks were worth more, they explained, because security glass made them harder to attack.\n\n\"You either need to pour petrol inside or throw a few Molotov cocktails inside,\" the account advised.\n\nBut even ordinary Ukrainians looking for employment can find themselves offered money to carry out sabotage.\n\nWe found adverts offering high pay for unspecified part time work posted in a variety of unrelated Ukrainian Telegram groups, including some geared at refugees and even beauty tips. When we followed one up, a recruiter again offered thousands of dollars for arson attacks and asked us to send videos as proof.\n\n\"I need all the arson I can get,\" they messaged. \"Finding a reliable person is far more difficult than parting with money. That's why I pay exactly what I say and I do it very quickly, usually within a couple of hours after receiving the video.\"\n\nThe BBC reported a number of these channels, accounts, chats and bots to Telegram, which removed a few but not most of them. One of the channels that is still active has grown by over 750 subscribers since we started monitoring it, meanwhile an account that we told Telegram had directly offered us payment for an arson attack is still live.\n\nIn a statement, Telegram said: \"Calls to violence or destruction of property are explicitly forbidden on Telegram and are immediately removed whenever discovered.\"\n\nUkrainian officials have publicly named members of Russia's intelligence agencies they suspect of acting as handlers to saboteurs.\n\nThe BBC has not been able to independently verify that the Russian state itself is responsible.\n\nHowever, several European governments have said that they have evidence of Russian agents recruiting young men to carry out acts of vandalism, arson, or even surveillance in their countries.  In the UK, six men were jailed  for their part in a Russian-ordered arson attack on a London warehouse providing aid to Ukraine.\n\nIn Ukraine, hundreds of alleged saboteurs are awaiting trial, but for some the consequences can be deadly. Several suspects have been killed by explosives they were carrying.\n\nThe SBU claims Russian handlers have deliberately detonated devices remotely, knowing their agents would be killed.\n\nIn March, a 17-year-old died and a 15-year-old was badly injured when a bomb they were believed to be taking to a rail station in Ivano-Frankivsk exploded.\n\nThe BBC put the SBU's allegations to the Russian Embassy in London. In a statement it accused Ukraine of a similar sabotage campaign  using Russian citizens .\n\n\"The practices that you mention have become a trademark of the Ukrainian special services. In particular: recruitment of civilians, including children, to carry out arson, sabotage or bombings against people, buildings or vehicles.\"\n\nThere have been reports attributing acts of sabotage inside Russia to Ukrainian recruitment on Telegram. But again, it is notoriously difficult to verify who exactly is behind these attacks.\n\nMeanwhile Vlad has a message for others tempted by the recruiters.\n\n\"It's not worth it. They will either cheat you, and then you will end up in prison just like me, or you can take a bomb in your hands and it will simply blow you up.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8e8z38d2po","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"12:04:09.583+00:00","title":"Doja Cat responds to Ma Vie World Tour complaints from fans","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Doja Cat responded to fan criticism of the opening night of her Ma Vie World Tour in Auckland, New Zealand, where fans complained about a lack of visuals, structure, and outfit changes.

Report Injects More Uncertainty Into Fed’s December Decision\n\nPublished: 2025-11-20T10:15:24-05:00\n\nSeptember’s mixed jobs report injected yet more uncertainty into whether the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its December meeting, a decision that has become increasingly fraught as divisions between officials have deepened over how to respond to weakness in the labor market and rising inflation.\n\nPolicymakers who were inclined to support standing pat at the meeting will be able to point to the 119,000 positions added for the month, far stronger growth than economists had expected. But the rise in the unemployment rate to a four-year peak of 4.4 percent will help bolster policymakers who favor a cut.\n\n“This isn’t going to change anybody’s mind,” said David Seif, chief economist for developed markets at Nomura.\n\nTraders in federal funds futures markets slightly raised their bets that the central bank would end up cutting interest rates next month, although the odds are still below 50 percent.\n\nThe September jobs report was released nearly two months late because of the government shutdown. It has become one of the most important economic releases that policymakers at the central bank will receive before they vote on interest rates at their next two-day meeting, which takes place on Dec. 9-10. The shutdown, which stretched on for over 40 days and was the longest on record, delayed a raft of other crucial reports, some of which will not come out until after the Fed’s decision.\n\nThe Fed will get some other data before its policy decision, including September’s retail sales figures, data tracking prices for goods and services that companies use to make products as well as statistics related to job turnovers. Only part of October’s jobs report will be released alongside November’s data, which now is scheduled for Dec. 16, roughly a week after the Fed’s gathering. The Bureau of Labor Statistics has not given any update on its Consumer Price Index reports, which provide policymakers with insights into how inflation is faring.\n\nPolicymakers have other data sources to look to, including regional surveys and other private-sector data. But the lapse in official government statistics risks making it much more difficult for the Fed to reach a consensus next month on whether to cut interest rates, which was seen as a done deal in the lead up to the latest meeting in October.\n\nWhat has changed is that there has been a groundswell of opposition from many officials on the need to reduce borrowing costs further at this point. Those policymakers are chiefly worried about inflation and the fact that price pressures have picked up again because of President Trump’s tariffs. They appear less concerned about the labor market and more inclined to think that the overall slowdown in monthly jobs growth is a function of a reduced supply of workers, as opposed to flagging demand, as a result of Mr. Trump’s immigration restrictions.\n\nOn the other hand, there is a powerful set of backers for another interest rate cut, including several members of the Fed’s board of governors in Washington, who vote at every meeting.\n\nThose divisions were on full display in minutes from October’s meeting, at which the Fed lowered interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to a range to 3.75 percent to 4 percent.\n\nMost policymakers thought the Fed should be lowering interest rates over time, but several of those officials suggested that a cut in December was not the right call. Overall, the minutes said that many participants at last month’s meeting wanted to keep interest rates unchanged for the remainder of the year. At the same time, several policymakers also thought a December cut “could well be appropriate.”\n\nAndrew Hollenhorst, chief U.S. economist at Citigroup, said he expected September’s jobs report to help tip the balance in favor of a cut, although he conceded it was a close call.\n\n“The unemployment rate is the more important thing to watch here,” he said, noting that it had ticked higher over the summer and in September’s report was close to rounding up to 4.5 percent.\n\n“That’s the kind of trend that tells you that this is a labor market that is still loosening,” he said.\n\nMr. Seif acknowledged that September’s jobs report showed clear-cut signs that unemployment is rising, but ultimately he expects the Fed will stand pat. That reflects his view that there is a “clear hawkish element to the Fed right now.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c17p4z8q9zko","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"00:35:54.813+00:00","title":"Hasina's conviction for crimes against humanity is testing India-Bangladesh ties","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Sheikh Hasina, Bangladesh’s former prime minister, has been sentenced to death for crimes against humanity related to her crackdown on student protests, leading her to flee to India.

strategically valuable - and as politically costly - as its long embrace of Bangladesh's former leader Sheikh Hasina.\n\nDuring 15 years in power she delivered what Delhi prizes most in its periphery: stability, connectivity and a neighbour willing to align its interests with India's rather than China's.\n\nThese days she is across the border in India but  has been sentenced to death  by a special tribunal in Bangladesh for crimes against humanity over her crackdown on student-led protests, which led to her ousting.\n\nThe 2024 demonstrations forced her to flee and paved the way for Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus to lead an interim government. Elections are due early next year.\n\nThe fallout from all this has created a diplomatic bind: Dhaka wants Hasina extradited, but Delhi has shown no inclination to comply - making her death sentence effectively unenforceable.\n\nWhat Delhi intended as humanitarian asylum is turning into a long and uncomfortable test of how far it is willing to go for an old ally, and how much diplomatic capital it is prepared to burn in the process.\n\nMichael Kugelman, a South Asia expert, says India faces four unappealing options.\n\nIt could hand Hasina over - \"which it really doesn't want to do\". It could maintain the status quo, though that will become \"increasingly risky for Delhi once a newly elected government takes office next year\".\n\nOr, it could press Hasina to stay silent and avoid  statements  or  interviews , something she is \"unlikely to accept\" as she continues to lead her Awami League party - and something Delhi is unlikely to enforce.\n\nThe remaining option is to find a third country to take her in, but that too is fraught: few governments are likely to accept a \"high-maintenance guest with serious legal problems and security needs\", Mr Kugelman says.\n\nExtraditing Hasina is unthinkable - India's ruling party and opposition alike view her as a close friend. \"India prides itself on not turning on its friends,\" according to Mr Kugelman.\n\nWhat makes this moment especially awkward for Delhi is the sheer depth - and asymmetry - of the India–Bangladesh relationship, rooted in India's pivotal role in Bangladesh's birth.\n\nBangladesh is India's biggest trading partner in South Asia, and India has become Bangladesh's largest export market in Asia. Total trade reached nearly $13bn (£10bn) last year, with Bangladesh running a sizeable deficit, heavily dependent on Indian raw materials, energy and transit routes.\n\nIndia has offered $8bn-$10bn in concessional credit over the past decade, provides duty-free access to some goods, built cross-border rail links, and supplies electricity - plus oil and LNG - from Indian grids and ports. This is not a relationship either side can easily walk away from.\n\n\"India and Bangladesh share a complex interdependence - relying on each other for water, electricity and more. It would be difficult for Bangladesh to function without India's co-operation,\" says Sanjay Bhardwaj, a professor of South Asian studies at Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University.\n\nYet, many believe, Bangladesh's interim government, under Yunus, appears to now be moving quickly to rebalance its external ties. His first months in office have been a burst of diplomatic outreach aimed at \"de-Indianising\" Bangladesh's foreign policy, according to political scientist Bian Sai in a  paper  published by the National University of Singapore.\n\nA government that once aligned itself with India at every regional forum is now cancelling judicial exchanges, renegotiating Indian energy deals, slowing India-led connectivity projects, and leaning publicly on Beijing, Islamabad and even Ankara for strategic partnership. Many believe the message could not be clearer: Bangladesh, once India's most dependable neighbour, is hedging hard.\n\nThe deterioration is already visible in public sentiment. A recent  survey  by the Dhaka-based Centre for Alternatives found more than 75% of Bangladeshis viewed ties with Beijing positively, compared with just 11% for Delhi - reflecting sentiments after last year's uprising. Many blame Delhi for supporting an increasingly authoritarian Hasina in her final years, and see India as an overbearing neighbour.\n\nProf Bharadwaj says that long-standing economic and cultural ties often endure beyond political shifts: data show that trade between India and Bangladesh grew between 2001 and 2006, when the \"less friendlier\" Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), in coalition with Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI), was in power.\n\n\"While diplomatic and political relations often fluctuate with changes in government, economic, cultural and sports ties tend to remain largely stable. Even if a new administration is less friendly toward India, it does not automatically disrupt trade or broader bilateral relations,\" he says.\n\nFor Delhi, the challenge is not just managing a fallen ally in exile, but preserving a neighbour central to its security - from counterterrorism and border management to access to its restive north-eastern region. India shares a 4,096km (2,545 mile) largely porous and partly riverine border with Bangladesh, where domestic turbulence could trigger displacement or mobilisation of extremists, experts say.\n\n\"India should not be in a hurry,\" says Avinash Paliwal, who teaches politics and international studies at SOAS University of London. The path forward, he argues, requires \"quiet, patient engagement with key political stakeholders in Dhaka -including the armed forces\". Diplomacy can buy time.\n\nDr Paliwal believes the relationship is likely to remain turbulent over the next 12–18 months, with the intensity depending on developments in Bangladesh after next year's elections.\n\n\"If the interim government is able to pull off elections with credibility, and an elected government takes charges, it could open options for the two sides to renegotiate the relationship and limit the damage.\"\n\nThe uncertainty has Delhi weighing not just immediate tactical moves, but the broader principle: How can India reassure friendly governments that it will stand by them \"through thick and thin\" without inviting accusations that it is shielding leaders with troubling human rights records?\n\n\"There are no silver-bullet operational solutions to this dilemma. Perhaps the deeper question that requires mulling is why India faces the dilemma in the first place,\" says Dr Paliwal. In other words, did Delhi put too many eggs in one basket by backing Hasina so consistently?\n\n\"You deal with whoever is in power, is friendly, and helps you get your job done. Why should you change that?\" says Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty, former Indian high commissioner to Bangladesh. \"Foreign policy isn't driven by public perception or morality - relations between states rarely are.\n\n\"Internally, we can't control Bangladesh's politics - it's fractious, deeply divisive, and built on fragile institutions.\"\n\nWhether India can repair the deeper political rupture remains uncertain. At the same time, much depends on Bangladesh's next government. \"The key is how much Bangladesh's next government lets the Hasina factor impact bilateral relations. If it essentially holds the relationship hostage, then it will be tough to move forward,\" says Mr Kugelman.\n\nUltimately, the next elected government will need to balance Bangladesh's core interests - border security, trade and connectivity - against domestic politics and public anti-India sentiment, he says.\n\n\"I don't anticipate a serious crisis in ties, but I suspect they'll remain fragile at best.\""},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/20/us/politics/jeffrey-epstein-jpmorgan-chase-ron-wyden.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"09:57:11-05:00","title":"Wyden Presses for Investigation Into JPMorgan Chase and Epstein","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Senator Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, has called for a joint investigation by Congress and the Justice Department into JPMorgan Chase, alleging that the bank deliberately underreported over $1 billion in suspicious transactions tied to Jeffrey Epstein over a 15-year period.

But it waited until after Mr. Epstein’s arrest on sex trafficking charges in 2019 and subsequent death to file reports that described some $1.3 billion in transactions as suspicious.\n\nInternal bank emails suggest JPMorgan may have waited to file those reports because it wanted “to continue working with Epstein” as a source of referrals for business even after firing him as a client in 2013, the report found.\n\nMr. Wyden, in a statement, said it was “clear that JPMorgan Chase ought to face criminal investigation for the way it enabled Epstein’s horrific crimes.” The report said both Congress and the Justice Department should investigate the bank.\n\nThe bank has repeatedly said it regrets its dealings with Mr. Epstein and did all it could with the information it had at the time. “The second the government finally made public the sex trafficking details in 2019 — information they clearly had for years — we identified for law enforcement a range of Epstein’s past transactions intended to assist with the investigation,” Patricia Wexler, a spokeswoman for the bank, said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nMr. Epstein has been a matter of intense focus in recent weeks, as well as those close to him — including JPMorgan Chase, which paid $230 million in 2023 to settle a class-action lawsuit by his victims that accused it of enabling his crimes.\n\nPresident Trump, a one-time friend of Mr. Epstein’s who did an about-face this week and signed a law that directing the Justice Department to release information on Mr. Epstein’s crimes, has called for the department to investigate JPMorgan along with several prominent Democrats who had associated with Mr. Epstein.\n\nAlso this week, the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform issued a subpoena to the bank seeking documents and records about its dealings with Mr. Epstein.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/20/nyregion/justice-democrats-espaillat-avila-chevalier.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"08:30:05-05:00","title":"Justice Democrats Re-Emerge in New York to Try to Unseat Espaillat","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Justice Democrats organization, which played a key role in Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s 2018 congressional rise, is now re-engaging in New York City politics by endorsing Darializa Avila Chevalier, a 31-year-old Harlem-based activist and Ph.D. student, in a 2026 congressional race against incumbent Representative Adriano Espaillat.

Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s rise to Congress in 2018, will test New York City’s political climate and throw its support behind an insurgent challenger to Representative Adriano Espaillat.\n\nThat candidate, Darializa Avila Chevalier, a Harlem-based organizer, will receive the group’s first endorsement in New York City for the 2026 midterms, and its fifth in a new crop of progressive challengers to establishment moderates in Congress.\n\nThe endorsements in New York are an effort to capitalize on the momentum generated by Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist who pledged that the success of his campaign and administration would prove that the party’s left flank, once considered flailing and overly idealistic, could deliver on its ambitious policy goals.\n\nMs. Avila Chevalier, 31, said that both Mr. Espaillat’s record and Mr. Mamdani’s successful mayoral campaign had compelled her to run. Her 71-year-old opponent, she said in an interview, has been more beholden to corporate interests than to the needs of the district’s working-class families.\n\n“He takes money from the very institutions that are making life harder for New Yorkers here — institutions like landlords, AIPAC and corporate PACs — and turns the other way when our rents are being raised, when we’re being priced out of our communities,” she said, referring to a prominent pro-Israel lobbying group. “And I think New Yorkers are hungry for something different. I think this past mayoral election proves that.”\n\nMr. Espaillat was not immediately available for comment.\n\nMs. Avila Chevalier’s run is one of a handful of primary challenges against well-known Democrats in the city that have emerged since Mr. Mamdani’s victory. The leftist city councilman Chi Ossé has said he plans to run against Representative Hakeem Jeffries, the top House Democrat, in his Brooklyn district; the city comptroller, Brad Lander, is preparing a run against Representative Daniel Goldman, a moderate Democrat representing parts of Brooklyn and Lower Manhattan.\n\nUsamah Andrabi, Justice Democrats’ communications director, said the group was weighing possible endorsements of candidates challenging Mr. Jeffries and Mr. Goldman, but that for now, it was prioritizing unseating Mr. Espaillat, a Democrat serving his fifth term in the 13th District.\n\nMr. Espaillat, the first Dominican American to serve in Congress, is considered one of the body’s foremost Latino members. His district, which includes broad swaths of Harlem and Washington Heights in Upper Manhattan and stretches to the West Bronx, voted overwhelmingly for Mr. Mamdani in the Democratic mayoral primary and the general election. Mr. Espaillat, who endorsed former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo during the primary, switched to support Mr. Mamdani ahead of the November election.\n\nMr. Espaillat benefits from widespread name recognition and a ready-made fund-raising machine. And despite the momentum Mr. Mamdani’s campaign has generated for the left, there is no guarantee that his mayoralty will be a boon to progressive candidates by next June’s primary.\n\nIt is unclear whether Mr. Mamdani intends to offer endorsements in congressional primaries.\n\nMr. Mamdani’s win on Nov. 4 brought many of the generational and ideological fights currently roiling the party into stark relief. New York has been on the front lines of a majority of those battles: Debates over the Israel-Hamas conflict, corporate interests’ meddling in politics and the response to the affordability crisis animated the mayoral contest, and all are likely to color competitive Democratic primaries citywide and across the country.\n\nSome Democrats have already responded to the discourse. In September, Representative Jerrold Nadler, the veteran congressman who served for more than three decades, said he would retire at the end of his term — a response to widespread calls for fresh leadership. Though he drew a primary challenger before his announcement, his impending exit has given way to a field of nearly a dozen contenders, including a Kennedy heir and a Gen Z democratic socialist.\n\nMs. Avila Chevalier, who canvassed for Mr. Mamdani, said the mayoral results had given her confidence that a political shift was underway.\n\n“I think that Zohran’s win convinced so many on the left that this is possible,” she said. “And I think we have to build on that momentum, because if we let that momentum go, then we did all that work for nothing.”\n\nThis campaign is Ms. Avila Chevalier’s first run for political office. She is a Ph.D. student and an investigator in a public defender office in Harlem, and has also helped lead protests against the Israel-Hamas war at Columbia University.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/20/arts/television/trump-jimmy-kimmel-hurricane-epstein.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"02:07:54-05:00","title":"Jimmy Kimmel Prepares for Hurricane Epstein","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. House and Senate passed a bipartisan vote to release long-withheld files related to Jeffrey Epstein, prompting widespread media and public discussion.

Here are the 50 best movies on Netflix right now.\n\nThe U.S. House and Senate voted on Tuesday to make the Justice Department release the Epstein files.\n\nOn Wednesday, Jimmy Kimmel eagerly anticipated their release, saying that he was “carefully following the path of Hurricane Epstein right now.”\n\n“It is a Category 5. It’s expected to make landfall sometime very soon.” — JIMMY KIMMEL\n\n“We are now one step closer to answering the question, ‘What did the president know, and how old were these women when he knew it?’” — JIMMY KIMMEL\n\n“Yesterday, both the House and Senate voted to release the long-withheld files related to a man who considered himself to be Trump’s closest friend for more than a decade, the late sex criminal Jeffrey Epstein. The vote in Congress went 427-1. It was such a landslide, Trump might actually be able to rebury the Epstein files under it.” — JIMMY KIMMEL\n\n“Trump hasn’t been this nervous about signing something since Don Junior’s birth certificate.” — JIMMY KIMMEL\n\n“Even if Trump keeps his promise and signs the bill, we don’t know whether the Department of Justice will actually release all the files or if they’ll be tied up in investigations, specifically investigations Trump orders to keep them tied up in investigations. And that is where things will get interesting. Will we get the — will we have the original documents, or is Trump going to pull a Taylor Swift and give us ‘The Epstein Files: Donnie’s Version’ of the document?” — JIMMY KIMMEL\n\n“That’s how they’re going to keep these files secret — ‘national security,’ America’s go-to justification. It stops us from bringing shampoo on a plane, it puts tariffs on bananas and soon it can prevent you from seeing if the president is a pedophile. By the time Pam Bondi is done with these files, they’ll be more censored than the airplane version of ‘Anora.’” — RONNNY CHIENG\n\n“That is so sad. I don’t agree with Mace’s politics, but South Carolinians gotta stick together. Nancy, next time I throw a party, I would like to invite your dog. No one should have to spend that much time alone with Nancy Mace.” — STEPHEN COLBERT, referring to Nancy Mace’s distancing herself from the Epstein network in an on-camera interview where she claimed to have no friends but her dog\n\n“Are you fishing for an invite to the sex party? Like, why did you make not being a part of a pedophile ring sound so sad?” — RONNY CHIENG\n\n“There’s a middle ground between Epstein Island and friendless loser. Like, walk the middle path.” — RONNY CHIENG\n\n“I mean, she doesn’t go to parties. She doesn’t have friends. She does have a dog, but after a day with her even the dog’s like, ‘Where’s Kristi Noem when you need her?’” — RONNY CHIENG\n\nMary Steenburgen told Seth Meyers on Wednesday’s “Late Night” about the expansive vocabulary of her husband and “A Man on the Inside” co-star, Ted Danson.\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren will sit down with Stephen Colbert on Thursday’s “Late Show.”\n\nAt 71, Greg Ginn has enlisted three new bandmates in their 20s to join the latest iteration of his iconic punk band, Black Flag.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/19/obituaries/robert-stirm-dead.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"19:56:12-05:00","title":"Robert L.

Stirm, Returning P.O.W. in Pulitzer-Winning Photo, Dies at 92\n\nPublished: 2025-11-19T19:56:12-05:00\n\nRetired Colonel Robert L. Stirm, an Air Force pilot whose return home to his family after more than five years of captivity in North Vietnam was the subject of a jubilant Pulitzer Prize-winning photo — an image that hid the painful truth about his marriage ending, died on Nov. 11 in Fairfield, Calif. He was 92.\n\nHis death, in a senior living community, was confirmed by his daughter, Lorrie Stirm Kitching.\n\nOn March 17, 1973, then-Lieutenant Colonel Stirm arrived home with 19 other former prisoners of war to Travis Air Force Base in Fairfield, about 50 miles northeast of San Francisco. Lorrie, who was 15 at the time and his eldest daughter, raced to him on the tarmac in a moment immortalized by a photojournalist: Grinning ecstatically, she had her arms outstretched for a hug, and her feet were off the ground as if levitating.\n\n“It was like when you’re a little kid, and Santa is going to be coming, and you know it’s going to be amazing but you don’t know how amazing it’s going to be,” Ms. Stirm Kitching, now 68, said in an interview.\n\nHer sister and two brothers also hurried toward their father, smiling, as did their mother, Loretta, who wore a large corsage for the occasion.\n\nSlava Veder, an Associated Press photographer known as Sal, was on assignment to cover the reunions and rushed to a makeshift darkroom inside a women’s bathroom on the base after rival photographers from United Press International took the men’s bathroom.\n\n“It was a hell of a moment and, in that moment, you are grabbed,” said Mr. Veder, who is now 99. “It was overwhelming.”\n\nHis published photograph, titled “Burst of Joy,” appeared in newspapers across the country and was awarded the 1974 Pulitzer Prize for feature photography. Lt. Col. Stirm, dressed in his military uniform, back to the camera, face unseen, served as a representative of every serviceman who returned to loved ones from Vietnam, Mr. Veder told Smithsonian magazine in 2005.\n\nDonald M. Goldstein, a co-author of “The Vietnam War: The Story and Photographs” (1997), described the moment to the magazine as “a hero’s welcome for guys who weren’t always seen or treated as heroes.” After a lost war that “tore us apart,” Mr. Goldstein said, “it was finally over, and the country could start healing.”\n\nFor Colonel Stirm, the joyous homecoming captured on camera obscured the agonizing reality he had braced for on the flight home: the dissolution of his marriage.\n\nHis will to survive as a P.O.W., he later said, was built on memories of his domestic life and the hope of returning one day to his family. Those thoughts sustained him after he was shot down and was forced to eject from his F-105 Thunderchief during a bombing mission over North Vietnam on Oct. 27, 1967, and they continued to sustain him in prison camps, including the notorious “Hanoi Hilton,” where he was starved, tortured and subjected to mock executions.\n\nHe held the rank of major at the time he was taken prisoner and was eventually elevated to colonel. He was among 591 American prisoners of war released as part of Operation Homecoming after the Paris Peace Accords ended the United States involvement in the Vietnam War. Three days before he landed at Travis Air Force Base, he was handed what he described as a “Dear John” letter from his wife.\n\n“I have changed drastically — forced into a situation where I finally had to grow up,” his wife of 18 years wrote. “Bob, I feel sure that in your heart you know we can’t make it together — and it doesn’t make sense to be unhappy when you can do something about it. Life is too short.”\n\n“I love you — we all love you,” she continued, “but you must remember how very unhappy we were together.”\n\nMs. Stirm Kitching said her mother acknowledged in the letter of having an affair during her husband’s captivity that ended before his return.\n\n“She was a really great mother,” Ms. Stirm Kitching added, recalling that she led the family in nightly prayers for Colonel Stirm’s safe return and kept his memory alive for the children by explaining, when asked, the date and place and circumstance of each photograph of him that hung on a wall in the family room.\n\nThe affair, Ms. Stirm Kitching said, was a “sad, unfortunate thing.”\n\n“She met somebody who pursued her and called her and sent her flowers,” she said. “She was feeling like, ‘Oh gosh, I’ve been this mom, just taking care of my kids, making sure they’re good and growing up well, and then somebody wants to pay attention to me.’”\n\nDespite the painful letter to her husband, Loretta Stirm offered to try to make her marriage work, her daughter said.\n\nColonel Stirm later told The Associated Press that he had found it impossible to forgive his wife for the affair. Days after a bitter divorce in 1974 that made the news, both remarried. Colonel Stirm kept several copies of the picture autographed by Mr. Veder but, while his children displayed them, he did not.\n\nRobert Lewis Stirm was born on March 22, 1933, in San Francisco and grew up in Hillsborough, Calif. His father, H. Glenn Stirm, owned a steel-fabrication business. His mother, Virginia (Lewis) Stirm, ran the household.\n\nHe joined the Air Force aviation cadet program in 1953, graduated from the University of Colorado in 1954 with a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering and earned his pilot wings in 1959. After numerous postings and advanced training, he served as an F-105 pilot with the 333rd Tactical Fighter Squadron at Takhli Royal Thai Air Force in Thailand from August 1967 until he was shot down that October.\n\nHe said little about Vietnam after returning home, Ms. Stirm Kitching said, but he told a story about a fellow P.O.W., John S. McCain, the Navy pilot and future U.S. senator, who told a joke by tapping on the wall in code to Colonel Stirm in an adjacent cell. “My Dad said it was the first time he laughed in jail,” she said, adding, “I wish I knew the joke.”\n\nColonel Stirm retired from the Air Force in 1977 and worked as a corporate pilot and in the family steel-fabrication business. His military decorations included three awards of the Silver Star as well as two awards of the Legion of Merit and the Distinguished Flying Cross.\n\nHis marriages to Loretta Mrosko and Nancy Smith ended in divorce.\n\nIn addition to his daughter Lorrie, he is survived by two other children, Cynthia Pierson and Roger Stirm; three sisters, Virginia Hall, Marjorie Stirm and Nancy Stirm Bronstein; a brother, John Stirm; nine grandchildren; and eight great-grandchildren. His son Dr. Robert “Bo” Stirm Jr., a dentist, died in 2023.\n\nIn 2005, Ms. Stirm Kitching told Smithsonian that when she looked at the Pulitzer-winning photograph, she felt fortunate because many families had not been reunited during or after the Vietnam War.\n\nToday, she said, she feels “joy and happiness” when seeing herself, always running to hug her father, whom she called her hero. She keeps the photo in the foyer of her home near San Francisco. When guests arrive, she said, she likes to tell them, “This is my way to welcome you; I’m so happy you’re here.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5612689","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"06:00:00-04:00","title":"Ahead of the Holidays, Consumer and Child Advocacy Groups Warn Against AI Toys","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Consumer and child advocacy groups, including Fairplay and the Public Interest Research Group (PIRG), have issued a joint advisory warning against the purchase of AI toys for children during the holiday season.

   Ahead of the holidays, consumer and child advocacy groups warn against AI toys \n         By Chloe Veltman \n        \n           Thursday, November 20, 2025 • 6:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         A nonprofit children's safety organization, Fairplay, is urging gift givers to avoid buying AI toys for children this holiday season, according to an  advisory  issued on Thursday. Fairplay, along with other child and consumer advocacy groups, say these toys – playthings like plushies, dolls, action figures, and kids' robots embedded with chatbots and other artificial intelligence technologies – can be dangerous. Designed to mimic human behaviors and interact with kids as if they were friends, the toys offer novelty at a time when AI is starting to infiltrate many corners of peoples' lives. Fairplay's advisory, headlined \"AI Toys are NOT safe for kids,\" says these toys prey on children's trust and disrupt human relationships, among other harms. The advisory was endorsed by more than 150 experts and groups including MIT professor and author Sherry Turkle, pediatrician and researcher Jenny Radesky, Social Media Victims Law Center, and International Play Association USA. \"It's ridiculous to expect young children to avoid potential harm here,\" said Rachel Franz, a Fairplay program director, in a statement to NPR. \"Young children are especially susceptible to the potential harms of these toys, such as invading their privacy, collecting data, engendering false trust and friendship, and displacing what they need to thrive, like human-to-human interactions and time to play with all their senses. These can have long and short-term impacts on development.\" Others share concerns The advisory follows similar recent warnings from the Public Interest Research Group (PIRG). The consumer rights nonprofit's 40th annual \"Trouble in Toyland\"  report  says some AI toys enable in-depth talk about sexually explicit topics, have few parental controls, and collect a mountain of data about their underage owners. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"All of them are collecting your child's voices, potentially. They're collecting their names, their dates of birth. All kinds of information – the kid's likes, dislikes, favorite toys, favorite friends,\" said Teresa Murray, co-author of the PIRG report and director of its consumer watchdog program, in an  interview  with NPR. \"Because they're connected to the internet, so anything is available, who knows what those toys might start talking to your children about with their friends or their friends' parents or your neighborhood? I mean, it's terrifying.\" Toy industry and AI players highlight safety and privacy The toy industry and AI companies are responding to such fears by highlighting their focus on safety and privacy. OpenAI said it suspended the maker of the AI-powered teddy bear Kumma earlier this week, after  PIRG reported  the toy was sharing questionable advice with minors, such as providing details about how to find and ignite matches. When prompted by researchers, it also talked in-depth about sexual matters. \"We suspended this developer [the Singapore-based toymaker FoloToy] for violating our policies,\" OpenAI spokesperson Gaby Raila said in an email to NPR. \"Our usage policies prohibit any use of our services to exploit, endanger, or sexualize anyone under 18 years old. These rules apply to every developer using our API, and we monitor and enforce them to ensure our services are not used to harm minors.\"    The company's technologies are also embedded in other AI toys including the AI robot pet Loona, and it entered into a  strategic partnership  with Mattel earlier this year \"to support AI-powered products and experiences based on Mattel's brands.\" No products have yet been announced. But the company said the initial set of Mattel products and experiences will focus on families and older customers, not users under 13. Fairplay singled out several AI toys to demonstrate the potential risks of data collection and the impact on a child's understanding of trust. Among them are  Miko , a cute plastic robot that comes with educational games and the tagline \"Built to be your new best friend,\"  Loona Petbot , a small, plastic robot companion that moves around on wheels and has a screen and ear-like, and  Gabbo , a cube-shaped robot plushy with big anime-style eyes. It has no screen, but can be connected to wifi and do voice chat. NPR has reached out to the makers of these products for comment. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"Children's safety is our top priority,\" said Curio, the company behind Gabbo and other AI playthings, in a statement to NPR. \"Our guardrails are meticulously designed to protect kids, and we encourage parents to monitor conversations, track insights, and choose the controls that work best for their family on the Curio: Interactive Toys app.\" \"Facial recognition on Miko 3 is entirely optional and exists solely to help families enjoy a more personalized and interactive experience,\" said Ritvik Sharma, a senior vice president at Miko.ai, in an email to NPR. \"Importantly, all visual data is processed locally on the device. It is never sent to the cloud or shared externally. To offer families greater confidence and control, every Miko robot includes a physical camera shutter that allows parents to completely block the camera whenever they choose.\" In an email to NPR, The Toy Association, which represents toy manufacturers, said toys sold by responsible manufacturers and retailers must adhere to more than 100 strict federal safety standards and tests, including the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, which governs children's privacy and data security online and is overseen by the Federal Trade Commission. \"The Toy Association urges parents and caregivers to shop only from reputable toymakers, brands, and retailers who prioritize children's safety above all else,\" the statement said, adding that it offers  safety tips for A.I. and other connected products  to better inform peoples' buying decisions. \n      \n"}]}
