Evan Perez, Kristen Holmes, Kaitlan Collins, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   President Donald Trump  on Wednesday sought to bring a swift end to perhaps the most damaging saga of his term,  signing a measure  compelling the release of the Epstein files after losing a monthslong, tooth-and-nail fight to prevent their disclosure.\n \n\n   \n  The decision represents a stunning reversal for the president aimed chiefly at quelling a brewing GOP revolt and restoring his iron grip over the party. But few believe the path will be so easy from here.\n \n\n   \n  “I HAVE JUST SIGNED THE BILL TO RELEASE THE EPSTEIN FILES,” Trump posted on Truth Social late in the day, framing the overwhelming votes for it in Congress as a result of his involvement.\n \n\n   \n  The measure becoming law is now set to open a fraught new stage in  the push for the files  tied to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, putting the Justice Department under fresh scrutiny and testing the White House’s ability to pivot attention away from the president’s past dealings with Epstein and toward more advantageous political ground.\n \n\n   \n  At an unrelated press conference earlier Wednesday, Attorney General Pam Bondi would only say that the Justice Department would “follow the law” when asked about the Epstein files.\n \n\n   \n  But already, officials face growing suspicion from Capitol Hill and their MAGA base that the administration will use a just-opened, Trump-ordered criminal investigation as an excuse to keep some of the Epstein case file under wraps.\n \n\n   \n  Justice officials, meanwhile, are scrambling to balance their probe with a looming December deadline for releasing the documents after being caught off-guard by both Trump’s demand for a new investigation and his subsequent sudden support Sunday evening for making all the Epstein files public, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  And even as the White House tries to accelerate past the controversy to focus on next year’s midterm elections, there remains little sign that Trump’s supporters are anywhere near ready to leave it behind.\n \n\n   \n  “This is a storyline that’s going to continue to dog the president into the second year of his presidency,” said Alex Conant, a longtime GOP operative. “The Epstein conspiracies have reached moon landing status. And we’ll never stop talking about it.”\n \n\n   \n  The relentless intrigue surrounding the Epstein files marks the rare issue that has driven a wedge between Trump and the Republican Party he’s led for the last decade, exposing a vulnerability for the White House made all the more frustrating by the fact that it’s largely the result of a series of self-inflicted wounds.\n \n\n   \n  Since it became clear that he could not suppress the files’ release, Trump has tried to reunify the GOP behind a new effort to tie Epstein directly to the Democratic Party.\n \n\n   \n  In announcing he’d signed the bill, Trump focused squarely on Democrats, writing, “Perhaps the truth about these Democrats, and their associations with Jeffrey Epstein, will soon be revealed,” and adding, “This latest Hoax will backfire on the Democrats just as all of the rest have!”\n \n\n   \n  The offensive has drawn on newly disclosed Epstein emails that mention various prominent Democrats, alongside numerous references to Trump — a development that White House officials hope will put them back on offense after months under siege. (Corresponding with Epstein would not be a crime, and there’s no evidence in the emails that any of them participated in Epstein’s wrongdoing.)\n \n\n   \n  “All of a sudden there existed a real opportunity to change the narrative,” one official told CNN, noting that aides had only limited knowledge of what was in the documents compiled by Epstein’s estate until a House committee released them last week.   \n \n\n   \n  But the strategic shift comes after months of failed gambits, dismissals and outright resistance to releasing the files — all of which has sapped precious attention and time from the administration’s core agenda.\n \n\n   \n  The president now faces some of the lowest approval ratings of his term so far, as well as the twin challenges of waging an uphill battle toward the midterms while keeping a lid on the simmering divisions over Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the president was in the right position at the end,” GOP Sen. Mike Rounds said of his support for the Epstein measure. “The rest of the story now is that they will have to deliver on that package in very short order, and then it’s going to depend upon what’s in the package and what’s been withheld.”\n \n\n   \n    Pressure for the files was a problem of Trump’s own making\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s signature on the bill — and the credit he claimed for its success — capped a public push for the files that the president himself first fueled nearly a year-and-a-half ago, after he pledged on the campaign trail to release the materials if elected.\n \n\n   \n  His team then leaned into that off-hand commitment   as a way to energize a segment of the GOP base that’s been fixated on the Epstein files and has been convinced they would implicate a range of powerful figures in the late financier’s sexual abuse of young girls.\n \n\n   \n  The administration further heightened expectations in February, when Bondi distributed “Epstein Files” binders to conservative influencers at the White House. The event was a dud; virtually all of the information was already public, sparking public backlash and opening the door to months of private tensions among top DOJ officials.\n \n\n   \n  Bondi later claimed the administration was poring over newer materials, only for the DOJ to announce months later that no “further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted.”\n \n\n   \n  The ensuing firestorm pitted the White House against many of the MAGA figures who had aided Trump’s rise, sparked a bipartisan effort on Capitol Hill to force the release of the files and prompted an internal scramble to tamp down an issue that threatened to consume the administration through much of the summer.\n \n\n   \n  That effort became more challenging in the wake of revelations that magnified Trump’s past connections to Epstein, including that the president’s name had surfaced in the files. (Trump has not been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.)\n \n\n   \n  Within the White House, aides sought to manage the expectations of their allies, trying to explain that publicizing the rest of the files risked harming victims and violating the privacy of people whose names were in the documents but not credibly accused of wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, meanwhile, repeatedly took to social media to try to browbeat Republicans in line, insisting that the files he once vowed to release were now little more than a Democratic “hoax.” Yet neither approach succeeding in quelling the calls for more disclosure.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re trying to explain to people that they’re believing in something that does not exist,” a senior White House official said. “That’s why it’s so frustrating.”\n \n\n   \n    New investigation raises fresh questions about what will be released\n \n\n   \n  At one point, as the congressional effort to compel the Epstein files’ release gained steam, officials floated launching the new DOJ investigation as a way to alleviate the pressure and block any more documents from being released, an administration official said.\n \n\n   \n  But it’s not clear whether the option made it to Trump. A White House official said the idea of an investigation into Democrats came after the emails were released by the House oversight panel last week. The Justice Department declined to comment.\n \n\n   \n  During Wednesday’s unrelated press conference, Bondi said that “new information” obtained by investigators had prompted her to reopen the Epstein matter without specifying what that was.\n \n\n   \n  So last Friday, as the House vote on releasing the files loomed, Trump abruptly called for the DOJ to probe Epstein’s connections to a handful of Democrat-aligned figures including former President Bill Clinton. He also sought an inquiry into the banking giant JPMorgan Chase’s associations with Epstein.   (Responding to the probe, spokespeople for Clinton and JPMorgan maintained they were not involved in Epstein’s crimes.)\n \n\n   \n  The White House insists Trump has always been on the side of releasing the files. “President Trump has never been against releasing the Epstein files — rather, he has always been against Republicans falling into the Democrat trap of talking about this rather than focusing on the historic tax cuts signed into law, the fact that zero illegal aliens have entered our country in five months, and the many other accomplishments of the Trump Administration on behalf of the American people,” White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  And since the opening of the new investigation, multiple White House officials have insisted to CNN that Trump will not stand in the way of the documents being released and that aides have little reason to believe the new investigation will affect that process, though Bondi declined to offer any explicit assurances on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Within the DOJ, some officials have lamented that Trump’s novel support for releasing the files amounts to a lose-lose — with Bondi and her department now facing dueling directives to both run an investigation and make public its pertinent documents.\n \n\n   \n  The White House’s belated bid now to lean into the Epstein files as a political attack line has also generated some grumbling among allies on Capitol Hill and in the broader Trump orbit who had hoped to move on from a challenging period.\n \n\n   \n  In the last two weeks, some of these allies noted, Trump oversaw an end to the record-long government shutdown, promoted the administration’s efforts on key affordability issues and hosted a series of high-profile diplomatic events.\n \n\n   \n  Yet as Trump and his aides try to turn the tables on Democrats over Epstein, “this is all anyone’s talking about,” Conant said.\n \n\n   \n  “The power of the presidency is the ability to set the agenda,” he added. “And to the extent that this is a distraction, it does undermine what else he can do.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Hannah Rabinowitz contributed to this story. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/sport/soccer-ncaa-washington-huskies-mia-hamant","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-05:00","title":"Washington Huskies Win Big Ten Championship in Tribute to Fallen Goalkeeper Mia Hamant","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The University of Washington women's soccer team, deeply affected by the death of their teammate and close friend Mia Hamant from stage 4 kidney cancer, chose to play in the Big Ten tournament championship game just three days after her passing.

Inspired by her memory, they won a championship 3 days later \n       \n  By Don Riddell, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The aftermath of a  penalty shootout  is always emotional.\n \n\n   \n  One team will be joyfully exuberant, celebrating a victory wrought from the most nerve-wracking tension. That ecstasy will often be peppered with relief because things rarely go perfectly in a shootout. But for the other side, there is only dejection and heartbreak; it’s cruel to come so close to winning and lose.\n \n\n   \n  On November 9 in the Big Ten tournament championship game, it would have been hard to guess the result just from looking at the University of Washington’s  women’s soccer  players. They hugged each other tight, and some were weeping on their knees as they processed both a win and a loss: Just three days before the final, beloved goalkeeper Mia Hamant had died.\n \n\n   \n  Hamant had been diagnosed with an extremely rare and aggressive form of stage 4 kidney cancer in April, upending her soccer dream for her senior season. But as she was tossed into a desperate fight for her life, Hamant remained an integral part of the team, both in the locker room and as their biggest cheerleader on the sidelines for home games. She was also ready to contribute on FaceTime when they were on the road.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s hard to perfectly describe her because Mia was Mia,” the Huskies head coach Nicole Van Dyke told  CNN Sports , adding: “If I didn’t start with her being an exceptional goalkeeper, she might be upset.”\n \n\n   \n  Last season, Hamant’s save percentage ranked her as one of the top three goalkeepers in the college game, but she was valued for so much more than her ability to stop shots.\n \n\n   \n  “She was strong, resilient, an exceptional teammate,” Van Dyke continued. “She was funny, she just regularly kept us laughing, she always brought people with her. She brought us so much joy.”\n \n\n   \n  Hamant documented her fight against cancer on her Instagram page,  @miakickscancer , and she maintained regular contact with the coaches while helping develop some of the players in the team, particularly this season’s sophomore goalkeeper Tanner Ijams.\n \n\n   \n  “She was probably my biggest role model and definitely my biggest inspiration going into this season,” Ijams told CNN Sports. “You could just see how incredibly strong she was throughout all of this because you could tell how much pain she was in and we all knew that she was dealing with this insane battle of her life, and yet she was still laughing with us.”\n \n\n   \n  But on November 6, the laughter stopped. The Huskies had just beaten Wisconsin in their semifinal match when they learned that they had lost their friend and teammate.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s something no one’s prepared for,” explained Van Dyke, “Fortunately, we were surrounded by friends and family, and I know that’s what Mia and Mia’s family wanted for us. To be together in that moment, we’re unbelievably grateful for that.”\n \n\n   \n  They all spent the next day together, united by grief as they tried to make sense of their loss without somebody who would usually be on hand to lift their spirits.\n \n\n   \n  On a team outing to Target, they bought pajamas and candles, and at Chick-fil-A, they drank milkshakes. The next day, on the eve of the final, the senior players were asked whether they should even take the field against Michigan State. The players looked quizzically at their coach, incredulous that they were even having the conversation, but she had to be sure: Was carrying on what they all wanted to do?\n \n\n   \n  “I know she would be up there making fun of us for being so sad,” Ijams recalled. “We knew that she would want us to go out in that finals match and crush them. So, that’s what we did.”\n \n\n   \n  The players could sense Hamant everywhere around the stadium that day, they listened to her playlist in the locker room and they couldn’t help thinking of her when a sunset, which she so admired, glowed in the exact orange hue of the ribbons they’d been wearing in her honor all season. Orange is known as the color of kidney cancer awareness.\n \n\n   \n  Nobody could have known it at the time, but in what would be one of Hamant’s final games for the Huskies, she was the hero. In a quarterfinal match of the Big Ten tournament last season, Washington beat Iowa in a penalty shootout and Hamant made three saves. It seemed tragically poetic that in the first game after her passing, the match against Michigan State would also be settled with spot kicks, during which the goalkeepers play an outsized role in the proceedings.\n \n\n   \n  “Mia loved penalties, and I definitely share that love with her,” Ijams said. “She would have been absolutely thrilled to go to penalties. I knew that we had already won the game before the penalties even started.”\n \n\n   \n  Channeling some of the tricks and mind games that her late teammate had taught her, Ijams imposed herself on the shootout, saving two of MSU’s first three kicks.\n \n\n   \n  There would be no need for a fourth. Washington’s penalty takers all converted, securing an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament and a chance to win the national title – a goal that the team is still chasing.\n \n\n   \n  After their successful spot kicks, each player paid their respects.\n \n\n   \n  Jadyn Holdenried lifted her jersey to reveal a t-shirt with the inscription “For Mia,” Laura Cetina kissed her orange wristband, and Alex Buck blew kisses to the heavens. By the time Julia Hüsch stepped up with the chance to finish the game, Ijams could feel the emotional dam breaking.\n \n\n   \n  “At that point, my job was done because I knew she was going to put it away,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  When the players all rushed into each other’s arms a moment later, the emotion was palpable.\n \n\n   \n  “We felt that our love for (Mia) wasn’t going to be defined by any result,” explained Van Dyke. “We didn’t put pressure on ourselves to do it. I don’t think there was a dry eye in the stadium, or across the nation, to finish in penalties to win that game.”\n \n\n   \n  “Everyone was just sobbing in each other’s arms,” said Ijams, “We were just saying like, ‘Hey, we did it, like we did it for her.’”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/middleeast/israeli-hostage-kupershtein-gaza-captivity-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"In your head, you count every day: Ex-October 7 hostage describes 2 years in captivity","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Bar Kupershtein, a 23-year-old Israeli security guard and former paramedic, was kidnapped on October 7, 2023, during the Hamas attack on Israel.

Despite the enormous hardship he endured, he says he would do the exact same thing again.\n \n\n   \n  “I was responsible for the safety of all the partygoers”’ he said. “If I ran away and saved myself, knowing that others were there and I could have helped them –– I wouldn’t have been able to live with myself.” Survivors have called him a hero. “I just did my job,” he insists.\n \n\n   \n  That decision cost him 738 days.\n \n\n   \n  “In your head, you count every day, that’s how you keep yourself busy,” he told CNN. In the beginning, he recalls, blindfolded and forbidden from speaking, counting was one of the only activities available. Days became weeks, months, two years.\n \n\n   \n  “There were moments when they tried to execute us, when they starved us, when they abused us, whether with beatings, physically, verbally, depriving us from basic human conditions,” he recounts. “You feel like the most miserable person in the world.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Just endure it’ or ‘It can’t get any worse than this’\n \n\n   \n  Held underground with five other hostages, in what he described as “a small dungeon,” Kupershtein recalls an especially violent period, following statements by far-right  Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir  on Palestinian prisoners. “They came to us, beat us and hit us, and when we asked why, they said it was because of Ben Gvir and because of our government,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  In April 2025, Hamas released  a propaganda video  showing Kupershtein and another hostage, Maxim Herkin, appearing emaciated and distressed, begging to be brought home. “All I was thinking about was that my family would know that I am alive, that’s it,” he said. “I didn’t care what they told me to say, I would say everything – just for my family to see me safe and sound and speaking.”\n \n\n   \n  In that hell, Kupershtein says his anchor was his faith.\n \n\n   \n  “God gave me the strength to be strong. I truly believed and knew that I would get out safe and sound,” he said. “From day one, I had this inner feeling. I kept telling myself not to give up and stay strong – for the family – because one day I will get out and go back to being Bar. I told myself that it can’t get any worse than this – so just endure it.”\n \n\n   \n  His faith grew even stronger during captivity.\n \n\n   \n  “I wasn’t very religious beforehand, only traditional, but in captivity, one really connects to God, you talk to him. He saved me – not once or twice. Every day that I stayed alive was a miracle.”\n \n\n   \n  In captivity, Kupershtein had little access to the outside world and was only occasionally aware of what was happening. Even then, it was often what his captors wanted him to know.\n \n\n   \n  But a radio transmitter brought in to broadcast Quran passages to the hostages gave them an unexpected link to the outside.\n \n\n   \n  Kupershtein managed to locate an Israeli military radio station and get updates from home. “I remember waking up every morning, looking at the radio and waiting to listen to it,” he says. “It really is a miracle. Imagine you’re 30 meters (98 feet) underground and you’re listening to the radio.”\n \n\n   \n    A father’s fight for his son\n \n\n   \n  From that radio, he heard about his family’s efforts to secure his release. Kupershtein’s father, Tal, was a former volunteer paramedic for  United Hatzalah , Israel’s largest volunteer emergency medical service organization. He suffered a severe stroke in a motorcycle accident three years prior to the kidnapping. The accident made Bar, the eldest of five siblings, the family’s breadwinner, managing their falafel stand while also working as a security guard at events. He also followed in his father’s footsteps, volunteering as a paramedic.\n \n\n   \n  During his son’s captivity, Tal – who was in a wheelchair and had been unable to speak for years – engaged in an intense recovery effort with speech therapists and regained his ability to speak so he could advocate for his son’s freedom.\n \n\n   \n  “I saw my father sometimes at demonstrations, they even brought me a picture of him standing at a demonstration,” Kupershtein says. “I also heard my mother organized a birthday for me at Hostages Square.”\n \n\n   \n  He didn’t believe his release was coming until the last minute. “There were so many deals that didn’t go through, so we thought here’s another one that won’t go through, something will mess up,” he said. “Even when I was on my way home, I didn’t believe we were actually getting out.”\n \n\n   \n  Now, he is on his way to the Oval Office, where the US president invited all 20 newly- freed hostages. Kupershtein, who calls Trump “an emissary of God,” plans first and foremost to thank him. “God said we needed to get out of there and he was the emissary,”, he says. “He played a big part in us getting out of there.”\n \n\n   \n  Asked if he believes in peace, Kupershtein is measured. “Personally, yes, but after these two years I was there, I know that the other side is really not interested in peace, so as much as we as a state can want peace – I don’t think it can happen with Hamas.”\n \n\n   \n  He describes himself now as an “upgraded version” of who he was before and says being back in Israel is like a daily dream.\n \n\n   \n  “There is an excitement every day to wake up in the morning here – and not there in the tunnels – and to be alive and breathing,” he said. “I thank God for this every day.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, underneath the smiles and the laughter, he acknowledged the wounds remain.\n \n\n   \n  “Of course, there are moments when I can’t fall asleep at night with hard thoughts and a need to go out for fresh air,” he admits. “Sometimes I find myself in situations where I see everyone around me happy, but I’m just regular, and it’s not true happiness.”\n \n\n   \n  He says he tries “to surround myself with a loving, supportive environment so that I don’t reach those situations and just be happy. It’s part of it, I believe it will heal.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/europe/poland-fighter-jets-russia-ukraine-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"06:51:00-05:00","title":"Rescuers scour wreckage for survivors after deadly Russian attack on western Ukraine","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a deadly Russian attack on two apartment buildings in Ternopil, western Ukraine, at least 26 people were killed, including three children, and over 20 remain missing.

apartment buildings in western Ukraine, killing at least 26 people including three children, President Volodymyr Zelensky said Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  More than 20 people are still missing after the airstrikes on two apartment blocks in the western city of Ternopil, which Ukraine’s interior minister said may have wiped out entire families.\n \n\n   \n  The large-scale Russian attack overnight Tuesday was one of the deadliest to target western Ukraine since the start of the conflict and prompted NATO to scramble fighter jets over neighboring Poland and Romania.\n \n\n   \n  Zelensky warned that the death toll could rise as people remained trapped under the rubble, and said Russia “will never stop on its own.” In a post on Telegram, he urged allies to increase pressure on Moscow to halt the violence and restore peace.\n \n\n   \n  Oksana Kobel’s son was in a ninth-story apartment in the building at the time of the attack.\n \n\n   \n  “I went to work, heard the explosions.

The buildings in Ternopil were most likely hit by Russia’s powerful Kh-101 cruise missile, which is designed to avoid air defenses and is equipped with an advanced precision guiding system, they said.   \n \n\n   \n  Romania’s Defense Ministry said it scrambled two Eurofighters, part of NATO’s fleet, and later two Romanian F-16 fighter jets after a  Russian drone entered its airspace  during the attack.\n \n\n   \n  Polish and allied fighter jets were also launched to protect Polish airspace on Wednesday morning, the country’s  operational command  said.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll and a top-level Pentagon delegation were in Ukraine Thursday for meetings with officials following reports that Russia and the US are working on proposals that could see Ukraine cede land and reduce the size of its army.\n \n\n   \n  Polish Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski told CNN that any peace plan would have to involve Europe and leave Ukraine with the capacity to defend itself.\n \n\n   \n  “Poland is a neighbor of both Russia and Ukraine, and the (European Union) is helping Ukraine more, including militarily, than the US, and also financially more than the US. So we have a much bigger stake in this than the US,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  NATO allies have  increasingly scrambled fighter jets  in recent months during Russian attacks on Ukraine, or when stray Russian munitions, drones and warplanes have either strayed too close to their borders or crossed them.\n \n\n   \n  The latest move by NATO comes during a tense week. Polish officials have pointed the finger at Russia after a  key train track was destroyed  in what Warsaw said was an “unprecedented act of sabotage” committed by two Ukrainian citizens who were “collaborating with Russian services.” Russian officials have denied the accusation.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, Poland’s Sikorski said he would close the last Russian consulate in the country in response to the destruction of the train track. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov expressed regret over the move.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, the US State Department approved a possible $105 million sale that would allow Ukraine to upgrade its Patriot air defense system – a critical shield against Russian aerial attacks.\n \n\n   \n  “The proposed sale will improve Ukraine’s ability to meet current and future threats by further equipping it to conduct self-defense and regional security missions with a more robust local sustainment capability,” said a Pentagon statement.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this week, Zelensky struck a deal during a visit to Paris to purchase “up to 100” French-made Rafale fighter jets as well as anti-air defenses and drones from France.\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/09/09/style/hong-kong-bamboo-scaffolding-hnk-intl-dst","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"06:29:00-05:00","title":"Building a modern metropolis using a centuries-old technique","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In Hong Kong, a centuries-old bamboo scaffolding technique — rooted in Han dynasty traditions and honored through rituals like paying respects to Lo Pan — continues to shape the city’s skyline and cultural identity.

centuries-old technique \n       \n  By Karina Tsui, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:29 AM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Every year, in the middle of summer, hundreds of Hong Kong construction workers and engineers walk up some 200 steps to Ching Lin Terrace in the seaside neighborhood of Kennedy Town.\n \n\n   \n  There, in one of the city’s temples ,  they gather and pay their respects to Lo Pan, a legendary Chinese carpenter from the Zhou dynasty and patron saint of builders and contractors.\n \n\n   \n  Even in the sweltering heat, workers cram into the tiny temple’s smoke-filled foyer with incense and candlesticks in hand. Bowing several times, they chant slogans in honor of the construction deity’s birthday and pray for a stable year of work.\n \n\n   \n  “I always tell people that Lo Pan is like our Michelangelo. He is a designer, an architect and an engineer,” said Lawrence Ng, president of the Hong Kong Construction Sub-Contractors Association, which represents the city’s waterproofing, metalwork and scaffolding professionals, among others.\n \n\n   \n  “We must pay respects to the workers who came before us, and Lo Pan is our ‘sifu’ (master).”\n \n\n   \n  Worshipping Lo Pan has taken on a particular significance in today’s precarious economy, Ng said.\n \n\n   \n  Since the Covid-19 pandemic, the city has seen  a decline  in large scale construction projects, leaving many laborers  without steady, long-term  employment. Among them are the city’s  “spidermen”  — thousands of construction workers trained in the ancient technique of bamboo scaffolding.\n \n\n   \n    Part of the city’s visual language\n \n\n   \n  On a slope behind Lo Pan temple is a towering residential building covered in a familiar sight to those who’ve walked Hong Kong’s streets: bamboo poles arranged in a distinct grid-like formation.\n \n\n   \n  The crisscrossed structures, in which each pole is fastened with nylon ties, are ubiquitous across the city’s dense, vertical urban landscape. These scaffolds are erected on skyscrapers, hundreds of feet high, and encased in fabric safety nets forming colorful cocoons of green, blue and purple.\n \n\n   \n  Smaller bamboo contraptions often poke out of windows, or cover air conditioning units and balconies.\n \n\n   \n  Bamboo scaffolding is not only used in the construction of new buildings, but the renovation of thousands of high-rises and historic tenements (“tong lau”) every year.\n \n\n   \n  Popular in Hong Kong for over a century, the technique’s origins in Chinese construction date back to at least the Han dynasty, around 2,000 years ago. The method was also widely used in mainland China until government regulations started calling for steel and aluminum scaffolds, in keeping with international norms, in the 1990s.\n \n\n   \n  Bamboo, however, remained the go-to material in Hong Kong, and has been used to build some of the city’s tallest skyscrapers, like Norman Foster’s HSBC headquarters and parts of the 88-floor International Finance Centre.\n \n\n   \n  Aside from helping develop Hong Kong’s modern structures, bamboo has also played an integral role in building temporary Cantonese opera  theaters .\n \n\n   \n  These traditional theaters, made entirely out of the plant, are built on special occasions like the birthdays of local deities or the Hungry Ghost Festival.\n \n\n   \n  Scaffolding has, in turn, become part of the city’s visual language. Being lightweight, customizable and relatively affordable, bamboo stands in stark contrast to its mainstream counterpart, metal.\n \n\n   \n  “Steel is relatively stiff and strong, but it’s less flexible than bamboo,” said Goman Ho, a structural engineer at British engineering firm Arup, who has more than three decades of experience overseeing the development of tall buildings in the city, including the 283-meter (928-foot) tall Cheung Kong Center.\n \n\n   \n  “Bamboo on the other hand, has its own craftsmanship,” he added. “You can build a lot of beautiful scaffolding in ways you’d never think of.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘It’s culture we need to maintain’\n \n\n   \n  Whether in traditional or modern construction, handling the long poles requires specific skills and intuition, which can take months or years to achieve.\n \n\n   \n  “Sometimes people spend one, two, three or even four years learning bamboo scaffolding and may not become masters,” said Ho Ping-Tak (no relation), Chairman of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Bamboo Scaffolding Workers Union.\n \n\n   \n  “But with metal, the technical requirements are lower. If you have the strength, you can generally meet the requirements in a much shorter time.”\n \n\n   \n  The largest member of the grass family, bamboo is combustible, susceptible to deterioration and weaker in rain, raising legitimate questions about its durability, Arup’s Ho said.\n \n\n   \n  “We need to find ways to overcome it,” he said of these challenges, suggesting that poles could be coated with epoxy or plastic solution to prevent erosion.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s culture we need to maintain,” Ho added.\n \n\n   \n  But keeping the tradition alive is challenging. The industry comprises an aging workforce –– many, like 78-year-old Leung Siu Wai, among the dozens of senior bamboo scaffold workers paying respects to Lo Pan, are close to retirement. New talent is also lacking, said Ng.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s hard to get young people to enter,” he added. “Young people in Hong Kong don’t want to do physically demanding work, or work that gives them an identity they feel uncomfortable with.”\n \n\n   \n  Discussions on safeguarding the practice resurfaced earlier this year when the Hong Kong government’s Development Bureau  announced  that 50% of new public building projects erected from March onwards would need to use metal scaffolding to “better protect workers” and align with modern construction standards in “advanced cities.”\n \n\n   \n  The notice sparked concern among some Hong Kong residents, even though the policy will only impact “one or two new building projects” this year, according to the statement.\n \n\n   \n  The bureau later confirmed to CNN that only one public project would be affected in 2025. Nonetheless, some residents have taken to social media to lament what they believed to be the beginning of the end of bamboo scaffolding.\n \n\n   \n  “This is your sign to film bamboo scaffolding while you still can,” wrote a Hong Kong videographer in an Instagram  post  that garnered over 20,000 likes. “Truly one of Hong Kong’s quiet wonders. And soon, it’ll just be part of the past.”\n \n\n   \n  The storied building technique has also been celebrated on the global stage, presented as part of the Hong Kong pavilion at this year’s Venice Biennale –– the world’s largest architecture exhibition.\n \n\n   \n  In May, a sprawling bamboo scaffold was built in the courtyard of Venice’s Campo della Tana, as part of a showcase exploring the diverse and often juxtaposing aspects of public space in Hong Kong, with a focus on threatened heritage.\n \n\n   \n  Its curators said their proposal for the pavilion was finalized in January, two months before the government announced its move to adopt more metal scaffolding in construction.\n \n\n   \n  “We were a bit shocked, to say the least, because we had planned for this without knowing (the government’s announcement) was coming,” said Ying Zhou, an architect and one of the curators.\n \n\n   \n  “So immediately, we were like, ‘Oh what does our thing now say?’ It takes on a whole different kind of importance, especially when we bring it to a place like Venice.”\n \n\n   \n  Eleven bamboo “sifus,” or masters, traveled to Venice to build the structure. Watching them in action, Zhou’s Italian counterparts were, she said, impressed with the way the material was assembled so quickly and precisely –– without much calculation.\n \n\n   \n  “These pre-modern technologies are never recognized in a standardized world, because you have steel, you have concrete, you have numbers that are calculable,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “And here we have something that even the Italians are like, ‘Oh, we need your structural engineer to certify (it).’”\n \n\n   \n    Safety concerns\n \n\n   \n  Thirty-six-year-old Over Chan, a bamboo scaffold worker who builds structures for external repair work, claims that recent industry-wide discussions about fatal accidents on construction sites have prompted more government intervention. (There were  24 deaths related to bamboo scaffolding  from January 2018 to August 2025, according to Hong Kong’s Labour Department).\n \n\n   \n  “When I was starting out as a worker, we didn’t even have to wear shirts, but now, we’re required to wear our uniform, have good manners, and so on –– this ultimately allows us to rise above the competition.”\n \n\n   \n  “Bamboo is not unsafe,” Ho, the chairman of the workers’ union, said, emphasizing the importance of workers fastening themselves to the wooden structures.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s fine to use metal scaffolding –– we’re not saying that metal scaffolding is a competing technique, but if (the government) makes an announcement without much explanation…it gives the public the wrong impression that bamboo is unsafe, which has huge implications.”\n \n\n   \n  Hong Kong’s Development Bureau told CNN that adopting metal scaffolding in construction is just one of many ways to improve site safety.\n \n\n   \n  “Provided relevant legislative requirements on bamboo scaffolds and metal scaffolds are fulfilled, both types of scaffolds are safe,” the bureau said in an email, adding that the government has “no intention to phase out the adoption of bamboo scaffolds.”\n \n\n   \n  Many large-scale construction projects in Hong Kong already incorporate a hybrid of bamboo and steel scaffolding, the union leader Ho said, with metal bars fixed to the ground supporting wooden structures higher up.\n \n\n   \n  He estimates that, currently, 80% of scaffolds are created using bamboo, while 20% use metal or a hybrid of materials.\n \n\n   \n  Chan, who remains eager and optimistic about the trade, said he has started taking courses on metal scaffolding to stand out in the workforce, despite his belief that bamboo isn’t going anywhere.\n \n\n   \n  “Over the past few years, there’s been this feeling in Hong Kong about needing to preserve what’s left of the city’s identity,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/travel/coolest-streets-2025-time-out","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"06:20:00-04:00","title":"The world’s coolest streets have been named.

Here’s what locals really think \n       \n  By Francesca Street, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:20 AM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Hitting the streets is a great way to catch a city’s real pulse — drifting through indie stores, ducking into coffee shops or grabbing a barstool somewhere lively.\n \n\n   \n  As global listing guide Time Out puts it, a city’s streets are where you’ll find “local life at its most authentic.” That idea powers the magazine’s annual “coolest streets” list, its global roundup of walkways, alleys and other urban arteries.\n \n\n   \n  The  2025 edition is out , celebrating, as Time Out travel editor Grace Beard tells  CNN Travel,  how “streets are everything that makes urban life brilliant.”\n \n\n   \n  To compile it, the brand leaned on its global network of editors and writers, each arguing for the corners of their cities that deserve the spotlight.\n \n\n   \n  This year’s winner: Rua do Senado in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Time Out says this downtown strip is buzzing with newly opened spots that bring “a fresh energy” to the area, alongside institutions like Armazém Senado, home to a weekly, street-filling samba jam.\n \n\n   \n  Luiz Felipe Bernardo, who runs Instagram guide RIO DESTAQUE, tells CNN Travel that seeing a Rio street on the list is a “tremendous source of pride” for locals.\n \n\n   \n  Rua do Senado, he argues, sums up the city’s “history, diversity, and a cultural movement that never stops.” It’s where “music, gastronomy, art, and an unmatched energy all come together.”\n \n\n   \n    What makes a “cool” street?\n \n\n   \n  Coolness, of course, is subjective, but Time Out editor Beard says the streets on the list are “packed with independent businesses, great places to eat and fun things to do.”\n \n\n   \n  Artchitecturally, there’s no common thread. It doesn’t matter if it’s “a pedestrianized canalside path or a major artery,” according to Beard.\n \n\n   \n  Take Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, slotted in at No. 25. The PCH wouldn’t be classed as a “street” by most people; it’s a classic West Coast California road trip. But Time Out suggests if you actually park your car, you’ll find plenty to enjoy. “It’s teeming with cool stuff to do, eat and drink,” says Beard, who points to the road’s “community spirit” after January’s Palisades wildfires. Time Out says a street’s camaderie and creativity matter as much as bars and coffee shops.\n \n\n   \n    Where else made the cut?\n \n\n   \n  No. 2 is Orange Street, in Osaka, Japan, a former antique-hunting district that now mixes streetwear, retro shops, al fresco eats and showy cocktails. No. 3 is Rua do Bonjardim in Porto, Portugal, with old-school grocers, hotels — including former soap factory Torel Saboaria — and restaurants like artsy Ottto. Its owner, Bruno Amaral, tells CNN Travel “it’s really exciting” to see the street on the list, and hopes it leads “more and more people to discover its charm.”\n \n\n   \n  Chengdu’s Fanghua Street takes No. 4 as the city’s “go-to strip for people-watching.” Sherbrooke Street West in Montreal, the highest ranking address in North America, rounds out the top five. It benefits from historic buildings, museums and the bookish vibes of McGill University and its  Blue Metropolis  literary festival.\n \n\n   \n  Former McGill student Katherine Davidson tells CNN the street’s “a stone’s throw from much of what makes Montreal great,” from terrace-lined cafes to the Musée des beaux-arts.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Orchard Street in the lower East Side in New York City is number 8 on Time Out’s ranking, praised for its array of interesting shops and businesses, including recently opened bookstore/podcast studio P&T Knitwear. Owner Bradley Tusk, who chose the name in honor of a business run by his grandfather in the 1950s, tells CNN Travel it’s an “honor” to be namechecked as “cool” in Time Out.\n \n\n   \n  “When my grandfather started the original P&T Knitwear on the Lower East Side in 1952, I doubt he even knew what cool meant, let alone that his grandson would open a bookstore and podcast studio a block over on a street considered one of the coolest in the world,” says Tusk.\n \n\n   \n    Is the list for tourists or locals?\n \n\n   \n  Time Out insists its ranking offers inspiration for both tourists and locals.\n \n\n   \n  The streets are “certified local favorites,” Time Out editor Beard explains. “But there may well be some locals who haven’t yet visited or even heard of the street highlighted in their city. For visitors, we hope this list can provide some invaluable in-the-know insight to help them plan their next city break — and spend their time and money on local businesses.”\n \n\n   \n  The complete list of the 31 coolest streets can be seen at  Time Out’s website. \n \n\n   \n    Time Out’s Top 10 coolest streets for 2025\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/us/transgender-day-remembrance-victims","dateOfPublication":"2024-04-10","timeOfPublication":"20:30:00Z","title":"New Health Regulations Announced to Improve Public Health Standards","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Health Ministry has introduced new regulations aimed at improving public health standards, requiring all public health facilities to update their protocols by April 15, 2024.

For transgender Americans, this year’s memorials will take on particular poignance, as the Trump administration and  conservative lawmakers  have  taken great strides  to restrict how they can live  publicly  and privately, while also eliminating  federal data collection  about anti-trans hate crimes and ending funding for an  LGBTQ suicide hotline .\n \n\n   \n  Since last November, at least 27 trans and nonbinary people have been killed, according to the nonprofit  Advocates for Trans Equality . The number is likely an undercount as precise data is difficult to collect, the organization notes. Some research has shown trans people are  more than four times  more likely than cisgender people to be victims of violent crime.\n \n\n   \n  “In many ways, in our society, trans people are made to feel invisible,” said Bahari Thomas, the advocacy group’s director of public education.\n \n\n   \n  Trans people, particularly trans youth, are also at heightened risk of suicidal thoughts and attempts, according to the  Trevor Project . The organization notes this may be the result of a lack of social support and exposure to stigma and discrimination.\n \n\n   \n  Gwendolyn Smith – one of the activists who founded Transgender Day of Remembrance – said it’s both heartening to see her community uphold what she started decades later and sobering to see them continue to experience high rates of violence.\n \n\n   \n  It’s crucial, she said, to remember the “very vibrant lives” trans victims led. “That’s our humanity.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has profiled eight trans people who died this year, focusing on the fullness of their lives rather than the tragic circumstances of their deaths. These are their stories.\n \n\n   \n    Tahiry Broom, who stood ‘ten toes down’ for her values\n \n\n   \n  Tahiry Broom could show up anywhere – from a seat at a church service to a night club’s pulsing dance floor – armed with her long, painted nails, shimmery eyeshadow and colorful wigs. Then, like magic, the whole place would belong to her.\n \n\n   \n  And Patricia Bender would most likely be there, too, watching proudly.\n \n\n   \n  Bender is Tahiry Broom’s aunt, but the two grew up more like siblings. With only five years between them, Bender and Broom spent their days in Cleveland, practically inseparable.\n \n\n   \n  “When you see me, you saw her,” Bender said.\n \n\n   \n  Bender said she loved Broom’s fearlessness. Broom taught her to “walk into the room like you own it, every time.”\n \n\n   \n  Broom was outspoken, always standing “ten toes down” for anyone or anything she believed in, ever since she was a kid. She was a social butterfly who “could make fun out of nothing.”\n \n\n   \n  Bender, who is a member of the LGBTQ community, said Broom leaned on her for support before coming into her own as a transgender woman.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m like, ‘Hey, you can’t worry yourself worrying about what the next person is going to feel like or what the next person is going to think, because at the end of the day, you’re killing yourself trying to make everybody else happy,’” Bender said.\n \n\n   \n  She also helped Broom become more acquainted with those in Cleveland’s LGBTQ community. Bender already knew “everything and everybody” and getting to know new people “was a big thing” for Broom.\n \n\n   \n  She was outgoing. She loved everybody, and they loved her back.\n \n\n   \n  Going one to two weeks without hearing from her wasn’t cause for concern. She was independent and tended to mind her own business.\n \n\n   \n  But in February, Bender’s phone began to ring and ring and ring. She hesitated to answer, sensing there may be bad news on the other end of the line.\n \n\n   \n  “Sometimes your phone rings and it rings different,” Bender said.\n \n\n   \n  When she finally answered her cousins’ FaceTime call and saw their rosy and tear-stained faces, she said she felt numb.\n \n\n   \n  Broom – visiting snowy Southfield, Michigan, at the time – had been shot and killed, less than a month before her 30th birthday.\n \n\n   \n  “My little brother, my nephews, my male cousins, I worry about them. They’ll be outside doing only God knows what,” Bender said. “Tahiry? Nobody worries about Tahiry.”\n \n\n   \n  A suspect in Broom’s death has been charged with second-degree murder and remains in custody, awaiting a trial date, according to Southfield police.\n \n\n   \n  Hearing of an arrest in Broom’s case was a “calming feeling” for Bender, but getting her justice would involve the suspect being “in a cell for the rest of his life,” she said. She and her family members keep up with the case by regularly attending the suspect’s Zoom hearings.\n \n\n   \n  Researchers and advocacy groups say Black trans women, like Broom, are disproportionately impacted by violence. Of the 372 trans victims identified by Human Rights Watch between 2013 and 2024, 73% were women of color, and 60% were Black women.\n \n\n   \n  Bender is still Broom’s “ying and yang.” Her “frick and frack.”\n \n\n   \n  Her niece might have thought introducing her to the local LGBTQ scene, being older or being her “auntie” made Bender Broom’s “savior.” But Broom, Bender said, saved her too.\n \n\n   \n  “I may be helping you in a sense or exposing you to this…and I’m helping you live your truth,” she added. “And the whole time, you think you need me. But the whole time, I needed you more.”\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Sydney Bishop \n \n\n   \n    Karmin Wells, a Detroit ballroom legend whose walk rivaled Naomi Campbell\n \n\n   \n  She was the “walking wonder” of Detroit’s queer ballroom scene – a nightlife runway legend whose hip-twisting strut is rumored to have put Naomi Campbell to shame. She wouldn’t hit the runway in anything less than six-inch heels, and the jangle of jewelry and sharp clack of her heels announced her presence almost everywhere she went.\n \n\n   \n  She was Karmin Wells – nothing more and nothing less.\n \n\n   \n  “Her style can’t be mimicked ever again,” said her aunt, Markeitha Bibb. “When she came in, they knew what it is. They knew she was (going to) take the stage.”\n \n\n   \n  The 37-year-old was a staple of the local ballroom community, a historic queer subculture where performers compete in categories that include modeling, dancing and “voguing.” Often, performers compete as members of a “house,” a chosen family that can provide a support system that biological families sometimes cannot.\n \n\n   \n  Wells had worked the stage for years, eventually earning the status of “legend” and becoming the mother of the Detroit chapter of the internationally-renowned House of Revlon.\n \n\n   \n  Monica Hudson met Wells when she was still a teenager. Hudson had been doing LGBTQ community outreach at the city’s Palmer Park when she came across Wells and was instantly charmed by her witty sense of humor.\n \n\n   \n  “Our interaction was so real and so raw and authentic. She ended up becoming my chosen daughter,” Hudson said. When Wells was killed on May 25, Hudson said it felt like “losing a part of myself.”\n \n\n   \n  Wells was shot to death in her home just days before her 38th birthday. Police say the suspect has not been identified or charged.\n \n\n   \n  “The world lost a talented, funny, loving, caring, hardworking hustler. The world has lost a gem,” said Hudson.\n \n\n   \n  She cared deeply for her grandfather, Willie Bibb, and her younger sister, Kimari Howard, her aunt said. And she had formed her own sprawling family of chosen children – younger people she mentored and uplifted, Hudson said.\n \n\n   \n  “Whatever you gave her, she gave it back to you 10 times,” said Marcel Goudeaux-Stanley, Wells’ close friend and former significant other. “You could never outdo her. She had a really, really big heart.”\n \n\n   \n  Never staying in one place for long, Wells’ suitcase seemed to always be packed. She would leave Michigan at a moment’s notice, traveling to Las Vegas to hit the casinos or to Atlanta to compete in balls, Bibb said. Then, she would show up on her aunt’s doorstep, insisting they go out to Gigi’s or the Woodward, popular LGBTQ bars in Detroit.\n \n\n   \n  “She’s always on the go. She’s always hustling,” Hudson said.\n \n\n   \n  But Wells found peace in small ways: through morning devotionals to God, performing alone in the privacy of her living room, and finding the company of those who knew who she was when the aura of entertainment wore off, Hudson said.\n \n\n   \n  “When she’s around people that she loves, that genuinely love her, and when she can be comfortable and she can rest, that’s where she’s genuinely happy,” Hudson said.\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Elizabeth Wolfe \n \n\n   \n    Lia Smith, a curious student athlete and formidable board game opponent\n \n\n   \n  For her parents, Lia Smith’s birth was a dream come true – albeit a little nerve-racking.\n \n\n   \n  Born early at just over 31 weeks and under 4 pounds, Smith arrived just minutes before her twin (a fact she would later point out with pride to her “baby” sister). Her father, Greg Smith, camped out in the NICU for weeks until he and his husband, Keith, were able to take the babies home to meet their other child.\n \n\n   \n  “We were just thrilled beyond belief,” Greg Smith said.\n \n\n   \n  Smith grew into a healthy child and young adult who was deeply empathetic, “intrinsically curious and very hardworking,” her father said.\n \n\n   \n  She filled her days learning piano and trombone, going to swim practice, poring over books on world history, and playing board games and cards with her family. Exceptional with numbers and problem-solving, she eventually learned how to count cards and maximize her odds of winning.\n \n\n   \n  “Over time, I learned to only play games of pure chance with her if I wanted to win,” Smith said at his daughter’s   memorial service earlier this month. “Simply put, she was smarter than me.”\n \n\n   \n  Diving became a “core part of her existence,” he said. At age 8, Smith began training with Stanford’s youth swim program, and by the time she left home for college, her bedroom walls were decorated with hundreds of competition ribbons.\n \n\n   \n  Though she was recruited by several colleges to compete on their men’s teams, she was delighted to be invited to compete on the women’s team at Middlebury College in Vermont, her father said.\n \n\n   \n  It would be the first time she would compete on a team that aligned with her identity. After her first year at Middlebury, Smith stopped competing in diving but continued to practice with the team.\n \n\n   \n  “She was really more focused on being one of the girls,” Smith said. “It was very affirming, and mostly she just wanted to hang out with them and practice.”\n \n\n   \n  This year, Smith returned to Middlebury as a senior, working towards degrees in statistics and computer science. The 21-year-old was somehow able to find time to pursue other interests as well.\n \n\n   \n  “She loved to debate the history of Japan or think about the intricacies of China. She had a keen and eclectic interest, and it made it always fun and interesting to talk to her.”\n \n\n   \n  Though she loved to spend time with family and friends, she was at her core an introvert. In her cherished private moments, she would read, sit down at the piano, or write poetry, which she rarely shared.\n \n\n   \n  But while Lia was deeply loved, her father Greg said at her memorial that she “lived on a daily basis with the quiet whispers of judgment and the furrowed brows of contempt.”\n \n\n   \n  Last month, Lia was reported missing. After a days-long search, her body was found near the college campus. She had died by suicide.\n \n\n   \n  Lia did not leave a note explaining why she killed herself, but her father noted that she had felt the brunt of cultural backlash against transgender people, a feeling he said was only exacerbated by online harassment and  a parade of restrictions  on transgender people under the Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n  “Over time, I believe the relentless negativity exhausted her,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Hundreds of people attended memorial services at Middlebury and at Smith’s high school, her father said. He was stricken by the “infinite love” shared at the services and the outpouring of support he has received from strangers online.\n \n\n   \n  “She was perfect for us in every way,” he said. “We cherished her, and others did, too.”\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Elizabeth Wolfe \n \n\n   \n    Amyri Dior, a mother figure with a musical soul\n \n\n   \n  Even though Amyri Dior didn’t have children, she was like a mother to all. She guided and cared for her loved ones in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, deeply. And when it came to her family and friends’ children, she didn’t play around — she looked after them like her own.\n \n\n   \n  “My child, her friend’s children, she would claim them as her kids,” Alejandra Rederford, Dior’s cousin and best friend, said. “Always giving. She will give her last, even if it’s her last … Amyri was a good, caring, genuine soul.”\n \n\n   \n  Dior also “didn’t discriminate” when it came to music and had a passion for singing, rapping and dancing. Rederford said sometimes she would sing while Dior rapped on the spot. Through giggles, she also recalled a memory of Dior dancing in a parking lot once to the sound of a car alarm.\n \n\n   \n  “She would try to hype the people around her to dance,” Rederford said.\n \n\n   \n  Dior would write her own songs, her grandmother, Carrie Joyner, remembered.\n \n\n   \n  “She sang her own music from her own voice. She loved singing with such character,” Joyner said.\n \n\n   \n  Dior would also take the time to have deep conversations with Rederford and others about her experience as a trans woman. She was confident in her identity, even if some people didn’t accept her.\n \n\n   \n  Rederford and Joyner also highlighted Dior’s immense strength, living in foster care as a child for eight years before ultimately running away to her grandma’s house.\n \n\n   \n  Dior and Rederford were only a year apart, and mid-February was always a special time, with their birthdays on February 15 on February 21, respectively.\n \n\n   \n  On Dior’s 23rd birthday this year, they celebrated with a house party full of food and drinks. Dior sang along to songs she loved while laughing with her friends and family.\n \n\n   \n  Just seven days later, the two were supposed to be celebrating Rederford’s birthday together. While Rederford was still getting dressed, she answered a phone call, thinking it was Dior ready to be picked up for the night of festivities. Instead, the voice on the other line was her aunt, telling her Dior had been shot.\n \n\n   \n  A man has been charged with first-degree intentional homicide in Dior’s death, according to a criminal complaint from the Milwaukee District Attorney’s office obtained by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “She was a shining soul,” Rederford said. “She was really loved. Everywhere she (went), she was loved.”\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Taylor Galgano \n \n\n   \n    Kelsey Elem, who was chasing her dream of modeling\n \n\n   \n  Kelsey Elem’s smile could light up a room the moment she walked in, her mother, Calvenita Brock, said. She said Kelsey moved through the world with love, the kind you could feel just being around her.\n \n\n   \n  “Kelsey would give a person any and everything,” Brock said.\n \n\n   \n  Born in Greenville, Illinois, and raised in East St. Louis, with her mother and two brothers, Elem ran track, sang in the church choir and loved animals. Later, she joined Job Corps and received her nursing certificate, her mother said.\n \n\n   \n  Elem loved fashion. She was always dressed to impress, known for her bold style and her signature long nails. Brock said the two were very close, and Elem often turned to her for styling advice.\n \n\n   \n  “She’ll come by the house like, ‘Ma, I need to go in your closet, and I’m on my way, get me something out. I need something to wear today.’”\n \n\n   \n  Brock said she spoke to Elem daily, up until the morning of her death on April 24. She was 25 years old when she was fatally shot. The suspect, whom Brock has identified as one of Elem’s friends, was arrested and charged with second-degree murder, third-degree domestic assault and armed criminal action.\n \n\n   \n  The day before her death, Elem posted on Facebook about how proud she was of her transition journey and how happy she was with life.\n \n\n   \n  “She fought to be the woman and the queen that she were,” Brock said. Elem strove to show other trans people “that they didn’t have to have shame, they didn’t have to feel unloved, because, you know, some people’s … loved ones don’t accept them, and Kelsey was there to let them know, because I accepted my child.”\n \n\n   \n  At the time of her death, she was traveling around the US as a model, building a dream she had long imagined.\n \n\n   \n  “She been traveling all around and so she kept telling me, ‘Mom, you got to come on,’” Brock said. “So she told me, ‘Well, I’m (going to) make sure I do all this for you, Ma, you wanted to do all this, and you stopped for us.’”\n \n\n   \n  She was laid to rest on May 9 in a red, pink, white and green casket adorned with photos of her and the words “goodbyes are not forever.”\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Amanda Jackson \n \n\n   \n    Sam Nordquist, who dreamed of buying a log cabin filled with animals\n \n\n   \n  A man so kind he would give you the shirt off his back.\n \n\n   \n  That’s how Linda Nordquist describes her son Sam. His kindness permeated every part of his life, from the patient demeanor he assumed at his job caring for vulnerable adults to the loving care he showed his pet cats and lizards, or the way he showered his young nieces and nephews with affection. On drives around Minneapolis, Nordquist would often buy extra food to hand out to the homeless, his sister, Kayla Nordquist, said.\n \n\n   \n  Nordquist’s confidence blossomed after he transitioned, his sister said, buoyed by a close-knit and deeply supportive family. His mother helped administer his testosterone shots and carefully emptied his surgical drains after he got top surgery. Although transgender identity was new to her, “Sam is still Sam to me, and I loved Sam no matter what,” his mother said.\n \n\n   \n  He was close with his family, often jetting off for road trips with his sister and her children or binging true crime shows together. He lived with his mother, and they built a familiar routine: sharing a cigarette before work, walking the dog together, and making plans for the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  Last September, their routine ended when Nordquist traveled to upstate New York to meet a woman he had met online. Nordquist was tortured to death in early February, according to New York State Police. Seven people have been indicted on murder charges for their involvement. He was 24. Authorities have said there is no evidence of a hate crime but said Nordquist was treated “like a dog” before his death: beaten, assaulted, sexually abused, starved, and held captive for weeks.\n \n\n   \n  “My heart is shattered,” his sister said. Kayla Nordquist said she still wakes up every day wanting to text her brother. For his mother, “life will never be the same. Life will never be normal as we used to know it.”\n \n\n   \n  Nordquist had big aspirations, his family said: He dreamed of buying a log cabin, filled with animals. His mother wishes most of all she could have seen Nordquist find “actual true love.” It stings, she said, that she’ll never see her son get married or have children.\n \n\n   \n  In Minnesota, Nordquist’s family is dedicated to keeping his memory alive as they brace for their first holiday season without him. His sister had a portrait of him tattooed on her arm, and both his sister and mother got tattoos of “8,995,” the number of days Nordquist was alive. For Christmas, his mother is decorating the tree with ornaments adorned with her son’s name.\n \n\n   \n  His mother has taken responsibility for his cat, who sometimes wakes her up scratching at the door of Nordquist’s room, which she’s left untouched since he was killed. His sister, meanwhile, took in his bearded dragon – and she’s found herself caring for the lizard just as lovingly as Nordquist did, decorating its tank for Halloween and Christmas.\n \n\n   \n  Nordquist “was the most gentle, kindest, sweetest person that you’ll probably ever meet,” his mother said. “And the world should know that they’re all missing out on him.”\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Zoe Sottile \n \n\n   \n    Laura Schueler, the ‘Beyonce of Cincinnati’ with an eye for consignment shopping\n \n\n   \n  Laura Schueler was the friend you could call for anything.\n \n\n   \n  De’Whitney Hankins said she would text Schueler for help with outfit choices because she trusted her fashion instincts. Schueler, a transgender woman, was known for wearing trendy furs, jackets, shoes and purses often purchased from consignment shops, Hankins said. Her edgy style prompted some in their circle of friends to call Schueler the “Beyonce of Cincinnati,” Hankins said.\n \n\n   \n  “She was very much outgoing,” said Hankins, a transgender woman who befriended Schueler in the 1990s when they were living in the same neighborhood.\n \n\n   \n  But the light Schueler brought to others— along with her fun, selfless and caring spirit— darkened when she was  shot and killed on June 7  in Cincinnati, Hankins said. Schueler was 47. A 19-year-old man was arrested on July 11 in connection with her death and charged with murder, felonious assault, among other charges, court records show.\n \n\n   \n  Hankins said Schueler was confident and secure with herself, which inspired many others in the transgender community. She cared deeply about her family, including her nieces and nephews, Hankins said.\n \n\n   \n  “She was not a taker,” Hankins said. “She was more of a giver. If you were hungry, she would give you money or take you to get something to eat. And she would give you the clothes off her back.”\n \n\n   \n  Hankins said she believes Schueler was targeted because she was a transgender woman and her death was a hate crime.\n \n\n   \n  “She had a lot of love to give, and we still had stuff to do,” Hankins said. “My heart is empty.”\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Nicquel Terry Ellis \n \n\n   \n    Dream Johnson, whose animated personality was made for reality TV\n \n\n   \n  When she began her transition three years ago, Iris Terrell’s daughter chose a new name for herself, one that her mother said fit her perfectly: Dream.\n \n\n   \n  “Dream wanted to be a superstar one day,” said Terrell.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson thought her big, confident personality would be perfect for a reality show and wanted to be on TV, Terrell said.\n \n\n   \n  “She had a beautiful soul and would always, always keep you laughing,” her mother said. “She was the life of the party.”\n \n\n   \n  Johnson’s aunt, Vanna Terrell, said her niece’s desire to be in the spotlight even extended to their holiday gatherings.\n \n\n   \n  “We would say we’re going to color coordinate, and Dream would go outside the box and wear something totally different,” Vanna laughs. “We would have a family function, and she would dress like Diana Ross.”\n \n\n   \n  Johnson’s mother and aunt say the family supported her transition and credit Dream’s closest friends for helping her find her own new style.\n \n\n   \n  “They were pushing her to come out of her shell – to be whoever she wanted to be,” Vanna Terrell said.\n \n\n   \n  “I know for a fact that her friends are definitely going through the hardest time now because they stayed together,” she adds.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson’s life was cut short in July at the age of 28 when she was shot four times on a sidewalk in her hometown of Washington, DC, in a residential neighborhood about two miles from the US Capitol.\n \n\n   \n  According to a court document, witnesses say Dream got into an argument with a group of strangers mocking her and calling her “a boy” and a slur used to attack the LGBTQ community.\n \n\n   \n  Although surveillance footage showed Johnson never physically attacked anyone, according to police, a member of the group allegedly pulled out a handgun and shot her to death. She was unarmed,  prosecutors say .\n \n\n   \n  The suspect is charged with first-degree murder, and the case is classified as a gender identity hate crime.\n \n\n   \n  Although the allegation that Dream was targeted for being transgender is painful to her family, they also feel it is important that the reality of the crime be recognized.\n \n\n   \n  “We were pushing for that. We wanted the hate crime (charge),” Vanna said. “We needed the world to know that this is still out here.”\n \n\n   \n  That kind of hate was something Johnson never had to worry about at home.\n \n\n   \n  “I told her she was kind. She was beautiful,” said Johnson’s mother. “Can’t no one change you from being you, and don’t let no one change you.”\n \n\n   \n  Iris Terrell keeps Johnson’s positive spirit even through the sadness surrounding her death, but said the holidays will be hard this year.\n \n\n   \n  But despite her family’s tragedy, Iris Terrell only has   happy memories of her daughter and the person she became.\n \n\n   \n  “It was one thing that I loved about her – that she was herself.”\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Andy Rose \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/middleeast/israel-strikes-gaza-escalation-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"05:59:00-04:00","title":"Israeli strikes across Gaza kill at least 32 Palestinians, as Hamas warns of ‘dangerous escalation’","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israeli strikes across Gaza killed at least 32 Palestinians, including 12 children and 8 women, in a recent escalation of violence that violates a ceasefire agreement.

Palestinians, as Hamas warns of ‘dangerous escalation’ \n       \n  By Abeer Salman, Tareq Al Hilou, Mohammed Tawfeeq and Ibrahim Dahman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:59 AM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Israeli strikes across  Gaza  killed at least   32 Palestinians  in the latest escalation of violence since the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas took effect.\n \n\n   \n  The Palestinian Ministry of Health said 12 children and eight women were among those killed in the strikes, which continued from Wednesday into Thursday morning, while a further 88 people sustained injuries.\n \n\n   \n  The Israel Defense Forces said it carried out the strikes on Hamas targets after “several terrorists” fired on Israeli soldiers operating in Khan Younis in southern Gaza. “This action constitutes a violation of the ceasefire agreement,” the IDF said, adding that none of its forces had been injured.\n \n\n   \n  Hamas condemned the strikes as “a dangerous escalation” and rejected the IDF’s account, accusing Israel of trying to “justify its ongoing crimes and violations.” It called on the US to exert “immediate, serious pressure” on Israel to “respect the ceasefire and halt the aggression against our people.”\n \n\n   \n  The latest strikes bring the total Palestinian death toll since the ceasefire came into effect to 312.\n \n\n   \n  They come just days after the UN Security Council  endorsed  US President Donald Trump’s plan for how to move beyond the fragile truce to a more sustainable peace and the reconstruction of the devastated enclave.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, in a separate development, Israel also carried out airstrikes on what it claimed were Hezbollah weapons storage sites in southern Lebanon.\n \n\n   \n  The strikes in Gaza were the third major escalation since the  ceasefire agreement  came into force in October, each preceded by an attack on Israeli soldiers.\n \n\n   \n  In the two previous escalations, on  October 19  and  28 , approximately 150 Palestinians and three Israeli soldiers were killed.\n \n\n   \n  However, despite those escalations the ceasefire has largely held.\n \n\n   \n  CNN footage taken Wednesday at Gaza City’s Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital complex shows dozens of people crowding around incoming ambulances carrying victims of the strikes.\n \n\n   \n  The footage shows several people sitting beside the corpses inside the hospital, some peering into the body bags in despair. One of the body bags contains the bodies of three lifeless children still covered in dust.\n \n\n   \n  The deadliest strike Wednesday was in the Zaytun area in the east of Gaza, where 10 people, including a woman and a child, were killed, Gaza Civil Defense said.\n \n\n   \n  Another strike hit an area west of Khan Younis targeting “a group of civilians inside the UNRWA club,” the Civil Defense added.\n \n\n   \n  UNRWA is the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East.\n \n\n   \n  Israel launched its war in Gaza after Hamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people and took more than 250 hostage during an attack on Israel on October 7, 2023. Since then, according to the Gaza health ministry, more than 69,000 Palestinians – most of them women and children – have been killed.\n \n\n   \n  As part of the first phase of the US-brokered ceasefire framework, Hamas agreed to release all the remaining hostages in Gaza, living and dead, while Israel agreed to withdraw from some parts of Gaza and release some Palestinian prisoners. Hamas has since released all of the living hostages and the bodies of all but three of the dead ones.\n \n\n   \n  The strikes in Gaza come a day after an Israeli strike on a Palestinian refugee camp in  Lebanon killed 13 people,  according to Lebanon’s health ministry. The IDF said Tuesday’s strike had targeted “a Hamas training compound” that was being used to “plan and carry out terrorist attacks against the IDF and the State of Israel.”\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, Israel carried out further strikes in southern Lebanon, targeting what it said were “several weapons storage facilities belonging to Hezbollah’s rocket unit.” The strikes caused no casualties but damaged several houses, according to Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency.\n \n\n   \n  Israel has been carrying out strikes in  Lebanon targeting militants from Hezbollah  as well as various Palestinian militant factions for more than two years. These escalated after Iran-backed Hezbollah launched attacks on Israel in support of Hamas following the October 7 attack. The latest strikes come despite a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah that took effect in November 2024.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Heather law contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/us/charlotte-ice-raids-residents-mobilizing","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"05:40:00-04:00","title":"Volunteer patrols and the PTA at school entrances: How some Charlotte residents are mobilizing amid the immigration crackdown","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In response to the federal immigration crackdown known as 'Operation Charlotte’s Web,' residents of Charlotte, North Carolina, are mobilizing through volunteer patrols, PTA-led school guard programs, and community support initiatives.

Charlotte residents are mobilizing amid the immigration crackdown \n       \n  By Dalia Faheid, Andy Buck, Dianne Gallagher, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:40 AM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The pews of the Charlotte church were packed as onlookers watched a man restrain a woman while a group in bright vests furiously blew their whistles and filmed the interaction, chanting, “La migra esta aqui.”\n \n\n   \n  Another group loudly sang, “This little light of mine, I’m gonna let it shine.”\n \n\n   \n  Clapping then erupted from the crowd.\n \n\n   \n  The scene was among several role-play scenarios hundreds watched Wednesday evening at Dilworth United Methodist Church as part of a training on how to respond to the expanding federal immigration enforcement operation that has  gripped the Charlotte area  and left residents on high alert.\n \n\n   \n  “Let’s practice our whistling language,” Rev. Joel Simpson, a pastor at First United Methodist Church in Taylorsville, said before a dissonant symphony of whistles filled the church.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to report active operations that are happening in our city, alert people nearby and offer reminders of our rights,” Simpson, who led the training, told the crowd. “We’re going to document and record unlawful practices, and we’re going to deter violence by getting as many people as possible to join quickly as an organized presence.”\n \n\n   \n  The plan is simple: Volunteers sign up for shifts and receive instructions from a “patrol dispatch team” on specific zones in Charlotte they will drive around in and alert people when they see immigration enforcement activity. They’re advised to do it in pairs, keep a safe distance from agents and to never try to physically impede law enforcement.\n \n\n   \n  The initiative is just one of many launched by Charlotte residents to help immigrant neighbors as the Trump administration touts  over 250 arrests  in the area since the aggressive immigration crackdown began over the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  Parents are banding together to guard school entrances or carpool students to class, and business owners across the city are patrolling their neighborhoods and closing their doors to protect their customers.\n \n\n   \n  People throughout Charlotte  have been  using many of the same tactics employed in Chicago – including watching for raids, blowing warning whistles and carrying signs advising people of their rights. Flags from Honduras, Colombia and Mexico were seen adorning cars and hanging from homes and businesses.\n \n\n   \n  Still, the fear throughout the city is palpable: families are keeping their children home from school and taking off from work, worrying they’ll be targeted by federal immigration agents.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Loving your neighbors is holy’\n \n\n   \n  Immigrant worker group Siembra NC organized Wednesday’s event at the church to train volunteers to help immigrants safely get to school and work and guard against constitutional violations during immigration enforcement activities, according to the organization.\n \n\n   \n  Volunteers stood outside the church doors, passing out warning whistles and held signs saying “Loving your neighbors is holy.”\n \n\n   \n  Hundreds of volunteers have attended training sessions held by the group to help immigrants as they travel within the city, document and record “unlawful practices” by agents and warn about enforcement activity, Simpson said.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re coming out on weeknights and they’re saying this is how we need to be spending our time and we want to be on the streets and in our communities, making sure people are cared for,” Simpson told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Over 1,000 people registered for Wednesday’s training and some people had to be turned away, the pastor said.\n \n\n   \n  Simpson said they got “best practices” from other communities that have been stops in the administration’s immigration blitz, including Chicago, Los Angeles and Washington, DC.\n \n\n   \n  “People are telling me as they go through this training like, ‘I’m feeling empowered,’” he said. “‘I feel like I can do something and there’s a way to channel my love and my anger and my fear into something that supports other people.’”\n \n\n   \n  That was the case for Maria Klein, who has used the training as a way to channel her frustration about the crackdown in her city.\n \n\n   \n  She attended the training because she cares about “our children who should be able to go to school safely, for our parents who should be able to go to work for the American dream.” Klein, who teaches English as a Second Language to adults, says many of her students have stopped attending class.\n \n\n   \n  “This was an opportunity to really do something practical and to have an immediate impact,” Klein told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    Parents and teachers help families as school attendance plummets\n \n\n   \n  “What is gonna happen if I go home and my parents aren’t there?”\n \n\n   \n  “What does that mean if my parents get taken away?”\n \n\n   \n  These are the questions teacher Jamie Roldan told CNN she has been getting from students at Charlotte East Language Academy since the immigration crackdown began in the city.\n \n\n   \n  “I tell them that I’m gonna fight if someone comes to my door. I’m fighting – hands, feet, it doesn’t matter. You’re not coming in my classroom and taking any of my kids,” Roldan said. “My classroom is a safe space and it will stay that way.”\n \n\n   \n  Amid “Operation Charlotte’s Web” – the immigration enforcement operation in the city named after the classic 1952 children’s book – more than  30,000 students were absent  from Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools on Monday, about 20% of the district’s enrollment.\n \n\n   \n  “We just understand that they were not in school receiving education, advancing their social skills and we know that that there was an impact to those homes where parents had to modify their work schedules,” Charlotte Mayor Pro Tem Danté Anderson told CNN Wednesday. “They had to have an economic impact out of fear that something would occur at those schools.”\n \n\n   \n  The district  issued a statement Sunday night  that no immigration activity had happened on their campuses and that leaders   hadn’t been informed of impending action. There were no reports of immigration enforcement on their campuses on Monday or Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools teacher David Gillespie says hallways and classrooms were nearly empty on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not sure which of my students I’m going to see again,” Gillespie told CNN affiliate  WCNC . “Whether because their parents were involved in detainments or because their parents have to make that unfortunate safety calculus — is it worth it to send my kids to school and put myself at risk?”\n \n\n   \n  As attendance plummets, some parents in the district are organizing to help families who are afraid to leave their homes.\n \n\n   \n  Some PTA members are standing guard at school entrances during drop-off and pick-up so they can alert staff and families if they see federal immigration agents, WCNC reported. Others are passing out information packets and using PTA funds to help families experiencing food insecurity or transportation issues.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re standing there bearing witness and being part of the community,” PTA member Amy Hawnelson told WCNC. “They do not stick around — and that’s why we’re here.”\n \n\n   \n  Another member, Mike Mastry, said they want to help students feel safe at school.\n \n\n   \n  “Seeing a familiar face that’s friendly and smiling helps bring a sense of normalcy,” Mastry told WCNC. “When kids don’t know what’s going on, they get disoriented and have trouble learning.”\n \n\n   \n  Roldan said parents with legal status are picking up children whose parents may not have legal status to bring them to school.\n \n\n   \n  Gillespie says he’s reaching out to families to help students stay on top of schoolwork.\n \n\n   \n  Extracurriculars have been impacted by the operation too. OurBRIDGE, an organization that helps newly arrived immigrant children and their families, has suspended its afterschool programs after Border Patrol activity at one of its sites, the group  announced  on social media.\n \n\n   \n  High school students in the district  staged a walkout Tuesday morning  to protest immigration enforcement in the city. Several hundred students gathered around the edge of a football field at East Mecklenburg High School, many wearing black and holding flags, photos of the demonstration showed.\n \n\n   \n  “The students’ main objective is to provide protection and cover to their fellow students of immigrant descent,” a news release on the demonstration said.\n \n\n   \n    Business owners work to protect customers\n \n\n   \n  Charlotte business owner Bryan Li enrolled in a training session offered by a local advocacy group and has been out patrolling the city the past few days, looking for federal agents and reporting back to advocacy groups that alert the community.\n \n\n   \n  Li, a US citizen born in Hong Kong, told CNN he couldn’t sit at home and not do something.\n \n\n   \n  “When harm is done, more people rally, learn and prepare so we can help protect our most vulnerable,” Li told CNN. “Charlotte will stand united and protect our immigrant community with everything we have.”\n \n\n   \n  While people like Li patrol the city, many businesses have shuttered their doors, fearing their customers will be a target.\n \n\n   \n  About  half the mom-and-pop businesses  the community development organization  CharlotteEast  works with have closed their doors at some point, despite all of them being owned by US citizens, Executive Director Greg Asciutto said Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  “From strictly an economic standpoint, it’s pretty catastrophic right now,” Asciutto said, comparing current closures to the first week of the coronavirus pandemic in the area.\n \n\n   \n  A Colombian bakery open for 28 years closed its doors Saturday after men in tactical gear   chased and tackled people outside the shop. Community members showed up afterwards to guard the business.\n \n\n   \n  Beth Clements, who stood outside the bakery wearing a yellow vest, had been standing guard there for three days.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m going to walk the streets with my whistle and I want to keep my neighbors protected because they deserve protection and they deserve to live in a world where they’re not scared,” Clements said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/economy/us-jobs-report-september-final","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Rising affordability pressures put extra weight on today’s jobs report","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The long-delayed U.S. September jobs report is set for release on Thursday, November 20, 2025, following a six-week delay caused by a government shutdown.

reports is finally set to be released Thursday: the long-delayed jobs report for September, originally due on October 3.\n \n\n   \n  After sitting on the shelf for six weeks due to the historic government shutdown, the report comes as affordability has emerged as a central issue in the economy, causing consumers to pull back (as  Home Depot  and  Target  can attest).\n \n\n   \n  Thursday’s report will be the last clean jobs report for a couple of months, since the  shutdown mucked up the finely tuned process of data collection and analysis during October  and part of November.\n \n\n   \n  Some October data – including the headline jobs number – will be included with the November jobs report, which has moved to December 16 from December 5. The household survey data was not able to be collected, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said.\n \n\n   \n  As such, Thursday’s jobs report will provide a critical baseline of the US labor market entering the fourth quarter.\n \n\n   \n  Economists are expecting 50,000 jobs were added in September and that the unemployment rate held steady at 4.3%, according to FactSet. The consensus estimates would mark a pickup from  August’s preliminary 22,000-job gain .\n \n\n   \n  If September job gains come in as expected at 50,000, they will keep this year on course for the weakest employment growth since the pandemic and, before that, the Great Financial Crisis.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not expecting huge changes in the (September) report, relative to past reports,” said Allison Shrivastava, economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab. “I really just expect this continuation of this anemic job market that we’ve seen.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s been a low-hire, low-fire slog of a labor market where the lion’s share of job gains has occurred in health care and social services.\n \n\n   \n  That trend was largely confirmed by a  host of private sector  labor market data released during the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Still, while economists aren’t expecting many surprises, Thursday’s report doesn’t come without some fairly big risks – especially for the consideration of monetary policy. The Federal Reserve trimmed interest rates by a quarter point on October 29 with a backdrop of a “less dynamic and somewhat softer labor market,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time.\n \n\n   \n  “Anything that looks kind of ugly now has had the potential to fester for a little bit longer, for the six weeks before we got a better eye on it,” Oliver Allen, senior US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    ‘A precarious place’\n \n\n   \n  Job growth was expected to slow following the post-pandemic economic recovery; however, it’s been  practically listless  the past several months. Since May, job gains have averaged 31,000 per month, which is about one-fifth of the average seen in 2024, BLS data shows.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re in this place of such uncertainty because there’s so much change in policy,” Shrivastava said, noting the frequently changing tariff rates imposed by the Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n  The economy has continued to expand in recent months and consumer spending has held up; however, it’s wealthier Americans who are propping up those outlays.\n \n\n   \n  “This is already a pretty precarious spending situation that could really topple,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The bifurcation (also widely known as  K-shaped  or two-lane) in the spending environment has further contributed to the bifurcation in the labor market. Aside from health care, social services and leisure and hospitality (to some extent), job gains have been flat or negative in many industries, she said.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to uncertainty around trade policy, factors such as immigration, artificial intelligence, federal employment and funding cuts, high interest rates and pandemic-era overhiring are serving as headwinds, she said.\n \n\n   \n  And that in turn will continue to put downward pressure on wages and serve as barriers for people trying to break into or re-enter the labor market, she said.\n \n\n   \n  Continuing jobless claims, which are submitted by people who have filed for at least a week or more of unemployment, have been hovering at around four-year highs, Department of Labor data shows. The latest claims data, which was filled in partially this week, showed that continuing claims were 1.957 million as of October 18, the highest since August.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re in a precarious place, we’re in an anemic place, but not necessarily something wholly negative,” Shrivastava said.\n \n\n   \n    A more ‘upbeat’ outlook for 2026\n \n\n   \n  Still, layoff activity hasn’t worrisomely accelerated: First-time claims for unemployment benefits were 232,000 as of October 18, a tally that was in line with September.\n \n\n   \n  If claims are “in the order of, 300,000 to 400,000 and once we kind of are consistently above that level, then I’d start to be a little more worried about the job market in general,” Oren Klachkin, financial market economist at Nationwide, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  At this point, Klachkin and other Nationwide economists “don’t see a recession on the horizon anytime soon.”\n \n\n   \n  “If I had to put a metaphor around it, it’s like we’re at the end stages of a marathon for the labor market,” Klachkin said. “We came out of the pandemic with extremely robust gains in job growth, and now we’re reaching the end stages of this so-called race, where the job market is looking a bit softer, a bit slower and is potentially at risk, just given where we are in the cycle.”\n \n\n   \n  The labor market is vulnerable to a crash-out; however, the odds are still in favor of it trudging across the finish line and to a point where it could get refueled early next year by increased certainty around tariff rates as well as a potential fiscal boost from the tax and spending bill.\n \n\n   \n  “In the earnings results for the third quarter, the corporate sector is still essentially signaling that we can be relatively upbeat about the economy into next year,” Klachkin said.\n \n\n   \n   This story is developing and will be updated. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/us/golden-state-killer-case-update-cec","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"06:30:00-05:00","title":"A prosecutor reveals new details about the capture of one of America’s most notorious serial killers","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article details the capture and prosecution of Joseph DeAngelo, known as the Golden State Killer, who committed at least 13 murders and dozens of rapes across California from the 1970s to 1980s.

\nUpdated: \n        6:30 AM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Joseph DeAngelo   moved through California neighborhoods like a shadow.\n \n\n   \n  He stalked his victims for days, learning their routines before slipping into their homes in a mask to torture, rape and kill. At first, he preyed on women who lived alone but later expanded his attacks to include couples. He pocketed wedding rings, photos and other grim tokens from crime scenes.\n \n\n   \n  What started as burglaries and break-ins escalated into brutal attacks and murders that left entire neighborhoods too terrified to sleep. Each wave of terror in a different part of California came with a new nickname: The Visalia Ransacker. The Original Night Stalker. The East Area Rapist. And finally, the  Golden State Killer .\n \n\n   \n  DeAngelo killed at least 13 people and raped dozens more in the 1970s and 1980s. In April 2018, nearly four decades after his last known crimes, police armed with DNA evidence surrounded his house in the quiet Sacramento suburb of Citrus Heights and arrested him.\n \n\n   \n  Dressed in a T-shirt, cargo shorts and tube socks, a shocked DeAngelo offered no resistance when detectives moved in after he stepped into his yard. In a jarring contrast to the cruelty he once inflicted, the predator who’d terrorized residents in 11 counties did not fight back. But he protested in a high-pitched voice, ‘I have a roast in the oven!’”\n \n\n   \n  Once inside the cold and bare interrogation room of the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Department, he slumped into a plastic chair. Alone, he quietly stared at the fluorescent-lit walls for nearly two hours, drawing in large gulps of air.\n \n\n   \n  “He reminded me of a sloppy grandpa or an alcoholic uncle whom you avoided at Thanksgiving dinner. He did not seem … particularly menacing,” writes Thien Ho, the lead prosecutor in the case, in his new book, “ The People vs. the Golden State Killer. ” “The monsters of our imagination can look and feel very different in the bright light of reality.”\n \n\n   \n  Detectives offered DeAngelo a can of Dr Pepper – the same drink he’d left behind at several crime scenes. He didn’t touch it nor acknowledge it. Investigators believe he feared he’d leave his DNA on it – unaware that they’d already obtained it from his trash can, said Ho, now the District Attorney of Sacramento County.\n \n\n   \n  DeAngelo was convicted of multiple murders in August 2020 and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.\n \n\n   \n  Ho’s book, released this month, offers a rare look inside the investigation that brought down one of California’s most notorious killers.\n \n\n   \n  CNN talked to Ho about the new revelations in his book. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n \n\n   \n    Why do you think DeAngelo shut down in the hours after his arrest?\n \n\n   \n  He was being calculating and manipulative. When he was sitting inside that room for those two hours, I was watching the video of it, and I thought a couple times that the video kind of just froze because he’s sitting there, not moving at all. And after he was confronted with the murders and rapes, he started mumbling to himself, talking to himself, saying, “I didn’t want to do it. Jerry made me do it.”  He was trying to present this mental defense of a split personality … where he was blaming Jerry for taking over and kind of forcing him to do these things.\n \n\n   \n  He didn’t realize that his mental defense didn’t work, because this isn’t the first time he tried it. In 1979, when he was arrested for shoplifting dog repellent and a hammer, he was caught by store security, and he was acting like he was crazy, mumbling to himself, saying crazy things. And when the police came, he admitted he was pretending to be crazy, hoping that security wouldn’t call them. He has used this technique of pretending to be crazy, so we knew it was fake.\n \n\n   \n    At the beginning of his crime spree, he was a police officer, even working on task forces hunting him. Did that help him evade capture?\n \n\n   \n  It did. The first series of crimes, he was the Visalia Ransacker from 1974 to 1975. There were 120 burglaries in a three-mile square radius. It turned out he was a police officer in a nearby town, and he was on the task force to find the Visalia Ransacker, and he was the ransacker. He left Visalia in central California and moved up to Sacramento, where he started committing rapes there. As a police officer, he knew how everything operated, how long it took to respond to the scene, where they would set up their blockades and how to get around that. He used his expert knowledge as a police officer to commit his crimes, find his victims and then escape.\n \n\n   \n    What drove his escalation from voyeurism and burglary to rape and murder?\n \n\n   \n  It was that insatiable appetite for power.\n \n\n   \n  When we caught him, I tried to recreate every aspect of his life, from when he was born in Bath, New York, all the way to his arrest. We found out that in his personal life, he felt … like he didn’t have control or power. For example, when he was a young boy, he witnessed his little sister, who was 8 or 9 at the time, get raped by two military service members, and he was held down and had to watch that. His parents constantly beat him.\n \n\n   \n  And … many of the victims talked about how small his penis was. So when we arrested him, … we did a search warrant to take pictures of his penis, and it was micropenis. He felt very small and powerless all his life.\n \n\n   \n  And when he became a police officer, it was his way of exerting control and power over other people. When he went in and raped and tied up people, he was drinking their beer, eating their food in their home, violating their marriage. He would take one earring and leave the other behind. He would take the wedding band. And when he would bludgeon them to death … he was playing God over their lives. He had power and control over their lives, because he didn’t have any in his life.\n \n\n   \n    Some of the survivors made their voices heard in court. How did you track them down decades later and prepare them to testify?\n \n\n   \n  After he was caught, we (victim advocates, law enforcement and prosecutors) started reaching out to people and telling them what’s going on. Some people reached out to us when they saw it on the news. We found people across the country … we went to the Midwest and different parts of the country to interview people.\n \n\n   \n  We tried to make everything victim-centered – we connected the survivors with counseling services, sat down with them and went over their testimony and prior statements, talked to them about what court’s like and gave them a tour of the courtroom before trial. We prepared them as best as we could to go through that process.\n \n\n   \n    Your book focuses more on the survivors and law enforcement officials than on the killer himself. What was the reasoning behind that approach?\n \n\n   \n  A lot of times, true crime books focus on the criminal and the crimes. But here, I wanted to focus on the law enforcement officers that never gave up the search for him, and on the victims.  There’s an amazing moment in the case that I’ll never forget and sort of led me to that … in a criminal case, the victims get to read their impact statement. And one of them was Jane Carson, who retired from the military as a colonel. She wrote her own book on being raped by him.\n \n\n   \n  During the impact statement, she says, ‘I’ve brought somebody here with me today that was also a victim, and her name is Bonnie.’ And Bonnie comes up. And Bonnie was actually engaged to DeAngelo about 40 years ago but had broken up with him.\n \n\n   \n  And the Golden State Killer is all about control, and so here was Bonnie, who he couldn’t control because she dumped him. And Bonnie stood there, and they both stared at him. I was six feet away from him. And this guy’s all about control and maintaining control. He’s sitting there, just looking straight ahead, not reacting to anything, trying to maintain control. But when Bonnie was brought into the courtroom, I looked at him, and his breathing had stopped.\n \n\n   \n  Carson also told him, ‘Oh, by the way, DeAngelo, do you remember the roast you had cooking in the oven the day you were arrested? … The only roast you’ll experience is when you roast in hell, because that’s where you’re going.’\n \n\n   \n  It was the victim and Bonnie seizing control back … you could see there was a reaction. It was a very empowering moment in the courtroom.\n \n\n   \n    His crimes were horrifying. Is there a particular survivor whose story has stayed with you?\n \n\n   \n  When I think about the case now, I don’t think about him or the crimes. I think about the survivors. One of them, Phyllis Hennemann, was the very first rape victim in Sacramento. She was diagnosed with cancer, and when it was time for court she couldn’t be there because she was having chemo. But when DeAngelo was sentenced, I looked across the courtroom, and there’s Phyllis sitting there. And she had this twinkle on her eye. For the first time in 40 years, she got justice. About three months later, she died from cancer. I think about her a lot … that we were able to get her that justice.\n \n\n   \n    After four decades, was there a moment in the investigation that marked a turning point?\n \n\n   \n  DNA technology shifted the direction of this case. We took some of the DNA, some of the semen from the Ventura rape and converted into a DNA profile that you use in the genealogy database, and then we uploaded it. We found out he had a distant relative, and so we then took that relative and built a family tree. You know, who was that person’s brothers and sisters, their parents, their uncles and aunties, their grandparents, their great-grandparents. We built this massive family tree with a thousand-plus names on it.\n \n\n   \n  And from that family tree, we investigated and looked at everybody. How many were male? How many of them were white? How many of them were police officers or military? How many lived at these crime scenes? And we were able to narrow it down to three people. And lo and behold, he was one of them. We collected his trash and found a piece of tissue that we tested for DNA that matched the killer from all these other locations.\n \n\n   \n    Having seen the evidence up close, which details have stayed with you?\n \n\n   \n  The brutality of the murder scenes in Southern California … For many of those murders, he bludgeoned the victims to death with a blunt instrument. A gunshot would draw the neighbors’ attention … (so) killing them with a log, a lamp base or a brass sprinkler head allowed him time to take in the crime scene at his leisure before leaving.\n \n\n   \n    Do you believe there are more victims out there?\n \n\n   \n  I do. His last known crime was the 1986 murder of Janelle Cruz in Orange County. People ask me, ‘Why did he stop in 1986’? And my answer is, ‘How do you know he stopped in 1986?’\n \n\n   \n  There’s a three-year period from 1986 to 1989, when he was living in LA, that we’re not sure exactly where he was and what he was doing. And he was already beginning to evolve as a killer. So what’s to say he didn’t continue to kill his victims, but he discarded the bodies somewhere that we never found?\n \n\n   \n    You describe justice in this case as not just a legal victory but a personal, full-circle moment for you. Why?\n \n\n   \n  I escaped Vietnam on a fishing boat and lived in a refugee camp. When I came to the US, I learned how to speak English by watching Bugs Bunny cartoons. Twenty years later, I graduated from law school, and I became a lawyer.\n \n\n   \n  I come from a country that doesn’t have the rule of law … it’s governed, essentially, by a dictatorship. And to come to this country, and give back to victims rights, be part of a system of justice that works, it meant everything in the world.\n \n\n   \n    What’s DeAngelo’s life like in prison today?\n \n\n   \n  He was sentenced to multiple life sentences without the possibility of parole and is in a prison in the Central Valley in California. He’s in a protective unit – this is where you put the child molesters, the rapists, the snitches, people who drop out of gangs because other prisoners want to hurt them. He’s not in the general population. And in that unit, he is constantly looking over his shoulder, worried that somebody’s going to attack him.\n \n\n   \n  So he’s in his own version of hell, where he belongs.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/politics/dick-cheney-funeral-washington","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"05:57:00-04:00","title":"Trump and Vance Not Invited to Dick Cheney’s Funeral, But All Four Living Former Vice Presidents Attending","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The funeral of former Vice President Dick Cheney, who died on November 3, 2025, at age 84, is set for November 20, 2025, at the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C.

Country overnight as thunderstorms start to dump torrential rain. A Level 3 of 4 risk of flooding rainfall is in place Thursday for about 75,000 people in this region.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after midnight local time, strong thunderstorms began stalling over northwestern Kerr County at the headwater forks of the Guadalupe River, upstream from where more than 100 people died in July after extreme rainfall triggered a  surge of floodwater  on local rivers.\n \n\n   \n  This forecast isn’t as dire as July’s, but confidence is increasing that more than 5 inches of rain could fall in some locations Thursday. Rainfall rates could approach a torrential 3 inches per hour at times during the heaviest rain.\n \n\n   \n  The National Weather Service issued a Flood Warning for the Guadalupe River near the Kerr County community of Hunt, about 80 miles northwest of San Antonio﻿, through Thursday evening, alerting residents that rising water from the stalling storms may push the river out of its banks and cause moderate flooding. The warning was cancelled after storms moved out of the area early Thursday morning, but the river is still expected to rise to over 9 feet, or just below flood stage.\n \n\n   \n  Portions of Gillespie and Val Verde Counties could also see flash flooding during the early morning hours on Thursday. The National Weather Service is monitoring radar for high rainfall rates and advises residents of these counties to stay weather aware.\n \n\n   \n  The higher-end flash flood threat peaks after sunrise, when weather models predict a second round of storms will develop over a similar area. These storms could “train,” or line up and move over the same spot one after another, like train cars on a railroad track.\n \n\n   \n  The Hill Country’s terrain makes torrential rain especially dangerous. Narrow canyons and fast-responding creeks can’t handle a few hours of training storms, let alone as much as 5 inches over a short time.\n \n\n   \n  Rainfall this heavy is usually confined to the summer months, but ongoing unseasonable heat in the South is raising the bar on how much moisture these storms could wring out of the atmosphere.\n \n\n   \n  If you’re in the Hill Country, keep phones charged and alerts on.

there is ‘no market’ for Japanese seafood exports as spat over Taiwan comments escalates \n       \n  By Jerome Taylor, Ross Adkin, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:48 AM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   China  has warned there is “no market” for  Japanese seafood exports,  the latest veiled threat from Beijing as its diplomatic spat with Tokyo escalates over recent comments by Japan’s leader on defending Taiwan.\n \n\n   \n  The two neighbors have been engaged in a  rapidly spiraling dispute  after Japanese leader Sanae Takaichi, in response to a question in parliament, said that a Chinese attack on Taiwan would count as “a situation threatening Japan’s survival,” and thus could trigger a military response from Tokyo.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing views the self-governing democracy of Taiwan as its territory and has vowed to take control of the island, by force if necessary. For Beijing, Taiwan’s sovereignty is the most sensitive issue in its relations with other nations – a “red line” not to be crossed.\n \n\n   \n  For more than a week, China and its state media has issued near daily denunciations of Takaichi   as well as threats to economically punish Tokyo unless the comments are retracted.\n \n\n   \n  Seafood emerged as the latest pressure point at a regular press briefing on Wednesday from China’s foreign ministry.\n \n\n   \n  “Due to the erroneous remarks made by Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi on important Taiwan issues, there has been strong public outrage in China,” spokesperson Mao Ning told reporters. “Under the current circumstances, even if Japanese seafood were exported to China, there would be no market for it.”\n \n\n   \n  Mao was responding to reports earlier that day in Japanese media that China had already informed Tokyo that it planned to ban seafood exports from Japan. Both NHK and Kyodo ran the reports, citing sources.\n \n\n   \n  However Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara told reporters Tokyo has yet to receive any confirmation from the Chinese government on the matter.\n \n\n   \n  Mao’s response did not confirm a ban was in place, but it has raised the prospect that one might be on its way as well as further punitive measures.\n \n\n   \n  “Japan should first retract its erroneous remarks and take concrete actions to safeguard the political foundation of China-Japan relations; otherwise, China will have no choice but to take further measures,” Mao said.\n \n\n   \n    Fukhshima era ban\n \n\n   \n  China had only  partly resumed imports  of seafood from Japan earlier this year after banning them in August 2023 in response to Tokyo’s decision to begin releasing treated radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear plant.\n \n\n   \n  Japan’s devastating 2011 earthquake and tsunami caused water within the plant to be contaminated with highly radioactive material. Tokyo had argued that it had treated the water properly, but Beijing had long led regional opposition to the water being returned to the ocean.\n \n\n   \n  In contrast to China threats, Taiwan’s leader Lai Ching-te turned to social media to show his support for Japanese seafood this week, posting a picture on X on Thursday of his sushi lunch.\n \n\n   \n  The threat of a new   seafood ban comes after Beijing last week advised its citizens against travelling to Japan.\n \n\n   \n  Although the move is non-binding, it is hugely symbolic – nearly 7.5 million travelers from China visited Japan between January and September this year, by far the highest count of any country or region, according to official data cited by Japanese public broadcaster NHK.\n \n\n   \n  Chinese airlines including Air China, China Eastern and China Southern later published notices on their websites offering customers refunds or free changes on certain tickets to Japan, Chinese state broadcaster CCTV reported.\n \n\n   \n  Japanese companies are starting to report cancellations.\n \n\n   \n  Tokyo-based tour operator East Japan International Travel Service said it had lost 70% of its bookings for the remainder of the year, because of the ongoing row between Japan and China.\n \n\n   \n  Yu Jinxin, the company’s vice president, told CNN it was “a huge loss for us”, adding Chinese tour groups are a key part of their business.\n \n\n   \n  “We can withstand a short-term impact of one to two months, but if the situation becomes prolonged, the financial strain on our operations will be significant,” Yu added.\n \n\n   \n  Previous Japanese leaders have avoided discussing Taiwan in the context of a military response to avoid ruffling feathers in China – Japan’s biggest trade partner.\n \n\n   \n  Takaichi,  a hawk who has pushed to strengthen Japan’s defense capacity,  visited Taiwan earlier this year – before she became Prime Minister – and called for cooperation on “defense challenges,” which Beijing condemned at the time.\n \n\n   \n  She has previously criticized Beijing’s increasing military presence in East Asia, and during the APEC summit, she met with Taiwan’s representative, again angering China.\n \n\n   \n  She met Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the same summit, at which she said she had asked China to resume imports of Japanese beef and seafood imports.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Mai Takiguchi and Kloe Zheng contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/business/larry-summers-openai-board-epstein","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"21:54:00.000Z","title":"Larry Summers leaves OpenAI board, Harvard instructor role as scrutiny over Epstein emails intensifies","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Larry Summers, former U.S. Treasury Secretary and Harvard University president, has resigned from his roles on OpenAI’s board and as an instructor at Harvard University following the release of emails by a House committee that reveal years of personal correspondence with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

Marjorie Taylor Greene  apologize on national television  for her role in perpetuating divisive rhetoric and immediately instructed her staff to see if the Georgia Republican wanted to work with her on a bill addressing lawmaker safety.\n \n\n   \n  Crockett had reached out to Greene on the issue shortly after Charlie Kirk’s assassination in September, without response. But now, with Greene’s public rebuke of President Donald Trump and her own party, Crockett sees even more potential in teaming up.\n \n\n   \n  “If you can put Marjorie and myself as co-leads on anything, it automatically gets attention, and it also reveals to the American public that we can bridge these gaps if we just decided that we want to,” Crockett told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The pair don’t necessarily have a friendly history. Often seen trading insults during House Oversight Committee meetings, Crockett has  dismissed Greene as racist  and once referred to the congresswoman as a “ bleach blonde, bad built, butch body. ” No, Crockett said, she wouldn’t consider Greene a “Democratic bestie,” but she hopes they can develop a new working relationship.\n \n\n   \n  Crockett’s attempts to find common ground with Greene reflect a broader discussion in the Democratic Party about whether they should embrace Greene or if the congresswoman’s history of offensive,  at times violent , rhetoric and  conspiracy theories  – often  directed  at Democrats – makes the  idea  just too unpalatable.\n \n\n   \n  In conversations with over a dozen Democratic lawmakers and aides, the proverbial scars from Greene’s incendiary past statements cut deep and, as a result, there’s no clear consensus on how to best work with her in the future.\n \n\n   \n  Greene’s office declined to comment for this story, but she called for unity in her recent interview with CNN’s “State of the Union.”\n \n\n   \n  “I think America needs to come together and end all the toxic, dangerous rhetoric and divide. And I’m leading the way with my own example, and I hope that President Trump can do the same,” Greene told CNN’s Dana Bash.\n \n\n   \n    Some Democrats see opportunity\n \n\n   \n  In their pursuit of circumventing House GOP leadership to force a vote on the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files, Democrats found an unlikely ally in Greene.\n \n\n   \n  Even though virtually all Republicans ended up voting for the measure, Greene was one of only four Republicans to buck their party and sign onto the petition that made Tuesday’s vote possible. It culminated in a shared embrace with Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, a key Democratic backer of the effort, at a high-profile press conference on Capitol Hill (once strangers,  the pair now texts ) and laid the groundwork for some Democrats to start to see an opening.\n \n\n   \n  Another area Democrats see as an opportunity to work together: The issue of rising health care costs and affordability.\n \n\n   \n  During the government shutdown, Greene openly vented about how health care prices for her family would double due to the expiring enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies that were central to Democrats’ shutdown argument.\n \n\n   \n  “Not a single Republican in leadership talked to us about this or has given us a plan to help Americans deal with their health insurance premiums DOUBLING!!!” Greene  wrote  on X in October.\n \n\n   \n  Her criticisms reached the upper echelon of the House Democratic caucus.\n \n\n   \n  The second highest Democrat in the House, Minority Whip Rep. Katherine Clark, said she was open to working with Greene on lowering the cost of health care and cost of living.\n \n\n   \n  “Our hand is always extended in bipartisanship, and we will work with anyone that is going to prioritize the economic needs of families at home and reduce their costs,” Clark said.\n \n\n   \n  Greene’s criticism of Israel in the war with Hamas has also brought her closer to some unexpected allies.\n \n\n   \n  Minnesota Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar said that despite the pair’s charged history (Greene tried to censure Omar  last year ), she approached Greene on the House floor even prior to Greene’s  apparent political breakup  with Trump to thank her for speaking out on Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  “In regards to her stances and addressing the genocide, I have actually personally gone to thank her for that. I think it is important when somebody is doing a principled thing that we thank them for what they are doing,” Omar said of her conversation with Greene a few months ago.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Rep. Pramila Jayapal has even gone through the trouble of tracking down Greene’s cell phone number to thank her for being outspoken against Trump and the Republican Party and wants to suggest teaming up on the progressive priority of “Medicare for All.” It wasn’t something she ever thought she’d do.\n \n\n   \n  “But I also have worked with a lot of people that I disagree with on a lot of things,” Jayapal told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    Distrust remains\n \n\n   \n  Not all Democrats are quick to trust when it comes to the Georgia Republican, and some questioned the influence she has within her party to draw other Republicans to the table.\n \n\n   \n  Members of the progressive group known as “the Squad” who were often the subject of Greene’s most vile attacks said they needed to see evidence that Greene’s arc was real and not just a publicity stunt.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said she needs to see Greene’s words followed up by action and that it’s on Greene to reach out to make amends.\n \n\n   \n  “I personally believe that you never close the door to a person who wants to have changes in their life and in their heart, but they have to be genuine and they have to be authentic,” the New York congresswoman said. “It is incumbent upon her to repair the harm that she has done to people. It is not on the people she has harmed.”\n \n\n   \n  As a candidate in 2020, Greene  posted  on her candidate Facebook page an image of herself holding a gun alongside images of Ocasio-Cortez, Omar and Rep. Rashida Tlaib and encouraged going on the “offense against these socialists.” Facebook took down the photo at the time.\n \n\n   \n  Rep. Ayanna Pressley remembers that photo, but says she would be willing to work with Greene if the Republican show true change.\n \n\n   \n  “I am a Christian woman of deep faith, so I certainly believe in the capacity of people to evolve, to atone, and to redeem themselves. And if she is on a path to do that, that is extraordinary. And I need to see action that supports what she’s saying,” the Massachusetts Democrat said.\n \n\n   \n  “I never want to cause any harm or anything bad for anyone,” Greene told Bash on Sunday, saying she’d previously addressed her hateful comments.\n \n\n   \n  In  2021 , Greene also apologized for her offensive comments comparing Capitol Hill mask-wearing rules to the Holocaust after visiting the US Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Rep. Becca Balint who put forward a resolution censuring Greene in  2023 , arguing she’s “fanned the flames of racism, antisemitism, LGBTQ hate speech, Islamophobia, anti-Asian hate, xenophobia, and other forms of hatred,” said Greene will need to be proactive if she is serious about making a change.\n \n\n   \n  “We all know politics always makes for strange bedfellows. In this instance, though, it has been truly remarkable and shocking to see her change of heart regarding nasty rhetoric. The only way for this to be anything other than just platitudes is for her to truly make amends to all the colleagues she’s hurt and put in danger,” Balint said.\n \n\n   \n  If Greene were serious about showing her evolution many Democrats argued a great place for her to start would be supporting a congressional memorial to honor law enforcement caught in the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar, who formerly served on the January 6 select committee, said Greene having dismissed the violence that day and refused to accept Joe Biden as the rightful winner of the 2020 election make it hard for him to conceive of working directly with her.\n \n\n   \n  “Her positions on January 6th and supporting the ‘Big Lie,’ you know, would continue to be an issue. It’s not someone I choose to cosponsor legislation with,” Aguilar said. “But I appreciate that people evolve on certain issues and if she wants to work with us on health care issues, then I welcome that.”\n \n\n   \n    Relationships after Trump\n \n\n   \n  Part of the calculus for Democrats is that they want to show the capacity to forgive Republicans who are starting to grapple with what the future of their party looks like in a world where Trump will no longer be the ballot.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland went as far as to say the Democratic Party has a big enough tent that Greene could one day be a part of.\n \n\n   \n  “Obviously, Marjorie Taylor Greene would have a lot of political transformation to go through before she could come to the Democratic Party, but I do want to make the serious point that we have to be open to a lot of people who are refugees from the political corruption and authoritarianism of the Republican Party,” Raskin told CNN. “I hear from Republicans every day who say, ‘I can’t take it anymore.’”\n \n\n   \n  A senior House Democratic aide, pressed on the idea of Greene one day becoming a Democrat, quipped that “converts are the most devout.”\n \n\n   \n  But even the Democrats who see the capacity for forgiveness acknowledge that it’s a long road ahead.\n \n\n   \n  “She’s got to do her own work. She’s on her own life journey,” Ocasio-Cortez said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/us/harvard-launch-investigation-summers-epstein-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"10:29:00-05:00","title":"Former Harvard President Larry Summers Steps Aside from Teaching as University Probes Jeffrey Epstein Emails","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Larry Summers, former president of Harvard University and a prominent figure in American politics and academia, has stepped away from his teaching duties at Harvard as the university investigates personal emails between him and Jeffrey Epstein, which date back to 2013 and include sexist comments and romantic solicitations.

2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  What now?\n \n\n   \n  The drama, emotion and shock of Congress’s sudden demand for transparency on the  Jeffrey Epstein drama  has ceded to uncertainty and suspicion that President Donald Trump will try to wriggle off the political hook.\n \n\n   \n  The  victims of Epstein , an accused sex trafficker, have tragically seen justice postponed before. They’d been quick to warn after an unprecedented Republican revolt against Trump on Tuesday that it was just one more step in their long quest for vindication. Their wisdom was obvious once the euphoria of their triumph began to clear.\n \n\n   \n  Washington waited all day Wednesday to find out that  Trump had signed   the bill  passed with a 427-1 majority in the House and waved through on unanimous consent by the Senate, which had no desire to be drawn into the president’s self-inflicted political crisis. The measure requires the Justice Department to release  all investigative files , documents and other materials about Epstein, with some exceptions,  within 30 days  of it becoming law. It’s hardly surprising that Trump didn’t rush to sign it, since, despite his late embrace of the legislation, it repudiated his weekslong bid to keep the evidence secret.\n \n\n   \n  Trump was in a box. Any presidential veto was likely to be overturned, judging by the congressional majorities for the bill. But now his Justice Department — in theory at least — is bound to implement it. Any foot-dragging or obstruction would certainly worsen already disastrous public disapproval of his handling of the issue and would only fuel the question that got him into his current mess: What is he trying to hide?\n \n\n   \n    The political battle to come\n \n\n   \n  Epstein survivors and Trump critics are turning to the next stage of the political battle over the documents, but there is almost no clarity over if and when evidence will come out — and how much.\n \n\n   \n  Lawmakers who endorsed the bill seemed unclear what would happen if Trump just ignored it. And Trump’s Attorney General Pam Bondi put on a flustered public performance that fostered little confidence that she would obey Congress or that the administration has a coherent political plan.\n \n\n   \n  There were also new indications of the depth of the bipartisan morass over Epstein and the likelihood that the release of Justice Department files could cause deep embarrassment for many prominent business and political leaders, entertainment stars and even royalty who associated with him.\n \n\n   \n  Larry Summers, a former Treasury secretary and top White House official in Democratic administrations  resigned from the board of OpenAI  after the release of emails revealed his friendly correspondence with Epstein. Summers also will not finish out the semester in his instructor role at Harvard University, a school spokesperson  confirmed Wednesday .\n \n\n   \n  And  Stacey Plaskett , a Democrat who represents the US Virgin Islands in Congress as a non-voting delegate, struggled for a convincing explanation of why she texted with Epstein during a congressional hearing in 2019.\n \n\n   \n  No one can say where this extraordinary scandal with far-reaching consequences will go next. But one thing is clear — it is deeply damaging Trump, both in wider public opinion and because of a never-before-seen split that it has opened in the MAGA movement.\n \n\n   \n  A newly released Marquette University poll — conducted November 5-12, before many of the saga’s latest developments — found that 74% of adults disapproved of Trump’s handling of the Epstein affair. And only 43% of Republicans approved. Marquette’s question asking Americans to choose their top issue didn’t include Epstein on the list. But it found that Americans cared deeply about the economy and the cost of living, on which they gave Trump overwhelmingly negative report cards.\n \n\n   \n    DOJ is yet to show its cards\n \n\n   \n  Such is the reputation of Trump’s Department of Justice — a fully coopted branch of his political machine — that few observers in Washington expect Bondi to follow the letter of the law just established by Congress.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer warned that his party would be ready to hold Trump to account. This shows that Democrats believe that Trump’s exposure to the Epstein drama will outweigh any embarrassment that disclosures could bring to other prominent Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  “There must be no funny business from Donald Trump,” Schumer said. “This bill is a command for the president to be fully transparent, to come fully clean, and to provide full honesty to the American people, even if he doesn’t want to.”\n \n\n   \n  Schumer referred to the possibility that the DOJ could seek an end run around the bill. It could potentially cite investigations into prominent Democrats and Epstein that Trump ordered last week to argue against the release of evidence. Another possibility is that evidence could be released but redacted in such a way as to make it almost meaningless on the premise that officials were protecting victims, witnesses or people who committed no criminal wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  Some Democrats fear the DOJ will scrub any references to the president himself in the files. There has been no evidence of criminal wrongdoing by Trump in relation to Epstein. But emails released by Congress showed  multiple mentions of him  by Epstein and his jailed associate Ghislaine Maxwell.\n \n\n   \n  Connecticut Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal told CNN’s John Berman on Wednesday that he had “no trust, no confidence whatsoever … that this Justice Department will be evenhanded or fair in the disclosure of these files.” He added, “It will be on us in Congress, and hopefully a bipartisan effort, to scrutinize and oversee this process.”\n \n\n   \n  The Republican rebellion against Trump on the Epstein files — an issue that obsesses parts of the Republican base — is one thing. But it’s unclear whether GOP lawmakers would risk the kind of vigorous oversight to which they’ve never subjected Trump to force his compliance with their law. Pressure from Epstein victims could be important in this regard.\n \n\n   \n  Several senators expressed hopes Wednesday that the administration would show good faith. Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley said he’d “be really surprised” if the DOJ refused to release all the required information “given the huge bipartisan” support for the measure. Missouri’s other senator, Eric Schmitt, said that “all the credible information that can be released should be released.” And Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois told CNN’s Manu Raju he hoped Trump wouldn’t “defy the act of Congress.”\n \n\n   \n  At the Justice Department, Bondi was asked why she had agreed to Trump’s  demand to investigate Democrats over Epstein  — which critics say was an archly political move — after arguing earlier this year that the evidence suggested no new probes were necessary.\n \n\n   \n  “Information. Information. There’s information that, new information, additional information,” Bondi said, while offering no clarity on the situation. And she repeatedly told reporters, “We will follow the law, we will continue to follow the law, while protecting victims and also providing maximum transparency.”\n \n\n   \n  This only underscored the great unknowns about what will happen next. Given the extraordinary movement in the saga so far, it seems impossible to believe that the files won’t come out, somehow, eventually. If the administration stalls or obstructs, it’s possible DOJ whistleblowers will emerge.\n \n\n   \n  Republican lawmakers keen to get to Trump’s right on the issue ahead of midterm elections might discover a political motive to join colleagues like  Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene  in pushing for transparency. GOP Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky has warned he’d be ready to read aspects of the evidence surrounding Epstein into the record of the House. And a delay could help Democrats weaponize the issue ahead of midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  The survivors will be waiting.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m hoping that they’re going to do the right thing and release everything,” Sharlene Rochard, a victim of Epstein’s abuse, told CNN’s Audie Cornish. “We just want proof that this happened to us. … And we want to help other girls (so) that — that this doesn’t happen again.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/politics/nancy-mace-cory-mills-censure","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"20:39:00-05:00","title":"House Refers Nancy Mace’s Censure Motion Against Cory Mills to Ethics Committee","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A group of Republican lawmakers, led by Nancy Mace, filed a formal censure motion against Florida Representative Cory Mills, citing multiple serious allegations including assault, threats to release explicit material, financial misconduct, and falsified military service records.

fellow Republican Cory Mills referred to House Ethics Committee \n       \n  By Veronica Stracqualursi, Ellis Kim, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:39 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The House on Wednesday night referred a Republican’s push to ​censure her fellow GOP colleague to the chamber’s Ethics Committee, beating back an effort to swiftly remove him from his committee assignments.\n \n\n   \n  Lawmakers voted 310-103 to send GOP Rep. Nancy Mace’s complaint against Florida Rep. Cory Mills to the committee, staving off another vote on the matter later this week. Mills had moved to refer it to the panel.\n \n\n   \n  The House Ethics committee revealed separately on Wednesday it voted to  establish  an investigative subcommittee to probe the various allegations that Mills is facing.\n \n\n   \n  Mace announced earlier in the day that she would seek to censure the Florida congressman and remove him from the House Armed Services and House Foreign Affairs committees, pointing to several controversies surrounding him. Though ultimately unsuccessful, seven Republicans – Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene, Anna Paulina Luna, Lauren Boebert, Harriet Hageman, Tim Burchett, Kat Cammack and Joe Wilson – joined with Mace to move it forward.\n \n\n   \n  Once considered rare in the House chamber, censure has been  used more frequently  in recent years and amounts to a significant rebuke of a member of Congress.\n \n\n   \n  The congresswoman’s attempt to reprimand Mills comes after House Democrats on Tuesday night  abandoned a separate censure measure  against the Florida Republican after a GOP effort to censure Democratic Del. Stacey Plaskett failed.\n \n\n   \n  Mills said in  a statement  Wednesday that there was no deal between lawmakers leading Democrats to pull the Tuesday resolution and that he and his team were surprised by the move.\n \n\n   \n  “Let me be perfectly clear, there was no backroom deal, no negotiation, and no quid pro quo of any kind that would’ve forced the Democrats to stand down on that vote against me. Anyone pushing that narrative is just wrong,” he said on X.\n \n\n   \n  Mace’s resolution to censure Mills points to individuals who served with Mills in the Army and dispute his version of events that led him to be recommended the Bronze Star, which was reported on by  NOTUS .\n \n\n   \n  Arguing that Mills’ conduct “brings discredit upon the House,” the resolution also outlines the  allegation of assault  against Mills and  accusations from  an ex-girlfriend that he threatened to release sexually explicit images and videos of her. The resolution also  mentions a judge’s order  that Mills is not to have any contact with that ex-girlfriend. Mills has denied any wrongdoing in both matters.\n \n\n   \n  Mace’s resolution also points to the  Office of Congressional Ethics’ findings  that Mills may have entered into or held contracts with federal agencies while serving as a member of Congress, which is in violation of House rules. It also cites the ethics office’s finding that Mills may have omitted required information in his financial disclosure statements and accepted excessive contributions to his campaign.\n \n\n   \n  “These allegations are far too serious to ignore,” Mace said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  “A member of Congress accused of assaulting women, profiting off federal contracts from his seat, and inflating or falsifying his service record has no business anywhere near national-security committees. This isn’t about partisan politics, it’s about protecting the integrity of this institution and the safety of women,” she added.\n \n\n   \n   This headline and story have been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/weather/thanksgiving-weather-forecast-travel-climate","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"03:12:00-04:00","title":"Here’s where the weather could mess with your Thanksgiving travel plans","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As Thanksgiving approaches, the article details potential weather-related travel disruptions for over 80 million Americans planning to travel at least 50 miles.

weather could mess with your Thanksgiving travel plans \n       \n  By CNN Meteorologist Mary Gilbert\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:12 AM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Thanksgiving is a week away and more than 80 million Americans are planning to travel at least 50 miles from home. But the weather has the potential to disrupt their visits with family and friends.\n \n\n   \n  Most of those travelers — 73 million — are expected to hit the road with about 6 million set to take to the skies, according to estimates from  AAA .\n \n\n   \n  There are no major storms on the horizon in the run up to Thanksgiving, so the overall potential for major weather-induced disruptions is lower than recent years, but pockets of wet and windy weather could still cause less-widespread issues.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what Mother Nature is serving up over the next several days. To make it easier to skim, we’ve rated potential disruptions each day on a scale of 1 — minimal issues — to 5 — impossible travel.\n \n\n   \n    This weekend\n \n\n   \n   Disruption potential: 2 out of 5 \n \n\n   \n  Saturday will be rainy at times for parts of the East. Rain isn’t likely to be heavy enough to cause problems on its own, but it could prompt some slow-going road travel, especially early. The dreary weather could also lower visibility at times, potentially causing delays at large airport hubs from Washington, DC, to New York City.\n \n\n   \n  On the other side of the country, a storm will bring wet weather to parts of Southern California and the Desert Southwest on Saturday as it tracks near the US-Mexico border. It will be a soggy travel day for places not used to it ,  like San Diego and Phoenix.\n \n\n   \n  That same storm will continue tracking east on Sunday, bringing wet weather to lower elevations and perhaps some snow to mountainous areas of the Four Corners region. Rain will also start to push into the Southern Plains during the day but will likely get heavier overnight.\n \n\n   \n    Monday\n \n\n   \n   Disruption potential: 3 out of 5 \n \n\n   \n  Soaking rain is possible in the Southern Plains, especially in much of Texas and parts of southern Oklahoma. This rain could be heavy enough to cause flooding issues.\n \n\n   \n  Dallas and Austin, Texas, are already under a Level 2 of 4 risk of flooding rain Sunday into Monday morning, according to the Weather Prediction Center. Heavy rain could be a major pain point for travelers flying out of Dallas Fort Worth International Airport.\n \n\n   \n  Travelers in the East have better conditions expected — largely dry and not very windy. Much of the West is in a similar position except for some rain and high-elevation snow from a storm set to hit the Pacific Northwest.\n \n\n   \n    Tuesday\n \n\n   \n   Disruption potential: 2 out of 5 \n \n\n   \n  The forecast gets a little trickier to pinpoint by Tuesday. It’s likely that a stretch of wet weather develops in the central US and also impacts parts of the Mississippi Valley.\n \n\n   \n  But exactly which areas record rain and exactly how much falls is still coming into focus. It depends on whether Monday’s Pacific Northwest storm merges with the storm in the southern Plains.\n \n\n   \n  If the two storms merge, soaking rain and low clouds are possible from Texas and Louisiana up through the Midwest. That could disrupt flights headed through hubs in Chicago, Minneapolis and St. Louis.\n \n\n   \n  If the storms stay separated, however, it could remain dry in Chicago and Minneapolis with rain concentrated more in the lower and middle portions of the Mississippi Valley.\n \n\n   \n    Wednesday\n \n\n   \n   Disruption potential: 2 out of 5 \n \n\n   \n  A large portion of both the West and central US appear to be dry for last-minute Thanksgiving travels as storm-suppressing high pressure takes over.\n \n\n   \n  Disruptive weather could unfold farther east on Wednesday. Exactly how far east depends on how Tuesday’s storms play out. Parts of the mid-Atlantic and Northeast could have to navigate wet, cloudy weather during the day. A mix of rain and snow is possible in northern New England, especially later in the day.\n \n\n   \n  It’ll get windier throughout the day, regardless of how wet it is. Breezy to borderline windy conditions could cause some flight disruptions in major metro airports from Washington, DC, to Boston. Similar conditions could also impact the Great Lakes and cause issues for Chicago’s airports.\n \n\n   \n    Thanksgiving:\n \n\n   \n   Disruption potential: 1 out of 5 \n \n\n   \n  As if on cue, much of the country looks to dry out for Thanksgiving Day. The exceptions could be in the Great Lakes due to some lake-effect snow, and perhaps the Southeast coast from some lingering rain.\n \n\n   \n  Chilly but seasonable temperatures are expected for much of the central and eastern US. The day could end up being a little toasty for parts of the West and areas along the Gulf Coast.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/politics/russia-ukraine-white-house-plan","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"20:53:00-04:00","title":"Trump Administration Quietly Attempting to Hammer Out New Peace Plan with Russia","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration, through special envoy Steve Witkoff, is quietly advancing a new peace plan with Russia aimed at ending the war in Ukraine.

The negotiations accelerated this week as the administration feels the Kremlin has signaled a renewed openness to a deal, the source added.\n \n\n   \n  Army Secretary Dan Driscoll and a top-level Pentagon delegation arrived this morning in Ukraine “on a fact finding mission to meet with Ukrainian officials and discuss efforts to end the war,” Army Spokesperson Col. Dave Butler said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  The mission, at the direction of the president, was part of the White House effort to resuscitate peace talks, according to a separate source who is a US official.\n \n\n   \n  Driscoll was expected to discuss battlefield conditions and weapons needs with President Volodymyr Zelensky and other senior Ukrainian officials, as well as the nascent peace efforts, the official said.\n \n\n   \n   The Wall Street Journal  first reported on the US delegation traveling to Kyiv.\n \n\n   \n  In a post on Telegram, Ukrainian Defense Minister Denys Shmyhal wrote that he had the honor of meeting with Driscoll, posting a photo of the two men shaking hands.\n \n\n   \n  Shmyhal expressed “gratitude” to the US for its “important support that saves the lives of Ukrainians every day.” He added that he “presented to partners our developments in the field of defense innovations” and “focused on the next steps to implement the historic defense agreements reached by President Zelensky and President Trump.”\n \n\n   \n  Driscoll has not been publicly involved in the last rounds of peace talks, but he is a close ally of Vice President JD Vance, with whom he attended Yale Law School. He has focused on military acquisitions.\n \n\n   \n  Other officials traveling with Driscoll to Kyiv were Army Chief of Staff Gen. Randy George; Gen. Chris Donahue, the top US Army commander in Europe; and Sergeant Major of the Army Michael Weimer.\n \n\n   \n  Russian sources also confirmed to CNN that there are ongoing high-level contacts between US and Russian officials, including Witkoff.\n \n\n   \n  Russian Special Envoy  Kirill Dmitriev went to the US in October  to meet Witkoff and others and had what a Russian source told CNN were “very productive discussions.”\n \n\n   \n  According to an  Axios report , the current draft being hashed out between Washington and Moscow is focused on 28 points, including security guarantees for Ukraine and Europe, as well as future US relations with Russia and Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  The Kremlin on Wednesday downplayed the Axios report. When asked about it, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that there are “no new developments to report so far” regarding an end to the war.\n \n\n   \n  “There were discussions in Anchorage. Beyond what was discussed in Anchorage, there have been no updates yet,” he said, referencing a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Trump in Alaska in August.\n \n\n   \n  Europe and Ukraine’s involvement in the talks so far remains unclear, the source familiar said, as well as whether they would support such a plan.\n \n\n   \n  In her first public remarks since reports of the new deal, European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas on Thursday told reporters that “for any plan to work, it needs Ukrainians and Europeans on board.”\n \n\n   \n  Attending the same meeting in Brussels, Poland’s foreign minister Radoslaw Sikorski said “we command peace efforts, but… it’s, of course, Europe’s security that’s at stake. So we expect to be consulted,” Reuters reported.\n \n\n   \n  Secretary of State Marco Rubio in a social media post Wednesday evening indicated that the Trump administration is in communication with both Kyiv and Moscow to come up with ideas for possible peace plans.\n \n\n   \n  “Ending a complex and deadly war such as the one in Ukraine requires an extensive exchange of serious and realistic ideas,” he said on X, noting that a lasting peace would also require difficult concessions from both sides. “That is why we are and will continue to develop a list of potential ideas for ending this war based on input from both sides of this conflict.”\n \n\n   \n  The White House declined to respond to a request for comment.\n \n\n   \n  The discussions come as the Trump administration has tried repeatedly to find an end to the war, only for talks to fall apart after Putin refused to make substantial commitments to the effort.\n \n\n   \n  “I thought that was going to be my easy one, because I have a good relationship with President Putin, but I’m a little disappointed in President Putin right now,” Trump said during remarks at a US-Saudi investment conference Wednesday. “He knows that.”\n \n\n   \n  After Trump  spoke with Putin by phone last month , he was so convinced there was enough progress made that he announced would soon be traveling to Budapest for an in-person summit with the Russian leader.\n \n\n   \n  But just five days later, the  summit was off  and  new sanctions on Moscow  — the first of Trump’s second administration — were on.\n \n\n   \n  US officials told CNN that in the time between, the president and his administration came to the conclusion that Putin’s stance on ending the war had not significantly shifted from the last time he  met Trump on a US air base in Alaska .\n \n\n   \n  Previous US peace talks had focused on freezing Russian and Ukrainian troops along current battle lines. Europe and Ukraine backed the plan as a jumping off point for fresh negotiations, while the Kremlin rejected the proposal, arguing they were not interested in a ceasefire but a longer-term peace deal.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Haley Britzky contributed to this report. \n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/health/byheart-formula-recall-botulism-grows","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"20:37:00-05:00","title":"As infant botulism cases climb to 31, recalled ByHeart baby formula is still on some store shelves","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A growing number of infant botulism cases — now totaling 31 across 15 U.S. states — have been linked to the consumption of ByHeart infant formula, which was found to be contaminated with Clostridium botulinum.

31, recalled ByHeart baby formula is still on some store shelves \n       \n  By Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:37 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As cases of potentially deadly botulism in babies who drank ByHeart infant formula continue to grow, state officials say they are still finding the  recalled product  on some store shelves.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile the company reported late Wednesday that laboratory tests confirmed that some samples of formula were contaminated with the type of bacteria that has sickened more than 30 babies in the outbreak.\n \n\n   \n  Tests by an independent food safety laboratory found Clostridium botulinum, a bacterium that produces toxins that can lead to potentially life threatening illness in babies younger than 1, the company said on its website. ByHeart officials said they notified the U.S. Food and Drug Administration of the findings but did not specify how many samples were tested or how many were positive.\n \n\n   \n  “We are working to investigate the facts, conduct ongoing testing to identify the source, and ensure this does not happen to families again,” ByHeart said on its website.\n \n\n   \n  The FDA did not immediately respond to questions about the findings.\n \n\n   \n  The lab results come as investigators in at least three states found ByHeart formula still for sale even after the New York-based company recalled all products nationwide, officials told The Associated Press.\n \n\n   \n  At least 31 babies in 15 states who drank ByHeart formula have been hospitalized and treated for infantile botulism since August,  federal health officials said Wednesday.  They range in age from about 2 weeks to about 6 months, with the most recent case reported on Nov. 13.\n \n\n   \n  No deaths have been reported.\n \n\n   \n  In Oregon, nine of more than 150 stores checked still had the formula on shelves this week, a state agriculture official said. In Minnesota, investigators conducted 119 checks between Nov. 13 and Nov. 17 and removed recalled products from sale at four sites, an agriculture department official said. An Arizona health official also said they found the product available.\n \n\n   \n  Businesses and consumers should remain alert, Minnesota officials said in a statement. “No affected product should be sold or consumed,” they wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration conducted inspections at ByHeart manufacturing plants in Allerton, Iowa, and Portland, Oregon. No results from the inspections have been reported.\n \n\n   \n  California officials previously confirmed the germ that can lead to illness in an open can of ByHeart formula fed to a baby who fell ill.\n \n\n   \n   Infant botulism,  which can cause paralysis and death, is caused by a type of bacteria that forms spores that germinate in a baby’s gut and produce a toxin.\n \n\n   \n  Symptoms can take up to 30 days to develop and include constipation, poor feeding, a weak cry, drooping eyelids or a flat facial expression. Babies can develop weakness in their limbs and head and may feel “floppy.” They can have trouble swallowing or breathing.\n \n\n   \n  ByHeart had been manufacturing about 200,000 cans of formula per month. It was sold online or at retail stores such as Target and Walmart. A Walmart spokesperson said the company swiftly issued a restriction that prevented sale of the formula, removed the product from stores and notified consumers who had bought it. Customers can visit any store for a refund of the formula, which sold for about $42 per can.\n \n\n   \n  Federal and state health officials are concerned that some parents and caregivers may still have ByHeart products in their homes. They are advising consumers to stop using the product — including formula in cans and any singe-serve sticks. They also suggest marking it “DO NOT USE” and keeping it for at least a month in case a baby develops symptoms. In that case, the formula would need to be tested.\n \n\n   \n  The California health department operates the Infant Botulism Treatment and Prevention Program, which tracks cases and distributes treatment for the disease. Officials there have launched a public hotline at 833-398-2022, which is staffed with health officials from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. Pacific Standard Time.\n \n\n   \n  The new hotline was created after calls from hundreds of parents and caregivers flooded a different, longstanding hotline for doctors to discuss suspected infant botulism cases, officials said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/politics/what-we-know-epstein-files","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"13:05:00-20:00","title":"Trump Signs Bill to Release Epstein Case Files; Public Records Reveal Ties to High-Profile Figures","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has signed a bill directing the Department of Justice (DOJ) to release all records from the federal investigation into Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.

Here’s what we know about them \n       \n  By Haven Orecchio-Egresitz, Kara Scannell, Evan Perez, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:05 AM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump said on social media Wednesday he has  signed the bill  that directs the Justice Department to publicly release all records amassed by federal prosecutors during the sex trafficking investigation and prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein and his accomplice  Ghislaine Maxwell .\n \n\n   \n  The question of what is actually in those pages — and whether the public will ever see all of those documents — has become a headache for Trump and his administration.\n \n\n   \n  On November 12, the House Oversight Committee released  20,000 more pages  of records it received from Epstein’s estate, including emails in which Epstein insulted Trump and appeared to coordinate his response with Maxwell to a lawsuit brought by accuser Virginia Giuffre.\n \n\n   \n  At this point, though — six years after Epstein died in his New York prison cell — the public has gotten its hands on many records related to the disgraced financier and his alleged child sex trafficking ring.\n \n\n   \n  Some documents have come from the criminal trial and case file of Maxwell, Epstein’s onetime girlfriend. Others   came from Epstein’s estate, which provided the records to the House Oversight Committee in response to a subpoena.\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear what new information, if any, is stuffed in the boxes of evidence within the Justice Department.\n \n\n   \n  Some of it, such as records that detail the physical and sexual abuse of women and girls, may never be released.\n \n\n   \n  The Epstein files are made of over 300 gigabytes of data, paper, video, photographs, and audio that live within the FBI’s main electronic case management system, “Sentinel.” These records would include investigative reports and records from the FBI Miami field division’s original Epstein investigation. The bulk of the records would come from the second investigation carried out by the FBI’s New York Office, including memorandums about the investigation and potential targets, locations to be searched, records to be subpoenaed, and hundreds of pages of “302s,” which are the forms that FBI agents use to memorialize what witnesses, victims and suspects said in interviews with investigators.\n \n\n   \n  The case has continued to fascinate the public, years after Epstein’s death, due to his ties to powerful people. Politicians, including Trump, and celebrities have been publicly linked to Epstein for years — sometimes by appearing in flight logs or at events — and all have denied any wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  Epstein’s death by suicide before trial launched conspiracy theories and deprived many of his accusers a public airing of his conduct. Maxwell was convicted of sex trafficking minors following a four-week trial in 2021.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, after the most recent release of estate records announced he was asking Attorney General Pam Bondi  to investigate Epstein’s ties  to many other high-profile Democrats, including former President Bill Clinton, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman — as well as the bank JPMorgan Chase.\n \n\n   \n  Bondi later announced on X that  Jay Clayton , the US attorney in Manhattan, will lead the federal investigation.\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear whether opening a new criminal investigation would prevent the release of the highly anticipated Justice Department records.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we do and don’t know about the Epstein records:\n \n\n   \n    Grand jury\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department had asked federal judges in New York to unseal grand jury transcripts from Epstein and Maxwell’s criminal cases. Former federal prosecutors say the transcripts likely contain a miniscule amount of evidence from the investigations.\n \n\n   \n  Federal prosecutors in New York generally call law enforcement agents to testify before the grand jury to present just enough evidence they need to support an indictment. Other witnesses, including accusers, are rarely called in to testify before federal grand juries in New York.\n \n\n   \n  The judges overseeing the two cases in New York asked DOJ for more legal argument for why they should unseal grand jury material, which is rarely done. In August, two federal judges in New York  declined Justice Department requests  to unseal grand jury information in Epstein and Maxwell’s cases.\n \n\n   \n  A federal judge in Florida also denied DOJ’s request to unseal grand jury transcripts from its 2005 and 2007 investigations into Epstein, stating the department didn’t meet the legal hurdle to do so under the rules governing the circuit.\n \n\n   \n    Search warrants\n \n\n   \n  Federal prosecutors and the FBI obtained a trove of information during the searches of Epstein’s homes in Florida, New York and Little Saint James, Epstein’s private Caribbean island. That information is under the control of DOJ and is not blocked from public release by secrecy rules.\n \n\n   \n  FBI officials recovered thousands of nude and seminude photographs of young females, including at least of one minor, in a search of his Manhattan mansion in the days following his arrest. Binders of CDs containing the photos were seized. Agents used a saw to open a safe that had more than $70,000 in cash, 48 loose diamond stones, one as large as 2.38 carats, and a large diamond ring.\n \n\n   \n  They also collected documents from the New York home, including notes, messages with names and contact information for certain victims, and phone records.\n \n\n   \n  A search of Epstein’s private island was conducted days after he was found dead in a jail cell about one month after his arrest. By then the investigation had shifted its focus to any co-conspirators of Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  In February, the Justice Department provided an  index  of evidence it has. The index includes over two dozen computers, numerous hard drives, at least two cell phones, and four iPads. The index says there are boat trip logs potentially of who traveled to his private island — that information has not been made public.\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department does not release child pornography so those records would not be expected to be made public under any circumstance.\n \n\n   \n    Florida DOJ case file\n \n\n   \n  Federal prosecutors in New York obtained the investigative record from the earlier investigations into Epstein conducted by their counterparts in Florida in 2007 and 2009. Any of those records that were not covered by grand jury secrecy rules could be released.\n \n\n   \n    Civil lawsuits\n \n\n   \n  Much of the public record relating to Epstein has derived from civil lawsuits brought by accusers, some filed under their own names and others using Jane Doe pseudonyms. Judges have  ordered  the release of thousands of pages of documents, including depositions taken under oath.\n \n\n   \n  Among the famous names referenced in those  documents  are Trump, Clinton, Britain’s Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, French modeling scout Jean-Luc Brunel, American investor Glenn Dubin, and Leslie Wexner, the CEO of L Brands. Not all of them were accused of wrongdoing, and all of them have denied any wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  Two financial institutions, Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan Chase — where Epstein held bank accounts — also reached settlements with survivors and others.\n \n\n   \n  Records from a lawsuit brought by the US Virgin Islands, where Epstein owned Little Saint James, against JPMorgan Chase revealed details about Epstein’s  financial transactions  with Wall Street titans and his practice of withdrawing large amounts of cash. JPMorgan filed numerous suspicious activity reports with the Treasury Department flagging those transactions.\n \n\n   \n    Maxwell trial\n \n\n   \n  Maxwell’s four-week criminal trial was a public airing of her close relationship to Epstein and her role recruiting, grooming and at times participating in the sexual abuse of minors with Epstein. Four women testified about being sexually assaulted when they were minors.\n \n\n   \n  Epstein’s former pilot  testified  and identified people he saw on Epstein’s plane, including Trump, former Sens. John Glenn and George Mitchell,   Andrew, actor Kevin Spacey, and violinist Itzhak Perlman. The pilot said he never saw any wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  Gawker first published a copy in 2015 of Epstein’s so-called black book with names and phone numbers of his contacts. The Justice Department released a redacted version of it earlier this year as well as copies of the flight logs that were made public during Maxwell’s criminal trial.\n \n\n   \n  The release was criticized by some of Trump’s supporters because the information was already public — and did nothing to answer lingering questions.\n \n\n   \n    The estate\n \n\n   \n  In November, the House Oversight Committee released about 20,000 pages of documents it received from Epstein’s estate through a subpoena — materials the Department of Justice said it didn’t previously have access to.\n \n\n   \n  The documents included emails sent by Epstein. In one dated April 2, 2011, Epstein emailed Maxwell: “i want you to realize that that dog that hasn’t barked is trump.. REDACTED spent hours at my house with him ,, he has never once been mentioned. police chief. etc. im 75 % there.” GOP members of the House Oversight Committee  identified  the person as Giuffre. In one January 2019 email, Epstein wrote to author Michael Wolff: “trump said he asked me to resign, never a member ever. . of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop.” The emails also showed an apparent effort between Epstein and Maxwell to coordinate how they would respond to a lawsuit from Giuffre.\n \n\n   \n  The recent release   was the second time that the House Oversight Committee released documents from Epstein’s estate.\n \n\n   \n  In September, the committee put out a tranche of records, including a reported collection of birthday letters gifted to Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  The panel has been investigating the case and  had subpoenaed  the estate for documents as part of its probe.\n \n\n   \n  In a  social media exchange  last week, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche claimed that law enforcement did not have access to the estate documents at the time of his interview with Maxwell this summer.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details.

Further details to follow!”\n \n\n   \n  Dora Pekec, a spokesperson for the mayor-elect, confirmed the meeting in a statement, saying, “As is customary for an incoming mayoral administration, the Mayor-elect plans to meet with the President in Washington to discuss public safety, economic security and the affordability agenda that over one million New Yorkers voted for just two weeks ago.”\n \n\n   \n  Shortly before Trump announced the meeting, Mamdani confirmed his camp had reached out to arrange a meeting with the president in an interview with MS NOW.\n \n\n   \n  “We did reach out to the White House – and my team reached out because of a commitment that I made to New Yorkers, that I would be willing to meet with anyone and everyone, so long as it was to the benefit 8.5 million people who call the city home and their struggle to afford the most expensive city United States of America,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  A meeting between Trump and Mamdani would cap off months of acrimony between the two New Yorkers, who have traded barbs on the stump and in the press since Mamdani’s victory in the Democratic primary in June.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has used the Democratic Socialist Mamdani as a foil, seeking to link his politics to Democrats across the country and deriding him as “my little communist” in remarks from the Oval Office. He also threatened ahead of the election to take federal funding from New York City if Mamdani won.\n \n\n   \n  For his part, Mamdani directly addressed the president in his victory speech  moments after clinching the mayor’s race this month , joking, “Donald Trump, since I know you’re watching, I have four words for you: Turn the volume up.”\n \n\n   \n  Returning to the White House from his West Palm Beach home Sunday, Trump teased a meeting with Mamdani, telling reporters at Joint Base Andrews, “The mayor of New York, I will say, would like to meet with us, and we’ll work something out. But he, he would like to come to Washington and meet. And we’ll work something out. We want to see everything work out well for New York.”\n \n\n   \n  In the final stretches of the mayoral race, Trump had struck a far more antagonistic tone,  throwing his weight behind former Democratic governor and independent candidate Andrew Cuomo  in the hopes of stalling Mamdani’s momentum.\n \n\n   \n  “If Communist Candidate Zohran Mamdani wins the Election for Mayor of New York City, it is highly unlikely that I will be contributing Federal Funds, other than the very minimum as required, to my beloved first home, because of the fact that, as a Communist, this once great City has ZERO chance of success, or even survival!” Trump wrote just two days before Election Day.\n \n\n   \n  Previewing a potential meeting with Trump Wednesday, Mamdani told MS Now, “I want to just speak plainly to the president about what it means to actually stand up for New Yorkers and the way in which New Yorkers are struggling to afford this city, and frankly, cost of living is something that I heard time and time again from New Yorkers about why they voted for Donald Trump.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/politics/ryan-wedding-justice-charges","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"19:34:00-05:00","title":"Federal officials unveil more charges against the former Olympic snowboarder accused of running international drug ring","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Federal officials have unveiled new charges against Ryan James Wedding, a former Canadian Olympic snowboarder, accusing him of running an international drug trafficking ring that transported cocaine from Colombia through Mexico into the U.S. and Canada.

Trump said Wednesday night he had signed it.\n \n\n   \n  Now the question has quickly become: Will the Trump administration  actually release everything  the Justice Department has? Plenty of supporters of the legislation, including Republicans, have been quick to caution that this isn’t the end of the matter — that the White House might still have ways to get around that.\n \n\n   \n  “The real test will be: Will the Department of Justice release the files?” Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia said Tuesday. “Or will it all remain tied up in investigations?”\n \n\n   \n  GOP Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky — the co-sponsor of the effort in the House to force a vote on the issue — has warned of a “last-ditch effort” by the administration to block the release of the files.\n \n\n   \n  These lawmakers have good reason to worry, based on the administration’s actions and comments. Attorney General Pam Bondi on Wednesday declined to provide assurances beyond saying the administration would “follow the law.”\n \n\n   \n  But it’s also difficult to see how the administration could not follow through with releasing the files — at least without risking yet another major political fiasco.\n \n\n   \n    The administration’s suspicious moves\n \n\n   \n  First, some background. There is a clear path for the administration to try and hold some documents back.\n \n\n   \n  It goes like this:\n \n\n   \n  That’s a very convenient progression of events if your goal is to try and withhold documents.\n \n\n   \n  Suddenly an investigation that was completely exhausted and needed to be closed has some supposedly juicy new leads that are worth pursuing. And this happens right at the time when Trump needs just such a pretext to keep avoiding full disclosure.\n \n\n   \n  There are certainly other reasons for Trump to want those investigations – including making it look like it’s  other  people (ones often associated with Democrats) who have Epstein problems, and not him. (Neither Trump nor the people he asked to be investigated have been accused by law enforcement of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.)\n \n\n   \n    The administration has played games on this before\n \n\n   \n  There are other reasons to be suspicious about how the administration might handle this.\n \n\n   \n  For one, it’s  already been  shown to be playing games  on Epstein disclosures.\n \n\n   \n  When the situation first blew up in its face in July, the administration’s first big effort to quell the backlash was to push for judges to release grand jury materials. But as plenty of experts quickly noted, that was unlikely to actually shed much light for a host of reasons.\n \n\n   \n  Sure enough, it did not shed much light. But not only that; two judges suggested the administration was proactively creating a “diversion.” One said the move appeared “ aimed not at full disclosure but at the illusion of such .”\n \n\n   \n  Both noted the government had much more extensive information at its fingertips that it could release whenever it wanted to.\n \n\n   \n  Given this, it wouldn’t seem ridiculous to ask whether the administration might play games with whatever discretion it has — say, by releasing information that’s politically advantageous but withholding other information using the available justifications.\n \n\n   \n    Why Trump and Co. have said they didn’t want full disclosure\n \n\n   \n  And then there are the many things Trump and top officials have said warning about the dangers of full disclosure.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has repeatedly cited the need to protect “innocent” people – not just victims, but also people whose names turn up in the documents who did nothing wrong. Just corresponding with Epstein, for example, would not be a crime.\n \n\n   \n  “You got a lot of people that could be mentioned in those files that don’t deserve to be,” Trump said in August, “because (Epstein) knew everybody in Palm Beach.”\n \n\n   \n  The FBI’s July memo that announced it wouldn’t be releasing any new documents cited a desire “to protect victims” and “not expose any additional third-parties to allegations of illegal wrongdoing.”\n \n\n   \n  FBI Director Kash Patel in September testimony to Congress and elsewhere has suggested that part of the reason the administration has resisted full disclosure was to guard against releasing pornography. He also suggested that releasing more information could violate court orders.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not going to break the law to satisfy your curiosity,” Patel told a House Democrat.\n \n\n   \n  And House Speaker Mike Johnson on Tuesday argued that the Epstein bill could hurt people whose “names may be in these files, and they had nothing to do with this.” The Louisiana Republican also made an impassioned case that the bill did not adequately prevent the release of child sexual abuse material, despite a clause intended to do that.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson ultimately voted for the bill, saying he hoped the Senate would amend it. But Senate Majority Leader John Thune apparently didn’t share his concerns, allowing the bill to pass by unanimous consent without amendment.\n \n\n   \n  Given all of this — and given Trump’s clear reluctance for months to grant such disclosure, right  up until the moment the battle appeared lost  — you could see how the administration might want to at least preserve its options.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said Sunday that Congress “can have whatever they are legally entitled to,” but the phrase “legally entitled to” certainly looms large, for the reasons mentioned above.\n \n\n   \n    But not releasing would be a huge risk\n \n\n   \n  Even if the administration is reserving its options or intends to withhold significant documents, it’s hard to see how doing that could pass muster politically.\n \n\n   \n  For one, the legislation requires the withholding of documents related to active investigations to be “narrowly tailored and temporary.” Trump has more than three years remaining in his presidency; it’s difficult to see the administration withholding significant information for that long citing active investigations.\n \n\n   \n  For another, anything that’s redacted or withheld must include a written justification, and the administration must notify Congress about these categories of documents within 15 days. The legislation also requires the administration to give Congress an unredacted “list of all government officials and politically exposed persons” included in the materials.\n \n\n   \n  In other words, it could be pretty easy to piece together if the administration is hiding extensive amounts of information. What’s more, attempting to do that could risk an even bigger backlash than the administration has already seen, from even its own base.\n \n\n   \n  That doesn’t mean the administration wouldn’t  attempt  to withhold documents. Its handling of this matter  has been baffling  throughout.\n \n\n   \n  But if it did, that would be among the most desperate and politically risky things the administration has done — and at a time when it can’t really keep taking such hits.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/entertainment/jonathan-joss-murder-texas-man-indicted","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"20:29:00Z","title":"Texas man indicted on murder charge in shooting of 'King of the Hill' voice actor Jonathan Joss","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A grand jury in Texas has indicted Sigfredo Ceja Alvarez on murder charges for the killing of Jonathan Joss, a well-known voice actor behind iconic roles on 'King of the Hill' and 'Parks and Recreation'.

Here’s what that could mean for his murder trial \n       \n  By Lauren del Valle, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:33 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A Massachusetts man on trial for murdering his wife in 2023 admitted this week that he disposed of her body in dumpsters and misled police, but his lawyers insist he is not admitting to her murder.\n \n\n   \n  Now, with attorneys still working to empanel the jury that will consider the murder charge still haunting him, the question becomes: How will  Brian Walshe’s  legal team defend him?\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, minutes before jury selection was set to begin for his murder trial, Walshe pleaded guilty to misleading police and the improper conveyance – or illegal disposal – of a human body stemming from the death of his wife, Ana Walshe. The   corporate real estate manager and mother of three  vanished around New Year’s 2023 .\n \n\n   \n  Walshe pleaded guilty to the lesser charges without a deal with prosecutors, who “refuse to negotiate,” according to a defense filing, “unless negotiations included the indictment charging murder.”\n \n\n   \n  Walshe still faces one count of first-degree murder, which, if convicted, carries a mandatory life sentence without the possibility of parole.\n \n\n   \n  The eleventh-hour guilty pleas Tuesday came as a shock – and piqued interest in Walshe’s defense strategy.\n \n\n   \n  The decision to have Walshe plead guilty to those charges is an “incredibly bold move by the defense,” said Ronald Sullivan, a Harvard law professor, and will allow the defense to focus the trial solely on the question of whether the defendant killed his wife, potentially limiting what evidence the jury will see about Walshe’s disposal of Ana’s remains.\n \n\n   \n  “It may well be a good strategic move for the defense,” said Sullivan.\n \n\n   \n  It’s also possible Walshe’s attorneys are maneuvering for their client to face lesser homicide charges in the hopes of avoiding life without parole.\n \n\n   \n  Under Massachusetts law, Walshe cannot plead guilty to first-degree murder, so the commonwealth would have to change course and agree to Walshe pleading guilty to a lesser homicide charge like second-degree murder or voluntary manslaughter, which could allow for the possibility of parole.\n \n\n   \n  As of now, Walshe’s attorneys have made clear he isn’t admitting to Ana’s murder, despite his change of pleas.\n \n\n   \n  “Mr. Walshe is prepared to admit to the recitation of facts with respect to the indictment that the government just read in so far as it alleges he did impede and obstruct the criminal investigation into the disappearance of Ana Walshe. We obviously object, and he’s not admitting to … murder,” defense attorney Kelli Porges said in court Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Jury selection continues Thursday. Judge Diane Freniere has ordered the chosen panelists to stay off social media and avoid the news to reduce their risk of exposure to coverage of Walshe’s case.\n \n\n   \n    How we got here\n \n\n   \n  Ana Walshe’s employer reported her missing on January 4, 2023, sparking a search that drew national media attention. When local police went to the Walshe home, Brian Walshe told officers his wife had left early New Year’s Day to return to Washington, DC for a work emergency, and he hadn’t seen or heard from her since.\n \n\n   \n  Ana Walshe, who lived and worked in DC, commuted to the Boston suburbs to see her family on December 30, 2022. Her former boss joined the family to celebrate on New Year’s Eve around 8 p.m. and told authorities he left around 1 a.m. the following day.\n \n\n   \n  The guest didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary, and told authorities the couple seemed happy, according to court records. He is expected to testify at trial.\n \n\n   \n  Walshe reportedly called Ana’s employer, Tishman Speyer, on January 4, 2023, asking about his wife, court records say, but he never reported her missing to the police.\n \n\n   \n  Walshe was arrested on January 8, 2023, for misleading police in connection to Ana’s disappearance. He was charged with her murder later that month, and he has been in commonwealth custody since his arrest.\n \n\n   \n  The trial was originally slated to begin last month, on October 20. But Judge Freniere granted a delay for Walshe to undergo a mental health evaluation.\n \n\n   \n  Walshe’s attorneys lobbied for the delay after he was stabbed in jail in September, expressing concern their client could not adequately assist in his defense following the attack. He was deemed competent to stand trial last week after a 40-day stint in a state hospital.\n \n\n   \n    Possible defense strategies\n \n\n   \n  Walshe’s defense team has kept its strategy close to the vest, rarely commenting in the media about the case since his arrest almost three years ago.\n \n\n   \n  Following his guilty pleas Tuesday, Walshe faces up to 10 years in prison for the charge of misleading police – which could be enhanced up to 20 years if he is convicted of Ana’s murder. He also faces up to three years in prison for pleading guilty to the conveyance charge.\n \n\n   \n  Separately, Walshe is serving a 37-month prison sentence tied to a federal case from 2018, in which Walshe pleaded guilty to charges connected to selling forged Andy Warhol artwork. That sentence is set to run concurrently with his prison time for the state case connected to his wife’s death.\n \n\n   \n  Walshe faces a charge of first-degree murder for Ana’s death. But before the jury begins deliberating, his attorneys could ask the judge to allow the panel to consider less severe homicide charges.\n \n\n   \n  It’s possible the judge would not grant the request, Sullivan said. But she would consider “if there are enough facts to support something, or the absence of contradictory facts – like nobody was there.”\n \n\n   \n  Brian and Ana Walshe and their three young children are the only people said to have been in their home after ringing in the New Year. At this point, there is no publicly released evidence to suggest how Ana Walshe died. Her body  has not been found .\n \n\n   \n  The success of the defense case could hinge on testimony by Walshe himself, who could take the stand to offer the jury a narrative of what happened after their dinner guest left around 1 a.m. on New Year’s Day. For example, his lawyers could claim Walshe is innocent of murder because a terrible accident caused Ana’s death, or provide some justification to support a theory that Walshe caused her death in self-defense.\n \n\n   \n  “The problem with these sorts of defenses is that there’s no corroboration, and the alleged victim is unable to say anything, because the person is deceased,” said Sullivan, who was on the defense team that secured an acquittal in the 2017 double homicide case against one-time NFL player Aaron Hernandez.\n \n\n   \n  “If he testifies and says, ‘We got into an argument, you know, she pulled a knife on me, and I defended myself,’ he gets to testify to that because there are no contrary facts there,” he said. “And, you know, no one else was around, and that’s the evidence.”\n \n\n   \n  “The jury can credit it or not credit it,” Sullivan added, “but that’s on the record at this point.”\n \n\n   \n    What we might see at trial\n \n\n   \n  Sullivan indicated Walshe’s guilty pleas this week for misleading the police and improper conveyance of a body suggested the defense felt the evidence against their client was substantial.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re saying, ‘We will eat everything for which there’s such overwhelming evidence … We’re not going to win that fight so let’s just say we did it,’” Sullivan said, channeling the defense’s possible perspective.\n \n\n   \n  “Now all (they’re) fighting over is whether the defendant caused the death of the decedent,” Sullivan said. “So, one thing instead of several things.”\n \n\n   \n  Before Walshe changed his plea on two of the three counts in the indictment, prosecutors had said they could call up to 60 witnesses in the commonwealth’s case against him. But the commonwealth’s witness list will likely be trimmed down now that prosecutors don’t need to establish that Walshe disposed of his wife’s body and belongings or that he lied about his activities in the days after her disappearance.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors will likely show the jury some evidence of Walshe’s activities in the days after he claims he last saw his wife – but less than what would have been necessary to prove the charges to which he’s now pleaded guilty.\n \n\n   \n  “What the judge will likely do is say, ‘Well, some of that will come in because it goes to your state of mind,’ and the jury can reasonably infer consciousness of guilt from some of these actions,” Sullivan said.\n \n\n   \n  For instance, records and video surveillance put Walshe at Lowe’s and Home Depot on January 1 and 2, 2023, buying a bevy of cleaning supplies with cash. Walshe was also seen on video surveillance throwing several black bags into dumpsters.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators searched a dumpster at the complex where Walshe’s mother lived and recovered a number of items, including a Tyvek suit, a hatchet, a hacksaw and several items with  Brian and Ana Walshe’s blood  and DNA on them. They also found some of Ana’s belongings, including her Hunter boots, a Prada purse and her Covid-19 vaccination card.\n \n\n   \n  Ana’s blood was also found in the basement of the Walshe family home.\n \n\n   \n  Additionally, prosecutors have alleged Walshe used his 6-year-old son’s iPad for  dozens of Google searches  on the morning of January 1, 2023, like, “How to get blood out of hardwood floors,” “how to dispose of a body in the trash” and “how to stop a body from decomposing.”\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors have suggested Walshe had a financial motive to kill his wife, to cash in on life insurance policies that would help him pay restitution tied to his federal art fraud conviction.\n \n\n   \n  They have also said it’s fair to assume Walshe knew his wife was  having an affair  with a man in Washington, DC and suggested he could have been motivated to kill her because of the romantic entanglement. The jury is expected to see text messages between Ana and the man, who is also expected to testify.\n \n\n   \n  Walshe’s attorneys argue there is no proof he knew about the affair before Ana’s disappearance. But prosecutors say Walshe Googled the man days before Ana vanished.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/sport/football-nfl-kris-boyd-jets-shooting","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"19:26:00-05:00","title":"Jets Cornerback Kris Boyd Starts Breathing on His Own After Being Shot in Manhattan","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Kris Boyd, a 29-year-old cornerback for the New York Jets, was shot in the abdomen in midtown Manhattan on Sunday, November 16, 2025, just after 2 a.m., and was transported to Bellevue Hospital in critical but stable condition.

grateful! I’m coming along, starting to breathe on my own now. Sincerely appreciate everyone!”\n \n\n   \n  The post came a few hours after Jets coach Aaron Glenn said he had spoken to Boyd and is confident Boyd will be OK. He added that Boyd was “upbeat” in their recent conversation.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s what eases my mind, is that he’s in good spirits,” Glenn said. “His wife and his kid, they’re in good spirits and he will walk away from this just fine.”\n \n\n   \n  Glenn was unsure when Boyd might be released from the hospital, where he has been listed in critical but stable condition.\n \n\n   \n  “Don’t know just yet,” the coach said. “But I will say this, just talking to him, he felt really upbeat.

moved to repeal a controversial provision in the government funding law that allows senators to sue the Justice Department for up to $500,000 when their phone records are seized without their knowledge.\n \n\n   \n  The provision, included in the legislation that ended the historic shutdown, requires senators be notified when federal investigators access their phone records, with some exceptions. If they’re not notified, the lawmakers can sue the federal government for up to $500,000 in damages for each violation.\n \n\n   \n  House members publicly wary of the measure voted 426-0 to nullify the provision. But its future remains in doubt in the Senate, where Majority Leader John Thune had added it to the bill at the request of several members of his conference.\n \n\n   \n   Tucked into one of the appropriations bills , the language comes after Senate Republicans released FBI records related to an investigation called “Arctic Frost,” which pertained to the fake elector scheme from 2020 where Donald Trump allies pressured GOP electors to register Electoral College votes for Trump from states that former President Joe Biden won.\n \n\n   \n  It’s caused bipartisan furor on Capitol Hill and spotlighted a rare divide between the top Republican leaders. House Speaker Mike Johnson said he was blindsided by the measure, while Thune has resolutely stood behind it.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re striking the provision as fast as we can, and we expect the Senate to move it,” Republican Rep. Chip Roy of Texas told CNN Tuesday. “We believe there’s a fairly sizable growing majority over there that believes that they should strike it.”\n \n\n   \n  Some of the senators whose phone records were seized as part of Arctic Frost have tried to distance themselves from the legislation and  say they won’t seek  monetary damages.\n \n\n   \n  Missouri GOP Sen. Josh Hawley called it a “bad idea.”\n \n\n   \n  “I’m all for accountability. I mean, I had my phone tapped, so I’m all for accountability, don’t get me wrong, but I just, I think taking taxpayer money is not the way to do it. The way to do it is tough oversight,” he told reporters earlier Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for another member, Sen. Dan Sullivan, told CNN last week he does not plan on suing and is supportive of the House effort to repeal the provision.\n \n\n   \n  But at least one targeted senator is looking to reap gains.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Lindsey Graham on Wednesday said he plans on suing DOJ in his case for “far more” than $500,000, and advocated for expanding the measure to include private citizens.\n \n\n   \n  “You want to make sure that people who are going to issue subpoenas in the future against private citizens to get their phone records without a court order, I mean, without a warrant, have to think twice, and if the government doesn’t pay, you’re going to get more of this,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Mike Rounds, who was not one of the senators swept in Arctic Frost, explained that the measure was meant to “send a message to the administration that this can’t happen” in the wake of the news of then-special counsel Jack Smith’s subpoenas, though he predicted that many GOP senators would be “open for a reconsideration” depending on how the House approaches the issue.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Steve Daines, a Thune ally, said he doesn’t think House’s measure could pass the Senate, arguing that Smith’s move to obtain phone records of nine GOP lawmakers with grand jury subpoenas in his January 6 investigation was a “massive overreach.”\n \n\n   \n  “My name is not on the list, so I don’t benefit from this. This seems to be a strong pushback. I think the provision that Leader Thune put in there was appropriate, and I stand by his leadership,” he added.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/us/prairieland-detention-center-texas-guilty-pleas","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"19:00:00-05:00","title":"Five Accused of Supporting Antifa Plead Guilty to Terrorism-Related Offense After Texas Shooting","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Five individuals—Nathan Baumann, Joy Gibson, Seth Sikes, Lynette Sharp, and John Thomas—pleaded guilty to providing material support to terrorism after being linked to a July 4, 2025, shooting at the Prairieland Detention Center in Texas, where an antifa-related attack injured a police officer.

Days after that shooting, a man with an assault rifle  fired dozens of rounds  at federal agents and a U.S. Border Patrol facility in McAllen near the Mexico border, injuring a police officer.

   7:21 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A US appeals court has temporarily blocked an order curtailing federal immigration enforcement in Chicago, arguing the lower court judge overstepped when she imposed strict and wide-reaching restraints on how agents can interact with protesters and journalists.\n \n\n   \n  A three-judge panel for the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals on Wednesday granted the Trump administration’s emergency request to pause the order issued by US District Court Judge Sara Ellis earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  In an incremental victory for the Trump administration, the appeals panel concluded  Ellis’s order  was “too prescriptive,” writing in their decision that she is “impermissibly infringing” on the separation of powers between the executive branch and the courts.\n \n\n   \n  This is yet another twist in what has been a tense legal showdown in Chicago between the administration — which desires wide latitude to use force on protesters who it says are violently hindering its immigration agents — and the judge — who has expressed deep skepticism over the government’s presentation of the facts in court.\n \n\n   \n  For months, plaintiffs’ attorneys have complained to Ellis that federal agents have indiscriminately and without warning used chemical agents and other riot control measures against protesters — including members of the clergy — and reporters.\n \n\n   \n   Ellis’ order , issued November 6, prohibited several methods of force, including pulling or shoving; required federal agents to give warnings before deploying tear gas or other riot control weapons; and stipulated that almost all agents must wear clear identification and body cameras.\n \n\n   \n  The judge also ordered the government to turn over extensive use-of-force records and other internal records.\n \n\n   \n  But the appeals panel criticized the scope of Ellis’ order, saying it is so detailed it “resembled federal regulation.” They wrote that the order is so sweeping, it applies to almost any law enforcement personnel within the executive branch.\n \n\n   \n  “The district court’s order enjoins an expansive range of defendants, including the President of the United States, the entire Departments of Homeland Security and Justice, and anyone acting in concert with them,” the panel wrote in its decision.\n \n\n   \n  The order comes one day before Ellis is set to issue her written opinion in the case that has required a high-level Border Patrol agent, Greg Bovino, to  appear before her  in a downtown Chicago federal courtroom.\n \n\n   \n  However, the pause of Ellis’ order is only temporary as it considers the Trump administration’s larger appeal.\n \n\n   \n  “Do not overread today’s order,” the judges wrote, noting that they have a ream of facts to consider. “Those findings may support entry of a more tailored and appropriate preliminary injunction that directly addresses the First and Fourth Amendment claims raised by these plaintiffs.”\n \n\n   \n  At times, Ellis has chided ICE officials and federal attorneys in open court, saying their statements often “lack credibility.”\n \n\n   \n  The judge expressed particular skepticism over a confrontation between federal agents and protesters in which DHS said use of force was justified because Bovino was hit in the head with a rock thrown by a demonstrator. Video did not support the claim and “ defendant Bovino admitted that he lied ,” the judge said.\n \n\n   \n  In its written decision, the appeals panel appeared to question whether the plaintiffs suing the Trump administration still have a strong enough claim, as the federal presence in Chicago has tapered off while federal agents  flood into Charlotte, North Carolina, and prepare to enter New Orleans .\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration is battling on multiple legal fronts as it attempts to carry out what it hopes will be a history-making national immigration crackdown. As federal agents have rounded up thousands of migrants across  Tennessee, California, Oregon, Illinois and other states, it has been met with a wall of lawsuits from protesters, detainees and state and local governments who object to its escalating tactics.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/health/new-jersey-organ-transplant-investigation","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"18:45:00-05:00","title":"New Jersey Organ Procurement Organization Under Congressional Investigation After 'Alarming' Whistleblower Claims","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The US House Ways and Means Committee is investigating the New Jersey Organ and Tissue Sharing Network (NJTO) for 'extreme abuse of public trust' and potential illegal activity, including procuring organs from non-volunteers and continuing organ recovery on a patient who reanimated at Virtua Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Camden.

One of the incidents it highlights involves an unnamed patient at the Virtua Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Camden, New Jersey. The patient was pronounced dead and the network started the process to recover their organs, the letter says, but soon after the recovery process began, the person “reanimated.”\n \n\n   \n  The procurement team called the network’s chief executive officer to find out what to do. Witnesses told the committee that the CEO instructed the NJTO staff on site to “proceed with recovery,” according to the letter. “However, hospital staff intervened, and recovery did not move forward.”\n \n\n   \n  Neither the hospital nor the procurement organization responded to CNN’s requests for comment.\n \n\n   \n  The committee described the case as “shocking” and “alarming” and said several whistleblowers told investigators that documents with regard to details about the case were deleted or manipulated.\n \n\n   \n  The committee’s letter also alleges that the New Jersey Sharing Network misused documents to tell patients’ families it had authority to remove organs, even if the patient was not currently listed as an organ donor on their driver’s license or, in some cases, had withdrawn their permission to donate; may have procured and thrown out hundreds of organs just to meet federal metrics; and gave organs to people out of sequence on the transplant list.\n \n\n   \n  “This is unacceptable,” the letter says. “The organs procured by every [organ procurement organization] across the country belong to the individuals on the waitlist who are ranked and matched using medical criteria. They do not belong to the OPOs, and it is not NJTO’s role to pick winners and losers on the transplant waiting list.”\n \n\n   \n  The letter also says the organization has made misleading statements to Congress throughout the investigation.\n \n\n   \n  “These allegations raise questions about whether NJTO should keep its tax-exempt status and highlights the need for potential legislative reforms,” the letter says.\n \n\n   \n  The House Ways and Means Committee has asked the New Jersey organization to send additional documents including any complaints it has received, documents from the head of the organization and staff communications, as well as any more unredacted documents related to the patient in the Camden case.\n \n\n   \n  The letter is the latest development in the committee’s focus on the nation’s organ procurement groups.\n \n\n   \n  In July,  the committee sent a letter  to the Indiana Donor Network with regard to its use of private jets for non-mission charter flights. It also demanded documents from the Miami-area Life Alliance Organ Recovery Agency, and  after its investigation , the US Department of Health and Human Services moved to decertify the organization – essentially shutting the operation down – in September.\n \n\n   \n  The investigation found unsafe practices, staff shortages and paperwork errors,  according to HHS . Agency Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said at the time that the move was meant as a “clear warning” to other donor organizations.\n \n\n   \n  In September, the committee sent a letter to the Network for Hope, a Kentucky-based organ procurement organization, that demanded documents related to practices it considered unsafe.\n \n\n   \n   In one case  four years ago in Richmond, Kentucky, a man says he woke up on the operating table while a recovery team was shaving his chest to take his organs.\n \n\n   \n  Witnesses say the hospital staffers were pressured by people within the organization to continue with the procedure, but a local surgeon refused to continue the operation when she saw that the man wasn’t dead.

veteran FBI employee training to become a special agent was fired last month for displaying at his workspace an LGBTQ+ flag, which had previously flown outside a field office,  according to a lawsuit filed in federal court .\n \n\n   \n  David Maltinsky had worked at the FBI for 16 years and was nearly finished with special agent training in Quantico, Virginia, when he was called into a meeting last month with FBI officials, given a letter from Director Kash Patel and told he was being “summarily dismissed” over the inappropriate display of political signage, Maltinsky’s lawsuit said.\n \n\n   \n  After CNN  first reported on the firing last month , two veteran FBI employees speaking on condition of anonymity said displaying the LGBTQ+ flag at one’s desk historically would not violate any past FBI policy. However, since taking office, President Donald Trump has vowed to rid the federal government of what he calls “woke” ideology.\n \n\n   \n  The suit, filed Wednesday in US District Court in Washington, said Maltinsky had been a decorated intelligence specialist working in the Los Angeles field office and most recently was pursuing a longtime dream of becoming a special agent.\n \n\n   \n  In June 2021, the Los Angeles field office displayed a “Progress Pride” flag, which consists of a rainbow-colored horizontal stripes and a chevron with black, brown, pink, light blue, and white colors. It’s meant to represent people of color, as well as the LGBTQ+ community. Maltinsky was given that flag after it had come down and was then displayed at his Los Angeles field office workstation with the support and permission of his supervisors, according to the lawsuit.\n \n\n   \n  In April, he began training at the FBI Academy to become a special agent and had successfully completed 16 of the 19 weeks of training at the time of his firing, the lawsuit stated.\n \n\n   \n  Maltinsky said in the suit he helped lead diversity initiatives during his time at the bureau as well.

grand jury revelation at James Comey’s vindictive-prosecution hearing \n       \n  By Hannah Rabinowitz, Holmes Lybrand, Katelyn  Polantz, Casey Gannon, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:10 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The hearing Wednesday morning in the case against former FBI Director James Comey ended with a revelation by prosecutors and a conundrum: if a full grand jury never reviewed the final set of charges handed up against Comey, are they void?\n \n\n   \n  The question arose after a shocking back and forth where prosecutors conceded that instead of presenting a new indictment to the grand jury after it declined to approve one of three counts, interim US Attorney Lindsey Halligan simply brought an altered version, omitting the rejected count, to the magistrate’s courtroom for the grand jury’s foreperson to sign.\n \n\n   \n  Her admission sent shockwaves through the courtroom on Wednesday, where attorneys were gathered to argue a separate legal issue of whether Comey was charged only because of President Donald Trump’s animus toward him.\n \n\n   \n  What will happen to the criminal case was not immediately clear. Judge Michael Nachmanoff, despite appearing exasperated and taking several seconds of silence to take in what the prosecutors admitted, did not give away whether he viewed the issue as a procedural or fatal error.\n \n\n   \n  Nachmanoff did not make any rulings from the bench, saying that the issues before him were too  “weighty”  to immediately decide.\n \n\n   \n  But the judge ask the Justice Department to address Wednesday their legal interpretation of what happened with the grand jury, and the revelation is likely to play into another ongoing fight in the case where defense attorneys have asserted that federal investigators and top prosecutor Halligan mishandled the case.\n \n\n   \n  In a brief filed Wednesday evening, the Justice Department defended Halligan’s grand jury presentation and said the case should not be dismissed. The final indictment was reviewed by the grand jury foreperson and another representative — and then explained on the record in open court that it was reflective of the grand jury vote, the Justice Department wrote.\n \n\n   \n  The former FBI director has pleaded not guilty to lying during congressional testimony.\n \n\n   \n    The stunning admission\n \n\n   \n   Nachmanoff called on Halligan  — Trump’s handpicked US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia who secured the indictment against Comey by herself — to explain exactly what grand jurors did, or did not, see.\n \n\n   \n  Halligan appeared frustrated as she confirmed that only the foreperson and one other juror – not the entire grand jury – saw the final indictment. In the brief exchange, she tried to answer the judge before he finished asking his question and concluded the exchange with a terse “OK.”\n \n\n   \n  The back and forth lasted about one minute.\n \n\n   \n  Nachmanoff also trained his attention on a different prosecutor on the case, Tyler Lemons, and asked him to explicitly confirm that the final document was never presented to the grand jury.\n \n\n   \n  “I wasn’t there, but that is my understanding,” Lemons said.\n \n\n   \n  After the hearing concluded, people connected with the prosecutors’ office told CNN that they weren’t sure  how problematic Halligan’s admission will be  for the case. Some may consider it a clerical error that could be fixed, while others see a possibility it could be the fatal flaw in the case, as Comey’s team initially argued on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors have six months to “cure” an indictment that was dismissed over legal issues, according to the  Justice Department manual , even if the statute of limitations has expired – as is the case for Comey’s charges.\n \n\n   \n  Comey’s attorney Michael Dreeben said that, given the testimony of the prosecutor, “no indictment was returned.”\n \n\n   \n  And even if it is a legal problem, a grand jury document flub may pale in comparison to other issues that have arisen in the case and are still playing out in court, including regarding what Halligan told the grand jurors about Comey’s rights, the evidence and the law.\n \n\n   \n    Grand jury transcripts\n \n\n   \n  The issue over the indictment could also aid in defense attorneys’ efforts to gain access to the grand jury transcripts, an issue that is currently before a magistrate judge in the same courthouse.\n \n\n   \n  That judge initially allowed Comey’s team to have access to the grand jury material, finding in his own review that “the record points to a disturbing pattern of profound investigative missteps.”\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors quickly asked the magistrate judge to pause the order so that they could file an appeal, which the magistrate judge allowed.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Ms. Halligan was not a puppet’\n \n\n   \n  The hearing focused primarily on defense attorneys’ efforts to have the case dismissed because, they argue, it was brought at the direction of Trump and born from his animosity toward Comey.\n \n\n   \n  “The president of the United States has caused the executive branch to prosecute a perceived enemy,” Dreeben began his arguments.\n \n\n   \n  Dreeben, citing a  social media post  from Trump addressed to the attorney general and calling for the prosecution of Comey and other political enemies, argued that the president has gone after the former director to “punish Mr. Comey for speaking out against him.”\n \n\n   \n  Lemons pushed back, arguing that Comey was making “inferential leaps” in arguing that the case is selective and vindictive.\n \n\n   \n  The prosecutor said that there is “no proof” that Halligan took Trump’s social media post “as a charge.”\n \n\n   \n  “Ms. Halligan was not a puppet,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Still, the judge questioned “what independent examination could she have made” in the few days between her appointment and the charges being brought against Comey.\n \n\n   \n    DOJ refuses to say if a memo declining to prosecute Comey exists\n \n\n   \n  Nachmanoff also pressed Lemons on whether previous prosecutors who worked on the case before Halligan’s appointment had submitted a memo recommending that Comey not be prosecuted.\n \n\n   \n  Lemons told the judge that someone in Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche’s office told him he couldn’t disclose  “privileged” information  without their permission, which included the existence of any memo.\n \n\n   \n  “At this point, my position would be, whether there was a declination memo, is privileged,” Lemons said, adding that “I don’t know in the world of documents there is a declination memo.”\n \n\n   \n  Nachmanoff challenged the assertion, pushing Lemons to eventually say that “someone in the Deputy Attorney General’s office” had instructed him not to say anything.\n \n\n   \n  Asked why, Lemons demurred, conceding briefly that he has “reviewed” draft memorandums – both declination and prosecution memos – and other internal communications, but declined to give additional details.\n \n\n   \n  “I hope you understand that I am trying to answer your questions,” Lemons said.\n \n\n   \n    Justice Department defends Halligan’s work\n \n\n   \n  Federal prosecutors in their Wednesday brief defended Lindsey Halligan’s handling of the grand jury proceedings against Comey.\n \n\n   \n  At the end of Wednesday’s hearing, Nachmanoff instructed the parties to review a case in Washington, DC, from the late 1960s that dealt with similar grand jury issues.\n \n\n   \n  But in that case, prosecutors argued in their brief, “the grand jury never saw any version of the eventual indictment.”\n \n\n   \n  “In this case, the grand jury was provided the proposed Indictment, deliberated, and determined that probable cause existed to believe that the defendant had committed the crimes charged in two counts,” prosecutors said.\n \n\n   \n  The grand jury did not hand up an indictment on a third charge prosecutors attempted to bring against Comey.\n \n\n   \n  After their vote, according to prosecutors, only the foreperson and one other grand juror remained when a final version of the indictment – that omitted the third charge that was rejected – was signed by the foreperson.\n \n\n   \n  “Only the numbering of the counts (i.e., proposed Count Two became Count One, and proposed Count Three became Count Two) and the paragraphs differ,” prosecutors said in their brief.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors argue the case doesn’t need to be dismissed “given that the grand jury was presented with the two counts on which it voted to return an indictment and in fact voted upon those counts.”\n \n\n   \n  “Grand Jury foreperson, as the representative of the Grand Jury, endorsed the revised two count Indictment by signing it and explaining on the record in open Court that the Indictment reflected the vote of the Grand Jury,” prosecutors continued.\n \n\n   \n  A magistrate judge earlier this week made the rare decision to order prosecutors to give Comey’s team all grand jury materials, including transcripts and recordings of the secret process.\n \n\n   \n  That judge, William Fitzpatrick, said his review of those transcripts and recordings suggested that the grand jury could have been shown privileged evidence or given false instructions by the attorney who presented the case, Lindsey Halligan.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors strongly pushed back against that, too, arguing Fitzpatrick had quoted portions of Halligan’s presentation and not her statements in full.\n \n\n   \n  “The magistrate judge’s recommendation is grounded in misreadings of the transcript, incorrect legal conclusions, and factual assumptions that the record directly disproves,” prosecutors wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “The U.S. Attorney did not misstate the law, the grand jury was not misled, and the transcript shows a routine, regular presentation of the indictment,” they said.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article

Here’s what we know \n       \n  By Taylor Romine, Priscilla Alvarez, Rebekah Riess, Dianne Gallagher, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:44 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Rheba Hamilton was sipping coffee   on her porch Saturday morning as she watched the two workers she‘d hired begin    draping her front yard tree with lights in a quiet Charlotte, North Carolina, neighborhood.\n \n\n   \n  Suddenly, a gray minivan – doors already ajar –  made a sharp stop at the corner . Two federal   agents emerged and asked the landscapers for their papers. Hamilton joined the men on the lawn and started recording. Shortly after, the agents retreated.\n \n\n   \n  The abruptness of the incident took Hamilton by surprise,  mirroring the shock local officials and residents  felt as Charlotte became the latest city caught up this year in a string of targeted immigration actions.\n \n\n   \n  What began in Charlotte quickly spread to other cities in the state as the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration crackdown continues to expand nationally.  Gregory Bovino , the top Border Patrol official charged with enforcement operations, is expected to head to New Orleans in coming weeks.\n \n\n   \n  Here is where things stand:\n \n\n   \n    Next city to be targeted may already be in enforcement crackdown’s sights\n \n\n   \n  While the spotlight has been focused on North Carolina’s most populated city, immigration enforcement action has started to spread to other areas of the state and is expected to reach New Orleans within weeks.\n \n\n   \n  Bovino – who for many has become the face of the crackdown – is expected to arrive in New Orleans, where he once served as chief patrol agent, the first week of December, according to two sources familiar with the planning.\n \n\n   \n  The Department of Homeland Security is expected to deploy 250 agents in Louisiana – roughly in line with the number of agents  sent to other cities to assist Bovino, the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump has previously floated New Orleans as a destination for his federal crackdown, saying in an Oval Office meeting this year his administration was “making a determination.”\n \n\n   \n  As immigration enforcement is expected to spread further throughout the South, Customs and Border Protection agents  were seen Tuesday in North Carolina’s Wake and Durham counties , Raleigh Mayor Janet Cowell said during a City Council meeting. The counties are home to Raleigh and Durham, two of the state’s other major cities and part of the Research Triangle, with Chapel Hill.\n \n\n   \n  “We are just encouraging everyone, if you feel unsafe or you see something that you think is illegal, to please call the Raleigh Police Department or your local jurisdiction and to stay safe,” Cowell said.\n \n\n   \n  Residents of Cary, North Carolina, west of Raleigh, have  also reported seeing federal agents  at hospitals, restaurants and construction sites, Mayor Harold Weinbrecht told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Protesters  gathered at Moore Square in downtown Raleigh  on Tuesday night, holding American flags and signs printed with slogans like, “No fear no hate, no ICE in our state” and “Respect due process,” aerial footage from CNN affiliate WRAL shows.\n \n\n   \n    DHS arrests more than 250 people in Charlotte\n \n\n   \n  Over 250 people have been arrested in immigration raids in Charlotte since the weekend, DHS said in an update Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Among those arrested are “numerous criminal illegal aliens with extensive immigration and criminal histories, including domestic violence, assault, breaking and entering, larceny, and driving while intoxicated,” a Wednesday DHS statement said.   \n \n\n   \n  DHS Secretary Kristi Noem  said Tuesday  the Charlotte operation was based on previous investigative work, specifically citing “a high number of child abuse, trafficking, neglect type of instances that we had identified over our work there.”\n \n\n   \n  Two men were  federally charged in Charlotte  Tuesday for allegedly using their vehicles in separate incidents to assault federal officers who were conducting immigration enforcement, according to Russ Ferguson, the US Attorney for the Western District of North Carolina. The charges don’t stem from protests in the area, the US attorney said.\n \n\n   \n  A woman was also charged Wednesday after she allegedly assaulted a federal agent outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Charlotte, the US attorney’s office  said in a news release . The 44-year-old woman is accused of “grabbing the officer’s shoulders and attempting to jump on the officer’s back” while the officer was trying to arrest another person Sunday, the release said.\n \n\n   \n    Attorneys are turning to creative measures to find their clients\n \n\n   \n  The uptick in immigration detentions in Charlotte and the absence of information from the federal government has prompted some immigration attorneys to get creative in how they track clients being held in ICE custody.\n \n\n   \n  One of those attorneys is Gigi Gardner, a North Carolina immigration attorney, who said her client was detained on Tuesday after attending a routine ICE check-in.\n \n\n   \n     Her client – who she didn’t name, citing safety and client confidentiality concerns – has been in the US for roughly 40 years and has checked in with ICE annually, Gardner said.\n \n\n   \n     After failed attempts to get into the ICE office late last week due to a high volume of people, Gardner’s client checked in Tuesday, when he was detained, she said. Gardner and her client’s wife tracked his whereabouts by using the location of his AirPods, she said.\n \n\n   \n  They tracked his movements to  Folkston, Georgia, where there’s an ICE detention center . The AirPod’s battery appeared to die and it wasn’t until Wednesday morning that the man called his wife to say he had been transferred again – this time, to Jacksonville, Florida, Gardner said.\n \n\n   \n  “Nothing has changed. He has an attorney. And he was unable to contact me. They haven’t sent me any paperwork. They haven’t told me where he is. And they still haven’t told me where he is,” she said, referring to ICE.\n \n\n   \n    Charlotte community takes some tips from Chicago\n \n\n   \n  While the targeted immigration raids were unexpected to many of those in the Charlotte community, they were ready to meet the moment.\n \n\n   \n  People throughout Charlotte  were seen Monday  using many of the tactics employed in Chicago – including watching for raids, blowing warning whistles and carrying signs advising people of their rights.\n \n\n   \n  The support from residents across the city is palpable. Flags from Honduras, Colombia and Mexico are seen adorning cars and hanging from homes and buisinesses, a stark difference from what could be seen as recently as a week ago.\n \n\n   \n  Their vigilance comes as many businesses across the city have closed their doors, fearing their customers will be a target. About  half the mom-and-pop businesses  the community development organization  CharlotteEast  works with have closed their doors at some point, despite all of them being owned by US citizens, Executive Director Greg Asciutto said Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  “From strictly an economic standpoint, it’s pretty catastrophic right now,” Asciutto said, comparing current closures to the first week of the coronavirus pandemic in the area.\n \n\n   \n  A Colombian bakery open for 28 years closed its doors Saturday after men in tactical gear   chased and tackled people outside the shop. A program for immigrant and refugee children  was also suspended until further notice  Monday after Border Patrol was active at their site.\n \n\n   \n  A local laundromat is taking a different approach, with  the owner locking their doors  while customers are inside in an attempt to keep them safe.\n \n\n   \n  In Raleigh, more than 600 volunteers signed up in the overnight hours to help others travel within the city when the community became aware that federal agents intended to come to the area Tuesday, Siembra NC, a statewide immigrant worker organizing group, said.\n \n\n   \n  “By early morning, trained volunteers were dispatched throughout Raleigh as safety patrols ready to assist neighbors in getting to school and work safely,” a release from the organization said.\n \n\n   \n    About 20% of students absent from Charlotte-area schools Monday\n \n\n   \n  More than  30,000 students were absent  from Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools on Monday, about 20% of the district’s enrollment. CNN has reached out to the district to see how attendance was affected Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  The district  issued a statement Sunday night  saying no immigration activity had happened on their campuses and noting leaders hadn’t been informed of impending action. There were no reports of immigration enforcement on their campuses on Monday or Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  “CMS follows all federal and state laws protecting students’ right to a public education. The U.S. Supreme Court guarantees that all children, regardless of immigration status, have the right to attend public school,” CMS Assistant Communications Officer Tom Miner said in a statement to school district families.\n \n\n   \n  High school students in the district  staged a walkout Tuesday morning  to protest immigration enforcement in the city. Several hundred students gathered around the edge of a football field at East Mecklenburg High School, many wearing black and holding flags, an aerial Getty photo of the demonstration showed.\n \n\n   \n    North Carolina governor and local leaders denounce the raids\n \n\n   \n  Many Democratic leaders across North Carolina have denounced the raids.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve reached out to the White House,”  North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein said Tuesday.  “We haven’t gotten any word. We’re not hearing directly from Customs and Border Patrol, so we don’t know for sure where they’re going, how long they’ll be here, where else they’re going.”\n \n\n   \n  Stein went on to criticize the tactics used by federal agents, saying they are “not promoting safety in our communities.”\n \n\n   \n  In the county where Charlotte is located,   the Mecklenburg Board of County Commissioners unanimously passed a resolution Tuesday to affirm constitutional protections and express support for the immigrant community.\n \n\n   \n  “This is not an issue of policy. This is an issue of morality,” Chair Mark Jerrell said. “It’s immoral to profile, to tear families apart. It’s not right to have people living in fear … This board declared tonight that we don’t condone it. We won’t stand for it.”\n \n\n   \n  While the governor and local leaders vocally oppose the federal action, North Carolina’s Republican Party  praised the immigration enforcement  operation, saying “the need is real.”\n \n\n   \n  Though some people are overwhelmed with the intensity of the moment, Councilmember LaWana Mayfield  said during a City Council committee meeting Monday  that this moment is “an opportunity to show up for each other.”\n \n\n   \n  “Get to know your neighbors, get their phone numbers, go to their back door, bring them over to your house so the children can feel safe, let the kids play together, because they don’t need to be going through all of this,” Mayfield said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/us/anna-kepner-carnival-cruise-death","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"16:51:00Z","title":"Speculation intensifies in the death of a Florida high schooler on a cruise","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The mysterious death of 18-year-old Anna Kepner, a high school cheerleader from Temple Christian School in Titusville, Florida, aboard the Carnival Horizon cruise ship has sparked international speculation and media attention.

The planned 500-megawatt data center would be xAI’s first large-scale center outside of the United States, and the partnership will see xAI’s  Grok chatbot  deployed throughout Saudi Arabia.\n \n\n   \n  “The future of intelligence will be engineered through massive and efficient compute combined with the most advanced AI models,” Musk said in a statement on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  The center will be powered by chips from Nvidia, whose founder, Jensen Huang, sat alongside Musk and Saudi Arabian Minister of Communications and Information Technology Abdullah Alswaha at Wednesday’s panel. No further details about the partnership were revealed.\n \n\n   \n  “This is how we walk the talk in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia in partnership with the US,” Alswaha said. “Yesterday, the president and his royal highness announced the AI strategic framework and partnership. Today we’re going big with Elon and Jensen, so thank you for those opportunities.”\n \n\n   \n  Bloomberg  reported  on Wednesday that the United States is set to approve the first sales of advanced AI chips to Humain.\n \n\n   \n  At the event, Alswaha announced a 100-megawatt data center for Amazon Web Services “with a gigawatt ambition” that also will be powered by Nvidia’s infrastructure. AWS said in a statement that it plans “to provide, deploy and manage up to 150,000 AI accelerators” in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia.\n \n\n   \n  As AI companies expand, their huge data centers need  space  and  massive energy sources . Many data centers are being built in the United States, including  xAI’s Colossus in Memphis . However, there’s fear that China will beat out the United States when it comes to  energy production  to power AI systems. Saudi Arabia could help with that — it has much easier access to the space and energy needed to power these massive ventures.\n \n\n   \n  The investment from Saudi Arabia also plays a major part in Prince bin Salman’s redemption in the United States, following being labeled a “pariah” by  President Joe Biden  for his role in the killing of  Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi .\n \n\n   \n  During his Oval Office visit on Wednesday, Prince bin Salman claimed the country will be investing $1 trillion dollars in the United States, a substantial increase from the previously announced $600 billion investment in May. The comments surprised even President Donald Trump in the moment, although the timeline of the investments is not clear.\n \n\n   \n  “You’re saying to me now that the $600 billion will be $1 trillion?” Trump said to Prince bin Salman in the Oval Office. “Good. I like that very much.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/politics/melania-trump-usha-vance-north-carolina","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"17:46:00.000Z","title":"Melania Trump teams up with Usha Vance, visiting troops in North Carolina","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Melania Trump and Usha Vance made their first public joint appearance without their husbands at Camp Lejeune and Marine Corps Air Station New River in North Carolina, marking a renewed public engagement for both women in the Trump-Vance administration.

2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Melania Trump joined second lady Usha Vance on Wednesday for a pre-Thanksgiving visit with North Carolina military families, offering the latest signal that the first lady is more actively engaging with her role after a quiet start to her second term.\n \n\n   \n  The pair met with service members and their families at Camp Lejeune and Marine Corps Air Station New River in a trip marking their first public joint appearance without their husbands 10 months into the Trump-Vance administration.\n \n\n   \n  The visit offered a rare opportunity to see their relationship on display – and highlighted the key issues that each woman has chosen to prioritize.\n \n\n   \n  The first lady shined a light on children’s well-being and the responsible use of technologies like artificial intelligence during a classroom visit with Lejeune High School students who are participating in the presidential AI challenge. In a presentation to their guests, students detailed how they use the technology for class projects – and the rules governing that usage.\n \n\n   \n  Children’s literacy was front and center for the second lady as Trump and Vance played games and did arts and craft projects with younger children at nearby DeLalio Elementary School. Trump donned a headband with an index card as she played a reading game with the children.\n \n\n   \n  Vance offered praise to her counterpart during remarks to service members at the conclusion of their trip.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m honored to introduce our first lady, who shares my deep gratitude for your sacrifices to secure our country’s safety and its well-being,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, Vance added, is “committed to bettering our nation by ensuring that every child feels loved, supported, and prepared for the future.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear how much the two women have substantively engaged with each other behind the scenes, though the Vances hosted the Trumps at the Naval Observatory for dinner last month, spending about an hour and a half at the vice presidential residence. The first lady’s office declined to respond to CNN’s inquiries about their relationship.\n \n\n   \n  But in a sign of warm relations, Usha Vance joined Melania Trump in her cabin on the flight to North Carolina, according to a source familiar with the matter. That invitation was not extended for one of her predecessors, former second lady Karen Pence, who sat instead with her staff when traveling with the first lady during the first Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n  Trump and Vance appeared friendly in their engagements throughout the day, sharing a handshake on stage in the hangar and telling reporters they had a “very nice visit” upon their departure.\n \n\n   \n  Vance, a  former high-powered lawyer , is navigating the delicate dynamic of being a top figurehead in a new administration alongside the first lady, who has taken  her own approach  to the spousal role.\n \n\n   \n  The second lady has joined her husband, who appears to have higher political ambitions, on key trips across the country and abroad, all while transitioning three small children to a life under the microscope and becoming a public figure with a quiet platform of children’s literacy and early childhood development.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, meanwhile, took a more hands-off approach to her role, spending most of her time in the first months of the president’s second term away from the White House in New York or Palm Beach, Florida, often disappearing for weeks between public appearances.\n \n\n   \n  She has a much smaller staff compared with her first term. Though she was an active steward of White House preservation during her husband’s first term, she has left many of those decision to the president this time around,  culminating dramatically  last month with the demolition of  the East Wing , which has served as headquarters for presidential spouses since the Carter administration.\n \n\n   \n  But recently, the first lady has returned to public view with a series of engagements on a range of topics.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has held events advocating for children’s well-being and artificial intelligence safety, launching a  global coalition  on the issue called “Fostering the Future Together.” She joined the president as he signed an executive order last week on a (unrelated) “Fostering the Future” initiative for children in foster care. And she back-channeled with Russian President Vladimir Putin on releasing allegedly abducted Ukrainian children with  mixed results .\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, Trump honored the Marine Corps’ 250th anniversary as she looked ahead to new challenges facing the US military.\n \n\n   \n  “Technology is changing the art of war. Predictably, AI will alter war more profoundly than any technology since nuclear weapons,” she said during her remarks in the hangar.\n \n\n   \n  She continued, “Artificial intelligence will take center stage in the theater of war – it already plays a meaningful role on the battlefield. But of course, it is the Marine who will always play the most critical role in realizing mission success.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear why the first lady is choosing to reemerge now, and her office declined to respond to questions on whether this might portend a more active role. Trump recently indicated that the multimillion-dollar deal she signed with Amazon for an  eponymous documentary  highlighting her return to the White House had taken up much of her attention this year.\n \n\n   \n  “The silver screen and I have been in deep conversation lately. You may have heard the news — I produced a new film with Amazon MGM named ‘Melania,’” Trump said earlier this month in remarks accepting Fox Nation’s “Patriot of the Year” award.\n \n\n   \n  The “Melania” documentary, which will be released in January, is being directed by Brett Ratner and marks the filmmaker’s first major project since 2017, when he was  accused of sexual misconduct  by numerous women. Ratner has denied the allegations.\n \n\n   \n   This headline and story have been updated with additional reporting from Trump and Vance’s visit.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/americas/brazilian-amazon-gangs-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"17:51:00-05:00","title":"Gangs expand to nearly half the towns in the Brazilian Amazon, report finds","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Organized criminal gangs, including the Red Command and First Capital Command, have expanded to nearly half of the Brazilian Amazon’s municipalities—344 out of 772—marking a 32% increase from the previous year.

nearly half of the region’s municipalities, according to a report published Wednesday by a prominent nonprofit organization.\n \n\n   \n  The growth of these crime groups in the region, where  UN climate talks  are currently taking place, is driving violence and threatens the preservation of the world’s largest tropical rainforest, according to the Brazilian Forum on Public Safety.\n \n\n   \n  Organized crime groups are now active in 344 municipalities out of 772, or some 45%, the nonprofit said. That’s a jump of 32% from last year’s report when they were present in 260, and more than double from two years ago.\n \n\n   \n  The Red Command drug trafficking gang has more than doubled its presence since 2023. The notorious crime group was the target of Rio’s  most lethal  police operation ever on October 28, when 121 people died.\n \n\n   \n  The raid in Rio sparked a nationwide discussion on organized crime in Brazil, and on Tuesday evening the country’s lower house approved a bill that proposes an increase in the severity of sentences for gang membership.\n \n\n   \n  “These crime groups are seeking to diversify and maximize their illegal activities,” David Marques, one of the report’s authors, told The Associated Press. “In addition to drug-trafficking, there’s been an increase of extortion and environmental crimes,” such as illegal logging and mining, he said.\n \n\n   \n  With more criminal gangs come territorial disputes, weapons and violence, Marques said. There were 8,047 slayings in the region in 2024, a rate of 27.3 killings per 100,000 inhabitants, 31% higher than the national average, the group said.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to Red Command and its main rival, First Capital Command, there are some 17 other criminal gangs operation in the region, also including Venezuela’s  Tren de Aragua , a target of  military attack s by U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration.\n \n\n   \n  The Rio-based Red Command has dominated river routes in coordination with Peruvian and Colombian cartels. Drugs flow to strategic ports such as Manaus, Santarem, Barcarena, Macapa and Belem – where Brazil is hosting COP30.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the Sao Paulo-based First Capital Command has focused on using clandestine airstrips in remote areas that are tied to illegal mining, the group said.\n \n\n   \n  The group’s director, Renato Sérgio de Lima, said in a statement that combating organized crime in the Amazon will require a focus on alternate ways of developing the region besides “predatory exploitation of resources.”\n \n\n   \n  The bill approved by the lower house on Tuesday would boost sentences for certain crimes when the defendant also is a member of a gang, for example increasing the 6-to-20-year recommended sentence for intentional homicide to 20-to-40 years. It also would allow authorities to seize assets even before a case’s final judgement and oblige gang leaders to carry out their time behind bars in maximum-security federal prisons.\n \n\n   \n  President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has lamented on X that the legislation has been weakened because of proposed budget cuts to the federal police. The bill is now headed for the Senate, where it is likely to be modified, though some compromise version is likely to pass the congress eventually because crime has become a top concern of voters.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/tech/nvidia-earnings-ai-bubble-fears","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"17:00:00Z","title":"Nvidia Beats Earnings Expectations, Even as Bubble Concerns Mount","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Nvidia reported strong earnings, with 62% year-over-year revenue growth to $57 billion and a 65% profit increase to $31.9 billion, exceeding Wall Street expectations.

\n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:25 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Nvidia posted strong revenue and profits that exceeded Wall Street’s expectations Wednesday. The closely watched result could prompt a sigh of relief across the stock market following growing concerns about an artificial intelligence bubble.\n \n\n   \n  Nvidia’s sales grew 62% year-over-year to $57 billion in the October quarter, ahead of the $54.9 billion Wall Street had projected, signaling that demand for AI chips remains strong even as more questions emerge about whether returns from the technology will keep up with the pace of infrastructure investments. It posted profits of $31.9 billion, up 65% from the year-ago quarter and also slightly above expectations.\n \n\n   \n  “Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement, a message that echoes his earlier arguments that fears of an AI bubble are overblown.\n \n\n   \n  The company also posted stronger-than-expected sales guidance of around $65 billion for the fourth quarter, another indicator that the AI spending spree isn’t slowing anytime soon.\n \n\n   \n  Nvidia’s stock ( NVDA ) jumped 3.4% in after-hours trading immediately following the report.\n \n\n   \n  Nvidia has become both the backbone and an emblem of the AI boom, with much of the industry’s technology running on its chips. The  world’s most valuable public company  has also been central to this year’s stock market rally — it accounts for roughly 8% of the S&P 500 and its deals with other tech firms have helped fuel their stocks, too — meaning that nearly all investors and 401k holders  stand to be impacted  by Wednesday’s results.\n \n\n   \n  Fears of an AI bubble ahead of Nvidia’s report had caused volatility across the stock market as investors adopted a risk-off attitude and dumped assets like bitcoin and AI stocks.\n \n\n   \n  Shares of other tech stocks — including Meta, Microsoft, Amazon and Google — were in the green in after-hours trading following the Nvidia report, underscoring the chipmaker’s impact on the wider market.\n \n\n   \n  “This answers a lot of questions about the state of the AI revolution, and the verdict is simple: it is nowhere near its peak, neither from the market-demand nor the production–supply-chain sides for the foreseeable future,” Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com, said in emailed commentary following the report.\n \n\n   \n  At the heart of the bubble concerns are the circular funding deals that Nvidia and other chipmakers have formed with AI companies, such as a  $100 billion investment  in OpenAI in exchange for chip purchases that was announced in September. OpenAI Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar further raised eyebrows earlier this month when  she suggested  that the government should backstop the debt tech companies are taking on to build AI infrastructure — a statement the company later tried to walk back.\n \n\n   \n  But the fears haven’t stopped Nvidia from making more such deals. Anthropic on Monday  committed  to buying $30 billion in computing capacity from Microsoft Azure, running on Nvidia chips, in exchange for an investment in the AI lab from both tech giants.\n \n\n   \n  Huang has repeatedly batted down bubble concerns. At the company’s GTC AI conference last month, he told CNN that people’s willingness to pay for AI tools indicates that the technology is “profitable,” even if most tech firms are now reinvesting the money they’re earning into new infrastructure.\n \n\n   \n  The fact that Nvidia’s business continues to hum isn’t surprising given that tech giants such as Meta, Microsoft, Amazon and Google  all indicated  in their most recent earnings reports that they plan to continue hiking their AI infrastructure spending. Huang also  laid out  at GTC the company’s plans to get its technology into even more areas of life — from cell phone towers to self- driving cars.\n \n\n   \n  Nvidia Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress sought to reinforce that AI is generating returns in the company’s earnings call by taking the unusual tack of ticking through highlights from the chipmaker’s partner’s recent financial reports. At Meta, for example, AI recommendation systems are leading to “more time spent on apps such as Facebook and Threads;” Anthropic recently noted it expects to earn $7 billion in annual revenue this year; and Salesforce’s engineering team is 30% more efficient now that it’s using AI for coding, she said, ﻿among a long list of corporate customers she rattled off.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/politics/bessent-trump-federal-reserve-powell","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"15:58:00-05:00","title":"Trump Teases He’ll Fire Bessent If Fed Doesn’t Cut Interest Rates","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump threatened to fire Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent if the Federal Reserve does not reduce interest rates, highlighting political pressure on monetary policy.

If you don’t get it fixed fast, I’m going to fire your ass,” the president said, smirking, during a speech at a US-Saudi investment forum at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC.\n \n\n   \n  However, it won’t be easy for Trump to bend the Fed to his will: The Fed makes its decisions on interest rates independently, based solely on economic data, meaning that firing Bessent would simply not lead to lower rates. Several Fed officials have also said in recent public comments that they remain concerned about inflation, leaning against further rate cuts.\n \n\n   \n  The president has been a frequent critic of the central bank and its chair,  Jerome Powell , throughout his second term as the Federal Reserve declined to cut interest rates this year until September. But he acknowledged on Wednesday that Bessent has been privately urging him not to fire Powell, whom Trump has repeatedly said he wants out of the job.\n \n\n   \n  Trump appeared to suggest that Bessent has been the “voice of reason,” while Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick “is a little bit more for firing” Powell.\n \n\n   \n  “Please don’t fire him. He’s got three months to go,’” the president said, appearing to repeat what Bessent has told him of Powell.\n \n\n   \n  “I want to get him out,” Trump said, reenacting their conversation.\n \n\n   \n  “I think Howard is a little bit more for firing him. I think Howard would say get him the hell out of there,” the president said\n \n\n   \n    Bessent as a “voice of reason”\n \n\n   \n  Trump frequently threatened to fire Powell during the spring, but the president eventually backed off from those threats after his closest advisers warned of the chaos in financial markets that could ensue if he were to do so,  CNN previously reported .\n \n\n   \n  Wednesday is the first time Trump has appeared to suggest that Bessent, who has become well-respected on Wall Street, was one of the voices urging him to keep Powell in his role until the end of his term.\n \n\n   \n  “Markets have really appreciated having Bessent around,” James Ragan, director of wealth management research at DA Davidson, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s been very much the voice of reason in the Trump administration, so I don’t like to hear him challenging Bessent,” he added.\n \n\n   \n    The Fed’s decision making and Trump’s demands\n \n\n   \n  Fed officials say their decisions on rates are guided solely by what economic figures show, and they strive to achieve their dual mandate of full employment and stable prices. That’s precisely why Trump’s frequent demands for lower rates have largely fallen on deaf ears — and may continue to do so.\n \n\n   \n  The Fed’s rate-setting committee, led by Powell as chair, began to lower interest rates in September for the first time in nine months, and delivered another quarter-point rate cut at its latest meeting last month. October’s rate cuts bring the benchmark lending rate to  its lowest in three years. \n \n\n   \n  The Fed has been lowering rates to prevent unemployment from surging, though officials are divided over whether they should continue to lower rates with  inflation still above their 2% target  and Trump’s tariffs still threatening to push inflation higher.\n \n\n   \n  Minutes from the Fed’s October meeting underscored the heated debate among the policymakers of the world’s most powerful central bank, with several stating that they prefer to stand pat in December: “Many participants suggested that, under their economic outlooks, it would likely be appropriate to keep the target range unchanged for the rest of the year,” the minutes said.\n \n\n   \n  Investors currently see a roughly 68% chance of the Fed holding rates steady next month, according to futures, compared to a 32% chance of another cut.\n \n\n   \n  New data on the labor market’s health in September, which was delayed due to the government shutdown, is due on Thursday. Signs that the labor market is falling off a cliff would prompt the Fed to continue to lowering borrowing costs heading into next year, though officials are keeping a close eye on inflation.\n \n\n   \n  How the Fed makes its decisions is no secret, but that hasn’t stopped Trump from repeatedly demanding aggressive rate cuts and lambasting Powell, whose term ends in May.\n \n\n   \n  Trump could name Powell’s successor as early as December, and there are  five people on his short list , according to Bessent, who has led the search. But even if Trump names a loyalist who would call for aggressive rate cuts, that still wouldn’t do the trick because the Fed chair only gets one vote and they cannot unilaterally veto what the majority of the Fed’s 12-person rate-setting committee decides.\n \n\n   \n  The new Fed chair, whoever it may be, would have to persuade their colleagues to go along with any plans to lower rates aggressively, and at the moment, only one Fed official said he believes that is the right approach: Fed Governor Stephen Miran, who is taking an unpaid leave from his job as a top White House economist to temporarily serve on the Fed’s board.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/politics/dissent-texas-redistricting-case-judge-jerry-smith-all-about-eve","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"17:13:00Z","title":"‘I dissent,’ judge says 16 times in 100-page broadside against colleagues in Texas redistricting case","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Federal judge Jerry Smith issued a 100-page dissent against the majority decision of the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals, which blocked Texas’s newly drawn congressional map on grounds of racial gerrymandering.

PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A federal judge on Wednesday  issued an extraordinary broadside  against his two colleagues over their decision to publish their opinion in a major redistricting case in Texas before he had a chance to finish writing his dissent, saying they had lost “any pretense of judicial restraint, good faith, or trust.”\n \n\n   \n  The statement issued by Judge Jerry Smith, who sits on the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals, accuses the two other judges of unfairly rushing to get their ruling out on Tuesday even after he told them he had not wrapped up his part of the case.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, the Ronald Reagan-appointed judge issued a 100-page dissent that says the majority ruling is “replete with legal and factual error, and accompanied by naked procedural abuse.”\n \n\n   \n  The three-judge panel ruled 2-1 to block Texas from using its  newly drawn congressional map  in next year’s midterms, ruling that the map is likely an unconstitutional racial gerrymander.\n \n\n   \n  US District Judge Jeffrey Brown, who was appointed by Trump in 2019, wrote in the majority decision that the challengers were “likely to prove at trial that Texas racially gerrymandered the 2025 Map.” ( The majority opinion was 160 pages .)\n \n\n   \n  But Smith vigorously disagreed throughout his dissent. He said the “’obvious reason’” behind the decision to redraw the state’s congressional maps “’of course, is partisan gain,’” and that Brown was wrong to conclude that state lawmakers are “more bigoted than political.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s all politics, on both sides of the partisan aisle. George and Alex Soros have their hands all over this,” Smith wrote, referring to the billionaire father and son who have supported liberal causes.\n \n\n   \n  The judge also repeatedly invoked California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, who successfully pushed lawmakers and voters in the Golden State to redraw its maps to counteract the Texas effort.\n \n\n   \n  “Gavin Newsom took a victory lap in Houston to celebrate the Democrat redistricting win with Proposition 50,” he wrote. “That tells you all that you need to know – this is about partisan politics, plain and simple.”\n \n\n   \n  Smith also argues that Brown wrongly described the standard the court needed to use when deciding whether to block the map quickly, writing, in part, that his colleague understated how strong the challengers’ arguments against the redrawn districts needed to be.\n \n\n   \n  “With his creative formulation of the preliminary-injunction standard, Judge Brown is intentionally misleading at best and disingenuously false,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Sprinkled throughout the stinging opinion issued by Smith are more insults but also lighter, zippier lines, including references to the 1950 movie “All About Eve.”\n \n\n   \n  “’Fasten your seatbelts. It’s going to be a bumpy night!’” Smith’s dissent began.\n \n\n   \n  He closed with: “Darkness descends on the Rule of Law. A bumpy night, indeed.”\n \n\n   \n  Texas has appealed the ruling. But should it stand, it will be a major setback for Trump and Republicans, who had made Texas the  centerpiece of a national campaign  to redraw maps ahead of the midterms.\n \n\n   \n    ‘The outrage speaks for itself’\n \n\n   \n  \n \n\n   \n  In his four-page statement accompanying the 100-page dissent, Smith describes in detail the timeline that precipitated the release of the majority decision, penned by Brown and joined by District Judge David Guaderrama, an appointee of former President Barack Obama.\n \n\n   \n  Smith says that Brown told him last week that the majority intended to issue their ruling in coming days because they believed they could not wait any longer due to an election law principle that says courts should avoid making last-minute changes to how elections are run before the contests get underway.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, Smith said, Brown wrote him a note in the morning that said: “I’m sorry that we can’t wait on your dissent. Purcell compels us to get the ruling out as soon as we possibly can.

If these judges were so sure of their result, they would not have been so unfairly eager to issue the opinion sans my dissent, or they could have waited for the dissent in order to join issue with it.

Here’s a timeline of the case \n       \n  By Eric Levenson, Holly Yan and Lauren del Valle, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:21 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Ana Walshe, a 39-year-old mother of three, was first reported missing by her coworkers in Washington, DC on January 4, 2023.\n \n\n   \n  Her husband, Brian Walshe, initially told investigators that he had last seen her on New Year’s Day when she left their Cohasset, Massachusetts, home for the airport.\n \n\n   \n  But prosecutors say his statements to police were misleading, and they argue he secretly killed his wife, dismembered her body and disposed of her remains. As evidence, they pointed to a  series of chilling Google searches  on his son’s iPad, including “How long before a body starts to smell” and “How to clean blood from wooden floor.”\n \n\n   \n  Brian Walshe, now 50, has  pleaded not guilty to murder , but in a surprise move just as jury selection was about to start on November 18, 2025, he  pleaded guilty  to misleading police and improper conveyance of a human body.\n \n\n   \n  His murder trial subsequently started later that day.\n \n\n   \n  To better understand the case, CNN assembled a timeline of the couple’s movements in recent years, including his history of legal trouble, strains on their marriage and his actions in the critical days around his wife’s disappearance.\n \n\n   \n    September 2018\n \n\n   \n  Brian Walshe’s father, Dr. Thomas Walshe, died in September 2018 and left nothing to Brian, leading to a protracted legal fight over his estate, according to court documents filed in Plymouth Probate and Family Court in Massachusetts.\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Walshe’s will noted he was not in contact with Brian, to whom he bequeathed only his “best wishes” and “nothing else” from his estate, according to photographs of the document attached to court documents. Brian Walshe unsuccessfully contested the will and suggested his father’s signature on the document was a possible forgery.\n \n\n   \n  Affidavits in opposition to Brian Walshe’s petition said he had been estranged from his father and detailed years of alleged swindling and manipulation.\n \n\n   \n  “He had a severe falling out with his son,” wrote Andrew Walshe, the estate’s executor and one of Dr. Walshe’s nephews. “Brian had ran off with a significant amount of his money; he had had almost zero contact with Brian R. Walshe over the last ten plus years.” \n \n\n   \n    2018\n \n\n   \n  Brian Walshe was indicted on federal fraud charges in October 2018 for allegedly selling fake Andy Warhol artwork online, according to court documents.\n \n\n   \n  FBI investigators alleged Brian or Ana Walshe used her eBay account to sell the paintings in November 2016, less than a year after they were married. The complaint does not charge Ana Walshe with wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  The document also alleged Brian Walshe took real artwork from a friend to sell, but never did. He also did not compensate the friend for the art, prosecutors alleged.\n \n\n   \n  Walshe pleaded not guilty to wire fraud, interstate transportation for a scheme to defraud, possession of converted goods and unlawful monetary transaction in November 2018.\n \n\n   \n    2021\n \n\n   \n  In April 2021, Brian Walshe  pleaded guilty  to three of the four federal counts in exchange for a recommended sentence of incarceration, supervised release, fines, restitution and forfeiture, court documents show. He also agreed to either return the artworks or pay for them.\n \n\n   \n  As part of pre-sentencing probation, Brian Walshe was placed on monitoring and house arrest. He can request to leave home but must detail the specific locations, times and reasons.\n \n\n   \n    November 2022\n \n\n   \n  Ana Walshe  was having an affair with a man  in DC and spent Thanksgiving with him in Dublin, Ireland, according to court documents. The man told investigators he had been in a relationship with Ana Walshe for several months, the documents state.\n \n\n   \n    December 2022\n \n\n   \n  Brian Walshe began to suspect his wife was having an affair, according to  Norfolk County Assistant District Attorney Greg Connor .\n \n\n   \n  “He was routinely visiting the Instagram page of one of her male friends. And on December 26th, his mother – with his input and direction – obtained and hired a private investigator to surveil Ana Walshe in Washington, DC.”\n \n\n   \n  Brian Walshe’s defense attorney disputes the allegation that the husband suspected his wife was having an affair.\n \n\n   \n    December 27, 2022\n \n\n   \n  Brian Walshe Google searched, “What’s the best state to divorce for a man,” according to prosecutors.\n \n\n   \n    December 28, 2022\n \n\n   \n  During dinner with a friend in DC, Ana Walshe “became uncharacteristically upset and told her friend she believed that Mr. Walshe was going to be incarcerated as a result of his federal case, and that she was prepared to leave him and take the children to Washington, DC,” according to Connor.\n \n\n   \n    December 30, 2022\n \n\n   \n  Ana Walshe flew home to Massachusetts to be with her family during for the holiday weekend and was not expected to return to DC until January 3, prosecutor Connor said.\n \n\n   \n    December 31, 2022\n \n\n   \n  The Walshes hosted a New Year’s Eve dinner at their home with a friend named Gem, Brian Walshe told police, according to an affidavit.\n \n\n   \n  Brian and Ana Walshe went to bed shortly after the friend left around 1 or 1:30 a.m., he told investigators, according to the affidavit. He also told police that Ana Walshe said she had a work emergency and needed to fly to Washington for her job the next morning.\n \n\n   \n    January 1, 2023\n \n\n   \n  Brian Walshe told police that the morning of New Year’s Day, Ana Walshe “got ready and kissed him goodbye and told him to go back to sleep,”  the affidavit states. She usually took an Uber, Lyft or taxi to the airport and left between 6 and 7 a.m., according to the affidavit.\n \n\n   \n  According to prosecutors, Brian Walshe made a  series of Google searches  on his son’s iPad, including “How long before a body starts to smell,” “10 ways to dispose of a dead body if you really need to,” “How long for someone to be missing to inherit,” and “How to clean blood from wooden floor.”\n \n\n   \n  Walshe told police a babysitter arrived in the afternoon, and he left home to get groceries at about 3 p.m., the affidavit states. \n \n\n   \n  He told police he then went to see his mother around 4 p.m. in Swampscott, about an hour drive from Cohasset, but did not have his cell phone and got lost – making the trip longer than usual, the affidavit states. \n \n\n   \n  He said he left his mother’s home within about 15 minutes of arriving to run errands for her at Whole Foods and CVS. Brian Walshe told police he eventually returned home to Cohasset at about 8 p.m., according to the affidavit.\n \n\n   \n  But prosecutors say the evidence from January 1 tells a far different story than what Walshe claimed. \n \n\n   \n  Brian Walshe had told the babysitter and a family friend that he had lost his phone, Connor said.\n \n\n   \n  But “subsequent analysis of his phone determined that it was actually plugged in the morning of January 1,” Connor said. \n \n\n   \n  “However, while his phone stayed at the house, the oldest child’s cell phone did not.”\n \n\n   \n  Cell phone data from January 1 showed the oldest child’s device had traveled to two stores. Surveillance video showed Brian Walshe walking into those same stores by himself, Connor said.\n \n\n   \n  Around 5:30 p.m., surveillance video showed Walshe and his vehicle going to a dumpster in the parking lot of a liquor store and disposing of items before returning to his car, the prosecutor said. \n \n\n   \n  Afterward, cell phone data shows the device traveled to the dumpster at an apartment complex where Brian Walshe’s mother lived. \n \n\n   \n  The phone then traveled to a Lowe’s store, where Walshe is also seen on surveillance footage. He purchased five 5-gallon buckets, a hacksaw, 48 terry cloth towels, a full-coverage suit, 200 disposable rags, trash bags and cleaning products, Connor said. \n \n\n   \n  The phone then traveled to a CVS store, where Walshe was also seen on surveillance video purchasing “13 different types of hydrogen peroxide,” the prosecutor said.\n \n\n   \n    January 2, 2023\n \n\n   \n  Ana Walshe’s cell phone pinged in the area of their Cohasset home on January 1 and 2, prosecutor Lynn Beland said.\n \n\n   \n  Brian Walshe told investigators that he took one of his children for ice cream at a juice bar in Norwell on January 2 while the babysitter watched his two other kids, the affidavit states. Investigators confirmed this trip occurred, the affidavit states.\n \n\n   \n  He went to Home Goods and purchased three rugs, prosecutors said.\n \n\n   \n  Just after noon, prosecutors said, Brian Walshe made several more Google searches: “Hacksaw best tool to dismember,” “Can you be charged with murder without a body,” and “Can you identify a body with broken teeth.”\n \n\n   \n  According to surveillance video, Brian Walshe traveled to a Home Depot in Rockland wearing a surgical mask and gloves and made a cash purchase, the affidavit states. There, Walshe bought $450 of cleaning supplies, including mops, a bucket, tarps, goggles, a hatchet and baking soda, Beland said.\n \n\n   \n    January 3, 2023\n \n\n   \n  Brian Walshe allegedly made more Google searches, including “What happens to hair on a dead body,” “What is the rate of decomposition of a body found in a plastic bag compared to on a surface in the woods,” and “Can baking soda mask or make a body smell good,” prosecutors said.\n \n\n   \n  Cell phone data tracked Brian Walshe’s whereabouts to an apartment complex in Abington at 4:27 p.m., according to prosecutors. Surveillance video shows he exited his car with a heavy garbage bag and put it into a dumpster, prosecutors said.\n \n\n   \n  At 4:48 p.m., he traveled to another apartment complex in the same town, and at 5:10 p.m. he went to an apartment complex in a different town where he again discarded items in a dumpster, prosecutors said.\n \n\n   \n  These garbage bags were taken away and incinerated by the time police tracked them down, prosecutors said.\n \n\n   \n    January 4, 2023\n \n\n   \n  Brian Walshe visited Home Goods and TJ Maxx to buy towels and bath mats and visited Lowe’s to buy squeegees and a trash can, prosecutors said.\n \n\n   \n  Ana Walshe’s employer, the real estate company Tishman Speyer, called police to report she did not show up for her job, according to Cohasset police logs.\n \n\n   \n  According to Brian Walshe’s defense attorney, he called her workplace to ask whether they knew of her whereabouts before the employer called police.\n \n\n   \n  Cohasset Police went to Ana Walshe’s home for a well-being check, according to an affidavit. Brian Walshe spoke with investigators multiple times and provided the above timeline for his actions and whereabouts on January 1 and 2.\n \n\n   \n  Police noticed that Brian Walshe’s vehicle had the back seats down and a plastic liner in the back of the car, according to prosecutors.\n \n\n   \n    January 5, 2023\n \n\n   \n  Police noticed that the plastic liner was gone from Brian Walshe’s vehicle, and the carpet of the car showed fresh vacuum streaks, prosecutors said. Brian Walshe told police he threw the liner in the trash.\n \n\n   \n  Cell phone data showed Brian Walshe went to Swampscott and traveled to the corner of an apartment complex where there is a dumpster, according to prosecutors. Ten trash bags that originated from this dumpster contained blood stains, cleaning materials, a hacksaw, a hatchet, a purse and boots worn by Ana Walshe and her Covid-19 vaccination card, according to prosecutors.\n \n\n   \n   Cohasset Police announced Ana Walshe is missing  and asked the public to come forward with any information. Police said she was last seen “shortly after midnight on New Year’s Day.”\n \n\n   \n    January 6, 2023\n \n\n   \n  Police launched a massive search for Ana Walshe that included K-9 officers and search-and-rescue teams in the wooded areas near her home.\n \n\n   \n    January 7, 2023\n \n\n   \n  Investigators received an email saying “we have her here with us” and that Ana Walshe would not be returned until she paid $127,000,  according to court documents .\n \n\n   \n  “We have the so named Ana Walshe with us here… we had a deal worth $127,000… she messed up,” read the email, which was sent from the gmail account of “richardwalker9984.” It went on to say: “We have her here with us and if she doesn’t pay the money.. then she’ll never be back, and we know that the police and the FBI are involved.. good luck finding us.”\n \n\n   \n  Investigators said the email, which was sent to a Cohasset Police Department detective, was suspicious because it did not put forth a timeline to respond to the demand and did not include contact information, according to the documents.\n \n\n   \n  At least six investigators were tasked with driving to the north shore area of Massachusetts and watching surveillance video to try to verify Walshe’s timeline of events, the affidavit states. Investigators did not observe Brian Walshe on video at the Whole Foods or CVS in Swampscott on January 1, as he had stated, the affidavit says.\n \n\n   \n  Cohasset Police and Massachusetts State Police announced the search for Ana Walshe had ended.\n \n\n   \n    January 8, 2023\n \n\n   \n  Investigators obtained a search warrant for the Walshe’s Cohasset home and found blood and a bloody knife in the basement, prosecutors said.\n \n\n   \n  Brian Walshe was arrested and charged with misleading a police investigation,  police said in a statement .\n \n\n   \n    January 9, 2023\n \n\n   \n  Brian Walshe was arraigned in court and pleaded not guilty to a charge of misleading police.\n \n\n   \n  Beland, the prosecutor, said investigators had found no evidence of Ana Walshe taking a rideshare from the couple’s home on January 1. She said his statements to police caused a delay in the investigation.\n \n\n   \n  The judge set bail at $500,000 cash and set the next hearing for February 9.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors released the affidavit in support of a criminal complaint that lays out authorities’ timeline of the prior week. The affidavit describes Brian Walshe’s statements to police as a “clear attempt to mislead and delay investigators.”\n \n\n   \n  The affidavit outlines several trips he made that were not requested and approved beforehand and that may represent violations of the terms of his probation.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators conducted searches north of Boston and collected a number of items that would be processed and tested, the Norfolk district attorney said. The DA also called Ana Walshe’s disappearance “suspicious.”\n \n\n   \n  According to a source with direct knowledge of the investigation, investigators put crime scene tape around dumpsters near the home of Brian Walshe’s mother in Swampscott and dug through trash at a transfer station in Peabody. Both locations are north of Boston.\n \n\n   \n  Law enforcement sources told CNN investigators found a hacksaw, torn-up cloth material and what appears to be bloodstains at the Peabody site. The evidence was sent for testing.\n \n\n   \n    January 17, 2023\n \n\n   \n  An arrest warrant  charging Brian Walshe with murder  was issued for the death of his wife, according to  Norfolk District Attorney Michael Morrissey .\n \n\n   \n    January 18, 2023\n \n\n   \n  Brian Walshe was arraigned in Quincy District Court on  charges of murder and disinterring of a body without authority . \n \n\n   \n  Prosecutor Beland accused him of dismembering his wife and disposing her remains in dumpsters. She also laid out some of the evidence that led to the charges, including the discovery of Ana Walshe’s belongings and blood in the garbage and Brian Walshe’s Google searches.\n \n\n   \n  A not guilty plea was entered on Brian Walshe’s behalf. His attorney at the time, Tracy Miner, issued a statement suggesting the evidence against him was not strong.\n \n\n   \n  “In my experience, where, as here, the prosecution leaks so-called evidence to the press before they provide it to me, their case isn’t that strong,” she said. “When they have a strong case, they give me everything as soon as possible. We shall see what they have and what evidence is admissible in court, where the case will ultimately be decided.”\n \n\n   \n    March 30, 2023\n \n\n   \n  A  grand jury indicts Brian Walshe  on charges of murder, misleading investigators, and improperly conveying a human body, according to a district attorney. The indictment moves the case from Quincy District Court to Norfolk County Superior Court.\n \n\n   \n    April 27, 2023\n \n\n   \n  Brian Walshe was arraigned in Norfolk County Superior Court and pleaded not guilty to the charges. \n \n\n   \n  Prosecutor Connor laid out a spate of new details from the investigation. Among them: “Ana Walshe had taken out approximately $2.7 million in life insurance on herself, where Brian Walshe is the sole beneficiary,” Connor said. She also had a life insurance policy through her employer.\n \n\n   \n  Miner, his then-attorney, countered the prosecution’s notion that Walshe was trying to cash in on his wife’s life insurance policies. She said there is “no evidence Mr. Walshe was the least bit needing of money” and noted that his mother is wealthy.\n \n\n   \n  The judge ordered Brian Walshe to be held without bail.\n \n\n   \n    February 20, 2024\n \n\n   \n  Brian Walshe was  sentenced to 37 months  in prison and three years of supervised release and was ordered to pay restitution of $475,000 in the federal fraud case for selling fake Andy Warhol paintings.\n \n\n   \n    November 14, 2025\n \n\n   \n  Brian Walshe was ruled competent to stand trial after a 40-day stint in a state hospital for mental health evaluation, Judge Diane Freniere said in Norfolk County Superior Court.\n \n\n   \n  The trial was originally slated to begin October 20 but was delayed after Walshe’s attorneys called his competency into question after he was attacked in jail in September.\n \n\n   \n    November 18, 2025\n \n\n   \n  Just before jury selection began, Brian Walshe  pleaded guilty  to misleading police and improper conveyance of a human body related to the death of his wife. The guilty plea was made without a deal with prosecutors.\n \n\n   \n  Walshe faces a maximum sentence of 10 years on the misleading police charge, with up to a 20-year sentence enhancement if convicted of murder. He faces up to 3 years in prison on the conveyance charge.\n \n\n   \n  His attorney made clear he was not admitting to the murder of his wife.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/americas/us-military-deployment-support-caribbean-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00Z","title":"What we know of the countries backing US military moves in the Caribbean","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United States has launched a coordinated military and diplomatic campaign in the Caribbean under Operation Southern Spear, targeting drug trafficking networks allegedly linked to Venezuela.

2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The United States shared images on Wednesday of joint military exercises in  Trinidad and Tobago , as its armed forces amass in the region, building pressure on  Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro .\n \n\n   \n  The deployment is receiving logistical and diplomatic support from multiple Latin American countries, ranging from limited assistance to open cooperation with to US forces.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s more on who’s backing the US operation in the Caribbean, which Washington says is meant to combat drug trafficking in the region:\n \n\n   \n    Trinidad and Tobago\n \n\n   \n  Trinidad and Tobago, which is only 11 kilometers (7 miles) from Venezuela at its closest point, has declared its full support for the US operation.\n \n\n   \n  “I, along with most of the country, am happy that the US naval deployment is having success in their mission,” Trinidadian Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar said in early September, after the US launched its first attack on an  alleged drug vessel  in the Caribbean. “I have no sympathy for traffickers; the US military should kill them all violently,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  After the US began the deployment in August, Persad-Bissessar also warned that if Venezuela attacks Guyana, a country with which it has a  territorial dispute , she would grant the US government access for defense operations. The declaration showed her willingness to abandon a yearslong policy of neutrality and a pragmatic relationship with Venezuela based on economic interests.\n \n\n   \n  In late October, the US Navy destroyer USS Gravely carried out military drills in Trinidad and Tobago for several days, a move that the Venezuelan government called “a hostile provocation.” Maduro responded by announcing the suspension of bilateral gas agreements with the country, claiming its prime minister was threatening to turn Trinidad and Tobago into “the aircraft carrier of the US empire against Venezuela.”\n \n\n   \n    Guyana\n \n\n   \n  Guyana backed the US military deployment in the Caribbean shortly after it started in August, saying it would support a “collaborative and integrated approach to tackle transnational organized crime.”\n \n\n   \n  It added that transnational organized crime was a “threat to peace and security in the region” and involved networks like “the Cartel de los Soles of Venezuela.”\n \n\n   \n  Washington claims Cartel de los Soles is led by Maduro and is responsible for trafficking drugs to the US and Europe. Caracas has dismissed the accusation as a “fabrication.” But experts and former US government officials  say the group is not a  formally organized cartel, and it’s a stretch to suggest Maduro leads it, though there is government involvement in the drug trade.\n \n\n   \n  The head of US Southern Command Admiral Alvin Holsey visited Guyana this month to promote regional security and met with senior commanders to discuss a long-standing defense alliance between both countries, the US Embassy said.\n \n\n   \n    El Salvador\n \n\n   \n  In early November, an AC-130J military aircraft operated by the US Air Force was spotted in El Salvador’s Comalapa Cooperative Security Base, according to photos and satellite imagery obtained by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The gunship can carry Hellfire missiles but is primarily armed with large-caliber cannons. The AC-130J seen in El Salvador had two cannons – including a 105mm howitzer – visible its left side.\n \n\n   \n  Until recently, the Salvadoran base had been used almost exclusively for unarmed aircraft, according to the US Southern Command. Its location near the coast provides a strategic position for the US campaign in the Pacific, as the reach of bases in the Caribbean is limited.\n \n\n   \n  “Operating from Comalapa offers more options and allows for monitoring and defending a much wider swath of the Pacific Ocean, through which much of the cocaine trafficked to the United States passes,” Ryan Berg, director of the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told CNN earlier in  November. \n \n\n   \n  Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele has not commented specifically on the US military deployment, but he has a close relationship with US President Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n    Panama\n \n\n   \n  US military personnel are conducting training exercises in Panama, although the government of President José Raúl Mulino is trying to downplay the matter.\n \n\n   \n  The president denied last week that his country is participating in any “hostile act against Venezuela” and asserted that the military maneuvers are part of bilateral cooperation agreements with Washington.\n \n\n   \n  Panama, which has not had armed forces since 1990, has hosted military exercises since the  US invasion of the country in 1989 . In April, Panama signed a memorandum of cooperation enabling a greater US military presence and authorizing the use of air and naval bases for joint exercises. Mulino again denied that the activities are related to the White House’s pressure on Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n    Dominican Republic\n \n\n   \n  President Luis Abinader said Monday that the Dominican Republic and the US Drug Enforcement Administration would launch “much more extensive and in-depth” actions in the fight against drug trafficking.\n \n\n   \n  That same day, Dominican authorities said they boarded a speedboat with 806 packages of suspected cocaine off the coast of Pedernales. The National Drug Control Directorate said the intervention was in support of Operation Southern Spear, the name the Pentagon uses for the military deployment in the region.\n \n\n   \n  The collaboration had already begun on Saturday, when authorities seized another shipment of nearly 500 packages of cocaine on a speedboat.\n \n\n   \n    Puerto Rico and other bases\n \n\n   \n  Puerto Rico, a self-governing US territory in the Caribbean, also plays a key role in the deployment, as it contains the most US military bases in the Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n   Satellite imagery and photographs  taken in the area show that Roosevelt Roads Naval Station, which had been closed since 2004, is now operational again, and that US Marines supporting the Southern Command missions participated in amphibious landing drills in the archipelago in late September.\n \n\n   \n  The United States has two other bases in and around the Caribbean, but in both cases, the countries where they’re located have spoken out against the deployment.\n \n\n   \n  In southeastern Cuba, the Guantanamo Naval Base has been used for logistical, surveillance, and other operations since 1903, but the Cuban government, an ally of Venezuela, has repeatedly rejected the US military presence as well as its recent deployment.\n \n\n   \n  Washington also has an air base in Honduras staffed by more than 500 US military personnel and 500 Honduran and American civilians, according to its website. In January, before Trump took office, Honduran President Xiomara Castro threatened to reconsider the use of the base if the US carried out mass deportations. In August, she called some of Washington’s accusations against Maduro “unfounded” and later spoke out against the US military deployment in the Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n    Political support\n \n\n   \n  Countries in South America have shown political support for Washington’s pressure campaign on Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  In August, Ecuador designated Cartel de los Soles as an “organized crime terrorist group.” The decree was signed by President Daniel Noboa, an ally of Washington, whose attempts to lift a ban on foreign military bases was rejected in a recent referendum.\n \n\n   \n  Paraguay and Argentina, other White House allies, have also designated Cartel de los Soles as a terrorist organization.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/climate/trump-endangered-species-act-protection-roll-back","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"15:36:00-05:00","title":"Trump moves to strip protections for endangered and threatened species","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration, through the Interior Department’s Fish and Wildlife Service and NOAA’s National Marine Fisheries Service, has proposed rolling back Biden-era protections for endangered and threatened species by reinstating rules from its first term that prioritize economic development over species conservation.

report \n       \n  By Alicia Wallace, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:40 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  One of the most hotly anticipated economic reports is finally set to be released Thursday: the long-delayed jobs report for September, originally due on October 3. It lands as the floodgates open for a slew of backlogged economic data that was held up due to the historic government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Sitting on the shelf for six weeks, the months-old data has the potential to come across as stale – especially for a fast-moving economy that is  feeling increasingly perilous  for many Americans and  businesses .\n \n\n   \n  Economic uncertainty and the rising cost of living have caused consumers to pull back (as  The Home Depot  and  Target  can attest). Affordability concerns are reaching a fever pitch (so much so that President Donald Trump  exempted some grocery store items  like coffee, beef and fruit from steep tariffs).\n \n\n   \n  However, the end of the federal data drought provides a much-needed look at how the economy fared in recent weeks and what’s in store for the months to come.\n \n\n   \n  Plus, Thursday’s report might very well be the last clean jobs report for a couple of months, since the  shutdown mucked up the finely tuned process of data collection and analysis during October  and part of November.\n \n\n   \n  And on Wednesday we learned that some of that October jobs data – the payroll numbers from the establishment survey – will be included with the November jobs report that’s pushed back to December 16, from December 5. The household survey data was not able to be collected, BLS said.\n \n\n   \n  As such, Thursday’s jobs report will provide a critical baseline of the US labor market entering the fourth quarter.\n \n\n   \n  Economists are expecting 50,000 jobs were added in September and that the unemployment rate held steady at 4.3%, according to FactSet. The consensus estimates would mark a pickup from  August’s preliminary 22,000-job gain .\n \n\n   \n  If September job gains come in as expected at 50,000, they will keep this year on course for the weakest employment growth since the pandemic and, before that, the Great Financial Crisis.   \n \n\n   \n  “I’m not expecting huge changes in the (September) report, relative to past reports,” said Allison Shrivastava, economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab. “I really just expect this continuation of this anemic job market that we’ve seen.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s been a low-hire, low-fire slog of a labor market where the lion’s share of job gains has occurred in health care and social services.\n \n\n   \n  That trend was largely confirmed by a  host of private sector  labor market data released during the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Still, while economists aren’t expecting many surprises, Thursday’s report doesn’t come without some fairly big risks – especially for the consideration of monetary policy. The Federal Reserve trimmed interest rates by a quarter point on October 29 with a backdrop of a “less dynamic and somewhat softer labor market,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time.\n \n\n   \n  “Anything that looks kind of ugly now has had the potential to fester for a little bit longer, for the six weeks before we got a better eye on it,” Oliver Allen, senior US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    ‘A precarious place’\n \n\n   \n  Job growth was expected to slow following the post-pandemic economic recovery; however, it’s been  practically listless  the past several months. Since May, job gains have averaged 31,000 per month, which is about one-fifth of the average seen in 2024, BLS data shows.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re in this place of such uncertainty because there’s so much change in policy,” Shrivastava said, noting the frequently changing tariff rates imposed by the Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n  The economy has continued to expand in recent months and consumer spending has held up; however, it’s wealthier Americans who are propping up those outlays.\n \n\n   \n  “This is already a pretty precarious spending situation that could really topple,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The bifurcation (also widely known as  K-shaped  or two-lane) in the spending environment has further contributed to the bifurcation in the labor market. Aside from health care, social services and leisure and hospitality (to some extent), job gains have been flat or negative in many industries, she said.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to uncertainty around trade policy, factors such as immigration, artificial intelligence, federal employment and funding cuts, high interest rates and pandemic-era overhiring are serving as headwinds, she said.\n \n\n   \n  And that in turn, will continue to put downward pressure on wages and serve as barriers for people trying to break into or re-enter the labor market, she said.\n \n\n   \n  Continuing jobless claims, which are submitted by people who have filed for at least a week or more of unemployment, have been hovering at around four-year highs, Department of Labor data shows. The latest claims data, which was filled in partially this week, showed that continuing claims were 1.957 million as of October 18, the highest since August.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re in a precarious place, we’re in an anemic place, but not necessarily something wholly negative,” Shrivastava said.\n \n\n   \n    A more ‘upbeat’ outlook for 2026\n \n\n   \n  Still, layoff activity hasn’t worrisomely accelerated: First-time claims for unemployment benefits were 232,000 as of October 18, a tally that was in line with September.\n \n\n   \n  If claims are “in the order of, 300,000 to 400,000 and once we kind of are consistently above that level, then I’d start to be a little more worried about the job market in general,” Oren Klachkin, financial market economist at Nationwide, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  At this point, Klachkin and other Nationwide economists “don’t see a recession on the horizon anytime soon.”\n \n\n   \n  “If I had to put a metaphor around it, it’s like we’re at the end stages of a marathon for the labor market,” Klachkin said. “We came out of the pandemic with extremely robust gains in job growth, and now we’re reaching the end stages of this so-called race, where the job market is looking a bit softer, a bit slower and is potentially at risk, just given where we are in the cycle.”\n \n\n   \n  The labor market is vulnerable to a crash-out; however, the odds are still in favor of it trudging across the finish line and to a point where it could get refueled early next year by increased certainty around tariff rates as well as a potential fiscal boost from the tax and spending bill.\n \n\n   \n  “In the earnings results for the third quarter, the corporate sector is still essentially signaling that we can be relatively upbeat about the economy into next year,” Klachkin said.\n \n\n   \n   This story was updated to include additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/health/fluoride-drinking-water-cognition-positive-link","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"15:54:00-05:00","title":"Fluoride in drinking water does not negatively affect cognitive ability — and may actually provide benefit, study finds","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A new study led by Dr. Rob Warren at the University of Minnesota, published in Science Advances, finds that exposure to recommended levels of fluoride in drinking water is not associated with cognitive decline and may even improve cognitive performance in youth, especially when exposure is consistent throughout childhood. The research, which analyzed data from nearly 27,000 individuals followed from the 1980s to 2021, challenges earlier claims from the National Toxicology Program that high fluoride exposure reduces IQ, noting those claims used unrealistic, toxic exposure levels. The study emphasizes that public policy should be based on real-world, typical fluoride exposure levels, not extreme or unrepresentative doses. While states like Utah and Florida have banned fluoridation, and figures like Robert F.

But new research challenges recent claims about the risks of fluoride in drinking water — and instead suggests that it may have additional positive effects.\n \n\n   \n  The heightened federal debate was spurred by a  recent government study  from the National Toxicology Program that concluded that high levels of fluoride exposure are linked to lower IQ in children, but that study evaluated fluoride exposures that were at least twice the federally recommended limits with notably “ insufficient data ” to determine the effects of lower levels.\n \n\n   \n  The new study looked at more typical, recommended levels of fluoride in drinking water and instead found “robust evidence” that young people exposed to fluoride at these lower levels actually performed better on ​cognitive tests than their peers who did not have fluoride in their drinking water.\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Rob Warren, lead author of the  study published in the journal Science Advances  on Wednesday, said he was “shocked” by the findings from the National Toxicology Program study and motivated to provide research that was more relevant to public policy decisions.\n \n\n   \n  “I wouldn’t have done this work had it not been an empirical question that I didn’t think we had an answer to, of great immediate policy interest,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  US Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has called fluoride “an industrial waste” and cited “IQ loss” in  pledges  to roll back federal recommendations that fluoride be added to municipal drinking water.  Utah  and  Florida  have become the first two states to ban the practice.\n \n\n   \n  “Imagine testing some new drug for heart disease and the recommended dosage is 100 milligrams, and then your study compares people who get a million milligrams to people who get half a million milligrams. Well, that doesn’t tell you anything about the effect of getting 100 milligrams versus getting nothing,” Warren said. “That’s kind of the world we’re in with fluoride research. It’s important to know that if you get a toxic dose, really bad things happen to your body, but that’s not relevant for the public policy discussion.”\n \n\n   \n  Warren, a sociology professor at the University of Minnesota, leads a program that started in the US Department of Education and has followed a cohort of tens of thousands of people for more than four decades since their high school years in the 1980s.\n \n\n   \n  For the new study, he and other researchers used this data to overlay performance on mathematics, reading and vocabulary tests for a nationally representative sample of nearly 27,000 people with their exposure to fluoride in community drinking water based on historical data from HHS and the US Geological Survey.\n \n\n   \n  The analysis assumed that individuals lived near their high school for their whole childhood and grouped them based on whether they would have been consistently exposed to recommended fluoride levels through community water fluoridation or natural occurrence of the mineral, consistently lacking exposure to fluoride, or partly exposed if their community changed their local fluoridation policy at some point during their childhood.\n \n\n   \n  Students who were exposed to fluoride for part of their childhood had higher test scores in high school than those who had no exposure to fluoride, and the difference was even greater for those who were exposed to fluoride for their whole childhood, the study found. Follow-up tests continued through 2021, when most participants had reached 60 years of age, and suggested that fluoride exposure also did not contribute to cognitive decline as participants aged.\n \n\n   \n  Cognitive tests are not direct measures of IQ. There is a strong correlation, Warren says, but cognitive tests measure a mix of how well someone’s brain works along with the opportunities they’ve had to learn the material. He’s working on additional research that will directly assess the link between fluoride and IQ, with more precise measurements data about where the individuals lived during childhood, too.\n \n\n   \n  Other  research  from this year estimated that removing fluoride from public water in the US would lead to 25.4 million excess decayed teeth in children and adolescents within five years, along with $9.8 billion in health care costs. The new study did not measure individual dental health, but experts say that pain from tooth decay can cause children to have trouble focusing in school or miss it completely — which could be a factor affecting cognitive test scores.\n \n\n   \n  Fluoride is a mineral that can be found naturally in some foods and groundwater. It can help prevent tooth decay by strengthening the protective outer layer of enamel that can be worn away by acids formed by bacteria, plaque and sugars in the mouth. The practice of adding fluoride to public water systems started in the United States in 1945 to help improve oral health in a cost-effective and equitable way.\n \n\n   \n  The American Dental Association and many experts have continued to support the practice of community water fluoridation, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has not changed its recommendations. The agency cannot mandate that communities add fluoride to their water, but it considers 0.7 milligrams of fluoride per liter of water to be the “optimal level.”\n \n\n   \n  But the US Food and Drug Administration recently  took action  to restrict the use of prescription fluoride supplements. “There are better ways to protect children’s teeth than taking unapproved ingestible fluoride, which is now recognized to alter the gut microbiome,” FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary said in a news release about the action.\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Bruce Lanphear, an epidemiologist and professor at Simon Fraser University in Canada, said it’s important to capture a more complete set of all sources of fluoride exposures, such as toothpaste and pesticides.\n \n\n   \n  “Population strategies – like fluoridation, like vaccination, like taking lead out of gasoline – they can be extraordinarily powerful. If you’ve got a safe and effective intervention, you can have a big impact on the health of populations,” he said. “But when you have a population strategy like fluoridation, the evidence about its safety and about its effectiveness has to be extraordinarily strong.”\n \n\n   \n  But in a  formal response  to the new research that was also published in Science Advances on Wednesday, Dr. David Savitz, an epidemiologist with the Brown University School of Public Health, argues that the greater burden lies on proving the risk before ending a public health practice that has been successful for decades.\n \n\n   \n  “Until clear evidence exists that water fluoridation lacks public health benefit or compelling evidence of harm at the level of fluoride exposure in fluoridated water, neither of which has occurred, it seems foolhardy to interfere with a long-established and well-recognized public health success,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “With due credit to the folk wisdom of Bert Lance, director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Jimmy Carter, ‘If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.’ Warren and colleagues move the needle a bit further into the ‘ain’t broke’ range.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/health/tierra-walker-death-texas-propublica","dateOfPublication":"2023-10-05","timeOfPublication":"10:00:00Z","title":"The Evolution of Cultural Celebrations in 2023","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"This article explores the evolving nature of cultural practices in modern society, focusing on how traditions such as New Year's Day and the Festival of Lights are being reinterpreted to reflect contemporary values.

She died after she couldn’t get an abortion in Texas \n       \n  By Kavitha Surana and Lizzie Presser, ProPublica; Photography by Lexi Parra for ProPublica\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:12 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   This story was originally published by  ProPublica . \n \n\n   \n   ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive  its biggest stories  as soon as they’re published. \n \n\n   \n  Tierra Walker had reached her limit. In the weeks since she’d learned she was pregnant, the 37-year-old dental assistant had been wracked by unexplained seizures and mostly confined to a hospital cot. With soaring blood pressure and diabetes, she knew she was at high risk of developing preeclampsia, a pregnancy complication that could end her life.\n \n\n   \n  Her mind was made up on the morning of Oct. 14, 2024: For the sake of her 14-year-old son, JJ, she needed to ask her doctor for an abortion to protect her health.\n \n\n   \n  “Wouldn’t you think it would be better for me to not have the baby?” she asked a physician at Methodist Hospital Northeast near San Antonio, according to her aunt. Just a few years earlier, Walker had developed a dangerous case of preeclampsia that had led to the stillbirth of her twins.\n \n\n   \n  But the doctor, her family said, told her what many other medical providers would say in the weeks that followed: There was no emergency; nothing was wrong with her pregnancy, only her health.\n \n\n   \n  Just after Christmas, on his birthday, JJ found his mom draped over her bed, lifeless. An autopsy would later confirm what she had feared: Preeclampsia killed her at 20 weeks pregnant.\n \n\n   \n  Walker’s death is one of multiple cases ProPublica is investigating in which women with underlying health conditions died after they were unable to end their pregnancies.\n \n\n   \n  Walker had known that abortion was illegal in Texas, but she had thought that hospitals could make an exception for patients like her, whose health was at risk.\n \n\n   \n  The reality: In states that ban abortion, patients with chronic conditions and other high-risk pregnancies often have nowhere to turn.\n \n\n   \n  They enter pregnancy sick and are expected to get sicker. Yet lawmakers who wrote the bans have refused to create exceptions for health risks. As a result, many hospitals and doctors, facing the threat of criminal charges, no longer offer these patients terminations, ProPublica found in interviews with more than 100 OB-GYNs across the country. Instead, these women are left to gamble with their lives.\n \n\n   \n  As Walker’s blood pressure swung wildly and a blood clot threatened to kill her, she continued to press doctors at prenatal appointments and emergency room visits, asking if it was safe for her to continue the pregnancy. Although one doctor documented in her medical record that she was at “high risk of clinical deterioration and/or death,” she was told over and over again that she didn’t need to worry, her relatives say. More than 90 doctors were involved in Walker’s care, but not one offered her the option to end her pregnancy, according to medical records.\n \n\n   \n  Walker’s case unfolded during the fall of 2024, when the dangers of abortion bans were a focus of protests, media coverage and electoral campaigns across the country. ProPublica had revealed that five women —  three   in Texas   alone  — had died after they were unable to access standard reproductive care under the new bans.\n \n\n   \n  ProPublica condensed more than 6,500 pages of Walker’s medical records into a summary of her care with the guidance of two high-risk pregnancy specialists. More than a dozen OB-GYNs reviewed the case for ProPublica and said that since Walker had persistently high blood pressure, it would have been standard medical practice to advise her of the serious risks of her pregnancy early on, to revisit the conversation as new complications emerged and to offer termination at any point if she wanted it. Some described her condition as a “ticking time bomb.” Had Walker ended her pregnancy, every expert believed, she would not have died.\n \n\n   \n  Many said that her case illustrated why they think all patients need the freedom to choose how much risk they are willing to take during pregnancy. Walker expressed that she didn’t want to take that risk, her family says. She had a vibrant life, a husband and son whom she loved.\n \n\n   \n  Under Texas’ abortion law, though, that didn’t matter.\n \n\n   \n    ‘I don’t know how much more I can take’\n \n\n   \n  On a hot September day, Walker was lying down with JJ after a walk with their two small dogs, Milo and Twinkie, when she started shaking uncontrollably.\n \n\n   \n  Terrified, JJ called 911, asking for an ambulance.\n \n\n   \n  As the only child of a single mom, JJ had always considered Walker his closest friend, coach and protector wrapped in one. In their mobile home, JJ was greeted each morning by his mom’s wide smile and upturned eyes, as she shot off vocabulary quizzes or grilled him on state capitals. He loved how fearlessly she went after what she wanted; in 2021, she had proposed to her boyfriend, Eric Carson, and the two eloped. She’d just been talking about moving the family to Austin for a promotion she was offered at a dental clinic.\n \n\n   \n  At the hospital, JJ was shocked to see her so pale and helpless, with wires snaking from her head and arms.\n \n\n   \n  To Walker’s surprise, doctors quickly discovered that she was five weeks pregnant. They also noted hypertension at levels so high that it reduces circulation to major organs and can cause a heart attack or stroke. That, and her weight, age and medical history, put Walker at an increased risk of developing preeclampsia, a pregnancy-related blood pressure disorder, said Dr. Jennifer Lewey, director of the Penn Women’s Cardiovascular Health Program and expert in hypertension.\n \n\n   \n  “If I’m seeing a patient in her first trimester and her blood pressure is this uncontrolled — never mind anything else — what I’m talking about is: Your pregnancy will be so high risk, do we need to think about terminating the pregnancy and getting your health under control?”\n \n\n   \n  As Walker’s first trimester continued, she kept seizing. Her body convulsed, her eyes rolled back and she was often unable to speak for up to 30 minutes at a time. Some days, the episodes came in rapid waves, with little relief.\n \n\n   \n  For three weeks, she stayed at Methodist hospitals; doctors were not able to determine what was causing the spasms. Walker couldn’t get out of bed, in case a seizure made her fall, and this left her vulnerable to blood clots. She soon developed one in her leg that posed a new lethal threat: It could travel to her lungs and kill her instantly.\n \n\n   \n  Carson watched over her during the day and her aunt Latanya Walker took the night shift. She was panicked that her tough niece, whose constant mantra was “quit your crying,” now seemed defeated. One evening, during Walker’s third hospitalization, when she was about 9 weeks pregnant, she told Latanya she’d had a vision during a seizure: Her grandmother and aunt, who had died years earlier, were preparing a place for her on the other side.\n \n\n   \n  “You better tell them you’re not ready to go,” Latanya said.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t know how much more I can take of this,” Walker whispered.\n \n\n   \n  The next morning, Walker called for a doctor and asked about ending her pregnancy for the sake of her health. “When we get you under control, then everything will go smoothly,” the doctor replied, Latanya recalled. The physician on the floor was not an OB-GYN with the expertise to give a high-risk consultation, but the Walkers didn’t realize that this mattered. By the time the doctor left the room, her aunt said, tears streamed down Walker’s cheeks.\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Elizabeth Langen, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist in Michigan who reviewed Walker’s case, said a physician comfortable with high-risk pregnancies should have counseled her on the dangers of continuing and offered her an abortion. “The safest thing for her was to terminate this pregnancy, that’s for sure.”\n \n\n   \n  During Walker’s many hospital and prenatal visits, 21 OB-GYNs were among the more than 90 physicians involved in her care. None of them counseled her on the option — or the health benefits — of a termination, according to medical records.\n \n\n   \n  In Texas, the law bars “aiding and abetting” an illegal abortion. As a result, many physicians have avoided even mentioning it, according to interviews with dozens of doctors.\n \n\n   \n  In her condition, Walker couldn’t fathom leaving the state. When her aunt suggested ordering abortion medication online, Walker was worried she could go to jail. She was spending so much time in the hospital; what if she got caught taking the pills?\n \n\n   \n  At 12 weeks pregnant, she was admitted to University Hospital. Doctors there noted that even on anticoagulation medication, the clotting in Walker’s leg was so profound that she needed a thrombectomy to remove it.\n \n\n   \n  “At this point, we’ve gone from ‘complicated, but within the realm of normal’ to ‘we’ve got someone with a major procedure in pregnancy that tells us something isn’t going well,’” said Dr. Will Williams, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist in New Orleans, where an abortion ban is also in place. “In my practice, we’d have a frank discussion about whether this is a person we’d offer a termination to at the point of thrombectomy.”\n \n\n   \n  ProPublica reached out to five physicians who were involved in key moments of Walker’s care: the hospitalist on duty on Oct. 14, 2024, when she asked about ending her pregnancy; three OB-GYNs; and a hospitalist on duty at the time of her thrombectomy. They did not respond. The hospitals Walker visited, including those run by University Health System and Methodist Healthcare, which is co-owned by HCA, did not comment on Walker’s care, despite permission from her family. Although the Walkers have not pursued legal action, they have engaged a lawyer. A University Health System spokesperson said that it is the company’s policy not to comment on potential litigation.\n \n\n   \n  In her second trimester, Walker’s seizures continued and her hypertension remained out of control. At an appointment on Dec. 27, at around 20 weeks, a doctor noted spiking blood pressure and sent her to University Hospital’s ER. There, doctors recorded a diagnosis of preeclampsia.\n \n\n   \n  The experts who reviewed Walker’s vital signs for ProPublica said her blood pressure of 174 over 115 was so concerning at that point, she needed to be admitted and monitored. Most questioned her doctor’s choice not to label her condition as severe. The treatment for severe preeclampsia, which points to a problem with the placenta, is delivery — or, at 20 weeks, an abortion.\n \n\n   \n  Instead, doctors lowered her blood pressure with medication and sent her home.\n \n\n   \n  Three days later, JJ crawled into bed with his mom and fed her soup. “I’m so sorry,” Walker croaked. “It’s your birthday and it shouldn’t be like this.”\n \n\n   \n  He told his mom it was okay. He hadn’t expected laser tag or a trip to Dave & Buster’s this year. Over the past few months, when his mom was home, he had tried his best to make things easier on her, walking the dogs when she was out of breath, checking in every hour or so with a hug. JJ knew that after missing so many days of work, she had lost her job. She was stressed about getting enough food for the house. He was relieved when he heard her snoring — at least she was resting.\n \n\n   \n  That afternoon, when his stepdad was out grocery shopping and his grandmother was just getting back from dialysis, he cracked open the door to Walker’s room.\n \n\n   \n  His mom was lying face-down in bed, as if she had fallen over while getting up. JJ ran over and tried to find any sign she was breathing. When he called 911, a dispatcher coached him to slide her to the rug and start CPR.\n \n\n   \n  “I need you,” he shouted as he leaned over his mom, pressing down on her chest. “I need you!”\n \n\n   \n    ‘We have to allow for more exceptions’\n \n\n   \n  The anti-abortion activists who helped shape America’s latest wave of abortion bans have long seen health exemptions as a loophole that would get in the way of their goals. They fear such exceptions, if included in the laws, would  allow virtually anyone to terminate a pregnancy .\n \n\n   \n  In Idaho, an anti-abortion leader testifying at a state Senate hearing suggested doctors would use health exceptions to give abortions to patients with headaches.\n \n\n   \n  In South Dakota, a pregnant Republican lawmaker with a high risk of blood clots begged her colleagues to consider creating a health exception that would protect her; her bill never made it to a hearing.\n \n\n   \n  In Tennessee, an anti-abortion lobbyist with no medical training fought and defeated an amendment to the state law that would allow a health exception to “prevent” an emergency. He testified in the state Capitol that the carve-out was too broad since some pregnancy complications “work themselves out.”\n \n\n   \n  The refusal to entertain these broader exceptions is particularly consequential given the state of women’s health. Women are entering pregnancy older and sicker than they have in decades. The rate of blood pressure disorders in pregnancy has more than doubled since 1993; they now affect up to 15% of U.S. pregnancies. And they’re most prevalent in states with restrictive abortion policies, according to a 2023  study in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology . The burden of disease falls heaviest on Black women, like Walker, for an array of reasons: neighborhood disinvestment, poor access to health care and discrimination in the medical system. Cuts to Medicaid funding and changes to the Affordable Care Act are likely to exacerbate these problems, according to experts.\n \n\n   \n  Other countries give pregnant women and their doctors far more control over the medical decision to terminate. Across Europe, for example, most laws permit abortion for any reason through the first trimester, when more than 90% of abortions occur. After that gestational limit, their statutes also tend to include broad health exceptions that can be used for chronic conditions, illnesses that develop in pregnancy, fetal anomalies and, in some countries, mental health.\n \n\n   \n  U.S. abortion bans generally restrict interventions to a far more limited set of health risks, like a “life-threatening medical emergency” or “substantial and irreversible” harm to major organs. A small subset of lawyers and doctors argue that the law can and should be interpreted to cover patients with chronic conditions that are worsening in pregnancy. But the vaguely written bans threaten criminal penalties for performing an illegal abortion — in Texas, up to 99 years behind bars. In practice,  few hospitals grant health exceptions , ProPublica’s reporting has found.\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Jessica Tarleton, an OB-GYN who provides abortions in South Carolina, recalled how much changed at her hospital when the state’s ban was put in place: OB-GYNs who want to provide an abortion to a patient with a health risk now need to get a maternal-fetal medicine specialist to explicitly write in the chart that it is necessary, in compliance with the law. Not many doctors are willing to do so.\n \n\n   \n  “Some people were not because of their personal beliefs, and some because they didn’t want to be involved in any kind of potential legal actions,” Tarleton said. “They didn’t want their opinion to have anything to do with a patient getting an abortion or not.”\n \n\n   \n  Recently, for example, Cristina Nuñez sued two hospitals in El Paso for their inaction in her care in 2023. She had diabetes, uncontrolled blood pressure and end-stage kidney disease when she learned she was unexpectedly pregnant at 36. Doctors wrote in her medical record that “she needs termination based on threat to maternal life or health,” but Nuñez alleged that one hospital failed to find an anesthesiologist willing to participate. She remained pregnant for weeks, even as blood clots turned her right arm black, until an advocacy organization threatened legal action and she was able to obtain an abortion. The lawsuit is ongoing.\n \n\n   \n  This year, Texas Republicans  passed legislation with minor  amendments to their ban after ProPublica reported the deaths of three miscarrying women who did not receive critical abortion care during emergencies. In the updated law, an emergency still needs to be “life-threatening” to qualify for an abortion, but it no longer needs to be “imminent.” Doctors expect that most hospitals still won’t provide abortions to women like Walker who have dangerous chronic conditions but no certain threat to their lives.\n \n\n   \n  ProPublica asked Sen. Bryan Hughes, the author of Texas’ abortion ban, about how the specific complications Walker faced should be treated by doctors under the amended law. When her pregnancy began, would she be eligible for an abortion due to her health? Would she need to wait for a diagnosis of severe preeclampsia? Is there a reason the law doesn’t include an exception for health risks? ProPublica put the same questions to the 20 state senators who co-wrote the bipartisan amendment.\n \n\n   \n  Only Sen. Carol Alvarado, a Democrat, responded. In her view, the amendment was far too narrow. But, she said, her Republican colleagues defer to the far right of their base and oppose broader exceptions.\n \n\n   \n  “You can’t proclaim to be pro-life, but you’re passing laws that are endangering women and causing death,” she said. “We have to allow for more exceptions.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘So you’d rather let somebody die?’\n \n\n   \n  After Walker died, her family felt bewildered by her medical care. The doctors had assured them that her baby was healthy and she would be fine. The autopsy found that the fetus was indeed healthy, at just under a pound and measuring 9 inches long. But it showed that Walker had hypertensive cardiovascular disease with preeclampsia, along with an enlarged heart, dangerously full of fluid, and kidney damage — signs that her condition had declined even more than she knew.\n \n\n   \n  In Carson’s mind, the many doctors they saw cast the risks as challenges that would be overcome if his wife followed directions. “She was doing what they told her to do,” he said. He couldn’t understand how no one suggested ending the pregnancy to keep Walker safe. “Nobody said nothing.”\n \n\n   \n  Latanya worried the law played a role. “They didn’t want to offer to end the pregnancy, because the government or someone says you can’t? So you’d rather let somebody die?” she said. “Now we are the ones that have to suffer.”\n \n\n   \n  JJ couldn’t bear to stay in the home where he had found his mom, so he moved in with Latanya. Each day, he scrolls through old videos on the computer so he can hear Walker’s voice.\n \n\n   \n  Latanya does everything she can to support him, but she knows she can’t erase his pain.\n \n\n   \n  She recalls watching JJ steady himself at Walker’s funeral, to see her one last time. Until that point, he hadn’t cried.\n \n\n   \n  When he finally faced the open casket where his mom lay holding her fetus, JJ sank to his knees, overcome. His aunt, uncles, cousins and grandmother gathered around him and rocked him in their arms.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/us/melodee-buzzard-missing-investigation","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"15:32:00Z","title":"Child Missing: Mother’s Uncooperative Stance and Wigs Raise Red Flags in Melodee Buzzard Case","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Nine-year-old Melodee Buzzard has been missing for over a month since she was last seen with her mother, Ashlee Buzzard, during a cross-country road trip from California to Nebraska.

missing and her mother isn’t cooperating. What may happen next? \n       \n  By Eric Levenson, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:32 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Nine-year-old Melodee Buzzard has been missing for over a month after she was last seen with her mother wearing wigs on a cross-country road trip.\n \n\n   \n  The mother, Ashlee Buzzard, returned to their California home without Melodee, did not report her daughter missing and has declined to cooperate with law enforcement, according to the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office.\n \n\n   \n  The FBI has joined in the search for Melodee, and the case has drawn  widespread attention  well outside of Southern California. In all, the set of circumstances has raised serious red flags about Melodee’s well-being and about potential criminal wrongdoing for Buzzard.\n \n\n   \n  Still, investigators have not charged Buzzard with a crime related to Melodee’s disappearance.\n \n\n   \n  So, what gives?\n \n\n   \n  “It’s just not, ‘A kid’s missing. They haven’t been seen. Let’s arrest the mother,’” CNN legal analyst  Joey Jackson  said of how law enforcement operates. “What are the specific factual circumstances that would make the mother responsible?”\n \n\n   \n  “In any case, you need probable cause,” he added. “Is there reason to believe that a crime was committed and the subject of the person being arrested committed it?”\n \n\n   \n  CNN spoke to several legal experts and re-examined other high-profile missing children cases to better understand the potential path forward in Melodee’s case.\n \n\n   \n  The sheriff’s office, with assistance from the FBI, has been searching for Melodee and has publicly released some information from the “critical” time period of the road trip from October 7 to 10. Still, investigators may have more evidence that has not been released to the public, making it difficult to speculate on the case.\n \n\n   \n  “What they’re waiting for is evidence if she should be charged, and if so, with what,” Los Angeles’ Loyola Law School Professor  Laurie Levenson  said. “This one is still kind of a mystery. We know something is amiss: All of the wigs, the travel, the concerns that people are showing. I think those are legitimate that something is amiss, but we just don’t know what it is.”\n \n\n   \n    Melodee went missing last month\n \n\n   \n  The search for Melodee Buzzard began on October 14 when a school administrator reported the girl had been absent for a prolonged period of time.\n \n\n   \n  Officers searched the home, but Melodee was nowhere to be found, officials said. Her mother could not provide a “reasonable” explanation for her whereabouts and “has been uncooperative” with investigators, the sheriff’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  The investigation into Melodee’s whereabouts has focused on her and her mother’s movements during a 1,000-mile road trip from their home in Lompoc, California, to Nebraska. On October 7, Ashlee Buzzard left California with Melodee, driving a rented white 2024 Chevrolet Malibu, and returned three days later without the girl. That period is now a “critical” time frame for investigators, the sheriff’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  Surveillance footage from a rental car business in Lompoc showed the mother-daughter pair wearing wigs on October 7, the sheriff’s office said. Further, the rental car’s license plate was changed midway through the trip in what the sheriff’s office said is believed to be an attempt “to avoid detection.”\n \n\n   \n  “Investigators also believe that Ashlee swapped wigs throughout the trip, changing to a darker wig that is similar in color and style to the one Melodee was seen wearing,”  the sheriff’s office said in a November 6 statement . “This change in appearance is believed to have been intentional to avoid recognition during travel.”\n \n\n   \n  On November 7, the sheriff’s office  announced  Ashlee Buzzard was arrested on a felony false imprisonment charge related to an adult male victim. Authorities alleged she used a box cutter and “prevented a victim from leaving a location against their will.”\n \n\n   \n  The alleged victim in the case posted a statement on social media – which he later removed – saying he went to Buzzard’s house to offer help finding Melodee. He said Buzzard “became visibly distressed after sharing information she appeared to regret disclosing.”\n \n\n   \n  She pleaded not guilty and was released from custody with GPS monitoring. A preliminary court hearing is expected Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Buzzard’s attorney, Adrian Galvan, told CNN the defense was “eager to test” the accuser’s “credibility, veracity and reliability” in the false imprisonment incident. He declined to comment about the investigation into Melodee’s whereabouts.\n \n\n   \n  The Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office did not respond to a request for comment on the search for Melodee.\n \n\n   \n  Family members said they had lost touch with Melodee and Ashlee Buzzard in recent years. Melodee’s father died from a motorcycle crash when the girl was only 6 months old,  CNN affiliate KSBY  reported.\n \n\n   \n    The next steps in the investigation\n \n\n   \n  Investigators are likely to continue tracing the steps of the road trip as they search for physical evidence, digital communications and witnesses, legal experts told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “What they’re doing is what they should be doing,” CNN chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst John Miller explained. “They are taking their time. They are being meticulous. They are building the pieces of a case that may come together if and when they do have evidence to arrest her.”\n \n\n   \n  As for Buzzard, her uncooperative stance may be frustrating for investigators, but the Fifth Amendment guarantees everyone the right to silence in an interrogation.\n \n\n   \n  “There is no legal imperative at all, under any circumstance, no matter how bad things might look for you in public opinion, for you to say anything,” Jackson said.\n \n\n   \n    Other missing children cases\n \n\n   \n  In two high-profile cases involving missing children, the parents were initially charged with lesser counts as investigators continued to search for more evidence.\n \n\n   \n  Florida mother  Casey Anthony , for one, was initially charged with child neglect, providing false statements to police and obstruction in July 2008 in the disappearance of her 2-year-old daughter  Caylee Anthony . The child had last been seen a month earlier and was reported missing by her grandparents.\n \n\n   \n  Months later, in October of that year, Anthony was indicted on a first-degree murder charge. The decomposed body of her daughter was found in December 2008.\n \n\n   \n  A jury ultimately acquitted her of murder but convicted her on four counts of providing false information to police.\n \n\n   \n  Or consider the case of the Idaho mother  Lori Vallow Daybell .\n \n\n   \n  Her children, JJ and Tylee, were last seen in September 2019, and relatives raised concerns about their whereabouts two months later. In  February 2020 , Vallow Daybell was arrested in Hawaii on suspicion of two felony counts of desertion and nonsupport of dependent children.\n \n\n   \n  The children’s bodies were found in June 2020, and Vallow Daybell and her husband, Chad Daybell, were then indicted on murder charges in May 2021. Both were later  convicted  of  murder  in the children’s deaths.\n \n\n   \n  How Melodee’s case will play out remains a mystery.   In the near term, investigators’ focus will remain on finding her and her well-being.\n \n\n   \n  “There are so many open questions at this point,” Levenson said. “Right now, I think the priority is probably less the charges and more finding the kid.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/us/latino-population-us-tradition-identity-cec","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"16:00:00-05:00","title":"Latino Identity in the U.S. at a Turning Point Amid Anti-Immigration Sentiment","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Latino population, now over 68 million and representing nearly 20% of the population, is undergoing a significant transformation.

cultural traditions remain \n       \n  By Karen Esquivel and graphics by Jhasua Razo, CNN en Español\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:07 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In a country where some 68 million Latin Americans — nearly 20% of the population — are redefining their place in public life, Latino identity in the United States is at a turning point. Growth no longer depends primarily on immigration, but rather on a native-born generation that is transforming priorities and expectations.\n \n\n   \n  But this shift is occurring amid a harsher immigration policy. There have been  more than 500,000 deportations  and over  1.6 million voluntary self-deportations  since January 2025. That reality is impacting the economies of entire neighborhoods, increasing community tensions, and reshaping the political landscape.\n \n\n   \n  Between the growing presence of an increasingly younger population that still celebrates its origins and traditions and the pressure of historically aggressive measures, the question of what it means to be Latino in the US today is taking on new layers of complexity. Who are they, where do they come from, and how do they live?\n \n\n   \n  Many Hispanics feel more connected to the United States but remain tied to their country of origin’s traditions: food, language ,  and festivities are some of the customs they preserve, according to responses to a CNN survey answered by more than 120 readers, all Latino residents in the U . S.\n \n\n   \n  Sara Sánchez says she still enjoys Salvadoran food such as pupusas and in December celebrates Christmas Eve on December 24 and Christmas the following day with traditional dishes and music from her homeland.\n \n\n   \n  Arepas, for example, are still the preferred food of many Colombians and Venezuelans throughout the United States. Mexicans eat pozole, tacos, or beans on any given day, and Nicaraguans enjoy gallo pinto, a traditional dish that contains rice, beans, chili ,  and onion.\n \n\n   \n  Mexico’s Independence Day or Día de Muertos are celebrated by people who trace their origins to Mexico; some Colombians maintain religious celebrations such as Día de las Velitas or Colombia’s traditional Christmas festivities with their respective traditional dishes. Venezuelan music, especially Gaitas in December, is present in homes and gatherings.\n \n\n   \n    Diversity of origin\n \n\n   \n  The growing Latino community in the United States reached a record of over 68 million in 2024, according to  Census Bureau figures . This means its population is larger than that of countries such as Spain, Canada ,  and any other in Latin America except Brazil (over 211 million) and Mexico (130 million).\n \n\n   \n  Historically, the Mexican population has been the largest Hispanic group in the United States. In 2024, they totaled 38.9 million (11.5%), a significant increase compared to the 35.9 million counted in 2020,  according to Census data .\n \n\n   \n  Second are Puerto Ricans, with 6.1 million (1.8%); followed by Cubans with 2.9 million (0.9%), Salvadorans with 2.7 million, and Dominicans with 2.5 million as of last year.\n \n\n   \n  Puerto Rico is an unincorporated territory of the United States. For this reason, Puerto Ricans have been U . S .  citizens by birth since 1917, but they  do not have the same rights  as other citizens of the country: They cannot vote in presidential elections and do not have representation in Congress. They are considered part of the Latino community because the U . S .  government  defines this group  as the population that speaks Spanish or descends from Latin Americans or Spaniards.\n \n\n   \n  People with roots in Central and South America have registered a significant increase, with two populations — Colombia and Honduras — that for the first time since 2010 surpassed the one million mark, while the Venezuelan population reported the fastest growth of Hispanic groups, with an increase of 181% from 2010 to 2020, according to the Census.\n \n\n   \n  The Mexican population is the largest Hispanic group in 40 states, but has settled mainly in California, a state that recorded more than 12.2 million Mexicans as of 2020, according to the Census, followed by Texas (9 million) and Arizona (1.8 million). Their presence and reach in the country have been such that in the 1960s the Chicano movement was born with the objective of empowering the U . S .  population of Mexican descent and was focused in the southwestern United States.\n \n\n   \n  Chicano murals, for example, stand out in neighborhoods in California, Texas ,  and Arizona as a window into the labor struggle, social justice, Mexican Independence, migration, historical figures, pre-Hispanic symbols, and daily life. In Sacramento, California, there is one of the oldest Chicano murals in the country called “The Rise of the Chicano Social Struggle in a Bicultural Society.” These works, created by local artists, are a symbol of resistance and pride for the Latino community.\n \n\n   \n    The South of the U.S. is home to the largest number of Latinos\n \n\n   \n  Geographically, California, Texas, and Florida are the  states with the largest Latino populations , but this group has expanded beyond traditional enclaves, settling in areas of the Midwest and the South where the Latino population was historically scarce.\n \n\n   \n  These three states are clear examples of the settlement and expansion of the Latino community. As of 2024, California’s total population was more than 39.4 million people, of which more than 16 million were Latinos (40%) and more than 10 million were immigrants (27%),  according to data  from the Public Policy Institute of California.\n \n\n   \n  In Texas, a state with more than  31.2 million inhabitants , there are 12.6 million Hispanics (40%), surpassing the White population (39.8%), according to Census data. This means that the Latino community is the largest demographic group in the country’s second largest state.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Florida is home to 6.7 million Hispanics (28.7%) among its more than 23.3 million residents. The Latino community is also the second-largest ethnic group in the so-called Sunshine State.\n \n\n   \n    Enduring customs\n \n\n   \n  Rodríguez lives in a Latino community in San Francisco, California, a state where Hispanics of Mexican origin make up more than 12% of the population, which  —  she says  —  reminds her a lot of Mexico. “Here, there are many street vendors on the streets and they sell all kinds of food, especially on weekends, you find everything: There are pupusas, tamales, tacos, anything. It’s not something you see in other places in the United States, but it reminds me a lot of Mexico,” she explains.\n \n\n   \n  Gastronomy is one of the areas where Latinos of Mexican origin have made a strong presence. According to  data from Pew Research Center , one in 10 restaurants in the United States serves Mexican food and 85% of counties nationwide have at least one Mexican restaurant.\n \n\n   \n  Clemente López replied that he feels more connected to the United States, but he prefers the food of Honduras, his country of origin, as well as the music and soccer.\n \n\n   \n  Paola Acosta, originally from Colombia and a resident of Florida, came to the U . S .  15 years ago in search of the so-called American dream. For her, the connection to her country of origin is greater and is reflected in her traditional diet: arepas, sancocho ,  and rice are on her table every day.\n \n\n   \n  And for Marabeth Márquez, the religious traditions of Venezuela are still present in her life in the United States with celebrations such as Christmas Eve on December 24, observing Lent and fasting during Holy Week, in addition to not having adopted holidays like Halloween.\n \n\n   \n  One in every five inhabitants in the United States is Latino (20%), making this group the largest racial minority in the country. Although immigration has historically been a determining factor in this increase, now the births of people of Latino origin have taken first place: just between 2022 and 2023, there were 722,000 births recorded, compared to 437,000 migrants who arrived in the country,  according to official figures. \n \n\n   \n  Gina López is a clear example: She was born in New York but feels more identified with the traditions of Colombia, her parents’ country of origin. She now lives in Florida.\n \n\n   \n    Soccer, a sport that connects roots\n \n\n   \n  Regardless of their flag of origin, Latinos in the United States prefer soccer over other sports because it is an extension of their national identity that connects them to their roots. This sport, favored in Latin America, has expanded and gained popularity in the country.\n \n\n   \n  While in 1997, soccer was tied for last place on the list of favorite sports along with figure skating, by 2023, it had climbed to fourth place, just behind American football, baseball, and basketball,  according to a Gallup poll.  Hispanic television viewers in the U . S .  represented the vast majority of soccer’s audience in 2017, with 68% of viewers that year, according to another  study from Nielsen. \n \n\n   \n  Talking about this sport among the Hispanic population has another important nuance: Latinos who prefer soccer tend to support teams outside the United States. According to a  2024 report  from the marketing and media company For Soccer, 32% of Hispanics consider the U . S .  men’s national soccer team their favorite, while 21% prefer the women’s team. However, among Mexican Americans — the largest Hispanic group in the United States — only 40% have one of these U . S .  teams as their favorite, which means that most of them prefer other teams, from Mexico or other countries.\n \n\n   \n  Soccer has become a cultural meeting point and a common language for many Colombians, Mexicans, Ecuadorians, Salvadorans ,  and Venezuelans, mainly in states such as Florida, California and Texas, according to Latinos who responded to CNN’s questionnaire. An example of this is that the states hosting the most Major League Soccer teams — the US professional soccer league — are California, Texas and Florida, which are also the states with the largest Latino populations.\n \n\n   \n  Paola Acosta, a Florida resident, noted that not only is soccer her favorite sport, but she is also a fan of the Colombian national team, her country of origin. And John Jauregui, who was born in California and traces his origin to Mexico, prefers soccer over other sports.\n \n\n   \n  That said, American football and baseball have also become integral parts of the lives of many Latinos in the United States. According to the NFL, by early 2025 there were  39 million  Latino fans in the U . S . , and according to  Nielsen data , the percentage of Hispanic viewers of the Super Bowl increased from 10% in 2016 to 14% in 2024. Meanwhile, the percentage for the World Series went from 10% in 2016 to 15% in 2023.\n \n\n   \n    Spanish language, important in identity\n \n\n   \n  Latinos still maintain Spanish as a way to communicate at home and with close family and friends, in addition to considering it an important part of their identity and traditions. In fact, the United States is already the  second country with the most Spanish speakers  in the world, according to the report “Spanish: A Living Language 2024,” with just over 57.4 million Spanish speakers, second only to Mexico.\n \n\n   \n  But as the Hispanic population is increasingly made up of individuals born in the U . S . , the proportion of Latinos who speak English fluently is growing. In 2022, 72% of Latinos age 5 or older spoke the language fluently, compared to 59% in 2000,  according to the Pew Research Center. \n \n\n   \n  Additionally, the proportion of Latinos who speak Spanish at home decreased from 78% in 2000 to 68% in 2022, a figure driven mainly by those born in the United States.\n \n\n   \n    Latinos, a driving force in the economy\n \n\n   \n  Hispanics are a key part and engine in the economic development of the United States and will become even more relevant as the rest of the population ages in the coming decades, according to an  analysis by the Latino Donor Collaborative and Arizona State University. \n \n\n   \n  The Latino Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the United States increased from $2.1 trillion in 2015 to $4 trillion in 2023, according to the report, which is equivalent to being the fifth largest economy in the world, behind only the U . S . , China, Germany ,  and Japan, and above the United Kingdom, France ,  and Italy.\n \n\n   \n  “The magic and secret power, the superpower of the Latino community is the ability to be so diverse, to come from different countries in Latin America and from Spain, but at the same time have certain characteristics that also unite us, such as the great entrepreneurial spirit and the way our community continues to contribute to all aspects of life and American society,” said Frankie Miranda, of Hispanic Federation.\n \n\n   \n  Latinos in the United States are much more than a statistic: They are a force that transforms the country, drives its economy, and renews its culture. They are increasingly American, but their identity is strengthened by traditions and pride, and they are key to the future of the nation, a future that is also expressed in Spanish.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/politics/boasberg-contempt-of-court-alien-enemies-act-flights","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"15:09:00-05:00","title":"Judge Boasberg to resume criminal contempt inquiry into Trump officials involved in Alien Enemies Act deportation flights","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"U.S. District Judge James Boasberg is resuming a criminal contempt inquiry into Trump administration officials who allegedly defied his court orders to halt the use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador.

CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:09 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A federal judge said Wednesday that he plans to “promptly” move ahead with an effort to find out which Trump administration officials were responsible for flouting his orders in a high-stakes immigration case – and whether they will face punishment for their actions.\n \n\n   \n  The comments from US District Judge James Boasberg, the chief judge of the federal trial-level court in Washington, DC, come nearly a week after a appeals court cleared the way for him to continue with a criminal contempt inquiry that was put on ice months ago.\n \n\n   \n  ”I am authorized to proceed just as I intended to do in April – seven months ago,” Boasberg said during a hearing Wednesday in the immigration case concerning President Donald Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act to speed up deportations of alleged members of a Venezuelan gang.\n \n\n   \n  “This has been sitting for a long time and I believe that justice requires me to move promptly on this,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Boasberg, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, had ordered the administration in mid-March to turn around planes carrying migrants being deported to a notorious prison in El Salvador under the sweeping 18th Century wartime authority.\n \n\n   \n  Yet the flights continued, and the migrants were held at the prison for several months before being released this summer as part of a prisoner swap with Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  “I certainly intend to find out what happened on that day,” Boasberg said on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n    What Boasberg wants to find out\n \n\n   \n  In a blockbuster decision issued in April, Boasberg said “probable cause exists to find the Government in criminal contempt.” But before he could move forward with finding out who was responsible for defying his orders, the proceedings were put on hold by the DC US Circuit Court of Appeals. That court on Friday paved the way for him to restart his inquiry.\n \n\n   \n  The judge suggested that part of his inquiry could involve declarations from administration officials, or hauling officials into his courtroom to provide testimony under oath. Those hearings, he said, could begin as soon as December 1.\n \n\n   \n  Among those he’s interested in hearing from is an ex-Justice Department lawyer who alleged in a whistleblower complaint earlier this year that a then-top DOJ official told his colleagues in March that the administration  intended to ignore court orders  as part of the government’s aggressive deportation effort.\n \n\n   \n  That complaint, Boasberg said, was just one part of the “significant developments” that have occurred while his contempt proceedings were on hold for much of this year.\n \n\n   \n  Boasberg’s decisions this year in the case  drew the ire of Trump , who earlier this year called for the judge’s impeachment, prompting a rare rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts. The chief said the proper ways to respond to a disagreeable court ruling is to appeal it.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, South Carolina GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham and several other Republican senators are calling for Boasberg to be suspended and impeached after learning that the judge refused to allow the phone carrier Verizon to notify them that their phone records had been subpoenaed in the January 6, 2021, US Capitol riot investigation.\n \n\n   \n  Boasberg has asked the Justice Department and attorneys behind the Alien Enemies Act legal challenge to provide their view on how he should proceed with the contempt inquiry by Monday.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Morgan Rimmer contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/entertainment/family-stone-sequel-thomas-bezucha-diane-keaton","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"14:21:00-05:00","title":"A ‘Family Stone’ sequel is in the works, says writer-director Thomas Bezucha","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Thomas Bezucha, the writer-director of the 2005 holiday hit 'The Family Stone,' is developing a sequel, driven by the emotional impact of actress Diane Keaton’s death at age 79, who played the central character Sybil Stone.

\n  By Christian Edwards, Catherine Nicholls, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:50 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A Russian spy ship has entered British waters and directed lasers at military pilots, Britain’s defense secretary said Wednesday, as he warned that the country was facing a “new era of threat” from hostile actors.\n \n\n   \n  During a speech in London, John Healey said the Yantar spy ship was currently on the edge of British waters, north of Scotland, and that the ship was designed for “gathering intelligence and mapping Britain’s undersea cables.”\n \n\n   \n  He said a Royal Air Force (RAF) Poseidon-8 military plane had been deployed to “track this vessel’s every move” and that its pilots said they were targeted by lasers.\n \n\n   \n  “That Russian action is deeply dangerous,” Healey said. “My message to Russia and to (President Vladimir) Putin is this: ‘We see you, we know what you’re doing, and if the Yantar travels south this week, we are ready.’”\n \n\n   \n  Russia’s embassy in London responded angrily to what it called “the latest provocative statements” from Healey and claimed that the Yantar was an   “oceanographic research vessel” operating in international waters. In a statement, the embassy denied targeting Britain’s underwater communications or undermining its security.\n \n\n   \n  “London’s Russophobic course and the whipping up of militaristic hysteria are contributing to the further degradation of European security, creating the conditions for new dangerous situations,” the embassy said.\n \n\n   \n  The Yantar has entered Britain’s exclusive economic zone, which extends up to 200 nautical miles (about 230 miles) offshore, but the ship has stayed on the edge of the country’s territorial waters, defined as stretching 12 nautical miles (13.8 miles) from the coast, Britain’s PA Media news agency reported.\n \n\n   \n  Healey said Russia’s actions would not deter Britain from supporting Ukraine and that the government would continue to be vigilant – “just as we have been about incursions into NATO airspace, just as we are being now in terms of identifying the Russian spy ship in UK waters and just as we have continued to be in response to sabotage threats that we have seen across many different European countries as well.”\n \n\n   \n  Healey’s extraordinary announcement marked the second time this year that Britain has called out the activities of the Yantar. The government says the ship maps the undersea cables used by Britain and its NATO allies for energy and communications and is part of Russia’s secretive deep-sea research unit known as GUGI. But Healey said this is the first time that Russia has directly aimed lasers at British military aircraft.\n \n\n   \n  “We take it extremely seriously,” he said.   “I’ve changed the navy’s rules of engagement so that we can follow more closely, monitor more closely, the activities of the Yantar when it’s in our wider waters.” The defense secretary stressed that Britain has “military options ready, should the Yantar change course.”\n \n\n   \n  Britain sees Yantar’s latest incursion into waters of the UK’s economic zone as part of a pattern of increasingly reckless Russian  forays  into NATO territory, as Moscow seeks to show Europe that there are costs for backing Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  In recent months,  drones  have repeatedly crossed from Russia into NATO’s airspace, alongside other acts of  sabotage . This week, Polish officials blamed Russia for an explosion on a key  rail track  from Poland to Ukraine, calling it an “unprecedented act of sabotage.” Overnight into Wednesday, NATO once again  scrambled fighter jets  over Poland and Romania after Russian airstrikes struck western Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  “This is a new era of threat,” Healey said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/europe/turkey-suspected-poisoning-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"15:03:00Z","title":"Turkish police investigating after family on holiday dies in suspected poisoning","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A family of four from Hamburg, Germany, died in Istanbul after falling ill following a day of tourism and eating street food.

Turkish police are investigating after a vacationing family of four died of suspected poisoning in Istanbul.\n \n\n   \n  The Böcek family, who were visiting from Hamburg, Germany,   fell ill on November 12 after a day touring one of Istanbul’s main tourist spots and eating street food, according to Turkish state-run news agency Anadolu.\n \n\n   \n  Initially treated for what appeared to be food poisoning, the family was discharged from a hospital but returned later with worsening symptoms.\n \n\n   \n  The two children, Kadir, 6, and Masal, 3, died Thursday, and their mother, Cigdem, 27, died a day later. The father, Servet, 38, remained in critical condition over the weekend and died on Monday, Anadolu reported.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities initially considered food poisoning as the cause of death and swept up street food vendors from Istanbul’s lively Ortaköy area.\n \n\n   \n  But investigators shifted their focus to pesticide poisoning when two more tourists staying at the same hotel as the Böcek family were hospitalized on Saturday.

details how he became a dad and an MLB skipper in the same day \n       \n  By Hannah Keyser, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:16 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  When Blake Butera checked his phone after the birth of his first baby, he had about 600 text messages congratulating him on his new job: fatherhood.\n \n\n   \n  Well, not  just  fatherhood.\n \n\n   \n  The 33-year-old new dad to a daughter was also named the  Washington Nationals ’ new manager, making him the youngest major league manager in over 50 years. That news had broken about two hours before Blair Margaux Butera was born.\n \n\n   \n  “I didn’t respond until we got out of the hospital a couple days later and, with that, it was funny because almost half the messages were like ‘Congrats on the job!’ and then another text message a day later that was like, ‘Oh wait, and you guys had a baby!’” Butera told  CNN Sports .\n \n\n   \n  Actually, to be precise, both baby and job were finalized on the same day.\n \n\n   \n  Before he even agreed to interview for one of the most exclusive jobs in the world, Butera needed to ask his wife: “Is this something we can do right now?”\n \n\n   \n  Butera, the then Tampa Bay Rays’ senior director of player development, had wanted to be a major league manager someday, but he was happy in his role, happy with his organization and about to have his first baby.\n \n\n   \n  His wife, Caroline Margolis, was adamant.\n \n\n   \n  “She’s like, ‘We’ll figure it out, we always do,’” Butera said. “She’s like, ‘This is how the baseball world is. It’s hard to prepare and plan for everything to go exactly how you want it to, or how you expect it to.’”\n \n\n   \n  “I just know it’s something he’s always thought about and dreamt about,” Margolis told CNN Sports. “He was really missing being back on the field.”\n \n\n   \n  In baseball, teams have to grant permission for one of their employees to interview elsewhere. This meant that the Nats’ new general manager, Paul Toboni, needed to speak with the Rays president of baseball operations, Erik Neander, before reaching out to Butera. Neander had told Toboni that Butera was expecting a baby imminently.\n \n\n   \n  “So when Paul reached out, he said, ‘I’m fully aware of what’s going on. I have four kids myself. Before we start this process, I want you to know that your wife and your soon-to-be baby are first and foremost. And if we ever have to cut off communication, I completely understand. I don’t want you to miss the birth of your first child. You need to be there for that, you need to be there for Caroline,’” Butera said.\n \n\n   \n  That, and Toboni’s willingness to come to Raleigh, where Butera and Margolis live, for the interview rather than requiring him to travel in the weeks near the end of her pregnancy, reassured them about the organization’s priorities. They moved forward with the process.\n \n\n   \n  October 26 was the baby’s due date. The next day, a Monday, the Nationals offered Butera the job, kicking off the contract negotiations. On October 29, Butera and Margolis went to the hospital. They discussed the contract and watched the  World Series  game on TV that night.\n \n\n   \n  In the morning, October 30, Toboni called Butera to tell him that ESPN’s Jeff Passan was about to break the news. Soon, everyone would know that he was the next Nats manager. His new boss advised Butera to turn off his phone and focus on his family.\n \n\n   \n  But the TV was still on in the delivery room. The news of Butera’s hiring aired just as his wife was about to deliver their baby.\n \n\n   \n  “You couldn’t even make it up,” he said. “It just feels like a story that’s not real.”\n \n\n   \n  Later, after they’d moved to the recovery room, Butera signed his contract making the hiring official.\n \n\n   \n  “Once we had settled our breath a little bit, I was like, ‘All right, we’re doing this? You’re ready for me to sign the contract?’” Butera said. “Signed the contract together and said, ‘All right, well, we’re now a new family, and we also have kind of a new chapter in our lives.’”\n \n\n   \n  “To the extent that I remember it, that is how I remember it,” Margolis laughed. “I just remember her being in my arms.”\n \n\n   \n  The Nats waited two weeks to introduce their new manager so the equally new parents could have some time to settle in. The news conference was a full family affair. Baby Blair came, along with Margolis and her parents, and the Nats welcomed them with a custom jersey small enough to fit a two-week-old.\n \n\n   \n  That wasn’t even her first merch. The team had a care package waiting at the couple’s home when they got back from the hospital – three gift bags all full of Washington Nationals baby clothes.\n \n\n   \n  “It was strictly for Blair. Like, the only one we care about here is Blair,” Butera said. “I think we’re learning pretty early that Blair is the focus here.”\n \n\n   \n  Blair and Toboni’s four boys were highlighted in  a social media post  by the team as well.\n \n\n   \n  “Sports, and  baseball  in particular, you’re gone so much of the year. I think it’s really hard on families sometimes,” Butera told CNN Sports. “It’s just important to us that we still spend time together as a family in an industry where it’s really hard to.

Mamdani, who has been previously critical of the police and  once supported defunding the department , apologized to officers during his successful mayoral run. Tisch, known as a technocrat, has pushed to roll back criminal justice reforms and expand quality-of-life policing.\n \n\n   \n  “Leading this department is the greatest privilege of my life, and I am proud to continue doing it,” Tisch wrote in a letter to the NYPD that was obtained by CNN. “Now, do the Mayor-elect and I agree on everything? No, we don’t. But in speaking with him, it’s clear that we share broad and crucial priorities: the importance of public safety, the need to continue driving down crime, and the need to maintain stability and order across the department. We also agree that you deserve the city’s respect and support.”\n \n\n   \n  For weeks, it remained unclear whether Tisch, who was appointed to the department by Mayor Eric Adams, would accept to stay in the role after Mamdani publicly committed to keeping her on the job during the last mayoral debate.\n \n\n   \n  It was a final-hour effort by  Mamdani and his campaign  to show how much he was willing to compromise and appeal to city voters who remained skeptical about his campaign, particularly among older and more moderate Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  Tisch abstained from commenting on the race for mayor or Mamdani’s politics during the campaign. Last week, Mamdani and Tisch held a meeting, but it remained unclear if he had secured a commitment.  Gov. Kathy Hochul , one of the chief supporters of retaining Tisch, said she was confident Tisch would stay.\n \n\n   \n  Tisch, heiress to the Loews family fortune, is a career public servant who previously served as commissioner for the sanitation department and the city’s chief technology officer. She is highly regarded in government circles and was appointed to the job following a string of high-profile corruption scandals that rocked the department under Adams’ administration.\n \n\n   \n  In the last year, Tisch has overseen a record drop in the city’s crime rate, a reduction in shootings and homicides, and an effort to remove thousands of illegal guns from city streets.\n \n\n   \n    Joint appearance\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani and Tisch appeared together Wednesday at the Fallen Heroes Memorial in Lower Manhattan. The pair walked around the site while Tisch pointed out the names of officers recently killed in the line of duty. They were joined by a small group of officers who shook hands with Mamdani as he asked about their time in the department.\n \n\n   \n  “I appreciate the moments I just shared with Commissioner Tisch and a number of officers here with us to pay our respects to NYPD officers who lost their lives in the line of duty and to learn a little bit more about the names that some many New Yorkers have come to know, the heroism and the families they left behind,” Mamdani told reporters after the visit.\n \n\n   \n  Tisch declined to answer questions and told reporters she wanted to keep “politics out” of the discussion.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m sure there will be plenty of time to discuss all of that,” Tisch said, praising Mamdani for choosing the police memorial as the site of their first public appearance. “To me it is very meaningful that he asked to come here as our first public venture to visit the memorial.”\n \n\n   \n  As part of his campaign, Mamdani proposed creating a “Department of Community Safety,” which would shift focus away from the NYPD for certain emergency calls like responding to people in mental distress, domestic violence calls or the homeless. Mamdani has said the calls would still rely on police when necessary, but he has described the effort as a move that would allow police to focus on fighting serious crime.\n \n\n   \n  Following his visit, Mamdani suggested Tisch was on board with his proposal.\n \n\n   \n   “It’s untenable for officers to be asked to respond to respond to the 200,000 mental health calls they receive every year, to be tasked with the responsibility to deal with the mental health crisis, the homelessness crisis,” Mamdani said. “The commissioner and I share a belief in the fact that in order for police officers to be able to do their jobs we also need to create a Department of Community Safety to be tasked with those responsibilities.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/sport/curacao-football-world-cup-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"15:25:00-05:00","title":"Curaçao Makes History as Smallest Nation by Population to Qualify for World Cup","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Curaçao, a small autonomous Caribbean territory with about 156,000 people, has made history by becoming the smallest nation by population ever to qualify for the 2026 World Cup, surpassing Iceland's previous record.

Chrissy Houlahan said the “threats to our Constitution” are coming “from right here at home,” and repeatedly urged the military and intelligence community to “refuse illegal orders.”\n \n\n   \n  “No one has to carry out orders that violate the law, or our Constitution,” they said. “Know that we have your back… don’t give up the ship.”\n \n\n   \n  In the video, the lawmakers don’t specify which orders service members have received, or might receive, that could be illegal.\n \n\n   \n  Service members are required to follow only lawful orders in accordance with the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Following an order that might violate the law could open service members up to prosecution, as legal precedent holds that receiving an order alone isn’t a defense, colloquially known as the “Nuremberg defense” as it was deployed by senior members of Adolph Hitler’s leadership team during legal proceedings after World War II.\n \n\n   \n  The video comes as US military officials, including the  commander of US Southern Command , and US allies,  including the UK , have questioned the legality of a series of military strikes targeting suspected drug traffickers in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific. The attacks have killed at least 83 people since September.  The Trump administration is also fighting multiple  court cases  over its use of troops in American cities, raising legal questions about how the military can be used on US soil.\n \n\n   \n  Republican lawmakers quickly pushed back on the video. Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn told Fox on Wednesday, “It is inconceivable that you would have elected officials that are saying to uniformed members of the military who have taken an oath that they would defy the orders that they have been given to execute their mission.”\n \n\n   \n  Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham told Fox on Tuesday that “the senators and congressmen who made a video suggesting our men and women in the military do not have to follow unlawful orders have yet to show us an example. They owe it to our men and women in the military to be specific about orders issued by President Trump or those under his command that they believe to be unlawful.”\n \n\n   \n  The Defense Department is relying on a Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel opinion to legally justify the US military’s strikes against boats allegedly carrying drugs. The OLC opinion includes a list of 24 different cartels and criminal organizations based around Latin America it says the administration is authorized to target, CNN has reported.\n \n\n   \n  But lawmakers who have been briefed by the Pentagon about the operation have said that military officials have  acknowledged  not knowing the individual identities of those they are targeting before killing them. Instead, the officials said they need only establish that those on board the vessels are affiliated with cartels. Lawyers inside the Pentagon have raised legal concerns about the US military strikes, CNN has reported.\n \n\n   \n  Military lawyers have been conspicuously absent from recent congressional briefings on the operation, lawmakers have said. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth fired the top uniformed lawyers for the Army and Air Force earlier this year,  telling reporters afterwards  that he viewed them as potential “roadblocks to orders that are given by a commander in chief.”\n \n\n   \n  To date, key lawmakers have also not received a single briefing from members of the intelligence community on its role in the boat strikes  —despite submitting multiple requests for information and the Trump administration publicly citing intelligence that those killed were known drug traffickers, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  Formal requests, including at least one sent to Trump’s Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, have gone unanswered, the source added, noting lawmakers have received briefings only from officials at the State Department and Department of Defense so far.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/us/uriostegui-rios-deportation-government-lawsuit-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"13:10:00-05:00","title":"Trump administration ‘inadvertently’ deported transgender woman to Mexico despite judge’s concern she may face torture there","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration admitted it 'inadvertently' deported a transgender woman, Britania Uriostegui Rios, to Mexico in November 2025, despite an immigration judge’s finding that she faced a significant risk of torture or violent persecution due to Mexico’s history of extreme violence against transgender people.

 \nUpdated: \n        1:10 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Trump administration admitted it “inadvertently” deported a transgender woman to Mexico this month after a judge ordered she not be removed to the country over fears she may be tortured or violently persecuted.\n \n\n   \n  The government has said it will allow Britania Uriostegui Rios, a Mexican national,   to return to the US if she is able to make it to the border. Once she has returned, she will be placed back in ICE custody while the administration tries to deport her to a different country,   court documents show.\n \n\n   \n  The case marks the latest example of the Trump administration wrongfully removing someone protected by court orders or special status as it works to carry out the president’s goal of a  history-making  mass deportation program. Uriostegui Rios is  at least the fifth  such case this year, including the administration’s  dramatic legal showdown  over the removal – and  eventual return  – of Salvadoran man Kilmar Abrego Garcia.\n \n\n   \n  Uriostegui Rios’s attorneys are suing the administration and demanding that she not be required to return to federal custody once she is back in the US – “if she happens to make it to a port of entry without dying.”\n \n\n   \n  Mexico is one of the deadliest countries in the world for transgender people, according to the  Trans Murder Monitoring Project . Though the full scope of risk to transgender people in Mexico is unclear, journalists and advocacy groups  have documented  pervasive – and  often fatal  – violence.\n \n\n   \n  Since entering the US in 2003, Uriostegui Rios has racked up a lengthy criminal history that includes convictions for disorderly conduct, sexual solicitation and DUI, according to  court filings  from a Department of Homeland Security official.\n \n\n   \n  An immigration judge  ordered her deportation  in March after she was convicted of assault with a deadly weapon in Las Vegas.\n \n\n   \n  But the judge simultaneously blocked the government from removing Uriostegui Rios to her native Mexico, finding there was a likelihood she could face “torture” there.\n \n\n   \n  Even so, Uriostegui Rios was flown from a detention center in Louisiana to Texas on November 11, where her attorneys say she was taken across the border to Mexico without money, her daily medications or a cell phone. She was able to borrow a phone and call her attorneys, who say they were not notified Uriostegui Rios had been deported.\n \n\n   \n  “ICE confirmed that your client was removed to Mexico inadvertently,” Department of Justice attorney Shannon Smitherman  wrote in an email  filed in court. The next day, she wrote, “ICE stands ready to remedy the inadvertent removal by allowing your client to voluntarily reenter the United States if your client wishes to do so.”\n \n\n   \n  DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to CNN that Uriostegui Rios was “removed from the US and will be brought back to the US.” At the same time, the agency will seek another country for deportation.\n \n\n   \n  “The end result will be the same - Rios will not be able to remain in the US and will be removed,” McLaughlin said.\n \n\n   \n  The White House has not responded to a request for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Uriostegui Rios was being detained in a men’s facility in Louisiana while the US government unsuccessfully tried to deport her to Costa Rica, Honduras and Nicaragua, according to court filings. In August, it began an effort to remove her to El Salvador, but the petition is still pending with Salvadoran officials.\n \n\n   \n  It is unclear what fears Uriostegui Rios expressed to the judge, but the  legal definition of torture  is vast and includes state-sanctioned violence, “cruel and inhumane treatment,” and prolonged mental suffering out of fear for one’s life.\n \n\n   \n  When asked what threats Uriostegui Rios faces in Mexico, her attorney Bridget Pranzatelli told CNN she “is a trans woman who has been through extreme trauma, including being sexually trafficked by cartels [at] as young as 12 years old.”\n \n\n   \n  “As a result of these experiences, she has significant mental health issues,” Pranzatelli said. “There are many actors in Mexico who want to hurt her, which is why an immigration judge found it more likely than not that she would be tortured or killed if forced to return.”\n \n\n   \n   ﻿ Since being sent to Mexico, Uriostegui Rios has been shielding her identity while sheltering with family out of fear they will discover she is trans and kick her out, one of her attorneys, Talia Lepson, wrote in  a court filing .\n \n\n   \n  If Uriostegui Rios is able to return to the US, her legal team is asking that she be released from ICE custody and be allowed to go home under a supervision order, saying “the government cannot be trusted to follow the law” or court orders.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/travel/flight-canceled-delayed-what-to-do","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"12:15:00.000Z","title":"What to Do if Your Flight Is Canceled or Delayed","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"This article provides comprehensive guidance for air travelers on how to respond to flight delays and cancellations, especially during the busy holiday season.

EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Air travelers have become all too accustomed to flight delays and cancellations lately.\n \n\n   \n  Air traffic controller shortages caused major issues during the US government shutdown, triggering the Federal Aviation Administration to mandate flight cuts. While those cuts have been lifted, the busy holiday season could spell more disruptions, particularly if bad weather complicates operations.\n \n\n   \n  Keep in mind that in the United States, when an airline cancels your flight, you are entitled to a refund if you choose not to travel.\n \n\n   \n  “If a flight does get canceled, travelers are owed a full refund for the ticket, full stop. If they are presented with a credit, they have the right to refuse and ask for monetary refund,” said Katy Nastro, a spokesperson for travel site Going.com, who was underlining  Department of Transportation rules .\n \n\n   \n  If a big storm or another complication seems poised to disrupt your flights, “look to make alternative travel plans immediately,” said Eric Napoli, chief legal officer at  AirHelp , an air passenger rights company. Competition for seats becomes fierce during the holiday season when flights are more full.\n \n\n   \n  “Travelers should consider looking at flights that are very early in the morning — as these are typically less delayed, too,” Napoli said.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s more on what experts say you should do if your flight is delayed or canceled.\n \n\n   \n    It starts long before you go to the airport\n \n\n   \n  As bad as it is to find out your flight has been delayed for a long time, or worse, canceled, it’s better to find out from the comfort of home or a hotel room.\n \n\n   \n  “Check your flight status before you go the airport. Most of these notifications are not happening at the last minute,” said Scott Keyes, the founder of  Going.com . “Save yourself the drive to the airport.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s important that passengers closely monitor the routes they’re planning to travel, Napoli said.\n \n\n   \n  “We recommend booking refundable tickets or purchasing travel insurance in case of any issues that come up,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Other tips from Keyes and Going.com:\n \n\n   \n    If you’re at the airport already\n \n\n   \n  If you’re at the airport, act with urgency. Quickly head to the airline agents’ desk. “It’s going to make a difference who arrives first. It’s first-come, first-serve. Positioning yourself close to the desk can pay off,” Keyes said.\n \n\n   \n  You should also call up your carrier while you’re waiting, Keyes suggested. It might be faster to get through to a call center.\n \n\n   \n  Other tactics you can try:\n \n\n   \n    Attitude and research matter\n \n\n   \n  How you approach things can make a big difference, whether on the phone or in person.\n \n\n   \n  “Honey attracts more flies than vinegar,” Keyes said. “Look at this from the airline agents’ perspective. … The agent is the one who has the most ability to help you. Asking nicely and sympathetically is far more likely to get what you want than being a jerk about it.”\n \n\n   \n  And when it’s your turn to talk to an agent about new arrangements: “Come prepared to offer your own options already. Doing your own research is absolutely helpful.”\n \n\n   \n  Other considerations:\n \n\n   \n    Help from other airlines\n \n\n   \n  Cooperation between airlines could work in your favor.\n \n\n   \n  “When flights are canceled, many airlines have the option of putting you on another carrier’s flight because they have interline agreements,” Lousson Smith, product operations specialist at Going.com, told CNN Travel.\n \n\n   \n  “This means, for example, if Delta is having service interruptions but American is running a flight to your destination, you may be able to get on that flight.”\n \n\n   \n    Frequent flyer miles\n \n\n   \n  Thanks to changes in frequent flyer programs over the past several years, airlines often still have flights available with miles even when demand is high during a weather event, Julian Kheel, founder and CEO of  Points Path , told CNN Travel.\n \n\n   \n  “You’ll need to be prepared to spend a lot of miles, and you may not get the best value for them,” Kheel said, but the cash savings could be significant.\n \n\n   \n  “Most US airlines now allow you to cancel flights booked with frequent flyer miles without any fee or penalty right up until departure time. That means you can book multiple alternate flights on different airlines using your miles in case one of them ends up delayed or canceled.\n \n\n   \n  “But don’t try to book alternate flights on the same airline, as duplicates can be automatically canceled. And don’t forget to cancel the remaining flights you don’t end up using so you can get your miles back.”\n \n\n   \n    Trapped for the night\n \n\n   \n  What do you do if you’re not going to be able to fly out until the next day and you’re not in your home city?\n \n\n   \n  This depends on the specifics of your situation — in the US, for example, airlines aren’t legally required to put you up in a hotel. US-based airlines have their own individual policies for situations “within the airline’s control” that are tracked by the Department of Transportation,  here .\n \n\n   \n  According to the DOT, “a controllable flight cancellation or delay is essentially a delay or cancellation caused by the airline. Examples include: maintenance or crew problems; cabin cleaning; baggage loading; and fueling.” So weather events — or government shutdowns — typically would not fall into this category.\n \n\n   \n  But requirements in other countries are different. In the United Kingdom, for example, you’ll likely be automatically entitled to  food and drink vouchers and accommodation . You can read  all the details  at the UK’s Civil Aviation Authority (CAA)’s website.\n \n\n   \n  Your canceled flight will be  covered by UK law  if it was supposed to be departing from the UK, no matter who you were flying with.\n \n\n   \n  And if your flight was supposed to be arriving in the UK, you’ll be covered by UK law as long as you were traveling on an EU or UK airline.  This document  from the UK’s Civil Aviation Authority explains all the ins and outs of these rules.\n \n\n   \n  Despite this, sometimes airlines can’t help everyone, and as the CAA says, “this can happen when staff are stretched during major disruptions.” The  CAA advice  is to organize “reasonable care and assistance yourself, then claim the cost back later. If you end up paying for things yourself, keep every receipt and do not spend more than is reasonable.”\n \n\n   \n  Other things to consider:\n \n\n   \n    Refunds in the US\n \n\n   \n  Airlines in the United States are now required to give passengers cash refunds if the airline cancels or significantly delays or changes a flight and the passenger chooses not to travel. See more from the  Department of Transportation here .\n \n\n   \n    Travel insurance and receipts\n \n\n   \n  Travel insurance can be helpful to ensure reimbursement in a wide variety of circumstances. However, it doesn’t help in every situation.\n \n\n   \n  Many travel insurance policies apply to “unforeseen events,” according to Chrissy Valdez, senior director of operations at travel insurance comparison site Squaremouth. But once an event like the shutdown is known, it’s often not covered. Check with your insurer on your policy’s fine print.\n \n\n   \n  Cancel For Any Reason and Interruption For Any Reason coverage offer the highest level of protection for travelers shopping for insurance, she said.\n \n\n   \n  Nastro suggests checking on any protections offered by your credit card before purchasing additional coverage.\n \n\n   \n  Be sure to save all of your receipts in case you need to file a claim with your insurer or your airline.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Marnie Hunter contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/politics/family-members-raise-the-alarm-about-plight-of-american-suffering-from-cancer-jailed-in-iran","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"12:18:00.000+00:00","title":"Iran Imprisons American Man for Visiting Israel 13 Years Ago","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Kamran Hekmati, an Iranian-American Jewish man, was arrested in Iran in 2025 after visiting Israel 13 years earlier for his son’s bar mitzvah, triggering a legal prosecution under Iran’s law banning travel to Israel.

He is now imprisoned in Iran \n       \n  By Jennifer Hansler, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:18 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Kamran Hekmati didn’t have concerns about going to  Iran  earlier this year for what was supposed to be a brief trip.\n \n\n   \n  Hekmati, who is Iranian-American and Jewish, had traveled there numerous times with family, and he isn’t a political person, family members told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  But the 70-year old was arrested and sentenced to prison time by Iranian authorities for visiting Israel 13 years ago for his son’s bar mitzvah, according to family members who spoke to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  They asked not to be identified for fear of retaliation against Hekmati.\n \n\n   \n  Hekmati is suffering from bladder cancer and is currently detained in Tehran’s notorious  Evin Prison . Although an appeal has been filed, his family is seriously concerned about his health.\n \n\n   \n  The United States does not have a diplomatic presence on the ground in Iran, and Switzerland which represents US interests there, has not been allowed access to him, his family said.\n \n\n   \n  Rep. Tom Suozzi, who represents Hekmati’s state, called on the State Department to “urgently work toward the release” of his constituent. The New York Democrat said Hekmati should be released “immediately on humanitarian grounds.”\n \n\n   \n  According to family members, Hekmati was stopped at the airport when he sought to return home to New York in May. Authorities seized his passport and searched his phone and social media accounts. In the subsequent months, Hekmati was blocked from leaving the country and interrogated.\n \n\n   \n  In July, around the time of the so-called “Twelve Day War” between Israel and Iran, Hekmati was arrested, family members said.\n \n\n   \n  He was sentenced, without legal representation, to four years in prison under a law prohibiting Iranian passport holders from traveling to Israel. According to his family, which has since hired a lawyer, the punishment under the law was changed a few weeks later, and his sentence was reduced to two years.\n \n\n   \n  Family members said he had pictures of the trip on his Facebook.\n \n\n   \n  Although Hekmati is a US citizen, Iran does not recognize dual nationality. Tehran has a long history of imprisoning Americans and the US State Department has warned that “anyone with a U.S. connection, including dual U.S.-Iranian nationals, is at significant risk of questioning, arrest, and detention in Iran.”\n \n\n   \n  Asked about Hekmati’s case, a State Department spokesperson said they were unable to comment on individual cases due to “safety and privacy considerations.”\n \n\n   \n  “We continue to engage with allies and partners on this issue and on cases of unjust detention in Iran in general,” they said.\n \n\n   \n  Suozzi, in a letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, described Hekmati as “a respected and active member of our community.”\n \n\n   \n  “This case has deeply alarmed my constituents, particularly within the large Persian Jewish community on Long Island, and among his colleagues in the government of the Village of Great Neck Estates where he serves on the Zoning Board of Appeals,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Family members described him as a loving father, grandfather, and husband.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/business/netherlands-cedes-control-nexperia-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"11:19:00-05:00","title":"The Netherlands takes a big step to defuse its dispute with China that threatened car production","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Netherlands has suspended its controversial order to take control of Chinese-owned chipmaker Nexperia, ending a high-stakes standoff with China that threatened global auto production.

\nUpdated: \n        9:40 AM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  One team walked into Madison Square Garden in its team-issued sweatsuits. The other approached the Champions Classic much like an NBA squad arriving for work, fashioned in their outfits of the day. Otega Oweh sported a designer jacket from Amiri that runs about $1,200.\n \n\n   \n  Which maybe makes sense. Kentucky’s roster checks in at a reported $22 million. Might as well dress the part.\n \n\n   \n  But as college athletics continues its reckoning with big money and  bigger problems , it is perhaps worth remembering the wise words of the Beatles, penned some 60 years ago.  Can’t buy me love. \n \n\n   \n  Or, in Kentucky’s case, it can’t buy defense, offense, wins, continuity, effort and at least for the time being, success.\n \n\n   \n  The Wildcats got pantsed by Michigan State, 83-66. They trailed by as many as 24, and never led past the 14-minute mark of the first half.\n \n\n   \n  The Spartans came into the game shooting 21.7 percent from beyond the arc, and had hit a grand total of 13 treys in their first three games. Upon meeting the matadors from Kentucky, they drained 11 of 21 from long range.\n \n\n   \n  On the flip side, the Wildcats hit just six from deep, and missed 22. Kentucky also got manhandled on the boards (42 to 28) and dished 13 assists, which is the exact same number that Michigan State guard Jeremy Fears, Jr. handed out on his own.\n \n\n   \n  Built on promise and promissory notes, the Wildcats are now 3-2, the three wins coming against teams ranked between 258 and 317 in Ken Pomeroy’s rankings.\n \n\n   \n  After spending 45 minutes in the locker room with his team, Mark Pope emerged for his post-game press conference looking despondent. He waffled between just below-the-surface seething and out-and-out baffled, taking the heat while simultaneously questioning his team’s identity, promising he’d fix whatever ails his squad but also admitting what needed to be fixed would require a ‘long answer.’\n \n\n   \n  At one point, he used the words disappointed, discouraged and discombobulated in one sentence to describe his team. Fabulously alliterative, but not terribly encouraging, if you’re part of the Big Blue Nation.\n \n\n   \n  That this disastrous showing comes exactly one-week after Kentucky got beat up by rival Louisville does not help.\n \n\n   \n  After that equally disappointing, discouraging and discombobulated showing Pope alluded to a mysterious pre-game locker room issue. The way he said it - “I’m not ready to tell the story yet, but at some point, we’ll talk in detail about our pregame experience at Louisville, and it was out of character for us, and that’s young and new,’’ - it did not sound like this was some rival hijinks.\n \n\n   \n  By not specifically identifying the issue - joking later he wanted to plant some Taylor Swift Easter eggs - he opened the door to frantic speculation among a fan base that does not need to be led into the deep end of paranoia where its basketball team is concerned. It happily gets there on its own.\n \n\n   \n  At least now the issue seems clearer. Bad good news, if you will. It would be insulting to say the Wildcats don’t care. Athletes care. But perhaps this crew is currently misguided in what exactly it ought to care about.\n \n\n   \n  Flanked by Oweh and Malachi Moreno, who both looked like someone stole their lunch money (or maybe their NIL money?), Pope was asked how player injuries (point guard Jaland Lowe didn’t play) might be affecting his team’s performance. A Mormon who doesn’t really curse, Pope started, “I’m going to temper my words.’’\n \n\n   \n  He then took a deep long breath. “If you build an organization, your identity isn’t about an individual person; it’s about a collective group.”\n \n\n   \n  It is perhaps unfair to take one team’s misery a handful of weeks into a season and extrapolate it into some sort of moratorium on what does and does not work in college basketball.\n \n\n   \n  But it’s almost impossible to consider what just happened on the Madison Square Garden court and not think big picture. The chasm on the scoreboard was only slightly wider than the way the two programs operate.\n \n\n   \n  Tom Izzo did not spend $22 million on his roster. He didn’t even spend $10 million.\n \n\n   \n  He has a team with players that in this era might be considered endangered species - four-year guys (Carson Cooper and Jaxon Kohler), three-year guys (Coen Carr and Fears), a redshirt (Jesse McCullough) and a four-star top 60 player who averaged 3.1 minutes per game last year and came back anyway (Kur Teng).\n \n\n   \n  Playing for Izzo is no picnic. Teng isn’t the only one who could have bolted, and who no doubt was enticed with promises of cash and playing time.\n \n\n   \n  Instead they stayed, biding their time and finding their minutes along with their purposes. Teng scored 15, Kohler 20. Cooper and Carr both yanked six rebounds and Fears did his assist thing.\n \n\n   \n  More telling, at one point on Tuesday night, during a Division I college basketball game in the year 2025, the entire bench - players, managers, staff - stood up and started clapping and chanting, ‘De-fense, de-fense,’ as if this they were playing in a church-league game.\n \n\n   \n  Comparatively Kentucky’s Collin Chandler hit a three while his team trailed by 19 with two minutes left in the game and did the inject ice into my veins move as he came down the court.\n \n\n   \n  It is only November. Nothing is decided. Kentucky could very well find its groove and Michigan State could once again forget how to shoot. Both coaches know that.\n \n\n   \n  Yet as the two teams exited the building, one left in an existential crisis.\n \n\n   \n  “I feel like the identity that we felt like we carried may have been stripped away, and that’s some reality we’re facing,’’ Pope said.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s an incredibly, incredibly painful process. It’s a terrifying process. If you treat it right, it can be a galvanizing process. And that comes down to the character of your organization. I think the character of our organization is terrific and tested in a big way right. But that’s the beautiful thing about sports. You either get it done or you don’t.”\n \n\n   \n  And then there was Izzo, college basketball’s perpetual Eeyore, basking in something nearing joy and satisfaction. Izzo has not hidden his disdain for either the transfer portal or the transactional nature of college athletics.\n \n\n   \n  And so when he was asked if there’s something about having guys that stick around and stick it out, he too had to temper his remarks. He took a long beat before answering, promising to be careful with his words.\n \n\n   \n  “How about 100 frickin’ percent?” he said. “They’re homegrown and they play for the name on the front of their jersey because they know the name on the front of the jersey.’’\n \n\n   \n  He wasn’t talking about Amiri.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/business/target-stock-economy","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"08:46:00-05:00","title":"Target’s Problems Are Intensifying: Sales Drop, Leadership Change, and a Turnaround Attempt in the Face of Economic Struggles","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Target is facing a severe downturn, with declining sales, shrinking profit guidance, and a loss of customer trust due to inflation and shifting consumer preferences.

But Wednesday’s quarterly financial report showed there’s no quick fix to Target’s challenges.\n \n\n   \n  Target has proven over and over that it is poorly positioned to succeed in this uneven economy, selling the wrong mix of items for an increasingly frugal customer. Target specializes in cheap chic clothing and home decorations, but fewer customers believe they can find the best prices and deals there.\n \n\n   \n  Shoppers, strained by inflation, have shifted their spending to essentials and value items. They’ve switched to Walmart, Amazon, TJ Maxx and other chains instead.\n \n\n   \n  Target’s stock slipped 1% during pre-market trading Wednesday. Shares have tumbled roughly 35% this year.\n \n\n   \n  “Target is really struggling and does not seem to be able to climb out of the hole it has dug itself into,” Neil Saunders, an analyst at GlobalData Retail, said in a note Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  The company has also faced intense customer backlash for its retreat on some diversity initiatives.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, the company  ended some of its DEI programs . The decision  angered supporters of diversity and inclusion policies , who felt blindsided by Target. Customers online protested Target’s decision, and Target acknowledged its move hurt its sales.\n \n\n   \n    Store remodels and OpenAI partnership\n \n\n   \n  In August, Target CEO Brian Cornell announced he was stepping down after 11 years at the retailer.\n \n\n   \n  Some industry analysts believed Target should bring in an outside voice to lead the company, but it opted for an internal candidate. Cornell will be replaced next year by Michael Fiddelke, Target’s current chief operating officer.\n \n\n   \n  Heading into the holiday season, Target said it dropped prices on 3,000 everyday products and foods, and it plans to have double the number of new items in its holiday product assortment than last year.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, the company said it will increase spending by 25%, to $5 billion, next year to remodel stores. Target also announced a partnership with OpenAI to let customers shop on Target in ChatGPT.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re acting with urgency to make the changes and investments to position Target for sustainable and profitable growth,” Fiddelke said on a call with analysts Wednesday.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/sport/basketball-nba-lebron-james-longest-career","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"09:42:00.000Z","title":"LeBron James begins season No. 23, marking longest career in NBA history","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"LeBron James began his 23rd NBA season on November 19, 2025, becoming the player with the longest career in league history, surpassing Vince Carter.

CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:42 AM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As Los Angeles Lakers forward  LeBron James  took to the court at Crypto.com Arena Tuesday night to begin his 23rd season in the NBA, the 40-year-old added yet another record to his illustrious resumé – the longest career in league history.\n \n\n   \n  Prior to Tuesday, James shared the accolade with Vince Carter, who played 22 NBA seasons from 1998 to 2020.\n \n\n   \n  “It was just fun to be out there with the guys, man. It’s been rough mentally for me,” the four-time NBA champion said after the game, “this is the first time I’ve started a basketball season and not played since I’ve started playing basketball, like nine years old, I’ve never missed the beginning of a basketball season.”\n \n\n   \n  Sporting his famed No. 23 jersey, James was on the hardwood for the opening tip against the Utah Jazz.\n \n\n   \n  The public address announcer in the arena announced James’ achievement to a short ovation from the Lakers’ faithful during the first quarter. The future Hall of Famer acknowledged the crowd with a wave.\n \n\n   \n  The Lakers got off to a slow start, trailing by as many as 11 points early on. James was held scoreless in the opening quarter of play as the Jazz led 36-27 after 12 minutes.\n \n\n   \n  James knocked down a three-pointer from the wing early in the second quarter for the first points of his history-making season.\n \n\n   \n  As James heated up, so did the Lakers team. Los Angeles closed the gap in the second quarter and pulled away in the second half, winning comfortably, 140-126.\n \n\n   \n  James finished with a double-double, scoring 11 points and dishing out 12 assists in the game. The 21-time All-Star has now scored in double digits in a mind-boggling 1,293 consecutive games played.\n \n\n   \n  Lakers coach JJ Redick said postgame: “Just thought he played with the right spirit. Very unselfish all night. Was a willing passer, didn’t force it, took his drives and his shots when they were there.\n \n\n   \n  “The defense is going to pay attention to him, particularly when he has the ball in the post, particularly when he’s putting pressure on the rim, and I just thought he made a lot of great decisions tonight. Really good to have him back.”\n \n\n   \n  The 21-time All-Star played 30 minutes in the game, on par with the rest of the LA’s starters as the Lakers eased him back into action. James had been concerned about his stamina ahead of Tuesday’s season debut.\n \n\n   \n  “The pace tested me, but I was happy with the way I was able to go with the guys. As the game went on, my wind got a lot better. Caught my second wind, caught my third wind,” James said. “Rhythm is still coming back, obviously. First game in almost seven months, so everything that happened tonight was to be expected.”\n \n\n   \n  James missed the Lakers’ first 14 games of the 2025-26 campaign due to sciatica – a nerve issue causing pain that originates in the spine and radiates down the back of the leg.\n \n\n   \n  The  NBA’s all-time leading scorer  returned to Lakers’ practice this week after being absent from the team since the opening of training camp in early October due to what head coach JJ Redick said is a nerve irritation in his glute.\n \n\n   \n  Retirement rumors swirled around James over the course of the past year, but in June, the four-time league MVP reportedly picked up his $52.6 million option to return for an eighth season with the Lakers.\n \n\n   \n  Last year, playing in his record-tying 22nd season, James continued to display astounding productivity, averaging 24.4 points, 7.8 rebounds and 8.2 assists while appearing in 70 games.\n \n\n   \n  James had scored a record 42,184 regular-season points and 50,473 with the regular season and playoffs combined ahead of Tuesday night’s debut.\n \n\n   \n  The Akron, Ohio, native entered the NBA to much fanfare as an 18-year-old after being selected No. 1 in the 2003 NBA Draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers. He turns 41 in December.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Jacob Lev contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/politics/tom-steyer-california-governor","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"09:00:00-05:00","title":"Tom Steyer, the billionaire Democratic activist, enters California governor’s race","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tom Steyer, a billionaire Democratic activist and former presidential candidate, has officially entered the California governor’s race to succeed term-limited Governor Gavin Newsom.

Over the next 10 days, changes in the stratosphere will upend weather patterns and set the stage for a cold, snowy December across parts of the Northern Hemisphere.\n \n\n   \n  It will mean a dramatic swing in weather for parts of the US that are currently simmering in record heat just a week before Thanksgiving.\n \n\n   \n  It could also be one of the earliest significant  polar vortex disruptions  recorded since the dawn of the satellite era.\n \n\n   \n  Think of the stratospheric polar vortex   like a wall of wind, corralling the ultra-cold, Arctic air over the North Pole. When it weakens, cold air spills south into places like the Lower 48, Europe and Asia.\n \n\n   \n  Right now, the air in the stratosphere — the layer of the atmosphere above where most weather occurs — is warming quickly and dramatically, in a phenomenon known as a  sudden stratospheric warming event .\n \n\n   \n  But the sudden warming in the far upper atmosphere is going to result in anything but warmth. It is causing the polar vortex winds to weaken, said Amy H. Butler, a meteorologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and they could even reverse.\n \n\n   \n  Scientists are still trying to figure out why these warming events happen, and for good reason: they can trigger the most intense “polar vortex” cold-air outbreaks in the US.\n \n\n   \n  Over the next two weeks, these shifts could start to be felt in North America, Europe and Asia as the polar vortex weakens and tumbles south, like a spinning top that slows and wobbles off course.\n \n\n   \n  One unusual feature of this event is its timing; sudden stratospheric warming events of this magnitude are almost unheard of in November, said meteorologist Judah Cohen, a research scientist at MIT.\n \n\n   \n  It’s still not certain there will be a major winter blast, but scientists are watching for colder than normal conditions to develop in the mid-latitudes — where most of the world’s population resides — over the next month or so. Once the polar vortex is disrupted, it can take a month or more to recover, said Andrea Lopez Lang, a meteorologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n \n\n   \n  What’s most difficult to predict is where the polar vortex will deliver its icy blast, and the temperature outlooks aren’t taking it fully into account, yet.\n \n\n   \n  “We can see more active and shifted storm tracks and increases in cold air outbreaks in regions across the Northern Hemisphere,” she said in an email.\n \n\n   \n  Both Butler and Lopez Lang said having accurate forecasts for polar vortex events can help make 7- to 10-day forecasts better, which can be beneficial for decision-making.\n \n\n   \n  “Even though the stratospheric polar vortex is miles above us, it’s sometimes connected to our weather via invisible puppet strings we describe with atmospheric dynamics and thermodynamics,” Lopez Lang said.\n \n\n   \n  For example, other polar vortex events early in the winter have been followed by colder and snowier Decembers in the US, she said. Polar vortex events like these tend to generate a ridge of warm, high pressure over Alaska, which triggers a dip, or trough, in the jet stream to the east. That trough can usher in colder, snowier weather over the Central states and portions of the Eastern US.    \n \n\n   \n  As impactful as these polar vortex events are, scientists are losing some of their eyes on this layer of the atmosphere, Lopez Lang said.\n \n\n   \n  Satellites are crucial to observing the stratosphere and making predictions about sudden stratospheric warming events,   she said, and some of that data is blinking out as satellites age and  NOAA makes budget and program decisions  that affect the availability of current and future measurements. She cited some  newly missing data from polar-orbiting satellites  as an example.\n \n\n   \n  “The only way that we really observe these phenomena is via satellite data,” she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/travel/antico-caffe-greco-rome-coffee-shop-dispute","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"09:25:00-04:00","title":"Rome’s Oldest Coffee House Shuttered in Bitter Rent Dispute","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Rome’s oldest coffee house, the Antico Caffè Greco, has been forced into closure after a prolonged legal battle over rent.

coffee house was an ornate treasure. A bitter legal dispute has turned it into an empty eyesore \n       \n  By Barbie Latza Nadeau, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:25 AM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  For more than two centuries, the Antico Caffè Greco has been part of the cultural landscape of Rome. Authors and artists, movie stars and princesses — even cowboys — have all made the pilgrimage to Via dei Condotti, at the foot of the Spanish Steps, to soak up the storied atmosphere of the Italian capital’s oldest coffee house.\n \n\n   \n  Last month, that all changed. The café, a favorite for Romans and tourists, shut its doors. Portraits of former clientele — including Wild West sharpshooter Buffalo Bill — were stripped from its walls; plush red velvet chairs, seating booths and bar stools removed; gilded porcelain tableware carried away.\n \n\n   \n  The venue, as popular among Rome’s 19th-century bourgeoisie as it was with the 1960s “La Dolce Vita” in-crowd, became an empty shell.\n \n\n   \n  Antico Caffè Greco’s sudden demise was the result of a long-running rent dispute between its proprietors, Carlo Pellegrini and Flavia Iozzi, and their landlord, the Israelite Hospital of Rome. The hospital is a private institution that also provides healthcare to patients through Italy’s national health service.\n \n\n   \n  It began in September 2017 when an 80-year lease expired and the Israelite Hospital raised the monthly rent from 17,000 euros to 120,000 euros — a leap from about $20,000 to $140,000. The move, it said, was in line with other properties on the street, which is home to stores that include Gucci, Versace and Dior.\n \n\n   \n  High commercial rents have pushed many small businesses out of the center of Rome in recent years, especially since the Covid pandemic when lockdowns fueled the rise of home delivery and online shopping.\n \n\n   \n  “We would be ready to pay more rent to keep the café open but not six times the amount we’re paying now,” Pellegrini said when the Antico lease expired eight years ago. “I feel very angry, but we will fight this.”\n \n\n   \n    Casanova’s café ‘tryst’\n \n\n   \n  That fight was dealt a decisive blow in 2024, when the hospital finally won a court battle to remove the café’s occupants. It’s aim is to reopen the venue with a new tenant.\n \n\n   \n  Until last month, portraits on the walls reflected the café’s past, including the day in 1890 when Buffalo Bill  took his morning coffee  there with some fellow cowboys. It was a favorite haunt of Charles Dickens, Henry James and John Keats in the 19th century. Later, Orson Welles, Audrey Hepburn and Sophia Loren all spent time there.\n \n\n   \n  Notorious 18th-century seducer Giacomo Casanova even mentioned a “tryst” at the café in his memoir. The sofa in the back where it was said to have taken place became popular with lovers over the centuries since.\n \n\n   \n  Despite above-average prices, customers always seemed to think sipping a cappuccino or hot chocolate from the same cups as Pablo Picasso or Princess Diana was worth paying extra.\n \n\n   \n  Pellegrini and Iozzi were formally evicted in October after losing five appeals and retrials.\n \n\n   \n  The café was shuttered with the help of the military police. The locks were changed and the heavy wooden doors closed for the last time. Lawyers for the hospital removed a temporary “closed for vacation” sign that had been taped to the doors since September.\n \n\n   \n  The court stipulated that the hospital must preserve the historical integrity of the property, but departing staff told CNN through their lawyer that they removed the café’s artwork in September, which included portraits, sculptures and memorabilia said to be worth around 8 million euros, fearing damage from a leaking pipe.\n \n\n   \n  Antonio Maria Leozappa, special commissioner for the Israelite Hospital, told CNN the removed works and furnishings have since been seized by authorities and are now being protected by Italy’s Culture Ministry until new tenants can be found. It is unclear whether the hospital will seek backpayment from Pellegrini for an annual 100,000 euros rent shortfall since the legal battle began eight years ago.\n \n\n   \n  “The Israelite Hospital is a public health asset, and the revenue generated by its properties has always been and will always be used by the Israelite Hospital, an institution affiliated with the National Health System, for the sole purpose of improving healthcare,” the hospital said in a  statement  in 2023 after having won one of many court battles.  It said the rent increase was an attempt to improve healthcare “for the benefit of all citizens.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘A tragedy’\n \n\n   \n  Leozappa said the café will open again once work is done in the building. “It is a historic café, it is one of the first in Italy, it dates back to the late 18th century,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Under a new owner, the Antico Caffè Greco will “continue to enjoy a long history, respecting tradition and the established regulations, and the historic character of the place will be preserved,” he added. ”The city, Romans, and tourists will continue to enjoy their coffee at the Antico Caffè Greco for centuries to come.”\n \n\n   \n  Pellegrini isn’t ready to give up the battle just yet. “The matter cannot be closed like this,” his lawyer, Alessandro Ciciarelli, said when the locks were changed.\n \n\n   \n  Whatever happens next, the once-grand space is now an eyesore on one of the most prestigious streets in the city center — one of many empty storefronts, some of which sit vacant for years, that have appeared as a result of soaring commercial and residential prices.\n \n\n   \n  The Antico Caffè Greco’s wooden outdoor terrace now has signs that its empty planters   are not garbage bins.” Curious tourists peer through the windows into the empty space. Inside, the lights are on, but no one is making coffee.\n \n\n   \n  “I came here every day for almost 15 years,” Manuel Capponi, an elderly local who lives at the top of the Spanish Steps, told CNN. “It is a tragedy that it had to close this way, the fights, the anger. But this café — and this city — have weathered worse storms. There will be another café and I’m sure the prices will reflect the higher rent.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/markets/nvidia-us-stock-market","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00+00:00","title":"Nvidia Faces Critical Earnings Test as AI Market Questions Sustainability","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the AI market faces growing skepticism about its sustainability, Nvidia — the dominant force behind AI computing — is set to deliver a critical earnings report on November 19, 2025.

The market is already nervous \n       \n  By John Towfighi, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Growing concerns about an artificial intelligence bubble have, in large part, caused the stock market’s  recent bout of volatility . So the AI industry will face an enormous test when Nvidia, the world’s most valuable company and backbone of the AI boom, reports earnings after the bell on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  The stock market rally —  ﻿ that had been going practically nonstop since April until this month’s blip — largely depends on Nvidia. The chipmaker, which is the gold standard for AI computing power, has propelled the market higher across the past three years.\n \n\n   \n  Investors are now eager to know whether demand for Nvidia’s chips — and its optimism about the future — are continuing to grow or if there are signs of AI fatigue.\n \n\n   \n  Earnings this month from tech company Palantir ( PLTR ), which uses AI for its government contracts, beat Wall Street’s estimates. However, concerns about the stock’s expensive valuation and nerves about a bubble gave investors pause — and fueled a  sell-off in AI stocks  over the past several weeks. Nvidia’s stock ( NVDA ) has fallen more than 8% this month, although it’s still up 37% this year.\n \n\n   \n  “The market for the first time is questioning whether the hype will turn into reality,” Bob Elliott, CIO at asset management firm Unlimited Funds, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Nvidia’s chips power part of practically every major AI venture, meaning investors will scrutinize its earnings as well as chief executive Jensen Huang’s remarks.\n \n\n   \n  “Nvidia takes on even greater weight than normal,” Elliott said. “If it doesn’t confirm high expectations built into the market, then watch out below.”\n \n\n   \n    Market-moving earnings\n \n\n   \n  Every investor should care about Nvidia’s earnings this afternoon: Nvidia accounts for roughly 8% of the S&P 500, which is weighted by market value. That means investors — and those with 401(k)s — are increasingly exposed to the company’s strong gains. Similarly, they are more exposed to a drop in Nvidia’s stock price.\n \n\n   \n  As of Tuesday, Nvidia shares’ gains have accounted for 18% of the S&P 500’s total return this year, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.\n \n\n   \n  Since Nvidia last reported earnings in August, concerns have been rising about  circular financing , with tech companies entwined in a massive web of extraordinarily lucrative deals.\n \n\n   \n  Now nerves are fraying about whether the money being poured into the AI boom will be justified. On top of that, tech stocks have become relatively expensive.\n \n\n   \n  “Nvidia’s earnings on Wednesday are particularly important given the rising skepticism regarding the longevity of the AI cycle and current AI stock valuations,” James Demmert,   CIO at Main Street Research, said in an email. “Anything less than a stellar report and outlook could make stock indexes vulnerable.”\n \n\n   \n  And it’s bigger than just Wall Street. There are concerns that the AI boom — which has helped boost US economic growth this year — is now masking signs of weakness in the economy.\n \n\n   \n  At its market value of $4.4 trillion, Nvidia is currently larger than every country’s economy except the United States, China and Germany.\n \n\n   \n  Nvidia’s fate is interlinked with other big tech companies that depend on its products. A sign of a slowdown in demand could signal that the other tech companies are less confident about the AI buildout. \n \n\n   \n  Some Wall Street analysts are optimistic that Nvidia will continue to deliver impressive earnings. AI chatbots like ChatGPT — and the data centers powering AI — depend on the company’s chips. It’s the foundation of the current AI wave.\n \n\n   \n  “That is why everyone listens to every word that Jensen Huang has to say, because it’s a good gauge of the health of the AI ecosystem,” said Angelo Zino, a tech analyst at CFRA Research.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/middleeast/iran-us-nuclear-talks-intw-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"05:01:00-04:00","title":"Exclusive: Iran open to resuming nuclear talks with the US but won’t shift its conditions, supreme leader’s adviser says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Iran has signaled its willingness to resume nuclear negotiations with the United States, but only on terms that preserve its sovereignty over uranium enrichment for civilian and medical use and under conditions of mutual respect and equal footing.

Tehran’s ballistic missile program, which he said is expanding, will also be off the negotiating table. “It is only the nuclear issue we will discuss with the United States,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration and Iran were in the middle of talks to settle their dispute in June when Israel launched a surprise attack on Iran, eventually drawing in Washington, which carried out strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, the first direct US attack inside Iran.\n \n\n   \n  Almost five months on, the damage to Iran’s nuclear facilities has yet to be assessed, Kharrazi said.\n \n\n   \n  On Sunday, Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister Saeed Khatibzadeh told CNN that despite serious damage to “infrastructure, machineries” and “buildings,” the country’s nuclear program  remained “intact.”  On the same day, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said that no uranium enrichment was taking place “right now” because the country’s facilities had been attacked.\n \n\n   \n  During the Iran-US talks in the summer, Washington had insisted that Iran stop enriching uranium altogether, while Tehran was adamant about continuing domestic enrichment to a purity that cannot be used to build nuclear bombs. Highly enriched uranium is a key component of a nuclear weapon.\n \n\n   \n  Kharrazi said the “degree of enrichment,” not enrichment itself, would be the focus of potential negotiations with the US.\n \n\n   \n  Asked if he is concerned about another military confrontation with the US or Israel, he said: “Everything is possible. But we are ready for that.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN reported in June that Washington had made a proposal for a nuclear deal under which the US would invest in Iran’s civilian nuclear power program and  join a consortium  that would oversee the enrichment of low-level uranium inside Iran for an unspecified amount of time. That potential consortium would be expected to include Middle Eastern nations and the UN’s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\n \n\n   \n  At the time, Iranian officials repeatedly said they are open to the idea of an enrichment consortium but insisted Iran must be able to keep control of its own enrichment capabilities.\n \n\n   \n  Asked by CNN if there is room to reach an understanding with the US on Iran’s nuclear program, including on a potential consortium, Kharrazi said, “I think so.”\n \n\n   \n  “If there would be genuine negotiations between Iran and the United States, there are ways and means (of) how to ensure that Iran can continue its enrichment and at the same time assure the others that it’s not going to look for nuclear weapons.”\n \n\n   \n  Kharrazi also had a message for Trump.\n \n\n   \n  “Start with a positive approach with Iran. If it will be positive, certainly it will be reciprocated. But for that, they (the US) have to refrain from any force against Iran,” he said. “They have tried that and they now understand that it’s not acceptable and it’s not workable.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/style/celebrities-spring-summer-2026-fashion","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"05:08:00-04:00","title":"From the runway to the wild: Celebrities are already stepping out in clothes designers want you to wear next spring","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Spring-Summer 2026 fashion collections, showcased in major fashion capitals from September to October 2025, are witnessing a significant shift in how trends are promoted.

the wild: Celebrities are already stepping out in clothes designers want you to wear next spring \n       \n  By Kati Chitrakorn, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:08 AM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Spring-Summer 2026 collections, shown across the main fashion capitals of New York, London, Milan and Paris during September and October, marked a season of significant change as a number of high-profile designers made their debuts at big brands. While many of those designs are not yet available for general purchase or widespread red-carpet wear, they’ve already been spotted in the wild — worn by an exclusive few.\n \n\n   \n  Getting their clothes on famous individuals is important for brands. “In some cases, it’s because the brands have employed these people as ambassadors, so they’re on payroll,” said Booth Moore, a veteran editor and author of books including “American Runway,” pointing to the actor Greta Lee, who was recently named as a global face for Dior and has attended several high-profile events wearing the brand’s latest designs. “In other cases, it’s people who are highly visible because they have a show or film to promote, like Sarah Paulson who has been wearing Balenciaga. Sometimes, it’s just a one-off, like we’ve seen with Michelle Obama, who is arguably one of the most visible women in the world.”\n \n\n   \n  Only a few years ago, the red carpet was representative of fashion’s production schedule, with celebrities wearing runway looks around the time that the collections arrived in stores. These moments played a key part in motivating shoppers to buy — even if it is a more affordable lipstick or perfume. That pipeline has now shrunk to reflect shorter attention spans: what was shown on the catwalk a mere month ago can now be seen at movie premieres, film festivals, awards ceremonies, talk shows, galas, and other glitzy celebrity events, which seem to be multiplying in abundance.\n \n\n   \n  Some fashion designers, including Dario Vitale of Versace, have sped things up even further by  showing their designs on the red carpet even before they hit the catwalk . “There are a record number of brands trying to change their image at the same time,” said Moore. “They’re in races against each other, and their reliance on Hollywood as a promotional machine has increased so much in recent years, that there’s this kind-of feeding frenzy to reach the right people, and to get to them first.”\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, the competition is now heated among stylists to outdo each other, as they vie for the approval of online commentators and the media’s best-dressed lists. For some, there is kudos in  reviving an archival or vintage design , but for many others, being the first to wear something still translates to access, status, and trend-setting power. And while celebrities have typically worn custom designs to the biggest red carpet events, any occasion now seems to be fair game.\n \n\n   \n  See the latest catwalk looks — and who wore them where — below.\n \n\n   \n    \n \n\n   \n    \n \n\n   \n    \n \n\n   \n    \n \n\n   \n    \n \n\n   \n    \n \n\n   \n    \n \n\n   \n    \n \n\n   \n    \n \n\n   \n    \n \n\n   \n    \n \n\n   \n    \n \n\n   \n    \n \n\n   \n    \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/politics/lame-duck-presidency-trump-epstein-analysis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"06:00:00-05:00","title":"Is Trump a lame duck now?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In early 2025, President Donald Trump faced a significant internal challenge within his own Republican Party as lawmakers, including Rep.

This shift is interpreted as a sign of his declining influence, especially given that Trump will not run in 2028, making him politically unaccountable to voters.

Wolf, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:00 AM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  For the first time in his second term, President Donald Trump was confronted by his fellow Republicans. And he fell in line.\n \n\n   \n  Rather than face a massive defection of Republican votes in the House,  Trump flipped to support a bill  to force the Department of Justice to release non-classified files related to the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  The flip-flop was a long time coming. The House of Representatives stayed out of session for more than a month during the government shutdown, which helped to shield Trump from this vote. After Trump ultimately endorsed the bill he had previously opposed, there was near-unanimity  when the House voted on it Tuesday .\n \n\n   \n  It now appears to be on a glide path to Trump’s desk.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not clear that Trump will appear in the remainder of the files as he did in  emails from Epstein’s estate  released by the House Oversight Committee last week. But it’s definitely clear that Trump has no interest in continuing to talk about Epstein. When a reporter asked Trump in the Oval Office Tuesday why he doesn’t just release the files, he shot back that she was a bad reporter.\n \n\n   \n  “Quiet, piggy,” was how he sternly reacted with a pointed finger to another reporter last week on Air Force One when she asked about the Epstein files.\n \n\n   \n  The argument that seems to have convinced Republicans to break with Trump on releasing the Epstein files and vote was best expressed by Rep. Thomas Massie, the Kentucky Republican who has tangled with the administration on multiple issues.\n \n\n   \n  “The deal for Republicans on this vote is that Trump will protect you if you vote the wrong way,” Massie told CNN’s Manu Raju last week. “In other words, if you vote to cover up for pedophiles, you’ve got cover in a Republican primary. But I would remind my colleagues that this vote is gonna be on your record for longer than Trump is gonna be president.”\n \n\n   \n  Pair that sentiment with Trump’s recent acknowledgment that he will not be on the ballot in 2028, which means he won’t be president in 2029, and you have the makings of a lame-duck presidency.\n \n\n   \n  There are other issues dividing the GOP, as  CNN’s Aaron Blake noted Tuesday.  In addition to the Epstein files, Republicans are grousing about Trump’s foreign focus; his apparent  lack of understanding of the issue of  affordability  and how it relates to his tariff policy; the destruction of the White House East Wing; and the way his family is appearing to enrich itself.\n \n\n   \n  Pretty much all of these issues were on display at Trump’s Oval Office appearance Monday, when he sat next to and defended  Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman .\n \n\n   \n  None of this means that Republican lawmakers are going to turn on Trump en masse in the near future. But it does mean you will hear that term, lame duck, with more frequency.\n \n\n   \n    What is a lame duck?\n \n\n   \n  Believe it or not, “lame duck” is a technical term in US politics. Historians in both the House and Senate track lame-duck terms.\n \n\n   \n  To them, it refers to a politician in the period after their successor has been elected, but before that person is sworn in. The outgoing politician still technically has power, but is no longer really accountable to voters.\n \n\n   \n    Is Trump a lame duck now?\n \n\n   \n  From a technical standpoint, no. US voters will vote twice before Trump leaves office: in midterms next year and the general election to replace him in 2028. His presidency will play a factor in both of those elections. The government will have to be funded each year, and natural disasters and other events will require leadership.\n \n\n   \n  But the term also has a more colloquial meaning that refers to anyone who can’t be reelected. That included Trump starting on Day 1 of his second term. But his superpower in recent years has been his hold over the Republican Party. That power, at least in theory, will fade a smidge every time he asks Republican lawmakers to do something voters will not like.\n \n\n   \n    Lame-duck presidencies can be dangerous times\n \n\n   \n  Just because a president is losing power does not mean there is nothing important going on. The ultimate lame-duck disaster occurred in 1860, after the election of Abraham Lincoln but before he was sworn in. That’s when Southern states started seceding from the union,  starting with South Carolina in December .\n \n\n   \n  George W. Bush ushered in a bailout to the financial system during the Great Recession just before his successor, Barack Obama, was elected.\n \n\n   \n    How have lame ducks changed?\n \n\n   \n  The 20th Amendment to the Constitution was ratified in 1933 in part to shorten the length of lame-duck sessions. Originally, in the pre-modern horse-and-buggy era, unless the president called Congress into session earlier, lawmakers would not convene for a new Congress until  13 months  after Election Day.\n \n\n   \n  There’s a lot more time than that — a little less than 36 months — until the next presidential election.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/europe/denmark-asylum-immigration-system-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"05:32:00-04:00","title":"Denmark’s hardline immigration laws have caught Britain’s eye.

Here’s why \n       \n  By Christian Edwards, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:32 AM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   Denmark’s  biggest exports include  Ozempic , Carlsberg and Lego. But now, European leaders think it has something more valuable to sell: an immigration system tough and effective enough to neuter the hard right and keep mainstream parties in power.\n \n\n   \n  Mette Frederiksen, the Danish prime minister, has achieved what many center-left governments of recent years have found impossible: getting reelected. In an age when incumbents keep getting hammered at the ballot box, many in Europe are looking to the asylum policies of Frederiksen’s Social Democrats – which won elections in 2019, 2022, and, polls show, are on course to win again in 2026 – as a model to imitate.\n \n\n   \n  Britain’s  Labour government  – which has been hounded by the  populist Reform UK party  over its struggle to control  illegal immigration  – has been so impressed by the Danish model that it sent officials to find out how the system works.\n \n\n   \n  Announcing a  radical overhaul  of Britain’s asylum system on Monday, Shabana Mahmood, the home secretary, said while Britain had “held rigidly to the old model, other countries have tightened theirs.” She singled out Denmark as a poster child.\n \n\n   \n  The old model referenced by Mahmood is a creature of Europe’s post-war milieu. The United Nations Refugee Convention of 1951 applied only to Europe and sought to settle wartime refugees – primarily Jews who survived the Holocaust, ethnic Germans expelled from Eastern Europe and dissidents fleeing Soviet regimes. The treaty was expanded in 1967 to apply universally, in part to atone for colonialism.\n \n\n   \n  But the proliferation of conflict and climate disasters – coupled with cheap travel, rising rates of literacy, and the ease of online communication – has put immense strain on the post-war architecture of asylum. At the end of last year, 123 million people worldwide were forcibly displaced according to the UN, up from about 44 million people in 2010. “Our asylum system was not designed to cope with this,” Britain’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer said bluntly Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Britain is now poised to embark on a policy route first charted by Denmark a decade ago. In 2015, Europe received its most requests for asylum in a single year since World War II, as civil wars in  Syria  and Libya helped spur around 1.3 million people to travel to the region, mostly from the Middle East. When Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel famously said “Wir schaffen das (We can do it)!” urging Germans to  welcome in refugees , Denmark took a different approach.\n \n\n   \n  Under Lars Løkke Rasmussen, Frederiksen’s predecessor as prime minister who then led the center-right Venstre party, Denmark aimed to reduce the number of asylum seekers, improve integration, and swiftly deport those who arrived illegally.\n \n\n   \n  Rasmussen, who is now the foreign minister, first made refugee status temporary, not permanent. Before 2015, refugees could stay in Denmark for five years, after which their residence permits would automatically become permanent. Now, residence permits last for only one or two years, and refugees must wait for eight years before they can apply for permanent status. Even then, it is not guaranteed: Refugees must be fluent in Danish and have held a full-time job for several years.\n \n\n   \n  Denmark has also made it harder for refugees to be joined by family members. Both must be aged 24 and above and have passed a Danish language test. The refugee must not have claimed government benefits for the past three years, and they must also put up a financial guarantee.\n \n\n   \n  Michala Clante Bendixen, head of the refugee advisory group Refugees Welcome Denmark, said removing the assumption that refugee status will become permanent has been detrimental to integration.\n \n\n   \n  “Attachment to the labor market, learning the language and understanding the society – these are very important things for successful integration,” Bendixen told CNN. But she feared the tightened requirements had “set the bar too high” for many new arrivals, discouraging some from trying at all – particularly older people with lower levels of education.\n \n\n   \n  “It creates a feeling of hopelessness. I’ve met so many refugees who say, ‘No matter what we do, it’s never good enough. I have done everything they require of me, and still it’s not enough,’” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Denmark has also been criticized for its policy on “ghettos” (now termed “parallel societies”), which allows the state to sell off or demolish housing estates where more than 50% of residents are from “non-Western” backgrounds. Successive Danish governments had worried about poor levels of integration in certain neighborhoods. In 2004, then-Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen warned of areas where “the men are unemployed, the women are isolated, and the families speak only the language of their home country.”\n \n\n   \n  A charitable interpretation of the “ghetto” law, introduced in 2018, is that it supports integration by encouraging people from different backgrounds to live together, not merely side-by-side. But not everyone is convinced. In February, a senior adviser to the EU’s top court said the policy amounts to discrimination based on ethnic origin.\n \n\n   \n  Other laws have also been criticized by human rights groups. Under the so-called “jewelry law,” authorities can seize assets worth over 10,000 Danish Krone (around $1,500) to help cover the cost of asylum support. The measure was only applied 17 times over its first six years, but still has dark historical resonances, with some drawing comparisons to confiscations of valuables by the Nazi regime.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Performative cruelty’\n \n\n   \n  Few dispute that Denmark’s policies have achieved their stated aim. In 2014, Denmark granted refugee status to 6,031 people. By 2019, that figure had dropped to 1,737.\n \n\n   \n  While Denmark grants far more residence permits today than it did 30 years ago, the vast majority of these go to students and workers, not refugees. Of the 99,811 residence permits Denmark granted last year, just 859 went to asylum seekers – less than 1%.\n \n\n   \n  “Denmark in recent decades has shown that it is politically and practically feasible to transition to a system of overall higher migration, and more employment- and education-intensive immigration,” according to a report last month from Bruegel, a Brussels-based economic think tank.\n \n\n   \n  Over time, this has deterred refugees from seeking asylum in Denmark. Britain’s Home Office said Denmark’s policies had reduced asylum claims to a 40-year low and resulted in the removal of 95% of those whose claims are rejected. In 2024, there were four new asylum claims per 10,000 people in Denmark, compared to 16 per 10,000 in Britain, and 20 per 20,000 for the European Union as a whole.\n \n\n   \n  Although the Danish model has won the Social Democrats praise abroad, some are growing disillusioned at home. In local elections Tuesday, Frederiksen’s party lost control of Copenhagen for the first time in more than a century. While much of the discontent is over the capital’s high housing costs, analysts say the party’s hardline stance on immigration has alienated its more progressive urban base.\n \n\n   \n  Whether the Danish model can be imported wholesale by other governments remains to be seen. Britain plans to quadruple the wait for permanent settlement from five years to 20 – much longer than the eight-year wait for refugees in Denmark. A refugee’s status will be reviewed every two-and-a-half years; if their home country is deemed to have become safe during that time, they will be deported. Those seeking asylum could also be stripped of assets including jewelry to cover the costs of their accommodation.\n \n\n   \n  Bendixen warned the new 20-year path to permanent settlement would destroy refugees’ sense of the future and make them “feel like they are second class citizens forever.”\n \n\n   \n  “Integration fails when you give young people the feeling that they don’t belong. That’s where you see gangs and crime and areas where people have their own rules. That’s because they don’t feel like they’re part of society. A rule like this would make (that feeling) much, much stronger,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Many UK Labour Party politicians would agree. Although Starmer, like Frederiksen, insists that a more stringent asylum system is compatible with the progressive values of compassion and tolerance, others say the proposals are needlessly cruel and will not have the desired effect.\n \n\n   \n  “Plans to leave refugees in a state of perpetual uncertainty about where and if they can rebuild their lives are not just performative cruelty, they are counterproductive to integration and the economy,” Stella Creasy, a Labour MP, said Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Alf Dubs, a Labour member of the House of Lords who came to Britain on the Kindertransport in 1939 fleeing the persecution of Jews in Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia, told the BBC that he was “depressed” by Labour’s hardline turn, and called the new measures “a shabby thing.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/business/stimulus-check-trump-tariff-dividend","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-05:00","title":"4 Reasons You Probably Won’t Get a $2,000 Check from Trump Soon (and 1 Scary Reason You Might)","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has promised to deliver $2,000 tariff rebate checks in 2026 to help Americans struggling with rising living costs, but experts and economists argue the plan faces insurmountable challenges.

check from Trump soon (and 1 scary reason you might) \n       \n  Analysis by Matt Egan, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump has promised to deliver $2,000 tariff rebate checks next year, raising hopes of a lifeline for millions of Americans  struggling to make ends meet .\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve taken in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariff money. We’re going to be issuing dividends…probably the middle of next year, a little bit later than that, of thousands of dollars for individuals of moderate income, middle income,”  Trump said  Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Although Trump has suggested  these checks  are essentially a done deal, the reality is there are major, perhaps insurmountable,  obstacles standing in the way .\n \n\n   \n  Experts tell CNN it is improbable the federal government will  send out $2,000 checks  next year – unless it looks like the US economy needs to be rescued from an imminent recession.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s highly unlikely there is some sort of stimulus check sent out next year. I would be pretty shocked,” Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics at the Cato Institute, told CNN in a phone interview.\n \n\n   \n  Bettors on prediction platform Polymarket seem to agree. They  place just an 11% chance  that Trump creates a tariff dividend by March 31.\n \n\n   \n     The math doesn’t math \n \n\n   \n  Perhaps the biggest obstacle is that the numbers don’t add up.\n \n\n   \n  Tariffs are undoubtedly generating gobs of money for the federal government.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s new tariffs are projected to raise $158.4 billion in total revenue in 2025, and another $207.5 billion in 2026, according to  estimates  from the Tax Foundation.\n \n\n   \n  It’s hard to say exactly how much tariff dividend checks will cost because virtually no details have been released.\n \n\n   \n  Still, the Tax Foundation modeled three designs for tariff dividends – and all of them would cost more than the new tariffs are projected to bring in this year.\n \n\n   \n  For instance, if the checks went out only to tax filers and spouses, and had a hard cut off at $100,000 in individual income, they would still cost $279.8 billion, according to the analysis. That’s $121 billion more than projected new tariff revenue this year.\n \n\n   \n  At the high end of the scenarios analyzed, tariff dividends could go out to tax filers and non-filers as well as spouses and dependents. That would cost up to $606.8 billion – or nearly double the combined 2025 and 2026 projected new tariff revenue.\n \n\n   \n  That’s a problem because the Trump administration has already held up tariff revenue as a way to offset the cost of the sweeping tax and spending package Trump signed into law earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  “This is like the magic money tree. You just go to it anytime you need money. Of course, that’s not reality,” said Lincicome.\n \n\n   \n     The votes may not be there \n \n\n   \n  Another major problem is Congress would need to sign off on dividend checks – and it’s far from clear there are the votes for that.\n \n\n   \n  Deficit hawks were already reluctant to back the president’s tax law and this would only magnify budget worries.\n \n\n   \n  “I find it extremely implausible that Republican budget hawks are just going to be okay with blowing another $300 billion to $600 billion,” Lincicome.\n \n\n   \n  After topping $34 trillion for the first time in January 2024, the national debt has continued to mount,  hitting $38 trillion  late last month.\n \n\n   \n     Dividend checks could backfire \n \n\n   \n  There’s no doubt many Americans could use $2,000 checks from Uncle Sam as they struggle to catch up to high prices at the grocery store, on car insurance and elsewhere.\n \n\n   \n  However, some economists warn that stimulus checks could backfire by worsening the affordability crisis.\n \n\n   \n  The problem is that while some people may use the money to pay down debt, others would likely spend it, and that would increase demand. As the last inflation crisis demonstrated, boosting demand without increasing supply drives up prices.\n \n\n   \n  In fact, many Republicans blamed former President Joe Biden’s 2021 stimulus checks for causing the inflation crisis. That could make it difficult for those same lawmakers to support Trump-era stimulus checks.\n \n\n   \n  Academic research has found those  stimulus checks contributed  to the four-decade high in inflation, though they were hardly the only factor. Trillions of dollars in other stimulus, including Trump’s 2020 stimulus checks and the Paycheck Protection Program also contributed.\n \n\n   \n  Even some Trump-friendly economists are highly skeptical.\n \n\n   \n  “Sending out checks to people is a bad way to stimulate the economy,” Stephen Moore, co-founder of Unleash Prosperity and a former Trump economic adviser, told CNN in an email. “If there is tariff revenue, that should be used to cut income taxes across the board. Stimulus checks only stimulate inflation.”\n \n\n   \n  Additionally, redeploying tariff revenue to pay for dividend payments risks sparking a  revolt among the so-called bond vigilantes  that drives up Treasury yields that set a benchmark for a number of loan rates. That in turn would make it even more expensive for small businesses to borrow and homebuyers to get a mortgage.\n \n\n   \n  “What Congress and Trump are trying to do with stimulus, the bond market could take away instantly,” said Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James.\n \n\n   \n  That’s one reason stimulus checks are normally reserved for actual emergencies like the 2008 financial crisis or the 2020 pandemic.\n \n\n   \n     Supreme Court could wipe out tariff revenue \n \n\n   \n  Beyond the budget, political and economic obstacles, there are legal ones, too.\n \n\n   \n  Most Supreme Court justices during oral arguments earlier this month  sounded skeptical  about Trump’s reliance on emergency powers to impose his global tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  The Tax Foundation estimates the tariffs that could get struck down account for about 75% of the new tariff revenue coming in.\n \n\n   \n  “If the Supreme Court says the bulk of the tariffs are illegal, that could throw a wrench in the tariff rebate plan,” said Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation.\n \n\n   \n  For all these reasons, investors and economists on Wall Street are hardly counting on the arrival of $2,000 tariff dividend checks in 2026.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve learned that late night Truth Socials are not a direct line to reality,” said Bob Elliott, CEO and chief investment officer at alternative investment firm Unlimited.\n \n\n   \n     ‘Break-the-glass’ moment? \n \n\n   \n  However, one way Trump’s $2,000 dividend checks could become a reality is if they become a necessity.\n \n\n   \n  If trouble in the job market intensifies and the unemployment rate climbs significantly, then the White House could argue direct payments are necessary to prevent a recession or minimize the damage of one.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s almost like we shouldn’t want stimulus checks to happen,” Mills said, “because it would be an indicator of something wrong. This is a break-the-glass, use in case of emergency tool.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/politics/gop-failed-censure-vote-plaskett-mills","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"13:15:00-05:00","title":"Failed effort to censure Democrat over texts with Epstein sparks recriminations in the GOP","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A failed House censure effort against Democrat Stacey Plaskett for text exchanges with Jeffrey Epstein during a 2019 congressional hearing triggered widespread recriminations within the Republican Party.

Anna Paulina Luna attempted to raise a question on the floor to get Speaker Mike Johnson to explain “why leadership on both sides, both Democrat and Republican, are cutting back end deals to cover up public corruption in the House of Representatives” by both parties.\n \n\n   \n  Her inquiry was rejected for not following proper protocols, but it received support from GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert, who exclaimed “get it girl!” from the House floor. Boebert could be heard in the chamber moments earlier lashing out at members of her own party over the failure of the Plaskett censure push.\n \n\n   \n  Other Republicans, including Tennessee Rep.  Tim Burchett,  took to social media to denounce an alleged back room deal, though none offered any evidence of an agreement between Democrats and Republicans.\n \n\n   \n  Florida Rep. Kat Cammack  said on X  that “a handful of Republicans took a dive on a vote to strip Stacey Plaskett of her position on House intel because of her ties to Epstein. They did it to protect a Republican facing his own ethics issues from a similar vote.”\n \n\n   \n  “This backroom deal sh*t is swampy, wrong and always deserves to be called out,” she wrote.\n \n\n   \n  South Carolina Rep. Nancy Mace also  took to X  to protest what she said was “another backroom deal.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/entertainment/nicki-minaj-speech-nigeria","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"12:36:00.000Z","title":"Nicki Minaj’s diplomatic moment, explained","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Nicki Minaj, leveraging her global cultural platform, delivered a speech at a U.S. diplomatic event in New York to draw attention to the persecution of Christians in Nigeria.

   \n  By Lisa Respers France, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:36 AM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   Nicki Minaj  addressed those gathered for a special event in New York on Tuesday meant to draw attention to what some are saying is the  plight of Christians in Nigeria .\n \n\n   \n  The rapper was introduced by President Donald Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations Mike Waltz and began her remarks by expressing her nervousness and thanking both Waltz and Trump. She then said it was “an honor” to be present “to shine a spotlight on the deadly threats faced by thousands of Christians in Nigeria.”\n \n\n   \n  “I stand here as a proud New Yorker with a deep sense of gratitude that we live in a country where we can freely and safely worship God regardless of one’s creed, background, or politics,” she said. “No group should ever be persecuted for practicing their religion, like I recently stated on social media. And we don’t have to share the same beliefs in order for us to respect each other.”\n \n\n   \n  The US president  recently sparked alarm in Nigeria  after he said he was considering military action there and would cease aid over what he claimed was the Nigerian government’s failure to protect Christians from a  “mass slaughter” by Islamist insurgents in the African nation.\n \n\n   \n  Experts have said the situation is  more nuanced than presented by the US president , with both Christians and Muslims being victims of violence by Islamic extremists.\n \n\n   \n  The Nigerian government also rejected Trump’s comments. “We are shocked that President Trump is mulling an invasion of our country,” Nigerian presidential spokesperson Bayo Onanuga told CNN after the US president instructed the Pentagon to prepare for possible military action.\n \n\n   \n  Calling Nigeria “a beautiful nation with deep faith traditions,” Minaj noted in her address on Tuesday that some of her devoted fanbase, known as the Barbz, live there.\n \n\n   \n  “I am joined here today by peace builders, by faith leaders, by those who saw violence, saw intolerance, saw the threats clearly before us and chose not to look the other way,” Minaj said. “I am inspired by their work to build interfaith ties, to see the humanity across the lines which might divide us and to vie and to fight for security and liberty for all those who pray.”\n \n\n   \n  Waltz shared how Minaj’s invitation to speak at the US mission in New York came about in an interview on Fox News on Tuesday morning, saying she was asked to speak after expressing support of a Truth Social post from Trump in connection with the Nigeria issue. “To our astonishment, she accepted,” Waltz said. “She is reaching a whole other swath of people who may not follow these issues, and it’s going to be a great day.”\n \n\n   \n  Waltz  wrote earlier this week  that the rapper “is not only arguably the greatest female recording artist, but also a principled individual who refuses to remain silent in the face of injustice.”\n \n\n   \n  “I’m grateful she’s leveraging her massive platform to spotlight the atrocities against Christians in Nigeria, and I look forward to standing with her as we discuss the steps the President and his administration are taking to end the persecution of our Christian brothers and sisters,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Minaj  posted about her gratitude  for the invitation on X.\n \n\n   \n  “Ambassador, I am so grateful to be entrusted with an opportunity of this magnitude,” she wrote. “I do not take it for granted. It means more than you know.”\n \n\n   \n  She also referenced her fanbase.\n \n\n   \n  “The Barbz & I will never stand down in the face of injustice,” Minaj wrote. “We’ve been given our influence by God. There must be a bigger purpose.”\n \n\n   \n  Minaj, who recently made headlines because of an explosive online beef with fellow rapper Cardi B, has offered her admiration for Trump before.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, she  shared a screenshot on X  of Trump’s Truth Social post about Nigeria and his plans to act, writing, “Reading this gave me a deep sense of gratitude.”\n \n\n   \n  “We live in a country where we can freely worship God,” she wrote. “No group should ever face persecution for practicing their faith. We don’t have to share the same beliefs to respect one another.”\n \n\n   \n  The White House TikTok account this month joined the viral “Beez In The Trap x What’s Up?” remix, which combines the 1992 4 Non Blondes hit “What’s Up?” with Minaj’s 2012 “Beez In The Trap.”\n \n\n   \n   The White House video  featured scenes of Trump and first lady Melania Trump along with the remix.\n \n\n   \n  Minaj responded in the comments on the video by thanking the Trumps and saying, “This is pretty incredible.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/politics/epstein-files-ro-khanna","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Ro Khanna explains how he helped engineer the vote that ‘ripped MAGA apart’","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ro Khanna, a progressive Democratic Congressman from Silicon Valley, played a pivotal role in engineering a 427-1 House vote to release the Jeffrey Epstein files, a move widely seen as a significant defeat for President Donald Trump’s second term.

That’s a margin typically reserved for proclamations and post office namings, not for what was  perhaps the biggest defeat  of President Donald Trump’s second term, a fight that GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene declared on Tuesday had “ripped MAGA apart.”\n \n\n   \n  A group of Epstein’s survivors, sitting together in one section of the House gallery, applauded. Democrats applauded. Some Republicans applauded. No one seemed to say much to Rep. Ro Khanna as he stood in the center of the floor, toward the front, chitchatting with colleagues. When Illinois Rep. Joshua Jackson patted Khanna on the back a moment later, it wasn’t clear if he was acknowledging Khanna’s work or just trying to squeeze by to get to someone on the other side.\n \n\n   \n  That morning, Khanna had noticed that Greene and Rep. Thomas Massie, his Republican co-sponsor on  the discharge petition leading to Tuesday’s vote , were trending on X and he wasn’t. He is trying to be fine with that, as playing down the Democratic role to woo Republican support was always part of the plan. He offered a “Schoolhouse Rock”-like optimism about legislating, saying, “It feels like you can make a difference in Congress.”\n \n\n   \n  But Khanna doesn’t hide his belief that Tuesday’s triumph proves he should be taken seriously as a party leader and maybe even for the long-shot 2028 presidential run he is always happy to talk about. He argues the vote vindicates the value of his long relationships with Republicans – he and Massie connected years ago working on  legislation to halt US military support to Saudi Arabia  for its war in Yemen – and his willingness to talk to almost any party.\n \n\n   \n  “I make no secret about wanting to be part of shaping the national future of the Democratic Party of this country. I make no secret about the fact that I believe I have the best economic vision for this nation,” he said in an interview with CNN before the vote, ticking through his emphasis on forgotten communities abandoned by billionaires he says have rigged the system.\n \n\n   \n  “The knock on me from some — I mean, there are many knocks on me — but one of the knocks on me has always been: ‘Okay, Ro, you can write books on this, you can write op-eds on this, but can you really, brass tacks, get things done?’ And it’s easier if you’re a mayor or a governor or a Cabinet member to show you can get things done. And what this is showing is, you know what? On one of the biggest things, which is getting MAGA on board, it’s not just ideas. I’m able to get things done.”\n \n\n   \n  Others are willing to give him credit too.\n \n\n   \n  “It took him on his side and me on my side, and our working relationship before this, to be able to do this,” Massie said after finishing thanking the survivors at their press conference outside the Capitol on Tuesday morning. “Our chance of success was about 4 percent at the beginning, and we’re going to succeed. So I am a little bit surprised. I’m used to fighting battles and not winning.”\n \n\n   \n  “I think Ro Khanna is a brilliant human being. I think he stands for justice. He’s on the right side of history,” said Haley Robson, an Epstein survivor helping organize the trembling “sister survivors” who tend to arrive holding up pictures of themselves when they first met Epstein, speaking to CNN after the vote. “If it wasn’t for Massie, Marjorie Taylor Greene and Ro Khanna, I don’t think any of this would have been possible. They are just incredible people who genuinely care.”\n \n\n   \n    How he strategized\n \n\n   \n  Khanna, a 47-year-old who represents Silicon Valley, has gotten used to often getting a better reception as the token Democrat on right-wing media than he does from some of his colleagues. This time, he’d like a little more credit for being ahead of the curve.\n \n\n   \n  “In the beginning,” he told CNN, “I’m not going to say who, but some of the folks in our own party were like, eyerolls, ‘There goes Ro on one of his issues…’ ‘Why aren’t we talking about the price of eggs?’ ‘Why aren’t we talking about the price of health care?’ ‘What’s up with this?’ And I said, ‘No, there is something legitimate here.’”\n \n\n   \n  That included building a relationship with Greene, whom he said he barely knew before – but had never blasted on Twitter like so many of his colleagues – and now texts with. Or carefully maneuvering how to get Colorado Rep. Lauren Boebert in September to sign the discharge petition that forced the vote. Massie relayed that she’d do it if she didn’t have to wait in line, so Khanna pulled the paper away from a Democratic colleague on the House floor and let her walk over and do it.\n \n\n   \n  To report about Khanna is to inspire exasperation from political journalists and operatives who’ve rued for years how many stories the congressman always manages to put himself into as the hinge point.\n \n\n   \n  But it’s also to hear from a person who speaks to Barack Obama often that the former president keeps an eye on Khanna as an administration alumnus (Khanna was a deputy assistant commerce secretary in the first term, before launching a primary against an incumbent whom Obama endorsed). Without overstating it, the person said, Obama “appreciates that Ro is willing to show up across all varieties of platforms.”\n \n\n   \n  That gives Khanna a phone full of contacts to promote himself and his ideas, from MAGA podcaster Steve Bannon to forever never-Trumper Bill Kristol to  Larry Summers, the former treasury secretary and Harvard president whom Khanna is now disgusted to think he was on the phone with arguing about economic policy just weeks ago. The batch of Epstein estate emails  released last week revealed Summers had been asking Epstein for advice  on how to sleep with a mentee of his until just before Epstein’s final arrest.\n \n\n   \n  “If there was no media attention to this,” Khanna said, “this thing would never have gotten a vote. So the idea of politicians being ambitious to raise issues they care about to the American public is a good thing, if the ambition is for a good public purpose. This idea that we should not be savvy about getting our message out in the media is setting us up for being ineffective.”\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, who voted for and touted the win, didn’t respond when asked what the Democratic leader made of Khanna’s pushing the bill through.\n \n\n   \n  Rep. Don Bacon, the retiring Nebraska Republican who’s become friendly with Khanna through their subcommittee work, argued Republicans always wanted to release the files, despite Speaker Mike Johnson in a floor speech on Tuesday calling the vote a distraction from “urgent legislative work.”\n \n\n   \n  “It could have been anybody” leading the charge, Bacon said. Then he reconsidered.\n \n\n   \n  “He was smart enough to get on it,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    Anger and regrets\n \n\n   \n  At first, Khanna says, he took up the Epstein files cause because it was another way of sticking it to the elite class, the ones he travels the country talking about under his “economic patriotism” umbrella for shipping out their jobs and selling out their communities. But he was changed by what he calls the “emotionally horrific” meetings with survivors who started to come through his office — the guilt of having recruited friends, the trauma of being coerced, the women breaking down about how they’ve blocked memories of their own rapes and wanting the records of what happened so they can at least reclaim their own experiences.\n \n\n   \n  He should have listened sooner, he said Tuesday. He shouldn’t have let it slide when he says he brought up releasing the Epstein files with former Rep. Elijah Cummings, the Democrat and House Oversight chair who died in 2019. He shouldn’t have waited until Trump’s backing off his promise to release them got him going in the spring.\n \n\n   \n  “Had I met the survivors in 2019 or 2020,” Khanna told CNN. “I would have been more vocal in the Biden administration. I think it is a fair point that all of us should have been more vocal earlier.”\n \n\n   \n  Khanna’s father taught him to be stoic, he said, so tears don’t tend to flow, but the anger does. This was insidious, he felt, “a rottenness in our civilization that allowed this to happen — like, how are we allowing these people to get away with this stuff?” he said.\n \n\n   \n  This wasn’t about billionaires rigging the system, Khanna started to say. Men so rich and powerful and interconnected that they had means and the gall for a “rape island” and then to try to intimidate away any consequences represented something more: This, he argues, was about “the Epstein class.”\n \n\n   \n    A ‘proof of concept’\n \n\n   \n  Khanna doesn’t know if he’ll be invited to the bill signing Trump is now promising. He hasn’t talked to the president since January 6, 2021, not that their relationship was ever much more than hellos at first-term bill signings and one chat in the Oval Office about a new term-limits law. He thinks Trump won’t be able to wiggle out of his promise, or of complying, and believes there are too many survivors’ lawyers and former Justice officials who’ve seen the files to know if they get selectively scrubbed.\n \n\n   \n  Khanna is already talking to Greene about joining together to try to ban private equity firms from buying up single-family homes. He wonders if he can get a few Republicans to extend Medicare to people starting at 55, even though he still favors Sen. Bernie Sanders’ Medicare for All. Cutting defense budgets seems to have some crossover appeal. Maybe they can come up with a billionaire’s tax that they’ll say is all about taking on the Epstein class.\n \n\n   \n  “My point is, if your goal is just, ‘How do Democrats win,’ maybe anti-Trump is enough for a moment. If your goal is, ‘How do we build an enduring majority, which is what progressive Democrats like me want to do?’ This is absolutely essential,” Khanna said. “This is a proof of concept that we need to actually figure out how we bring disaffected MAGA voters into our coalition, that we need to focus much more on railing against a system that has screwed Americans and offering a hopeful message about how we help them, more than just meme-ing against Donald Trump.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/us/chkhikvishvili-neo-nazi-nyc-guilty-plea-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"04:10:00-05:00","title":"Neo-Nazi leader behind plot to give poisoned candy to Jewish kids in NYC pleads guilty","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Michail Chkhikvishvili, a 22-year-old neo-Nazi from Georgia known as 'Commander Butcher,' has pleaded guilty in Brooklyn to soliciting hate crimes and distributing information about making bombs and ricin.

trying to recruit others to commit violent attacks against Jews and racial minorities, including  one plot that would have involved dressing as Santa Claus  to hand out poisoned candy to children.\n \n\n   \n  Federal prosecutors said they would seek a sentence of up to 18 years for Michail Chkhikvishvili, a 22-year-old from the Republic of Georgia who goes by the nickname “Commander Butcher.” He  pleaded guilty Monday  before a federal judge in Brooklyn to soliciting hate crimes and distributing information about making bombs and ricin.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors described Chkhikvishvili as the leader of the Maniac Murder Cult, an international extremist group that adheres to an ideology that promotes violence intended to trigger a racial and religious war.\n \n\n   \n  They said the group’s violent solicitations — promoted through Telegram channels and outlined a manifesto called the “Hater’s Handbook” — appear to have inspired multiple real-life killings, including a school shooting in Nashville, Tennessee, earlier this year that left a 16-year-old student dead.\n \n\n   \n  Chkhikvishvili was arrested in July 2024 in Moldova. He was extradited to the United States in May.\n \n\n   \n  Since 2022, Chkhikvishvili has traveled on multiple occasions to Brooklyn, where he bragged about beating up an elderly Jewish man and instructed others, primarily through text messages, to commit violent acts on behalf of the Maniac Murder Cult, according to prosecutors.\n \n\n   \n  When he was approached by an undercover FBI agent in 2023, Chkhikvishvili recruited the official to various schemes, including one that would have involved dressing up as Santa Claus to give poisoned candy to racial minorities, according to prosecutors.\n \n\n   \n  The plot later evolved into poisoning children at Jewish schools in Brooklyn, prosecutors said.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors said in a court filing that when Chkhikvishvili described his desire to carry out a mass casualty attack in the United States, he said he saw the country as having “big potential” because of easy access to firearms. They also said he suggested targeting homeless people because the government wouldn’t care “even if they die.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/politics/trump-epstein-files-release-house-senate-analysis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"12:00:00-05:00","title":"A Washington Humiliation Leaves Trump More Politically Exposed on Epstein Than Ever Before","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A bipartisan surge in the U.S. Congress led to the swift passage of a bill requiring the Department of Justice to release documents related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, with only one vote against.

Washington humiliation leaves Trump more politically exposed on Epstein than ever before \n       \n  Analysis by Stephen Collinson, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:00 AM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  To paraphrase a perennial Washington question: What is the president going to release and when is he going to release it?\n \n\n   \n  Donald Trump is reeling from a spectacular defeat, easily his worst from his own party on Capitol Hill during two turbulent presidencies, after every step he took to stall and deflect  the Jeffrey Epstein saga  blew up in his face.\n \n\n   \n  No one would have believed as recently as this past weekend that a bill requiring the Justice Department to release files related to the convicted sex offender would  race through the GOP Congress  with only  one vote against it  by Tuesday evening.\n \n\n   \n  But such can be the power of suddenly unleashed political justice.\n \n\n   \n  Now, Trump and his Attorney General Pam Bondi, who both triggered the political uproar by pledging to open the Epstein files, only to then refuse to do so, are back where they started. Only in a much more vulnerable political position.\n \n\n   \n  And they have unappetizing political choices at a moment when Trump’s presidency appears damaged,  his popularity is falling  and a crush of other intractable issues bogs down his White House. Speculation is growing about whether a president who many were recently warning was a dictator is close to becoming a lame duck.\n \n\n   \n    Vindication for victims\n \n\n   \n  The overwhelming House and Senate moves to release the Epstein files are a stunning triumph for Epstein’s victims after they became more visible earlier this summer. A president who believes he enjoys unfettered power and who disdains democracy was defeated by grassroots political campaigning in combination with a handful of courageous lawmakers from both parties.\n \n\n   \n  But Haley Robson, a survivor of Epstein’s abuse,  told CNN’s Erin Burnett  that Tuesday’s moves were not the end for women who long ago lost trust the government would protect them. “We have to be very honest with ourselves. … We do have a long road in front of us,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  But the pressure of the survivors’ campaign now threatens to bear down on Trump alone, after the House and the Senate moved with extraordinary speed to dump a radioactive political issue on the White House. Their pace might at least momentarily weigh on the mind of a president who was twice saved from conviction in an impeachment trial by pliant Republican senators.\n \n\n   \n  In one of the most startling developments, House Speaker Mike Johnson, who’d long opposed the bill before Trump’s reversal, insisted the Senate must make changes to the bill. But senators ignored him and passed it up to the White House in an instant.\n \n\n   \n  Unless Trump and Bondi release the Epstein files immediately, the question that’s been haunting Trump for months will now become even more acute: What is he hiding?\n \n\n   \n  A bid by the DOJ to play for time — perhaps by arguing documents cannot be released because of ongoing investigations — might obstruct the hopes of survivors. But it might also mean Trump never escapes a storm that, judging by his  eruptions at reporters , is driving him to distraction. Another DOJ strategy could be to release countless pages of Epstein files but with details, names and other information blacked out to avoid incriminating people. But that would only prolong the controversy.\n \n\n   \n  There’s been no evidence of criminal wrongdoing by Trump in relation to his former friendship with Epstein, who killed himself in prison in 2019. Trump again branded the drama a Democratic “hoax” on Tuesday. But  multiple mentions of the president  in emails sent by Epstein recently released by Congress raise the possibility that he’s also referenced in documents held by the DOJ.\n \n\n   \n  One option for Bondi could be a vast document dump that casts suspicion on multiple prominent men who victims say maintained ties to Epstein in the hope that any minor mentions of Trump might be swept away in a deluge of scandal. But as president, he’s under the harshest spotlight and would be sure to attract the most interest, even though he has said he always knew Epstein was a creep.\n \n\n   \n  Of course, Trump has turned his DOJ into an arm of his political movement. So it would not be a surprise to see partial disclosures that do not satisfy his critics. But such is the intrigue around the drama, that there is no guarantee people would believe that he’d released everything. And conspiracists who’ve obsessed about the Epstein issue will never be satisfied.\n \n\n   \n  “The next question is, will Trump use some other maneuvers in an effort to deny the information to the public that’s required by the statute?” Vermont Democratic Sen. Peter Welch said Tuesday. “We’ll see, but I don’t trust Trump on that.”\n \n\n   \n  Kentucky Republican Rep. Thomas Massie, who broke with Trump to force through the bill demanding the release of the Epstein files, warned after the vote that he would act if there was an attempt to thwart disclosure of the Epstein evidence. As a last resort, he said, he might read aloud the names of alleged associates of the accused sex trafficker in the House. But he added that was only “if we hit all of the walls — but so far, we’re making it through the walls and over the walls, and we’re getting this done.”\n \n\n   \n    What wider damage has Trump sustained?\n \n\n   \n  Beyond the difficulty of next steps for Trump, there are the questions of how much political damage he’s suffered in recent days, both within his own party and personal power base and in the country more broadly.\n \n\n   \n  Ever since returning to the White House, Trump has wielded massive power through dominance, or at least the perception that he’s all-powerful. He never followed his party; it followed him. But the myth of total power was shattered on Sunday night when he reversed his adamant position that the House should block the attempt to release the Epstein files.\n \n\n   \n  The flip-flop was an attempt to defuse a looming political loss. But if his myth of omnipotence frays, it’s likely only to encourage further challenges to his authority. Of course, Trump’s instinct might be to lash out with constitutionally questionable conduct.\n \n\n   \n  This is an unusual moment for Trump. Could it presage a new phase of his presidency where the GOP does not move in lockstep on his orders? Or is the Epstein issue — which, at least to begin with, was disproportionately important to the conservative base — a one-off?\n \n\n   \n  One test might come soon for Trump over whether GOP lawmakers revolt over another matter: the expiration of enhanced Obamacare subsidies, which triggered the government shutdown. Some GOP lawmakers want to compromise with Democrats on the issue, but  the president reiterated  on Tuesday that he opposed any solution that sends more money to insurance firms.\n \n\n   \n  The US political calendar is relentless. And following larger-than-expected victories by Democrats in governor’s races in Virginia and New Jersey this month, Republicans are wary about midterm elections next year. And onetime Trump ally  Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s  recent attacks on Trump’s globetrotting and lack of empathy over high prices suggest that frustration with him  cuts deeper than Epstein alone .\n \n\n   \n  Yet Trump is a survivor, and not just of two assassination attempts. He pulled off the greatest political comeback in history in 2024 despite a criminal conviction and after leaving power in disgrace in 2021 after refusing to accept the results of an election. No modern president has ever had such an unshakable connection with his base.\n \n\n   \n  Still, Trump’s most potent political strategy has been to claim he’s been persecuted. That’s not an approach that seems likely to work as he’s faced with victims of Epstein offering their testimony in public.\n \n\n   \n    Trump’s rough patch\n \n\n   \n  Stunning developments on the Epstein files are not happening in isolation. It’s been a terrible few weeks for Trump. His polling numbers have slumped, especially over his handling of the economy. In another potential blow to his aura of invincibility, a federal judge this week  raised grave questions  about the viability of the DOJ’s prosecution of one of his enemies, former FBI Director James Comey.\n \n\n   \n  The Supreme Court recently  seemed skeptical  about Trump’s tariff policy ahead of a seismic pending ruling on presidential authority. And a federal court on Tuesday  blocked Texas  from using new congressional maps drawn at the president’s behest to aid the GOP’s bid to hold on to its House majority in next year’s elections. (Texas plans to appeal to the US Supreme Court.)\n \n\n   \n  This leaves Trump needing a political rebound — a tough ask for a White House organized on the principle of the president’s infallibility and for a commander in chief who will be 80 on his next birthday.\n \n\n   \n  It’s possible Trump no longer controls his own political fate. Presidents often get overtaken by events in second terms — most recently George W. Bush, whose political capital was consumed by the Iraq war and Hurricane Katrina.\n \n\n   \n  And the symbolic might of Epstein’s long-overlooked victims has the look of a political force with unstoppable momentum.\n \n\n   \n  Epstein’s death deprived many of his victims of justice.\n \n\n   \n  But on Tuesday, Jess Michaels, an Epstein survivor, spoke about watching House members add their votes to a 427-1 victory that she told CNN’s Jake Tapper represented a commitment not to “stay silent about powerful predators.”\n \n\n   \n  There’s no evidence of criminal conduct by Trump. But his handling of the Epstein crisis now threatens to consume his presidency.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/us/texas-judge-blocks-ten-commandments-law","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"20:40:00-05:00","title":"Texas Judge Temporarily Blocks Law Requiring Ten Commandments in Schools","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal judge in Texas, Orlando L.

Cardona, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:00 AM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  It’s a bird! It’s a plane! It’s…not Superman?\n \n\n   \n  No, it’s Super Mustache, Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro’s cartoon alter-ego, here to save the South American country from peril. \n \n\n   \n  “ Super Mustache ,” which has aired on Venezuelan state TV since 2021, is just one piece of the country’s propaganda push as  US warships amass  near the Venezuelan coast and US President Donald Trump  muses  about sending troops to depose Maduro.\n \n\n   \n  In  a September episode  of “Super Mustache,” aired shortly after Trump began his campaign of airstrikes on alleged drug boats off the Venezuelan coast, the cartoon superhero doffed his usual costume in favor of a military uniform, wielding a  sheathed sword  and declaring that Venezuela doesn’t have a “warmongering culture.”\n \n\n   \n  Yet despite Super Mustache’s new look, the Venezuelan government has sent mixed messages since tensions increased with the US, simultaneously urging citizens to prepare for action while insisting that everything is fine.\n \n\n   \n  The dissonance between the gravity of the crisis in the Caribbean and the regime’s messaging is visible on the streets of Caracas. Unlike in previous nationwide campaigns, CNN teams in Venezuela have not seen any billboards, banners, murals, or graffiti in the national capital calling for support for the regime’s war footing, even in neighborhoods considered government strongholds.\n \n\n   \n     Different strategies \n \n\n   \n  Maduro, who prior to August was more commonly seen in enclosed spaces, has been making speeches and public appearances almost daily since tensions began to rise with the United States, often seen surrounded by a significant security detail, according to Venezuelan researcher and journalist Andrés Cañizález.\n \n\n   \n  Maduro hasn’t taken on the job of projecting Venezuela’s military might in the face of Trump’s threats. He has instead portrayed himself as a peacemaker, even  singing John Lennon’s song “Imagine”  at a public event, urging Trump to come to the table for talks face-to-face. As he waded through the crowd at a rally on November 13, Maduro  told  CNN’s Stefano Pozzebon that the US should unite with Venezuela for peace in the Americas.\n \n\n   \n  Cañizález believes the Maduro government’s communication strategy has gone through different stages: initially, tensions with the US were downplayed, but as the US military presence in the Caribbean increased, the discourse shifted “to a more threatening, more retaliatory tone.”\n \n\n   \n  Maduro’s counterpoint in Venezuela’s propaganda machine is Diosdado Cabello, the interior minister and host of one of the country’s most popular talk shows on state TV – “ Con el Mazo Dando, ” Spanish for “Hitting it with a Club.” In a typical four-hour episode, Cabello meanders between attacking opposition politicians, telling jokes and promoting the government’s position.\n \n\n   \n  Chief among those positions is that US actions in the Caribbean have nothing to do with drugs, despite what the  Trump administration insists .\n \n\n   \n  “There are no tensions here between Venezuela and the United States. Here there is an aggression by the United States against Venezuela,” Cabello declared on his episode last week. “And the aggression has nothing to do with drugs, or terrorism, or criminal gangs, it has to do with taking control of Venezuela’s natural resources.”\n \n\n   \n  On every episode, the interior minister reads out criticisms of the Maduro government, usually from Republican politicians in the US, then responds with a recording of the late President Hugo Chavez daring the United States to try and invade Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  Political scientist Javier Corrales, who often writes about Venezuelan politics, told CNN that Cabello has long cultivated an aggressive reputation as part of the regime’s old guard.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s a bully,” Corrales said. “There is a certain aspect of Cabello that we recognize in other autocracies, the need to have somebody not just praising the president, but trashing the opposition - and Cabello is amazing.”\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks, Venezuela’s military has also posted numerous videos on social media showing soldiers preparing for war, usually set to dramatic music. Footage shows troops conducting shooting drills, anti-tank fortifications in Caracas, and militia members posing with weapons.\n \n\n   \n     Going easy on Trump \n \n\n   \n  Yet, in their different approaches, Maduro and Cabello share one feature: a reluctance to criticize Trump too harshly. Both men have a lot to say about US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n \n\n   \n  In Cabello’s telling, Rubio, whom the interior minister often calls “the Crazy Cuban,” is intent on leading a reluctant Trump to declare war on Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  “This move to seek a change of government in Venezuela isn’t even to satisfy the interests of…Trump or MAGA, but rather those of Rubio and the Cuban American mafia,” Cabello announced to his live studio audience during last week’s episode.\n \n\n   \n  Corrales explained that Rubio is a perfect foil for the Maduro regime, being perhaps the most prominent critic of Latin American leftism in the US government. The secretary’s Cuban heritage and Florida origins also provide fodder for Cabello, who often claims that Rubio is aiming to please an electorate of anti-communist Cuban exiles in Miami.\n \n\n   \n  Cañizález told CNN that while Trump might be criticized, Rubio is a useful “external enemy” for the regime’s most loyal supporters.\n \n\n   \n  Rubio “is presented as the direct enemy of the revolution,” Cañizález said. “This tactic seeks to sow divisions in US domestic politics and reinforce the idea of a personalized external enemy, useful for uniting the Chavista base.”\n \n\n   \n  Even after Trump ordered strikes on alleged drug boats directly off the Venezuelan coast in September, Cabello claimed in his show on September 3   that Rubio is “leading Trump to the slaughter, because Rubio is trying to fracture Trump’s MAGA base and…sell himself as a new hawk within the Republican Party.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the US State Department about Cabello’s claims.\n \n\n   \n  Even   though Cabello often talks about preparing for all scenarios, including possible military conflict, he occasionally downplays Trump’s announced actions against Venezuela. Shortly after Trump publicly authorized the CIA to conduct covert actions in the country, Cabello mocked as ridiculous the idea that the CIA had ever been inactive in Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  “Yes, (the CIA) has been formally authorized to act,” Cabello said sarcastically. “It never acted here before.”\n \n\n   \n  Herein lies the dilemma for Venezuela’s leadership: mobilizing support against external enemies while avoiding the panic of a country under siege. If worse comes to pass, will Super Mustache unsheathe his sword?\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/tech/cloudflare-down-outage-cause","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"10:02:00-05:00","title":"Why it feels like your favorite websites keep going down","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article discusses a series of high-profile internet outages in early 2025, including a major disruption at Cloudflare that affected services such as Spotify, ChatGPT, and Truth Social.

  \n  By Lisa Eadicicco, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:02 PM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Having problems with your favorite websites lately? It’s not just you.\n \n\n   \n  Web infrastructure provider Cloudflare experienced a disruption on Tuesday that temporarily impacted a swath of online services – from Spotify to ChatGPT and even President Donald Trump’s Truth Social platform – marking the latest in a string of high-profile internet outages.\n \n\n   \n  An  Amazon Web Services issue  disrupted the daily routines of millions of people last month, in some cases preventing them from doing even simple tasks like ordering coffee or managing smart home appliances. Just days later,  Microsoft’s Azure service  was hit with an outage.\n \n\n   \n  According to experts, it’s a sign of the times – a combination of society’s  increased reliance on digital services , the consolidation of critical cloud infrastructure between just a few companies and the proclivity of people to complain about tech mishaps online.\n \n\n   \n  It also shows that no one, not even major tech companies, are immune to tech malfunctions.\n \n\n   \n  “It really almost doesn’t matter how well-situated the provider is in these cases, or even how sophisticated the IT organization and infrastructure is for a private business,” said Eileen Haggerty, area vice president of product and solutions marketing for IT and cybersecurity firm Netscout. Tech disruptions like these are “very, very common problems.”\n \n\n   \n    What happened at Cloudflare\n \n\n   \n  Cloudflare’s outage was the result of a technical issue, not a cyberattack or malicious behavior, the company said in a statement to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The company said the outage was caused by a “configuration file” that was meant to manage “threat traffic.”\n \n\n   \n  “The file grew beyond an expected size of entries and triggered a crash in the software system that handles traffic for a number of Cloudflare’s services,” the statement said.   \n \n\n   \n  Dane Knecht, chief technology officer at Cloudflare, shared additional details  in a post on X  on Tuesday afternoon. In short: a routine configuration change caused a bug to crash, which “cascaded into a broad degradation to our network and other services.”\n \n\n   \n  “Work is already underway to make sure it does not happen again, but I know it caused real pain today,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  The Amazon outage similarly  involved a bug , which kicked off when two automated systems tried to update the same data simultaneously.\n \n\n   \n  IT outages are relatively common, tech experts say.   Twenty years ago, it was typical   for IT services to down “all the time,” said Mike Chapple, an IT professor at the University of Notre Dame and former computer scientist for the National Security Agency.\n \n\n   \n  “It would not be unusual to go a week at work having at least one outage of some IT service,” he said, noting that now everyone relies on the same large providers.\n \n\n   \n  The impacts can be widely felt when they happen at the major providers, such as Amazon, Microsoft and Google, that serve as the backbone of the web.   \n \n\n   \n  Issues submitted to Downdetector, a website that tracks user-reported problems with popular online platforms, surpassed 2.1 million on Tuesday, according to data provided to CNN by Downdetector parent company Ookla.\n \n\n   \n  Cloudflare says it handles 81 million HTTP requests – or when web browsers need certain data to trigger an action, such as loading a webpage – per second on average.\n \n\n   \n    Are there really more outages happening lately?\n \n\n   \n  That there have been three widespread outages in less than a month is a coincidence. But Haggerty acknowledged that it certainly feels like these outages are happening more often, mostly because of the scale of their impact.\n \n\n   \n  The number of service outages has “remained consistent,” but the “number of sites and applications dependent on these services has increased, making them more disruptive to users,” Angelique Medina, head of internet intelligence for Cisco ThousandEyes, told CNN in an emailed statement.\n \n\n   \n  Cisco’s network monitoring service has logged 12 major outages in 2025 so far, according to  a timeline published on its website , not counting Tuesday’s Cloudflare disruption.\n \n\n   \n  That compares to 23 in 2024, 13 in 2023 and 10 in 2022. A  sweeping Crowdstrike outage  upended businesses, flights and hospitals around the world in 2024.\n \n\n   \n  There are some common trends between outages that occurred in the first half of 2025,  according to Cisco . A string of outages were linked to systems accidentally spreading tech failures, systems that appeared to be functioning properly despite silent issues occurring and configuration changes that cascaded.\n \n\n   \n  While these trends aren’t new, Cisco’s blog post says it’s been “seeing more of these types of disruptions with more far-reaching consequences.”\n \n\n   \n  And it’ll likely happen again.\n \n\n   \n  “They aren’t something you’d say, ‘Well, thank God that would never happen to us,’” said Haggerty. “All of these could actually happen to any business.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Hadas Gold contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/us/ntsb-bridge-recommendation","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00Z","title":"How the NTSB is trying to prevent another major bridge collapse","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) issued 17 new safety recommendations following the 2024 collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, which was struck by the cargo vessel Dali.

     3:00 AM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore could be repeated across the country if recommendations aren’t followed, the National Transportation Safety Board said Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  The board issued 17 safety recommendations this week to prevent an accident like the one last year, where the 213-million-pound cargo vessel Dali lost engine and electrical power as it was leaving the port and struck a pillar of the Key Bridge causing it to collapse.\n \n\n   \n  The NTSB recommended Synergy Marine, the ship’s operator, use thermal imaging to find lose wires on its other vessels, make sure the right pumps are being used, and that engines won’t automatically shut down in situations like this crash.\n \n\n   \n  Other recommendations include new rules for wire labeling, a warning system for drivers crossing bridges in case of emergency, and better recoding systems to capture data on ships in case of a crash.\n \n\n   \n  “In order to see safety change, we need our recommendations implemented,” NTSB chairwoman Jennifer Homendy told reporters after a nearly five hour public meeting. “That’s the next step. We’ve issued the safety recommendations now we need to make sure that they’re implemented, and so we will work diligently.”\n \n\n   \n  The NTSB held the public meeting Tuesday to determine the probable cause of the container ship Dali crashing into the Francis Scott Key Bridge, and its subsequent collapse, killing six people.\n \n\n   \n  The 984-feet long vessel operated in the container liner trade, carrying truck-sized boxes of cargo between Asia and the US East Coast. The bridge was owned and operated by the Maryland Transportation Authority and opened to traffic on March 23, 1977.\n \n\n   \n  The last time the bridge was inspected was in 2024 when it was given a satisfactory rating. Yet the Key Bridge had nearly 30 times the acceptable level of risk for critical bridges of collapse if it were hit, based on guidance established by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, the NTSB said. But no one knew that before the collapse, because the owner of the bridge, the Maryland Transportation Authority, never evaluated that risk.\n \n\n   \n  The agency says all of the blame for the bridge collapse is the fault of the ship.\n \n\n   \n  “The MDTA maintains that the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge and the tragic loss of life were the sole fault of the DALI and the gross negligence of its owners and operators,” it said in a statement to CNN Tuesday.  “The Key Bridge was approved and permitted by the federal government and complied with those permits.”\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, Synergy thanked the NTSB for its “professionalism and technical rigour” throughout this investigation and said it and Grace Ocean Investment Limited, the company that owns the ship, have cooperated fully with the board.\n \n\n   \n  “We note the Board’s findings, including its observations regarding the vulnerability of the Key Bridge’s main support pier, as well as the comments relating to aspects of the vessel’s electrical arrangements. These matters will be reviewed in detail with our technical teams, the vessel owner and counsel,” the statement said.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, the NTSB recommended risk assessments also be conducted on 68 other bridges in 19 states spanning waterways frequented by cargo ships that, like the Key Bridge, were built before 1991 and do not have a current vulnerability assessment.\n \n\n   \n  Among those on the list are the Golden Gate Bridge in California; Brooklyn, Manhattan, Williamsburg, George Washington and Verrazzano-Narrows bridges in New York City; the Walt Whitman and Benjamin Franklin bridges in Pennsylvania; the Sunshine Skyway in Florida and the Mackinac Bridge in Michigan.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, Homendy noted that despite its recommendations, some of those bridges still have not been evaluated for risk of collapse if a ship like the Dali were to hit them.\n \n\n   \n    One loose wire, among thousands\n \n\n   \n  The NTSB said Tuesday it believes the probable cause of the power outage that led to the crash was a label was put in the wrong place on a signal wire when the ship was built. That sticker, identifying the line, kept the wire from getting a good connection in a circuit breaker – which in turn ultimately caused the first blackout.\n \n\n   \n  As a result, according to Marcel Muse, the NTSB’s investigator in charge, the vessel lost steering, the ability to operate the bow thruster, key water pumps, and most of the vessel’s lighting and equipment essential for operations. That first outage lasted 58 seconds.\n \n\n   \n  There were thousands of wires on the Dali, and one loose wire would not have been easily found by the crew.\n \n\n   \n  “The Dali is almost 1,000 feet, and it’s as long as the Eiffel Tower,” Homendy said. “It’s high with miles of wiring and thousands of electrical connections. Locating a single wire that is loose among thousands of wires is like looking for a loose bolt in the Eiffel Tower.”\n \n\n   \n  The crew onboard the Dali quickly found the tripped breaker, the NTSB said. Power came back within 58 seconds, but restarting a key pump that would have provided fuel to generators had to be done manually, and that didn’t happen. When the generators ran out of gas in their lines, the result was a second blackout.\n \n\n   \n  “To restart it, you would have to go two levels down in near total darkness with a flashlight from the engine control deck to the purifier room on the fourth deck,” Homendy said.\n \n\n   \n  The pump the Dali was using was designed for maintenance and was not intended for use while the ship was underway, so there was no backup system.\n \n\n   \n  At the time of the second blackout, the Dali was just three ships’ lengths from the bridge and despite the pilots reacting properly, they couldn’t regain control in time to avoid hitting it, the NTSB said.\n \n\n   \n  About 10 hours earlier, while the ship was still moored, it experienced two onboard blackouts, one caused by a crew error, according to the NTSB.\n \n\n   \n  Last year, Grace Ocean and Synergy reached  a settlement  with the Justice Department to pay nearly $102 million to resolve a civil claim alleging that the companies’ cost-cutting and negligence in the ship’s maintenance led to the disastrous collision.\n \n\n   \n  In its filing last month, the Justice Department said that the “tragedy was entirely avoidable,” pointing to alleged failures in the ship’s infrastructure.\n \n\n   \n    Black boxes didn’t give up information easily\n \n\n   \n  Investigators also encountered many issues extracting information from the vessel’s recorders, which are similar to black boxes on airplanes.\n \n\n   \n  Voyage data recorders, known as a VDRs, are electronic systems that continuously record navigational and location data, radar images, basic engine operations, alarm status, bridge audio recordings and VHF radio communications, according to the NTSB.\n \n\n   \n  Sean Payne, an investigator in the NTSB’s vehicle recorder division, said during the investigation, the NTSB encountered several problems that made it hard to extract and use the data efficiently.\n \n\n   \n  “Key issues included unrecorded data during the vessel’s first underway blackout, the lack of recording of communications between the Dali’s bridge and the Dali’s engine room, the digitally destructive mixing of recorded bridge audio channels, inadequate VDR playback software, the inability to download the full data set on board the Dali, and the complex workflow for processing proprietary VDR data in the common formats,” he explained.\n \n\n   \n    Final report coming soon\n \n\n   \n  The final report on the incident will be revised and issued in several weeks and the 17 recommendations will be formally issued and finalized by the NTSB.\n \n\n   \n  “We have a really big voice, and we’re not afraid to use it,” Homendy said. “While we don’t have enforcement power, certainly, we have had a lot of success with voluntary adoption of our recommendations. We’re usually at an 83% closure rate.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Michelle Watson contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/politics/epstein-survivors-house-vote","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00-21:00","title":"‘We have power together’: For Epstein survivors, a day of emotion and triumph","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Survivors of Jeffrey Epstein’s sex-trafficking ring gathered in Washington, D.C., to demand the release of Epstein’s files, culminating in a historic victory when the U.S. House passed the bill on a 427-1 vote.

Every time someone new arrived, there was an eruption of hugs and cheerful greetings.\n \n\n   \n  The scene could have easily been a joyful reunion of old friends.\n \n\n   \n  But the group was made up of the  survivors of Jeffrey Epstein , forever bonded by their trauma and abuse at the hands of the convicted pedophile. The women had once again descended on Washington, DC, to hold a press conference and plead with lawmakers to  vote to release the Epstein files .\n \n\n   \n  Dani Bensky, who met Epstein when she was a young ballerina, said she had managed to get just a few hours of sleep the previous night. She had spent the evening with the family of the late Epstein victim  Virginia Giuffre , making the most out of the fact that they are rarely in the same place at the same time. It was past midnight when she realized she still hadn’t written out the remarks she would need to make at a press conference just hours later.\n \n\n   \n  “Who writes a speech at one o’clock in the morning the night before? Ai yai yai, rookie mistake on my part,” Bensky said lightheartedly after the press conference, as she quickly made her way to a meeting that was scheduled with a lawmaker. Her fellow survivors, walking alongside her, were quick to reassure her that she had done just fine.\n \n\n   \n  Throughout the day, the women stayed close together much like this — there to offer each other pep talks and reminders to drink water and eat; quietly squeezing one another’s hands; and making sure nobody got lost in the maze of hallways on Capitol Hill as they hoped for good news.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Can we give you a hug?’\n \n\n   \n  In the late morning, the women found themselves consoling Republican Rep. Nancy Mace.\n \n\n   \n  The South Carolina congresswoman walked out into the foyer of her office in the Longworth building in tears. She has been ensnared in a legal battle of her own after  accusing her ex-fiancé  of crimes including physical assault, rape and sex trafficking — allegations he strongly denies.\n \n\n   \n  “You’ve given me hope that one day I might get justice,” Mace told the Epstein survivors. “It’s very raw for me.”\n \n\n   \n  “Can we give you a hug?” one woman jumped in to ask.\n \n\n   \n  “Yes, I would love a hug,” Mace responded, which prompted several women to take turns embracing the lawmaker.\n \n\n   \n  Mace was one of only four House Republicans to support a discharge petition to force a House vote on the Epstein files. When an Epstein survivor told the congresswoman that the group had been holding their breath and hoping Mace wouldn’t cave to political pressure and abandon her support for the bill, Mace responded: “Yeah, I ran out of fucks to give a long time ago.”\n \n\n   \n  “We rarely get this chance. This moment is historic,” she said. “Women never get this chance.”\n \n\n   \n  Annie Farmer, who said she was 16 when Epstein and his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell abused her, told CNN it was impossible for her now to imagine going through this experience alone.\n \n\n   \n  “Every time a large group gathers, it completely changes the dynamic and the experience,” Farmer said. “It really does move us from feeling fearful to feeling like we are feared. We have power together.”\n \n\n   \n  Her sister, Maria, is one of the earliest known Epstein accusers. As Farmer made her way from meeting to meeting on Tuesday, more than once, she was on the phone, keeping her sister apprised of developments.\n \n\n   \n  At 2:43 p.m., the gavel came down in the House — the  Epstein bill had passed  on an overwhelming 427-1 vote.\n \n\n   \n  As soon as she stepped out of the House gallery after passage, Farmer was back on her phone, calling Maria to share the news.\n \n\n   \n  “It was just incredible to hear her voice and to be able to tell her it passed and it happened and you were such a big part of it,” Annie said.\n \n\n   \n    ‘It kills me that she’s not here’\n \n\n   \n  One Epstein victim was not present on Capitol Hill on Tuesday but her presence could be felt everywhere that the group of survivors went.\n \n\n   \n  Giuffre, one of the most prominent victims of Epstein’s sex-trafficking ring, died by suicide in August. In her  posthumously published memoir  released last month, she wrote about having been lent out to an endless stream of wealthy and powerful people. “I believed that I might die a sex slave,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  When Giuffre’s brother, Sky Roberts, spoke at the survivors’ press conference and credited his sister for having helped to advance the fight for accountability and transparency, tears streamed down the faces of Giuffre’s fellow victims standing behind Roberts.\n \n\n   \n  “Sissy,” Roberts said. “You didn’t just make a small dent. You made a monumental impact, a resounding statement that echoed across the world. You built an unbreakable wall, a barrier that will protect future generations from the horrors of abuse.”\n \n\n   \n  Bensky, who credits Giuffre for having shaped her own decision to go public with her Epstein story, said she has wondered what Giuffre would have made of this moment.\n \n\n   \n  “It kills me that she’s not here to see it,” Bensky said. “It’s so wrong that she’s just not here. It’s kind of devastating to think that we’re doing this without her.”\n \n\n   \n  Many of the other survivors wore brightly colored butterfly pins on their lapels on Tuesday in Giuffre’s memory. For Bensky and Farmer, their green and pink jeweled brooches were all the more meaningful because they were gifts given to them by Roberts.\n \n\n   \n  “Virginia chose the symbol of the butterfly because of the metamorphosis and this real belief she had that there could be post-traumatic growth — that you could go through something like this and come out the other side and have so much to give and share,” Farmer told CNN. “And that’s what she did.”\n \n\n   \n  After the passage of the House’s Epstein bill, the women gathered in the early evening to hold a vigil honoring all of Epstein’s victims, including those who have passed. It was right around when Farmer was paying tribute to Giuffre that Bensky got a whisper in her ear: The Senate had decided to pass the Epstein bill immediately.\n \n\n   \n  Many of the survivors had assumed that the bill’s path through the Senate — and to President Donald Trump’s desk — could be long and arduous and had been preparing for another major battle.\n \n\n   \n  “Words will never ever be able to describe this day,” Bensky said. “We just feel like we never have gotten the win, and we got the win. And that feels so good.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/americas/venezuela-maria-corina-machado-freedom-manifesto-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"19:57:00-05:00","title":"Venezuela’s opposition leader publishes ‘freedom manifesto’ from hiding as Maduro opens door to dialogue with Trump","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Venezuela’s opposition leader María Corina Machado has released a 'freedom manifesto' from hiding, declaring the end of Nicolás Maduro’s authoritarian rule and outlining a democratic vision for Venezuela grounded in inalienable rights such as free speech, voting, and assembly.

Trump \n       \n  By Michael Rios, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:57 PM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Venezuela’s opposition leader  María Corina Machado  has published a “freedom manifesto” outlining her vision of a “new era” for the country without its strongman Nicolás Maduro.\n \n\n   \n  The four-page document, dated November 9 but made public on Tuesday, lays out the democratic pillars she says all Venezuelans are entitled to, including the rights to vote, assemble and exercise free speech.\n \n\n   \n  Borrowing language from other democratic frameworks, such as the US Declaration of Independence, the text calls for decentralizing power from the government and restoring it to the public. “Every Venezuelan is born with inalienable rights that have been conferred upon them by our Creator, not by men,” part of the document reads.\n \n\n   \n  Machado, who read the entire manifesto in a 15-minute video from an undisclosed location, declared that Maduro’s tight grip on power was coming to an end. Machado was driven into hiding after a disputed election last year, in which government-controlled electoral authorities declared Maduro the winner.\n \n\n   \n  “A new Venezuela is emerging from the ashes, renewed in spirit and united in purpose, like a phoenix reborn – fierce, radiant, and unstoppable,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the Venezuelan government for comment.\n \n\n   \n  David Smilde, a Venezuela expert at Tulane University, said that Machado likely published the manifesto to bring attention back to Venezuelans’ democratic struggle and assure supporters she has a plan for the country if Maduro eventually steps down.\n \n\n   \n  He said the manifesto resembles a “proto-constitution” but noted that Machado didn’t mention whether she would suspend the current constitution, impose a new one, or call a constitutional assembly. “So the natural question is: What is the status of this?” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Machado’s declaration comes as Maduro is confronting a US military build-up off Venezuela’s Caribbean shores. The US has amassed more than a dozen warships and some 15,000 troops in the region as part of what the Pentagon says is a mission to disrupt drug trafficking from Latin America.  It’s considered the  largest US military presence  in the region since the invasion of Panama in 1989.\n \n\n   \n  US officials say President Donald Trump is still  weighing  whether to carry out an attack inside Venezuela, though he has hinted that a diplomatic window may be opening.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said Monday he would be open to speaking directly with Maduro at a “certain time,” suggesting he sees a pathway in the country that doesn’t involve dropping bombs or sending commandos to take Maduro out.\n \n\n   \n  Maduro also suggested Monday night that he would be open to dialogue with his American counterpart. “Anyone who wants to talk to Venezuela will talk face to face,” he said on state TV when asked to respond to Trump’s comments.\n \n\n   \n  Venezuela’s government has condemned the military build-up, calling it an attempt to oust Maduro from power.\n \n\n   \n  Machado, who has welcomed the US pressure, said in her manifesto that Maduro must be held accountable for his actions, claiming he has committed crimes against humanity including torture, killings and forced disappearances. Venezuela in the past has denied such claims.\n \n\n   \n  Smilde, whose research covers Chavismo, the leftist ideology associated with Maduro’s party, noted that in Machado’s call for justice, she didn’t discuss reconciliation among Venezuelans.\n \n\n   \n  “She doesn’t try to reach out to Chavismo at all here and say, ‘We need this process of reconciliation. We’re all Venezuelans.’ Nothing like that. So it tells me this is a document that is basically oriented toward the international community,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  In October, Machado was awarded the  Nobel Peace Prize  for keeping “the flame of democracy burning amid a growing darkness.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/us/roman-surovtsev-ukraine-deportation-hope","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"20:26:00-20:30","title":"A Dallas dad came to terms with his imminent deportation.

With a criminal record from a 2003 armed carjacking conviction, he lost his green card and was held in custody for over 100 days. His wife, Samantha, rallied legal support, and his attorneys successfully vacated the carjacking conviction due to ineffective counsel under California Penal Code 1473.7(a)(1).

Then an 11th-hour court order gave hope to see his family again \n       \n  By Danya Gainor, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:26 PM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  On Saturday evening, Samantha Surovtsev squinted at her phone, blinking through tears as she rushed to order a set of Eastern European power adapters. Despite the 80-degree North Texas heat, she then drove to Old Navy and bought two bulky winter coats.\n \n\n   \n  When the adapters arrived Sunday, she tucked them into a suitcase alongside the coats and wool socks and drove everything to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility in Alvarado.\n \n\n   \n  Her husband,  Roman Surovtsev , was inside. The 41-year-old had been there for 109 days, after being unexpectedly detained during a routine check-in with ICE in August. Surovtsev had been convicted of armed carjacking when he was 19 and was released from prison in 2014 before a six-month stint in ICE custody. The run-in cost him his permanent resident status.\n \n\n   \n  Surovtsev was swept up again in ICE detainment as part of President Donald Trump’s crackdown on immigration, an effort stretching across the country from  Charlotte  to  Portland , fracturing families and communities.\n \n\n   \n  Since returning to office, Trump has implemented policies to deport undocumented migrants en masse. ICE agents have been  directed  to detain and arrest people at  work ,  courthouses,   churches and schools  as part of the administration’s  deportation push .\n \n\n   \n  Now the husband and father of two was a day away from boarding a deportation flight with dozens of other detainees to war-torn Ukraine, a country he hadn’t lived in since it was part of the Soviet Union.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for comment on Surovtsev’s case. In a Monday post on X, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin called Surovtsev a “criminal illegal alien” with “a history of violence,” citing carjacking and burglary charges alongside a number of other offenses of which he hasn’t been convicted.\n \n\n   \n  On Sunday night, he used the center’s tablet to call his wife, family and in-laws to say what he believed were his final goodbyes. Immigration officials wouldn’t tell Surovtsev, his attorneys or Samantha when or where specifically he was being removed, citing security concerns, his wife said.\n \n\n   \n  All they could do now was wait.\n \n\n   \n  Monday passed in agonizing quiet. Samantha sat by the phone for hours, waiting for confirmation that the worst had happened, that Surovtsev had been officially deported.\n \n\n   \n  His immigration attorney finally called at 3:29 p.m. She stepped outside, away from the sounds of her young daughters playing inside.\n \n\n   \n  “The stay has been granted,” the attorney told her. The flight full of detainees would still leave for Ukraine, but he wouldn’t be on it.\n \n\n   \n    ‘God’s timing is perfect’\n \n\n   \n  Roman Surovtsev was born in the former Soviet Union in 1984 and fled to the US legally with his mother and two siblings when he was 4 years old. Although they found relief from Soviet rule in their new country, he grew up in poverty and instability.\n \n\n   \n  In 2003, at 19 years old, Surovtsev began serving a 13-year sentence after helping some friends commit an armed carjacking of a motorcycle in California. In prison, he was baptized, a turning point that transformed him, his wife said.\n \n\n   \n  He met Samantha in 2017 while jet skiing with mutual friends in Orange County, and the two eventually married, bought a home outside Dallas, launched a painting business and started a family. Surovtsev has never violated the terms of his supervision order, his lawyers wrote in court filings.\n \n\n   \n  When Samantha hung up with the attorney on Monday, her heart racing, she rang the tablet at the detention center.\n \n\n   \n  “Are you listening?” she asked Surovtsev when he picked up. “They issued the stay, and they’re reopening your case.”\n \n\n   \n  His lawyers thought it would take two to three months to hear from a judge about the motion to reopen his case, which they filed November 4.\n \n\n   \n  Surovtsev wept. “God’s timing is perfect,” he told her.\n \n\n   \n  “We had accepted that Roman would be on that plane, and I was thinking about what our lives are going to look like and if we could ever get to him again,” Samantha said. “And suddenly, it’s all reversed, because there’s still hope.”\n \n\n   \n  She spent the rest of the day telling family and friends the news.\n \n\n   \n  That night, as Samantha tucked their daughters into bed, her 5-year-old asked if they could call dad. For months, Samantha had told the girls that their father was simply “at work.”\n \n\n   \n  When he picked up the tablet, the two talked excitedly about all the things they planned to do when Surovtsev came home. He promised her he would build a massive Barbie dollhouse to go into the attic playroom he made for his girls.\n \n\n   \n  His daughter squealed with excitement.\n \n\n   \n    Decades of legal battles, time served and reform led to the stay\n \n\n   \n  Surovtsev was released early on good behavior in 2014 when an immigration court judge ordered him to be deported. He lost his green card, and he was placed into ICE custody, but the agency ran into trouble removing him from the country.\n \n\n   \n  Having been born in the former Soviet Union, the Russian Consulate told the US government in early 2015 it had no records of Surovtsev, his lawyers wrote in court filings. The Ukrainian government also said at the time it couldn’t confirm his citizenship given that Surovtsev was from a region of Ukraine that’s at war and not readily reachable, and therefore could not issue him Ukrainian travel documents.\n \n\n   \n  Subsequently, Surovtsev was released from ICE custody in May 2015 on an order of supervision without his green card but with an employment authorization document, a work permit, and was required to wear an ankle monitor for six months. He checked in with ICE every other week before his visits became quarterly, then annual.\n \n\n   \n  For years, he checked in at the kiosk of the Dallas ICE office, confirming details like his address and any travel plans in between starting his own business and building a family.\n \n\n   \n  His unexpected detainment during a routine check-in on August 1 mobilized Samantha, who rallied a team of lawyers to represent him.\n \n\n   \n  His counsel was able to successfully vacate Surovtsev’s carjacking charge, essentially wiping it from his record, on the grounds that he received ineffective counsel back in 2014, Surovtsev’s immigration lawyer Jennifer Rozdzielski said. This empowered his attorneys to file a motion earlier this month to reopen his old criminal case in hopes of getting it dismissed.\n \n\n   \n  In the 11th hour on Monday, just before he was to board the deportation flight bound for Ukraine, a court in California agreed to hear his case and ordered a stay of his removal, barring the US government from deporting him.\n \n\n   \n  “Respondent has demonstrated new, material evidence to warrant reopening of these proceedings,” the order, reviewed by CNN, reads. “His convictions were vacated pursuant to California Penal Code 1473.7(a)(1), specifically due to constitutional defects in the underlying criminal proceedings, so Respondent met his ‘heavy burden’ to show that his evidence ‘would likely change the result’ in his case.”\n \n\n   \n  Surovtsev will remain in detention while the court proceedings play out.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re just thankful that plane took off without him, and that the judge ruled the way she did, because all we wanted was time for our case to be heard. And we got it,” Samantha said.\n \n\n   \n  But Surovtsev’s team has acknowledged that the fight isn’t over.\n \n\n   \n  “What’s next is making sure that not a single other Ukrainian who’s in detention is sent back to that country,” said Eric Lee, one of Surovtsev’s attorneys.\n \n\n   \n    The flight carrying dozens of detainees still took off for Ukraine, attorneys said\n \n\n   \n  Surovtsev’s relief while his court proceedings play out comes at a bittersweet moment for his legal team and other families. Some deportees boarded Monday’s flight and are now in Ukraine, his attorneys said.\n \n\n   \n  “However many people were ultimately successfully deported to Ukraine are probably fighting for their lives right now,” said Lee. “We’re glad at least one person was prevented from going on that flight, but we’re very upset about all the others and very, very sorry for their families.”\n \n\n   \n  Samantha has been in contact with several other families with loved ones who were deported on Monday’s flight. None of them have been able to get ahold of them yet, she said.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to DHS for comment on the flight to Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  One family is tracking their deportee’s phone, with an app showing it on the move inside Ukraine, Samantha said. But he’s not answering their calls, and they’re not sure if he still has his phone.\n \n\n   \n  Another detainee has a background similar to Surovtsev – a USSR child refugee who got into trouble as a teenager, served his sentence and moved through adulthood with a supervision order from ICE, his attorney Ann Peters said. Her client, who also narrowly missed being deported Monday, is the primary caretaker of his brother, a paralyzed Marine Corps veteran.\n \n\n   \n  As Samantha and other detainees’ families sit in legal limbo during what feels like an endless pursuit to see their loved ones again, Samantha said the Bible verse Romans 8:31 is keeping her warm.\n \n\n   \n  “If God is for us, who can be against us?”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/politics/khashoggi-murder-trump-bin-saudi-crown-prince","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"20:31:00-20:33","title":"Trump claims slain journalist Khashoggi was ‘extremely controversial,’ defends Saudi crown prince","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During a high-profile state-level visit to the White House, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was welcomed with full diplomatic honors, including a military flyover and black-tie reception, as President Donald Trump reaffirmed their close relationship and promoted new U.S.-Saudi investments.

Liptak, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:51 PM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump on Tuesday angrily dismissed a question about the 2018 murder of  Jamal Khashoggi , claiming the Saudi dissident journalist was “extremely controversial” and insisting the subject was only raised during his meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to embarrass his visitor.\n \n\n   \n  “You’re mentioning somebody that was extremely controversial. A lot of people didn’t like that gentleman that you’re talking about. Whether you liked him or didn’t like him, things happen,” Trump said in the Oval Office as he presided over a pageant-filled visit for the de facto Saudi leader.\n \n\n   \n  Trump went on to insist Prince bin Salman — who the CIA assessed  likely ordered the murder  — wasn’t involved.\n \n\n   \n  “He knew nothing about it, and we can leave it at that,” Trump said, turning toward the crown prince.\n \n\n   \n  The moment was the best illustration yet that the period of diplomatic isolation Prince bin Salman endured following Khashoggi’s murder is over. For his first visit to the White House in more than seven years, the crown prince was welcomed with  all the trappings of a state visit , the highest form of American diplomatic reception.\n \n\n   \n  His black Mercedes limousine was escorted onto the South Lawn by a team of dark horses as a military band trumpeted his arrival. A flyover of fighter jets that included F-35s – the jets Trump says he’s planning to sell to Riyadh – blared overhead. Later, Trump is hosting a black-tie dinner in the East Room.\n \n\n   \n  Sitting in the Oval Office, Trump heaped praise on the crown prince, including for what he called his “incredible” record on human rights. The president touted new deals on Saudi investments in the United States, and affirmed his plans to sell the American-made jets, even as the crown prince stopped short of committing to some of Trump’s priorities.\n \n\n   \n  And instead of merely glossing over the 2018 murder, which took place at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Trump took offense that the subject was raised at all during what he intended to be a splashy show of respect.\n \n\n   \n  “You don’t have to embarrass our guest by asking a question like that,” Trump told the reporter, longtime ABC White House correspondent Mary Bruce, who questioned him about the murder.\n \n\n   \n  Sitting beside Trump, the crown prince appeared nonplussed by the discussion of his alleged role in the murder, which was committed by Saudi agents who later dismembered the US resident and Washington Post columnist.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s painful and it’s a huge mistake,” Prince bin Salman said, going on to defend a Saudi investigation afterward.\n \n\n   \n  “About the journalist, it’s really painful to hear anyone that been losing his life for no real purpose or not in a legal way, and it’s been painful for us in Saudi Arabia,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The crown prince added that Saudi Arabia “did all the right steps of investigation” and that “we are doing our best that this doesn’t happen again.”\n \n\n   \n  Hanan Elatr Khashoggi, Jamal Khashoggi’s widow, responded to Trump’s claim that her slain husband was “extremely controversial,” saying that was no reason for him to have been assassinated.\n \n\n   \n  “This is not justification to murder him. Jamal was a good transparent and brave man,” she said in a statement to CNN, adding that “many may not have agreed with his opinions and desire for freedom of the press. The Crown Prince said he was sorry so he should meet me, apologize and compensate me for the murder of my husband.”\n \n\n   \n  In  an editorial , The Post wrote that Trump’s comments “dishonor Khashoggi’s legacy, stand at odds with the facts and are beneath the office of the president.”\n \n\n   \n  The CIA assessment released in 2021 found the prince approved the assassination of the Washington Post columnist, though he has long denied any involvement.\n \n\n   \n  “We base this assessment on the Crown Prince’s control of decision-making in the Kingdom, the direct involvement of a key adviser and members of Muhammad bin Salman’s protective detail in the operation, and the Crown Prince’s support for using violent measures to silence dissidents abroad, including Khashoggi,” the report said.\n \n\n   \n  During his first term, Trump largely shrugged off Prince bin Salman’s potential role in Khashoggi’s murder, though he described himself as “extremely angry and very unhappy” about the killing.\n \n\n   \n  His successor, President Joe Biden, pledged as a candidate to make Saudi Arabia a “pariah.” But even Biden came to recognize the kingdom and its crown prince were too powerful and influential to ignore entirely. He flew to the country in 2022 in a mostly unsuccessful attempt to convince Saudi Arabia to increase its oil output.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has actively sought to cultivate his relationship with the kingdom in his second term, visiting Riyadh in May to discuss new investments and security arrangements. His interest in the kingdom has drawn scrutiny for his family’s financial interests in the country, though he dismissed those concerns Tuesday. “I have nothing to do with the family business. I have left,” the president said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s hope is that Saudi Arabia eventually joins the Abraham Accords, his signature diplomatic achievement, by normalizing its relations with Israel.\n \n\n   \n  But Prince bin Salman made clear that wasn’t happening Tuesday, or anytime before a clear pathway exists for an independent Palestinian state.\n \n\n   \n  “We want to be part of the Abraham Accords,” the crown prince said. “But we want also to be sure that we secure a clear path to a two-state solution.”\n \n\n   \n  So, too, was Prince bin Salman noncommittal when it came to providing funding to help rebuild Gaza. He said he was in “discussion” on the matter before Trump interjected to insist “it will be a lot.”\n \n\n   \n  The crown prince did say he would increase Saudi Arabia’s investment pledge in the United States from the $600 billion announced in May to $1 trillion – a massive figure that’s nearly the kingdom’s entire yearly economic output.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, meanwhile, seemed eager to provide new American assistance to Saudi Arabia, including a defense pact and an agreement that would help the kingdom develop a civilian nuclear program.\n \n\n   \n  Mostly, however, he seemed intent on honoring the crown prince, who has consolidated power and is now the kingdom’s day-to-day ruler.\n \n\n   \n  “I just want to thank you,” Trump said. “We’ve been really good friends for a long period of time. We’ve always been on the same side of every issue.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/americas/torres-del-paine-snowstorm-five-dead-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"20:10:00Z","title":"Five tourists killed by snowstorm in Chile’s Torres del Paine National Park","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A deadly snowstorm in Chile’s Torres del Paine National Park killed five international tourists—two Mexicans, two Germans, and one Briton—while four others who were missing were found alive.

CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:48 PM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Lawmakers on Capitol Hill Tuesday took the significant step of ordering  President Donald Trump ’s Justice Department to publicly release all of its investigative files into the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, after months of nasty infighting within the GOP.\n \n\n   \n  Congress is sending the measure — which remarkably won support from all but one Republican across both the House and Senate — to Trump’s desk once it’s formally transmitted between the chambers. Despite months of calling the issue a “Democratic hoax,” the president has said he’ll sign the bill.\n \n\n   \n  Trump will do so “whenever it gets to the White House,” a senior White House official said Tuesday evening. (The president was already scheduled to host the Saudi crown prince for dinner at the White House Tuesday night.)\n \n\n   \n  The speed with which the bill moved through both chambers of Congress on Tuesday marked a stark reversal from recent months when Trump and GOP leaders worked furiously to quash it. But Trump ultimately decided to allow his party to back the measure as pressure mounted within his party.\n \n\n   \n  In the end, even Speaker Mike Johnson and his leadership team backed the measure, despite spending the summer and fall trying to quash Washington’s obsession with the Epstein files, while insisting the bill did not do enough to protect victims’ privacy. And in the Senate, Majority Leader John Thune did not stand in the way of Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer’s request for “unanimous consent” to pass it, sending it directly to Trump once received from the House.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson said earlier Tuesday he was urging his Senate counterpart to add key protections for victims’ privacy, which would have slowed the bill, but Thune said he was unlikely to amend the legislation that came out of the House nearly unanimously. “I think, when a bill comes out of the House 427 to 1, and the President has said he’s going to sign it, I’m not sure that amending it … is in the cards,” he told reporters.\n \n\n   \n  Ultimately, Johnson said, “all the Republicans want to go on record to show they’re for maximum transparency.”\n \n\n   \n  It was a remarkable turnaround for Trump and Republican leaders in Washington, who had unsuccessfully tried to halt the measure led by a party agitator, Rep. Thomas Massie, and strongly backed by Democrats. But by this weekend, with a House vote looming, Trump and his team  feared an embarrassing defeat  was coming and he agreed to relent — effectively allowing GOP lawmakers to vote for Massie’s measure.\n \n\n   \n  “This is an overdue moment,” Massie said Tuesday, hours ahead of the vote.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve fought the president, the attorney general, the FBI director, the speaker of the House and the vice president to get this win,” the Kentucky Republican said during a news conference on Capitol Hill, quickly adding that they are now “on our side today.”\n \n\n   \n  Massie has been pilloried by Trump and his advisers in recent weeks, including personal attacks on his marriage and a campaign to primary him in his district.\n \n\n   \n  Yet on Tuesday, Massie said he welcomed Trump’s turnaround on the issue: “What he’s doing this week is strengthening his position by coming on board, and we’re glad to have him.”\n \n\n   \n  While Johnson delivered a blistering critique of Democrats over the Epstein saga ahead of the vote, the effort drew widespread support from Republicans.\n \n\n   \n  “Let’s get accountability, let’s get answers and let’s get this over with,” GOP Rep. Kevin Kiley of California said.\n \n\n   \n  The Republican chair of the House Judiciary Committee, Rep. Jim Jordan, added of the vote: “We all support holding bad guys accountable, and we’re all going to vote for this resolution.”\n \n\n   \n  The only lawmaker to vote against it, Rep. Clay Higgins of Louisiana, said he did so because of the way the legislation is written. “It abandons 250 years of criminal justice procedure in America. As written, this bill reveals and injures thousands of innocent people – witnesses, people who provided alibis, family members, etc,” he wrote on X after casting his vote.\n \n\n   \n  Now, Johnson and GOP leaders are hopeful that they can soon turn the page from the months-long Epstein saga within their own conference, which has led to bitter feuds — like the one between Trump and his once-close ally, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene. Greene in recent months has joined Massie in pushing for the release of the files, prompting Trump himself to call her a “traitor” and call for her to be ousted in a primary race.\n \n\n   \n  The House’s investigative committees have launched their own inquiries into the Epstein matter.\n \n\n   \n  It was Trump himself who had initially helped gin up the GOP’s interest in the government’s Epstein investigation. The president had repeatedly speculated publicly whether the late financier and sex offender had died in prison and promised on the campaign trail to declassify the files.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s hand-picked DOJ officials had, too, fueled the speculation. When asked by a conservative podcast host in 2023 why the so-called Epstein list had not been released, Kash Patel suggested it was being kept hidden “because of who’s on that list.” Attorney General Pam Bondi said in February of this year that the Epstein client list was sitting on her desk.\n \n\n   \n  But months into Trump’s second term, the White House had released no new information about that investigation. The Epstein issue was quickly creating a major rift between Trump and his MAGA base. Many of his supporters were loudly complaining that the administration was failing to release what Trump once promised he would: the complete set of government files on Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  Soon after, Massie, along with his Democratic partner, Rep. Ro Khanna, launched a rogue push to go around the speaker and bring a bill to the floor without GOP leaders’ approval. A handful of other Republicans — all women, including Greene — signed on, too.\n \n\n   \n  The White House resisted the effort, with personal phone calls to members who had backed the measure and public threats to Massie, Greene and others.\n \n\n   \n  But they couldn’t block it entirely. Just days earlier, Massie and Khanna secured the 218th signature on a procedural gambit, known as a discharge petition, that forced Johnson to bring the bill to the floor.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Rep. Adelita Grijalva of Arizona, who provided that final signature to advance the measure, insisted on Tuesday it was not just a Democrat or Republican push.\n \n\n   \n  “This is a demand from the nation. This is not a partisan issue,” Grijalva said.\n \n\n   \n   This headline and story have been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/science/semiyarka-bronze-age-eurasia-steppe","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"18:30:00-05:00","title":"Archaeologists May Have Uncovered a Bronze Age Metropolis in Kazakhstan’s Steppe","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Archaeologists have uncovered a previously unknown Bronze Age settlement in Kazakhstan's steppe, named Semiyarka, which spans 140 hectares and includes evidence of tin bronze metal production, a rare and technologically significant advancement in the region.

What the team discovered was an expansive area that was once replete with houses, a central monumental building, which may have been used for rituals or governance, and possibly even tin bronze metal production facilities.\n \n\n   \n  Their findings, published  Monday in the journal Antiquity , are just the beginning, the study authors said.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s very exciting, because it’s such a rare find to have tin bronze production in this area,” said lead author Miljana Radivojević, an associate professor in archaeological science at University College London, UK. “We know we have hundreds of thousands of tin bronze artifacts from the Bronze Age in the  Eurasian steppe  and we have only one published site on tin bronze production. And this is the second one.” Tin bronze allowed for sturdier tools and other materials to be made, Radivojević added.\n \n\n   \n  As the team now embarks on excavating the area, they say the continued discoveries of Semiyarka are transforming what we know about urban life in prehistoric Eurasia.\n \n\n   \n  “We just don’t have anything like this at all,” said study coauthor Dan Lawrence, a professor of archaeology at Durham University in the UK. There are hardly settlements of any kind recovered in the steppe, he added. “What you get across this landscape, we associate with mobile pastoral groups, and we think maybe they were in tents or yurts. What we’ve got here is something that’s very clearly quite different.”\n \n\n   \n  Spanning 140  hectares  (about 346 acres) above the Irtysh River valley, the large size and strategic location of the settlement may indicate that the Bronze Age steppe had sophisticated cities similar to those located in more urban areas of the world at the time, Lawrence added.\n \n\n   \n    Surveying a long-lost city\n \n\n   \n  To find the borders of the settlement, Lawrence led the team in a survey project that looked at satellite imagery and analyzed every 50-meter square across the site. They only examined the surface, finding pottery fragments, including at least 114 ceramic vessels, and other artifacts scattered across the settlement.\n \n\n   \n  The team also used imagery from  Corona spy photography  dating to the 1960s, to identify where the land had been disturbed during the last several decades, as well as magnetometry, a noninvasive survey technique that allowed the archaeologists to see buried structures and metal objects without having to excavate.\n \n\n   \n  The next step, excavations, are underway now, and Radivojević says more discoveries have already been made. “What has been published is that we had indications — we looked at the materials that were crucibles and slags and artifacts, and we could just connect them and say, well, these are the bronzes,” she said. “But then as we go, we have more discoveries, so I was more confident in talking about, say, a larger-scale production of metallurgy on the site.”\n \n\n   \n  But not everyone agrees on whether Semiyarka resembled a major city. “The results, at least those presented in the article, would suggest a strong ‘NO’ to that question, especially given the low-density pottery sherd scatter on the surface and seemingly equally low-density evidence for metallurgy,” James Johnson, an archaeologist and assistant instructional professor in anthropology at the University of Wyoming in Laramie, said in an email. Johnson, who has studied Bronze and Iron Age pastoralist societies of the Eurasian steppe, was not involved with the new research.\n \n\n   \n  “Cities are spatial and demographic entities that usually represent the complex interplay of the built environment, population density and sprawl, and material culture (as well as numerous other sociological factors),” he added. The low number of ceramic artifacts found could indicate a limited use of pottery, common among prehistoric steppe societies, and that pottery might not be “the best material culture category to connect with population density usually associated with urban populations.”\n \n\n   \n  Further research into the middens, heaps of remains that provide a glimpse into past human life, as well as surface collections beyond the settlement would help archaeologists better understand settlement patterns, Johnson said.\n \n\n   \n  While Lawrence agrees that there isn’t enough evidence to conclude that the settlement was a major city, “I also think we can’t say it is a strong no for the same reasons,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The relatively small amount of pottery remains can be attributed to the fact that the ground is undisturbed and compacted by several feet of snow every winter; many artifacts could still be underground, Lawrence noted.\n \n\n   \n  He continued: “Different things happen in urban settlements than in the rural ones. For example, in modern times you need to go to a city to get heavy industry, fancy shops or a seat of political power. I think we can say that Semiyarka is a city in the sense that it is very different from surrounding settlements and provides just those kinds of urban services.”\n \n\n   \n  Semiyarka could be evidence that the region found a balance between the typical pastoralist mobile sites and other important societal elements, such as tin bronze production, one of the most important technologies of the time, said Michael Frachetti, a professor of archaeology at Washington University in St. Louis.\n \n\n   \n  “Although the archaeological scale and function of these central places is still unfolding, the results so far open many questions about the organizational choices steppe societies made in terms of metallurgy, political organization, and economic connectivity at both local and regional scales,” Frachetti said in an email. Frachetti, who specializes in pastoralism in the Bronze Age, was also not involved with the study.\n \n\n   \n    In search of answers\n \n\n   \n  There is not a lot of evidence of settlements in the Eurasia steppe during the Bronze Age; most sites were mobile, and did not leave behind a lot of archaeological evidence, Lawrence said. However, the grasslands haven’t received much archaeological attention, he added, and it’s possible there are many settlements still left to be uncovered\n \n\n   \n  With future research, the study authors said they hope to find further evidence of Semiyarka’s potentially powerful role during the Bronze Age, as well as insight into urban life and metal production within the steppe.\n \n\n   \n  As of now, their research has revealed the outlines of at least 15 structures throughout the settlement, with a few showing evidence of being houses with internal rooms.\n \n\n   \n  How many people lived there? How long did the settlement survive? What connections did the city have to other areas? Lawrence hopes that the excavation process will turn up answers.\n \n\n   \n  “This site is super interesting because it just breaks from all the things that we thought we knew about Central Asia up to this point,” Lawrence said. “And so understanding how that got there, why that got there, and then how it connects to these much larger stories is really interesting, and it’s not something we can answer yet, but now we know the site’s there, we can start to develop a program to try and understand what it all means.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/politics/human-rights-trump-khashoggi-analysis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"20:53:00-05:00","title":"Jamal Khashoggi, and Trump’s many flippant comments on human rights","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article examines Donald Trump’s pattern of downplaying or endorsing human rights abuses by authoritarian leaders, including Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Saddam Hussein, and Belarus’s Alexander Lukashenko.

Jamal Khashoggi, and Trump’s many flippant comments on human rights \n       \n  Analysis by Aaron Blake, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:53 PM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In 2018, the  CIA under the first Trump administration concluded  that Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the gruesome murder of a US resident and journalist, Jamal Khashoggi.\n \n\n   \n  The GOP-led Senate  voted unanimously to condemn  the crown prince. One Republican senator remarked at the time that if the matter went before a jury, the crown prince “would be convicted in 30 minutes.”\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump has made it abundantly clear that he simply doesn’t care about Khashoggi’s killing all that much. But even by his standards, Trump’s  comments alongside the crown prince  on Tuesday were stunning.\n \n\n   \n  Trump went from downplaying Khashoggi’s murder to vouching for the crown prince (who has denied personal involvement).\n \n\n   \n  While Trump  previously suggested  we’d never know for sure whether the crown prince were guilty, this time he said affirmatively that Prince bin Salman “knew nothing about it.”\n \n\n   \n  While the president previously gestured suggestively at conservative talking points about Khashoggi’s past associations with Islamist movements (a past that the evidence shows  Khashoggi abandoned ), this time Trump all but said the journalist had it coming. He called Khashoggi “extremely controversial,” and said, “Whether you liked him or didn’t like him, things happen” — as if dismembering someone with a bone saw were just a fluke.\n \n\n   \n  And perhaps most strikingly, Trump rebuked a reporter for even asking about this in the crown prince’s presence.\n \n\n   \n  “You don’t have to embarrass our guest by asking a question like that,” Trump said in the Oval Office.\n \n\n   \n  Khashoggi’s widow, Hanan Elatr Khashoggi, responded to Trump’s comments by saying the journalist’s past was “not justification to murder him.”\n \n\n   \n  “Jamal was a good, transparent and brave man,” she added in comments to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Trump is hardly the first president to bow to the strategic and geopolitical importance of keeping good relations with Saudi Arabia;  presidents of both parties  have offered tough talk about the Saudis on the campaign trail and then adjusted course once in office.\n \n\n   \n  But what sets Trump apart is his almost complete lack of interest in even  pretending  that he’s factoring human rights into that equation. In fact, he opened his meeting with the crown prince on Tuesday by saying, “What he’s done is incredible, in terms of human rights and everything else.”\n \n\n   \n  And this has been a constant throughout Trump’s decade in the national spotlight.\n \n\n   \n  Here are some of his more remarkable comments on human rights and alleged human rights abusers, mostly from his first term.\n \n\n   \n    2017: Likening US conduct to Vladimir Putin’s political assassinations\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after Trump first took office, then-Fox News host Bill O’Reilly posited to him that Russian President Vladimir Putin was “a killer.”\n \n\n   \n  “There are a lot of killers,” Trump  said . “You think our country’s so innocent?”\n \n\n   \n  When Russia’s war in Ukraine began in 2022, Trump initially  praised Putin’s “genius” and “savvy”  in launching the unprovoked invasion, even as Western leaders roundly condemned it. (Trump has since said he’s “very disappointed” in the Russian leader amid the ongoing war.)\n \n\n   \n    2018: Making similar comments about North Korea’s Kim Jong Un\n \n\n   \n  When another Fox host noted that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un executed lots of people, Trump responded: “He’s a tough guy.”\n \n\n   \n  When pressed again on Kim  doing “some really bad things,”  Trump  added : “Yeah, but so have a lot of other people done some really bad things. I mean, I could go through a lot of nations where a lot of bad things were done. Now look, with all of that being said, the answer is yes.”\n \n\n   \n    2016: Praising Saddam Hussein for killing alleged terrorists without due process\n \n\n   \n  “He was a bad guy — really bad guy,” Trump, then a presidential candidate,  said  of late Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. “But you know what he did well? He killed terrorists. He did that so good. They didn’t read them the rights. They didn’t talk. They were terrorists — over.”\n \n\n   \n  In fact, Hussein killed lots of people — not just alleged terrorists — without due process. A  2002 State Department report  said he did so “because he believes that their political beliefs, faith, ethnic background, family members or acquaintances are a threat to his power.”\n \n\n   \n    2017: Praising Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte for his drug war\n \n\n   \n  Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte’s drug war featured large numbers of extrajudicial killings and was widely condemned by human rights groups.\n \n\n   \n  And not only did Trump not condemn that; he at one point during his first term praised Duterte.\n \n\n   \n  “I just wanted to congratulate you because I am hearing of the unbelievable job on the drug problem,” Trump told Duterte during an April 29, 2017, phone call,  according to a transcript  whose basic contents were confirmed by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Trump added: “Many countries have the problem, we have a problem, but what a great job you are doing, and I just wanted to call and tell you that.”\n \n\n   \n  (A senior US official said at the time that Trump was merely acknowledging the US is combating its own drug problem, not condoning violence and human rights violations.)\n \n\n   \n    2019: Allegedly encouraging China’s Uyghur detention camps\n \n\n   \n  Former Trump national security adviser John Bolton in his 2020 book recounted a scene from a G20 summit. In it, Trump and Chinese leader  Xi Jinping discussed the Chinese government’s detention camps for Uyghur Muslims in western China.\n \n\n   \n  “With only interpreters present, Xi had explained to Trump why he was basically building concentration camps in Xinjiang. According to our interpreter, Trump said that Xi should go ahead with building the camps, which Trump thought was exactly the right thing to do,” Bolton  wrote . “The National Security Council’s top Asia staffer, Matthew Pottinger, told me that Trump said something very similar during his November 2017 trip to China.”\n \n\n   \n  Then-US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer  denied the account , calling it “absolutely untrue” and “completely crazy.”\n \n\n   \n    2025: Praising Belarus’ president\n \n\n   \n  Trump  in a social media post  in August referred to the “highly respected President of Belarus, Aleksandr Lukashenko.”\n \n\n   \n  Lukashenko has long been accused of  egregious human rights abuses  and even  crimes against humanity . He has often been called  Europe’s last dictator  by foreign policy watchers.\n \n\n   \n  What’s more, Trump’s own State Department in 2020  declined to recognize Lukashenko  as the legitimate president of Belarus, citing a rigged election.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/americas/brazil-supreme-court-sentences-military-officials-lula-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"18:43:00-05:00","title":"Brazil’s Supreme Court sentences military officials for planning to kill Lula","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Brazil’s Supreme Court has sentenced nine high-ranking military officials and one federal police officer to prison terms ranging from 1 year and 11 months to 24 years for attempting a coup and plotting to kill President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Vice President Geraldo Alckmin, and Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes.

sentences military officials for planning to kill Lula \n       \n  Story by Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:43 PM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  A panel of Brazilian Supreme Court justices sentenced high-ranking military officials and a federal police officer to up to 24 years in prison on Tuesday after finding them guilty of attempting a coup and plotting to kill President  Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva  and other authorities.\n \n\n   \n  In September, the Supreme Court panel sentenced former President  Jair Bolsonaro  to 27 years and three months in prison for leading the criminal organization that sought to overturn the 2022 election, when Lula defeated Bolsonaro. At the time, the panel also sentenced other close allies who justices said formed part of the “core group.”\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, the panel convicted those accused of planning the criminal organization’s violent actions, which included a plot to kill Lula, Vice President Geraldo Alckmin and Supreme Court Justice  Alexandre de Moraes .\n \n\n   \n  Of the 10 defendants forming part of this group, nine are high-ranking military officers and one a member of the federal police.\n \n\n   \n  The four-justice panel unanimously convicted nine of them, acquitting a retired general due to insufficient evidence.\n \n\n   \n  Seven of them were convicted of attempted violent abolition of the democratic rule of law, attempted coup, participation in an armed criminal organization, aggravated damage and deterioration of listed heritage.\n \n\n   \n  Two were convicted of the less serious offences of criminal association and public incitement of animosity between the Armed Forces and constitutional authorities.\n \n\n   \n  Sentences ranged from 1 year and 11 months to 24 years, with four defendants handed down time behind bars of more than two decades.\n \n\n   \n  “Brazil, once again, due to the irresponsibility and lack of patriotism of some, flirted with and almost fell into a chasm of institutional darkness,” Justice Flávio Dino said as he cast his vote, in a reference to Brazil’s military dictatorship (1964-1985).\n \n\n   \n  “It wasn’t just a walk in the park. It was a coup that was going to arrest and kill people, revoke the constitution, citizenship and the free press.

behind schedule \n         By Scott Horsley \n        \n           Thursday, November 20, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Morning Edition \n        \n      \n\n         The Labor Department will deliver an overdue snapshot of the U.S. job market on Thursday.  It's almost seven weeks behind schedule. And because the government shutdown delayed data-gathering, there won't be another one until mid-December.   While the information in the report is a bit stale, covering the month of September, it may offer some clues about the pace of hiring and firing this fall.  It comes after a sluggish summer of job growth, when employers added fewer than 30,000 jobs a month, on average.  But if employers weren't adding a lot of new workers, they weren't handing out a lot of pink slips, either.   Federal Reserve governor Chris Waller worries that's about to change.  Waller says his conversations with business leaders show the job market is close to stalling.  \"Four to six weeks ago, we were still in this kind of no-hire/no-fire mode,\" Waller told a group of economists in London this week. \"They're starting to talk about layoffs.  They're starting to plan for them in the future.\"  Amazon recently announced 14,000 job cuts and Verizon is cutting 15,000 workers.  Waller wants the Fed to cut interest rates again when policymakers meet next month, to boost demand and prop up the labor market. But  minutes from the last Fed meeting , released on Wednesday, show considerable disagreement among central bank policymakers.  Many members of the Fed's rate-setting committee suggested it would be appropriate to hold interest rates steady for the rest of the year, noting that inflation has remained stubbornly above the Fed's 2% target. That's partly due to President Trump's tariffs. And some Fed policymakers think the import taxes will continue to put upward pressure on goods prices well into next year.  Ordinarily, the Fed would have jobs numbers for October and November in hand before its next meeting.  But because of the government shutdown, those reports won't be released until after the meeting, and some of the October data won't come out at all.  It's also uncertain when or if the October inflation report will be published. That said, Waller insists he and his colleagues are not flying blind.  They've been listening to businesses like Target and McDonald's that say many of their customers are really cautious with their spending right now. That could put more of a squeeze on the job market. \"You just go talk with firms that work with low- and middle-income households, they'll tell you point-blank, they're just not coming in the door,\" Waller said. \"And then these firms are not going to be hiring.\"  While government data on consumer spending has also been held up by the shutdown, anecdotal reports suggest only the wealthiest families are spending freely these days, buoyed in part by the gains in their stock portfolios.   Thursday's report will also provide an update on the unemployment rate. The jobless rate in August was 4.3% — up from the beginning of the year but still quite low by historical standards.   The unemployment rate is driven by two forces: the number of jobs employers want to fill and the number of workers available to fill those jobs.  The administration's crackdown on immigration has limited the number of foreign-born workers, at the same time many native-born baby boomers are retiring.  Some analysts argue that drop in the supply of workers is largely responsible for the slowdown in hiring.   Waller worries the slowdown is driven more by a declining need for workers, which could result in higher unemployment in the months to come.    \"There's definitely a reduction of supply,\" he said. \"But to me that is masking the reduction in demand and that's what I'm concerned about.\"    \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-98477","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"12:07:00+00:00","title":"What's next now that Trump has signed a bill releasing the Epstein files","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has signed a bipartisan bill requiring the Justice Department to release approximately 100,000 pages of case files related to Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, including internal communications, records of Epstein’s 2019 death, and investigations into high-profile individuals such as himself, Bill Clinton, and Prince Andrew.

Now that the bill has been signed by the president, there's a 30-day countdown for the Justice Department to produce what's commonly known as the Epstein files. \"This bill is a command for the president to be fully transparent, to come fully clean, and to provide full honesty to the American people,\" Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said Wednesday. Schumer added that Democrats were ready to push back if they perceive that the president is doing anything but adhering to \"full transparency.\" In a social media post Wednesday as he announced he had signed the bill, Trump wrote, \"Democrats have used the 'Epstein' issue, which affects them far more than the Republican Party, in order to try and distract from our AMAZING Victories.\" The swift, bipartisan work in Congress this week was a response to the growing public demand that the Epstein files be released, especially as attention focuses on his connections to global leaders including Trump, former President Bill Clinton, Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, who has already been stripped of his royal title as Prince Andrew over the matter, and many others. There is plenty of public anticipation about what more the files could reveal. Yet the bill will most likely trigger a rarely seen baring of a sprawling federal investigation, also creating the potential for unintended consequences. What does the bill do? The bill compels Attorney General Pam Bondi to release essentially everything the Justice Department has collected over multiple federal investigations into Epstein, as well as his longtime confidante and girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for luring teenage girls for the disgraced financier. Those records total around 100,000 pages, according to a federal judge who has reviewed the case. It will also compel the Justice Department to produce all its internal communications on Epstein and his associates and his 2019 death in a Manhattan jail cell as he awaited charges for sexually abusing and trafficking dozens of teenage girls. The legislation, however, exempts some parts of the case files. The bill's authors made sure to include that the Justice Department could withhold personally identifiable information of victims, child sexual abuse materials and information deemed by the administration to be classified for national defense or foreign policy. \"We will continue to follow the law with maximum transparency while protecting victims,\" Bondi told a news conference Wednesday when asked about releasing the files. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The bill also allows the Justice Department to withhold information that would jeopardize active investigations or prosecutions. That's created some worry among the bill's proponents that the department would open active investigations into people named in the Epstein files in order to shield that material from public view. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a longtime Trump loyalist who has had a prominent split with Trump over the bill, said Tuesday that she saw the administration's compliance with the bill as its \"real test.\" \"Will the Department of Justice release the files, or will it all remain tied up in investigations?\" she asked. In July, the FBI said in a memo regarding the Epstein investigation that, \"we did not uncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties.\" But Bondi last week complied with Trump's demands and ordered a federal prosecutor to investigate Epstein's ties to the president's political foes, including Clinton. Still, Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican who sponsored the bill, said \"there's no way they can have enough investigations to cover\" all of the people he believes are implicated in Epstein's abuse. \"And if they do, then good,\" he added. The bill also requires the Justice Department to produce reports on what materials it withheld, as well as redactions made, within 15 days of the release of the files. It stipulates that officials can't withhold or redact anything \"on the basis of embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity, including to any government official, public figure, or foreign dignitary.\" Who could be named? There's a widely held expectation that many people could be named in case files for investigations that spanned over a decade — and some concern that just because someone is named, that person would be assumed guilty or complicit. Epstein was a luminary who kept company with heads of state, influential political figures, academics and billionaires. The release of his emails and messages by a House Oversight Committee investigation last week has already shown his connections with — and private conversations about — Trump and many other high-powered figures. Yet federal prosecutors follow carefully constructed guidelines about what information they produce publicly and at trial, both to protect victims and to uphold the fairness of the legal system. House Speaker Mike Johnson raised objections to the bill on those grounds this week, arguing that it could reveal unwanted information on victims as well as others who were in contact with investigators. Still, Johnson did not actually try to make changes to the bill and voted for it on the House floor. For the bill's proponents, a public reckoning over the investigation is precisely the point. Some of the survivors of trafficking from Epstein and Maxwell have sought ways to name people they accuse of being complicit or involved, but fear they will face lawsuits from the men they accuse. Massie said that he wants the FBI to release the reports from its interviews with the victims. Those reports typically contain unvetted information, but Massie said he is determined to name those who are accused. He and Greene have offered to read the names of those accused on the House floor, which would shield their speech from legal consequences. \"We need names,\" Massie said. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5613427","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"The latest Epstein emails reveal the powerful people who sought his counsel","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The latest release of over 23,000 documents from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate, obtained by the House Oversight Committee, reveals extensive correspondence with powerful political figures, academics, and financial leaders, including Donald Trump, Larry Summers, Noam Chomsky, and Steve Bannon.

Reading through the text messages and emails released, the people who consulted with Epstein rarely acknowledged the severity of the crimes that required him to register as a sex offender, though simply corresponding with Epstein does not implicate individuals in his criminal activities, convicted or accused. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       There's an  apparent letter of recommendation  for Epstein from linguist Noam Chomsky, calling him a \"highly valued friend,\" that recalled how Epstein connected him with former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak — another frequent Epstein correspondent. \"Jeffrey constantly raises searching questions and puts forth provocative ideas, which have repeatedly led me to rethink crucial issues,\" the letter reads. There's advice Epstein gave to Steve Bannon, Trump's former strategist, about ways to build a far-right political movement overseas. \"If you are going to play here, you'll have to spend time, [E]urope by remote doesn't work,\" Epstein wrote in 2018. \"Lots and lots of face time and hand holding. Europe can be a wife not a mistress.\" Former Harvard University president and onetime Treasury Secretary Larry Summers is documented numerous times having intimate personal chats with Epstein, including asking for romantic advice and joking about women's intelligence. \"I yipped about inclusion,\"  wrote Summers in 2017 . \"I observed that half the IQ [in the] world was possessed by women without mentioning they are more than 51 percent of population....\" Summers resigned as Harvard's president in 2006 after arguing that women may be innately less capable in math and science. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In the week since the latest Epstein emails release, he has resigned from the board of OpenAI and  abruptly left his teaching role  at Harvard, as the university  announced a probe  of \"information concerning individuals at Harvard included in the newly released Jeffrey Epstein documents to evaluate what actions may be warranted.\" Summers isn't the only high-profile Democrat who found themself in varying degrees of Epstein's orbit. Kathryn Ruemmler, former White House counsel in the Obama administration and current chief legal officer for Goldman Sachs, messaged with Epstein before and during Trump's first term. \"Trump is living proof of the adage that it is better to be lucky than smart,\" she wrote in August 2015. \"I regret ever knowing Jeffrey Epstein,\" Ruemmler told  The Wall Street Journal  in 2023. More than a thousand mentions of Trump Trump promised to release the Epstein files on the campaign trail but largely stonewalled the effort this year since he returned to office, frequently calling the push for more transparency around the Epstein case a \"hoax\" perpetrated by Democrats. In a Wednesday Truth Social post announcing the signing of the Epstein Files Transparency Act, Trump said Democrats were using the issue to distract from what he says are victories for his administration. \"Perhaps the truth about these Democrats, and their associations with Jeffrey Epstein, will soon be revealed, because I HAVE JUST SIGNED THE BILL TO RELEASE THE EPSTEIN FILES!\" he  posted . The president has the authority to release the files without congressional action. Trump is a frequent subject of emails and text messages in the latest file tranche — well over a thousand different mentions — though mainly the subject of Epstein's near-obsession with his presidency, as the latter positioned himself as a Trump whisperer of sorts to his powerful associates. This week, after an abrupt reversal that led to the near-unanimous approval of the  Epstein Files Transparency Act , the president has now called for Democrats mentioned in Epstein's communications to be investigated by the Justice Department. \"I will be asking A.G. Pam Bondi, and the Department of Justice, together with our great patriots at the FBI, to investigate Jeffrey Epstein's involvement and relationship with Bill Clinton, Larry Summers, Reid Hoffman, J.P. Morgan, Chase, and many other people and institutions, to determine what was going on with them, and him,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. Other Republicans are going on the offensive too — highlighting revelations that Epstein was texting Democratic Del. Stacey Plaskett of the U.S. Virgin Islands during a  House Oversight Committee hearing  with Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen in 2019. Comparing the newly released messages with the video of the hearing, minutes after Epstein suggested Plaskett ask Cohen things about the Trump Organization, Plaskett posed similar questions. An effort to censure Plaskett in the House failed Tuesday. In a floor speech, Plaskett defended her actions as receiving information from a constituent and said it was \"not public knowledge at that time that he was under federal investigation.\" Amid the partisan finger-pointing around the Epstein files, some of Epstein's accusers are imploring the president not to make things partisan and focus on the other powerful people that they say haven't faced scrutiny — regardless of political party. What's next for the government's Epstein files? Within 30 days of Trump signing the Epstein Files Transparency Act, the attorney general is supposed to make \"all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials\" available in a searchable and downloadable format. That includes information that relates to Epstein, his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell and \"individuals named or referenced in connection with Epstein's criminal activities.\" There's also a focus on information regarding plea deals and decisions not to charge Epstein for other alleged crimes, as well as documents pertaining to his 2019 death by suicide in federal custody. Over the summer, the  FBI put out a memo  that said their files include \"a significant amount of material, including more than 300 gigabytes of data and physical evidence.\" Some of that includes photos and videos of Epstein's accusers, including minors, and disturbing material that will not be made public. The bill from Congress also says anything \"that would jeopardize an active federal investigation or ongoing prosecution\" can be withheld or redacted, too. With Trump's ordering of the investigation into Democrats and financial institutions mentioned in the Epstein correspondence, it is unclear how much of the Justice Department's files will be released, to what extent they will be redacted and when they ultimately will be made public. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5613429","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"18:26:00-05:00","title":"How Chicago's ICE resistance was born","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In Chicago, activists have developed a community-based resistance strategy to counter federal immigration enforcement, particularly targeting ICE agents.

In his second term, Trump has continued to push the boundaries of military involvement in domestic matters, whether it comes to addressing public safety, quelling protests or safeguarding federal buildings and personnel, including ICE agents. In response, local and state Democratic leaders have forcefully pushed back and made strides in the courts, where judges have deemed the use of military force as unnecessary or unlawful. Some judges have also expressed wariness around having the military get involved in civilian affairs. \"This principle has been foundational to the safeguarding of our fundamental liberties under the Constitution,\" U.S. District Court Judge Karin Immergut wrote in her ruling freezing Trump's deployment to Portland, Ore. earlier this month. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The latest court to push back was in Tennessee, where a judge temporarily blocked the state's use of the Guard in Memphis. That deployment was ordered by the governor at the behest of Trump. As the legal challenges mount, the Defense Department over the weekend ordered hundreds of troops in Chicago and Portland to return to their home states after federal courts stalled deployments,  NPR previously reported . Some legal and military experts view the recent events as minor setbacks for the Trump administration. But others see the court decisions as proof of checks and balances at work, at least to some degree. \"There's a pretty common theme that deploying the military into U.S. cities is not something that can be done lawlessly,\" said David Janovsky, a senior policy analyst at the Project on Government Oversight, a watchdog group. \"It is a good sign that the courts are standing up and saying that.\" Breaking down the Memphis ruling  In Tennessee, a group of Democratic lawmakers and officials filed a lawsuit against Republican Gov. Bill Lee and others, challenging the deployment of the state's National Guard. The plaintiffs argued that Memphis did not face a \"rebellion or invasion,\" which was the criteria for sending the Guard under the state's constitution. Unlike the governors of Illinois, Oregon and California, who have opposed Trump's deployment of Guard forces, the governor of Tennessee approved and directed the deployment in Memphis.  Still, on Monday, Davidson County Chancellor Patricia Head Moskal sided with the plaintiffs. In her opinion, she wrote, \"The power committed to the Governor as commander-in-chief of the Army and Militia is not unfettered.\" Benjamin R. Farley, an attorney with the National Immigration Law Center, which   was part of a coalition that provided legal representation to the plaintiffs,   said Moskal's ruling showed that the Tennessee governor does not have blanket authority to deploy troops.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"It's one more victory in a line of victories for the law against executive overreach, whether that's the president or as is the case here, the governor of Tennessee,\" he said. White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told NPR that the administration disagreed with the ruling. \"This state court judge fundamentally misunderstood the law and is attempting to act as a policy-maker, not a judge,\" she said in an email. Now, it's important to note that the pause on the deployment has not taken effect, as the chancellor gave the state a few days to appeal. In a statement, Lee spokesperson Elizabeth Lane Johnson said the state will appeal and the Guard will continue to operate in the city. \"Memphians know their city is facing a violent crime emergency that the state must address, and we're confident higher courts will ultimately recognize this as well,\" she said. Janovsky from the Project on Government Oversight said allowing the Guard operations to continue is one way the courts tend to fall short. \"That sort of misreads the stakes of the situation,\" he said. \"If it is presumptively illegal to have troops on the streets, it seems completely backwards to let the troops stay on the street until there's a final determination.\" As federal courts block troop deployments, will SCOTUS have final say? A Defense Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, told NPR that the holidays may have influenced the decision to  withdraw out-of-state troops from Illinois and Oregon  in the coming days. But retired Maj. Gen. William Enyart, who led the Illinois National Guard from 2007 to 2012, believes the federal courts, which have repeatedly blocked the deployments in Chicago and Portland from moving forward, also played a role. \"This shows the relative strength of the system and of the founding fathers in designing that system, where we had a separation of powers as well as a balancing of powers,\" he added. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The Trump administration is challenging the rulings that block the use of troops and in the case over the deployment in Chicago, the administration has asked the Supreme Court to weigh in. Some legal experts say it could have a ripple effect — to a degree — depending on how broadly the justices rule. \"The more broadly they construe their opinion, the more broad of an effect we're going to see,\" said Chris Mirasola, a national security law professor at the University of Houston Law Center. Even as debates over the mobilizations play out in various courts, Trump has  suggested sending troops  to about half a dozen other cities, and warned of invoking the Insurrection Act to pave the way. Mirasola said there are limits to how much the courts can restrict the president's use of the military, and ultimately the public serves as a stronger check on power. \"It's always going to be public sentiment that I think is especially consequential,\" he said. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5584087","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-05:00","title":"This Frida Kahlo Painting Could Break Records at Auction on Thursday","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 1940 self-portrait by Frida Kahlo, titled *El sueño (La cama)*, is set to be auctioned by Sotheby's in New York on Thursday, November 19, 2025.

Surrealist women artists are currently  in vogue among collectors , and Kahlo is among a small handful of superstar artists with a seemingly bulletproof brand — think Andy Warhol, Jean-Michel Basquiat and Gustav Klimt. A Klimt painting auctioned by Sotheby's on Tuesday sold for $236.4 million, making it the second-most expensive painting ever auctioned. Kahlo's mystique erupts in part from her psychologically complex self-portraits that focus on her disabilities, her politics, her heritage and her deep connection to the world shimmering around her. \"Her paintings tell stories — intimate, engaging, terrifying and tragic ones,\" wrote art historian Sharyn R. Udall in her 2003 article,  \"Frida Kahlo's Mexican Body: History, Identity and Artistic Aspiration,\"  published in  Woman's Art Journal.  \"When Kahlo looked into death's dark mirror, she saw herself. In the act of painting and in the resulting canvases, she documented her own attempts to survive pain, to make sense of it, to act out through images layered with irony, fantasy and allegory. Her work is searingly candid, overlaid with the unreality of an endless nightmare.\" And her work seems to only grow in power. Just within the past year, more than a dozen museums around the world exhibited shows dedicated to Kahlo. An  immersive experience  that brought audiences inside some of them has been traveling internationally. The Museum of Fine Arts in Houston will soon open a vast retrospective called  Frida: The Making of an Icon.  It's scheduled to transfer to the Tate Modern in London next June. And a new Frida Kahlo museum that explores the artist's early life opened in Kahlo's neighborhood in Mexico City in September. It's the third museum that centers Kahlo's life and art in the city. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5612585","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"06:00:00Z","title":"Wicked: For Good – This all could've been just one good movie","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reviews 'Wicked: For Good', the sequel film to 'Wicked: Part I', which expands on the second act of the Broadway musical.

Our national nightmare — the year-long wait between Jon M. Chu's   Wicked: Part I   and  Wicked: For Good  — has finally come to an end.  When we last left  Chu's splashy, long-awaited adaptation of the Broadway musical juggernaut, green emo outcast Elphaba, soon to be known as the Wicked Witch of the West (Cynthia Erivo), had been radicalized by the discovery that the revered Wizard of Oz (Jeff Goldblum) is a magicless fraud and oppressor of animals; she thus committed to  defying gravity  and becoming a broomstick-riding outlaw. Her polar-opposite enemy-turned-bestie Glinda (Ariana Grande) declined to take up the cause but wished Elphaba well. Songs were belted, hearts were broken, blonde hair was tossed, and since then, the real world we're all existing in only grew more chaotic and distressingly parallel to that of the one depicted in Oz. Wicked: For Good  is based on the show's second act, and ever since it was announced that the two hour and 45-minute production (including intermission) would be sprawled across two separate films totaling an approximate five-hour runtime, people like me have wondered,  What's the (non-capitalistic) point of that?  Having now seen  For Good , I can attest there isn't a point, or at least not a wholly convincing one. This installment is far from a total misfire — thank goodness Erivo and Grande are such captivating performers perfectly-suited to these roles — but the over-padding and stuffing meant to justify this bifurcated packaging soon becomes readily apparent. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       First, however, it starts off with a bang: The exciting opening sequence touches down upon the vast open landscape outside the metropolis of Oz, as the Wizard's human lackeys are forcing animals to do the brutal labor of building his precious yellow brick road; suddenly, Elphaba appears out of the sky like a superhero and wields her mighty powers to disrupt the abuse and send a message. The Wizard's press secretary Madame Morrible (Michelle Yeoh, tasked again with trying to sing, to limited results) has pulled out all the stops to spread hateful propaganda about Elphaba to the people of Oz, and the people are buying it wholesale. A willfully ignorant Glinda is now the bubbly spokesperson for the Wizard's regime, keeping the lie about his wizarding credentials alive. And the formerly apathetic Fiyero ( Sexiest Man Alive  Jonathan Bailey) is now a reluctant guardsman arranged to marry Glinda, even though his heart and political sympathies remain with Elphaba. A lot happens over the next two-plus hours, including the story coinciding with the arrival of that girl from Kansas (glimpsed a few times here, but as far as I can remember, not heard), and it's entertaining enough. The highest notes carry over from  Part 1 , as Erivo and Grande are electric every time they share screentime — their big comical fight, which takes place immediately after a devastating cyclone of events, elicited rapturous engagement from the audience at my screening. And their duet \"For Good\" remains the Act II apex, a stirring meeting of the minds and declaration of friendship, even if lyricist Stephen Schwartz's prose leans toward clunk. (Two decades later, I'm still scratching my head at \" Like a seed dropped by a skybird  /  In a distant wood .\" Huh???) If  For Good  doesn't soar quite as consistently as  Part 1 , this is at least partially by design. A song from the original show like the Wizard's vaudevillian ditty \"Wonderful\" — a more sinister retread of Glinda's far superior ode to the benefits of self-mythologizing, \"Popular\" — can't come close to matching Act I's abundance of bangers. (And unfortunately, the two new songs added here, Elphaba's \"No Place Like Home\" and Glinda's \"The Girl in the Bubble,\" add little beyond runtime.) Act II is also where the show's politics become indecipherable, or — to put it less generously — noncommittal. The story aims to challenge perceptions of what makes someone \"good\" or \"bad,\" but unlike its source material, Gregory Maguire's revisionist novel  Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West , the new movie sands down those provocations to make certain characters more sympathetic than they are. But within the landscape of movie musicals, especially more recent examples, both  Wicked  movies serve as a triumph and tribute to creative fortitude. We've all laughed (and cringed) a lot about Erivo and Grande's peculiar antics throughout this never-ending publicity cycle, but there's something heartwarming about their deep commitment to the spirit of the material. Whatever your feelings about it, this is clearly a spectacle that's been made with love, and that's all for the better. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-98482","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"13:48:00-05:00","title":"U.S. Rep.

Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick of Florida has been indicted on charges accusing her of stealing $5 million in federal disaster funds and using some of the money to aid her 2021 campaign, the Justice Department said Wednesday. The Democrat is accused of stealing Federal Emergency Management Agency overpayments that her family health care company had received through a federally funded COVID-19 vaccination staffing contract, federal prosecutors said. A portion of the money was then funneled to support her campaign through candidate contributions, prosecutors allege. \"Using disaster relief funds for self-enrichment is a particularly selfish, cynical crime,\" Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement. \"No one is above the law, least of all powerful people who rob taxpayers for personal gain. We will follow the facts in this case and deliver justice.\" A phone message left at Cherfilus-McCormick's Washington office was not immediately returned. Cherfilus-McCormick was first elected to Congress in 2022 in the 20th District, representing parts of Broward and Palm Beach counties, in a special election after Rep. Alcee Hastings died in 2021. In December 2024, a Florida state agency sued a company owned by Cherfilus-McCormick's family, saying it overcharged the state by nearly $5.8 million for work done during the pandemic and wouldn't give the money back. The Florida Division of Emergency Management said it made a series of overpayments to Trinity Healthcare Services after hiring it in 2021 to register people for COVID-19 vaccinations. The agency says it discovered the problem after a single $5 million overpayment drew attention. Cherfilus-McCormick was the CEO of Trinity at the time. The Office of Congressional Ethics said in a January report that Cherfilus-McCormick's income in 2021 was more than $6 million higher than in 2020, driven by nearly $5.75 million in consulting and profit-sharing fees received from Trinity Healthcare Services. In July, the House Ethics Committee unanimously voted to reauthorize an investigative subcommittee to examine allegations involving Cherfilus-McCormick. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5611148","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"05:15:00-05:00","title":"Eating just a handful of plastic can be fatal for marine animals, a study finds","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reveals that even small amounts of plastic—such as six pea-sized pieces for seabirds, two baseballs for sea turtles, or a soccer ball’s worth for seals and dolphins—can be fatal to marine animals.

Balloons. Grocery bags. Every day, the equivalent of 2,000 full garbage trucks worth of plastic gets dumped in the world's oceans. Scientists have long known that plastic waste is harmful to marine life. A new study, published in the journal  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , shows much plastic a marine animal has to eat for it to be lethal. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"What surprised me the most is how little it takes to become deadly,\" said Britta Baechler, a co-author of the study and director of Ocean Plastics Research at the Ocean Conservancy. Less than three sugar cubes' worth of plastic could kill an Atlantic puffin. Two baseballs' worth would do in a sea turtle. The equivalent of a soccer ball is enough to off a seal or dolphin. \"For seabirds, ingesting just six tiny pieces of rubber, each smaller than about the size of a pea, can result in a 90 percent chance of death,\" Baechler said. To determine the amounts and the kinds of plastic that marine animals were eating, researchers compiled the autopsy data of more than 10,000 deceased animals from 53 studies that had been conducted around the world. Among the victims: an albatross with an entire plastic bottle in its digestive tract. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"In another instance, there was a sperm whale that had died from eating an entire bucket that broken up in its gut and caused an obstruction,\" Baechler said. The study focused on macroplastics, debris that can be seen with the naked eye. It didn't look at microplastics, which can be microscopic and have been found even in  the deepest parts  of the ocean. Nor did it look at  entanglements , the other primary way plastics impact marine animals. Greg Merrill, a researcher who focuses on plastics and marine animals and wasn't involved in the study, said scientists have known for years that marine animals are eating plastic, often because it looks like their natural food. \"Like if you are a sea turtle, for example, and you eat jellyfish, a plastic grocery bag is pretty similar,\" he said. \"It's fluid. It's not got a lot going on with it.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       He published a study last year that found whales, which use sonar to prey on food in the blackness of the deep ocean, can even be confused by plastic. The acoustic signature — the strength of the echo — a whale would hear coming off of a piece of plastic waste  was similar  to what they'd hear coming off of their natural prey. \"So it kind of suggested that perhaps they're mistaking their acoustic cues and ingesting plastic that way,\" he said.

\n        \n           Thursday, November 20, 2025 • 6:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         A nonprofit children's safety organization, Fairplay, is urging gift givers to avoid buying AI toys for children this holiday season, according to an  advisory  issued on Thursday. Fairplay, along with other child and consumer advocacy groups, say these toys – playthings like plushies, dolls, action figures, and kids' robots embedded with chatbots and other artificial intelligence technologies – can be dangerous. Designed to mimic human behaviors and interact with kids as if they were friends, the toys offer novelty at a time when AI is starting to infiltrate many corners of peoples' lives. Fairplay's advisory, headlined \"AI Toys are NOT safe for kids,\" says these toys prey on children's trust and disrupt human relationships, among other harms. The advisory was endorsed by more than 150 experts and groups including MIT professor and author Sherry Turkle, pediatrician and researcher Jenny Radesky, Social Media Victims Law Center, and International Play Association USA. \"It's ridiculous to expect young children to avoid potential harm here,\" said Rachel Franz, a Fairplay program director, in a statement to NPR. \"Young children are especially susceptible to the potential harms of these toys, such as invading their privacy, collecting data, engendering false trust and friendship, and displacing what they need to thrive, like human-to-human interactions and time to play with all their senses. These can have long and short-term impacts on development.\" Others share concerns The advisory follows similar recent warnings from the Public Interest Research Group (PIRG). The consumer rights nonprofit's 40th annual \"Trouble in Toyland\"  report  says some AI toys enable in-depth talk about sexually explicit topics, have few parental controls, and collect a mountain of data about their underage owners. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"All of them are collecting your child's voices, potentially. They're collecting their names, their dates of birth. All kinds of information – the kid's likes, dislikes, favorite toys, favorite friends,\" said Teresa Murray, co-author of the PIRG report and director of its consumer watchdog program, in an  interview  with NPR. \"Because they're connected to the internet, so anything is available, who knows what those toys might start talking to your children about with their friends or their friends' parents or your neighborhood? I mean, it's terrifying.\" Toy industry and AI players highlight safety and privacy The toy industry and AI companies are responding to such fears by highlighting their focus on safety and privacy. OpenAI said it suspended the maker of the AI-powered teddy bear Kumma earlier this week, after  PIRG reported  the toy was sharing questionable advice with minors, such as providing details about how to find and ignite matches. When prompted by researchers, it also talked in-depth about sexual matters. \"We suspended this developer [the Singapore-based toymaker FoloToy] for violating our policies,\" OpenAI spokesperson Gaby Raila said in an email to NPR. \"Our usage policies prohibit any use of our services to exploit, endanger, or sexualize anyone under 18 years old. These rules apply to every developer using our API, and we monitor and enforce them to ensure our services are not used to harm minors.\"    The company's technologies are also embedded in other AI toys including the AI robot pet Loona, and it entered into a  strategic partnership  with Mattel earlier this year \"to support AI-powered products and experiences based on Mattel's brands.\" No products have yet been announced. But the company said the initial set of Mattel products and experiences will focus on families and older customers, not users under 13. Fairplay singled out several AI toys to demonstrate the potential risks of data collection and the impact on a child's understanding of trust. Among them are  Miko , a cute plastic robot that comes with educational games and the tagline \"Built to be your new best friend,\"  Loona Petbot , a small, plastic robot companion that moves around on wheels and has a screen and ear-like, and  Gabbo , a cube-shaped robot plushy with big anime-style eyes. It has no screen, but can be connected to wifi and do voice chat. NPR has reached out to the makers of these products for comment. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"Children's safety is our top priority,\" said Curio, the company behind Gabbo and other AI playthings, in a statement to NPR. \"Our guardrails are meticulously designed to protect kids, and we encourage parents to monitor conversations, track insights, and choose the controls that work best for their family on the Curio: Interactive Toys app.\" \"Facial recognition on Miko 3 is entirely optional and exists solely to help families enjoy a more personalized and interactive experience,\" said Ritvik Sharma, a senior vice president at Miko.ai, in an email to NPR. \"Importantly, all visual data is processed locally on the device. It is never sent to the cloud or shared externally. To offer families greater confidence and control, every Miko robot includes a physical camera shutter that allows parents to completely block the camera whenever they choose.\" In an email to NPR, The Toy Association, which represents toy manufacturers, said toys sold by responsible manufacturers and retailers must adhere to more than 100 strict federal safety standards and tests, including the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, which governs children's privacy and data security online and is overseen by the Federal Trade Commission. \"The Toy Association urges parents and caregivers to shop only from reputable toymakers, brands, and retailers who prioritize children's safety above all else,\" the statement said, adding that it offers  safety tips for A.I. and other connected products  to better inform peoples' buying decisions. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5522341","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"She Cares for Her Aging Parents Full Time.

cares for her aging parents full time. That requires taking care of herself, too \n         By Juana Summers, Alejandra Marquez Janse, Sarah Handel \n        \n           Thursday, November 20, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         At age 43, Dawnita Brown made a life-changing pivot. She took leave from her secure government job, winnowed down her possessions, resolved her financial responsibilities, and in 2016, signed up for the Peace Corps. Volunteering in Eswatini was \"amazing,\" she says — so much so that she planned to extend her time abroad in a paid position with the Peace Corps after her service ended. She didn't know she was about to make another pivot. In 2018, her mom, Joan Cain, had a stroke in her brain stem. Brown rushed home to Baltimore, preparing herself to say goodbye. Instead, her mom recovered, but with a challenging prognosis. \"So, I became her proxy,\" Brown says, and she stayed by Cain's side through rehabilitation and nursing facilities. Eventually, concerns about the quality of her mother's care led Brown to step away from her job, take her mom home and care for her herself, full time. A huge number of today's 65-year-olds — more than  two-thirds  — will likely need some kind of long-term care as they age, whether it's in-home care, assisted living or a nursing home. Those services can  easily  cost more each year  than what the  average American  makes. And health insurers — both government and private — may not provide the necessary coverage. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       That leaves many people to rely on unpaid family caregivers whose care  AARP valued at $600 billion  in 2021. That's more than half a trillion dollars worth of work done by people like Dawnita Brown. As a household, Brown makes caregiving financially feasible through a patchwork of coverage, including Medicare, supplemental insurance and her mom's pension. And she's debt free thanks to the work she put in readying herself for the Peace Corps. \"I haven't had a steady income in almost 10 years,\" says Brown. \"I haven't paid into retirement. But I don't want for anything.\" 'It's a gift' Brown's   home is warm and inviting, much like herself. The brick row house is tastefully appointed with meaningful family artifacts and photographs, meticulously clean without feeling sterile. On the day we visited, Brown had just returned from taking her dad, Bill Lee Brown, to physical therapy. She cares for him, too. Although Bill and Joan are not a couple, he moved into the home in 2024 after complications from his multiple myeloma diagnosis made it hard for him to live alone. So, while her mom's upstairs, her dad is downstairs. Between them, doing countless flights of stairs a day, Dawnita Brown is holding it all together. Meting out prescriptions, preparing meals, scheduling appointments and calling for help when it's more than one person can handle. Caregiving is a role she didn't expect, but one she has leaned all the way into. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In 2021, Brown founded a community for fellow caregivers called the  Binti Circle . The name comes from the word for daughter in Swahili. \"I started Binti because it was the community I needed and did not have,\" she says. They meet monthly, have outings and events, all with the goal of making a difference in the lives of caregivers, reducing stress and providing safety in community. That way, Brown says, \"you have more skills and tools that you need for this gift of caregiving, because it's a gift to be able to care for your parent, even though it's hard.\" She says it was especially important to her to focus on Black daughters in caregiving roles. \"The daughter holds it together,\" says Brown, even in difficult situations. \"Looking at the fragility of your parent, processing the grief of losing the parent that you knew … that your mom doesn't know you.\" She adds, \"and you know what's even more challenging are those daughters that are caring for parents that did not parent them.\" In the Binti Circle, she has gathered \"a community of daughters that understand and can empathize, with no judgment.\" One of Binti's — and Brown's — core values is the importance of respite for caregivers. \"You know, most people think about self-care as nails and hair and massages,\" she says. Brown does those things, but taking care of herself also  includes regular doctor's appointments and therapy, and simpler things, too. \"It's breathing, just sometimes laying in my bed and breathing. And my devotionals, I always set the tone before I get out of bed.\" And as positive and motivated as Brown is, she does feel down sometimes. \"Yesterday I was feeling kind of yucky,\" she says. \"And so I got up and I found a … 'boost your mood' yoga workout.\" She has also built herself her own little getaway at home — an outdoor deck space furnished with thrifted and upcycled finds, succulents and a fire pit. She calls it her oasis. \"You are responsible for people,\" says Brown, so, \"if you're no good, they're no good. And so, that's why I work very hard to take care of myself.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5612509","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"17:59:00-05:00","title":"Teens and former child actors weigh in online after Megyn Kelly comments","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In response to Megyn Kelly’s controversial comments on her podcast suggesting Jeffrey Epstein was interested in '15-year-old girls' rather than pedophiles, a wave of public backlash emerged from former child actors and teenage girls, who shared photos of themselves at ages 15 and younger to assert that minors are still children and that underage sexual activity is illegal.

Teens and former child actors weigh in online after Megyn Kelly comments \n         By Ivy Buck, Alina Edwards \n        \n           Tuesday, November 18, 2025 • 5:59 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Former child actresses, as well as teenage girls around the country, have posted photos of themselves at 15 years old after journalist Megyn Kelly seemed to downplay the youth of Jeffrey Epstein's victims on her podcast. In a  discussion  with NewsNation host Batya Ungar-Sargon on \"The Megyn Kelly Show\" on Nov. 12, Kelly stated that she knows \"somebody very close to this case\" who \"told me from the start [...] that Jeffrey Epstein, in this person's view, was not a pedophile.\" \"He was into the barely legal type, like, he liked 15-year-old girls,\" Kelly continued. \"I'm not trying to make an excuse for this, I'm just giving you facts — that he wasn't into, like, 8-year-olds. But he liked the very young teen types that could pass for even younger than they were, but would look legal to a passer-by.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The age of consent in the United States ranges from 16 to 18 years old, depending on the state. It is not legal for an adult to engage in sexual activity with a girl below 16 years old in any U.S. state. NPR has reached out to Megyn Kelly for comment. NPR will update this story if we receive a response from Kelly. Women and girls react to Kelly online Many on social media were prompted to insist that 15 year olds are children. Actress and activist Cynthia Nixon weighed in on  Instagram : \"Megyn Kelly, I have a question for you, from one mother to another,\" she said. \"If Jeffrey Epstein were still alive, would you be comfortable with your teenage daughter being alone with him in his mansion? [...] And please, don't say 15 is barely legal. It is 100% illegal, and you know that.\" She was joined by celebrities who were former child actors, like Christina Ricci. On her Instagram story, Ricci posted, \"This woman is a danger to children.\" That Instagram story has since expired and is no longer online. Valerie Bertinelli, who starred in the sitcom  One Day at a Time,   shared  a picture of herself at 15, with the caption: \"This picture was taken in 1975. I'm 15. I'm a child. I'm gonna say this a little louder for those in the back row. I'm FIFTEEN. I'M A CHILD.\" She ended with a call to action, encouraging others to \"flood the Internet with pictures of all of us at 15.\" The Hollywood actresses were joined by actual teenagers, including a girl who posted a  TikTok video  from an account called @cheeringforchange and said her name is Eloise and that she is 14 years old. She said she wanted to respond to Kelly's comments with a \"reality check from a literal child.\" \"The minute adults start defending predators by debating the age of a child, you're not protecting the truth. You're protecting the predator. And you shouldn't need a freshman to tell you that.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Survivors advocating for the release of the Epstein files Some of Epstein's survivors who are now adults but say they were 17 or younger when they were abused have taken leading roles in pressuring both President Trump and Congress to release the full Department of Justice files on Epstein. On Tuesday, eight of them posted a \" national PSA ,\" which called for the release of all of the Epstein files. This was done in partnership with  World Without Exploitation , a national coalition of organizations working to end human trafficking. After showing photos of the women at ages 14 to 17, the video ends with a call for justice: \"It's time to bring the secrets out of the shadows. It's time to shine a light into the darkness.\" On World Without Exploitation's website, it urges Americans to call on members of Congress to vote for the Epstein Files Transparency Act: \"By mandating the release of these files—while safeguarding the privacy of survivors—the legislation seeks to shed light on the enablers, co-conspirators, and institutional protections that allowed Epstein's operation to flourish. It aims to close loopholes that obstruct justice and ensure that no one, regardless of wealth or power, is above the law.\" The response to Kelly's comments preceded the  nearly unanimous vote in the House of Representatives  to publicly release the full slate of the Department of Justice files on Epstein's child sex trafficking. The President,  in a reversal of position , had previously stated he would sign it if it passed the House and Senate.

Discovery is up for sale has Hollywood buzzing.   The legendary film studio, which has grown to include streaming services and cable channels, is currently accepting non-binding bids until Thursday. According to company spokesperson Robert Gibbs, they expect to have a decision about the sale by Christmas. It's become something of a Hollywood parlor game to guess who will ultimately take over   the business, which was  founded in 1923 by four brothers : Harry, Albert, Sam and Jack Warner. They owned a movie theater in Pennsylvania before coming to Hollywood to make movies. Warner Brothers Pictures found one of its first silent picture stars in a German shepherd named Rin Tin Tin. By 1927, the studio made history with its feature-length \"talkie\" picture:  The Jazz Singer,  starring Al Jolson. Over the years, Warner Brothers has made or distributed countless iconic films including:  Casablanca, The Big Sleep  and  The Maltese Falcon  in the 1940's .  The list goes on, with titles like  A Clockwork Orange ,  Goodfellas, Barbie,  as well as Bugs Bunny and all the Looney Tunes cartoons. Warners Brothers has had multiple owners over the decades. Three years ago, Warner Media, as it was called, merged with Discovery.

The legendary film studio, which has grown into streaming services and cable channels, is accepting bids until this Thursday, according to reports. It's become something of a parlor game, though, to guess who will ultimately buy the house that Jack Warner built, and theater owners are watching closely. Here's NPR's Mandalit del Barco. (SOUNDBITE OF CARY GRANT'S \"OPENING/END TITLE FROM 'ARSENIC AND OLD LACE'\") MANDALIT DEL BARCO, BYLINE: Warner Brothers has been in business since 1923, founded by four brothers, Harry, Albert Sam, and Jack Warner. They owned a movie theater in Pennsylvania before coming to Hollywood to make movies. Warner Brothers Pictures found one of its first silent picture stars in a German shepherd named Rin Tin Tin. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"THE JAZZ SINGER\") AL JOLSON: (As Jakie Rabinowitz) Wait a minute. You ain't heard nothing yet. DEL BARCO: And in 1927, the studio made history with its feature-length talkie picture, \"The Jazz Singer,\" starring Al Jolson. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"THE JAZZ SINGER\") JOLSON: (As Jakie Rabinowitz, singing) Toot, toot, tootsie. Goodbye. DEL BARCO: Over the years, Warner Brothers has made so many iconic films, including \"Casablanca.\" (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"CASABLANCA\") HUMPHREY BOGART: (As Rick Blaine) Here's looking at you, kid.

DEL BARCO: Over the decades, Warner Brothers had several owners. Three years ago, Warner Media, as it was called, merged with Discovery, and last June, the company announced it would split into two, with film, TV and streaming studios on one side and on the other side, mostly legacy cable channels, including CNN. The split hasn't happened, and a new buyer might get the entirety of Warner Brothers Discovery. As the film industry continues to consolidate, there's speculation that Warner Brothers old rival, Paramount, could take over. Having just merged as Paramount Skydance, CEO David Ellison has already made several overtures. The idea of streaming giant Netflix buying the company has raised antitrust concerns on Capitol Hill.

DANIEL LORIA: As long as we have more movies - that doesn't mean the same amount, that doesn't mean less, but more movies - I think you're going to find folks in the movie theater industry support any business decision that gets us there. DEL BARCO: That's Daniel Loria, senior vice president at the Boxoffice Company, which analyzes data from studios and theaters. He says when Disney purchased Fox and Fox Searchlight, their combined studios significantly reduced the number of films they released in the theaters. That's a problem for theater owners who have been struggling to bring audiences back to cinemas after the COVID-19 pandemic shut them down. They're competing with movie watching on TVs, computers and cellphones, and some fear studios will only greenlight a few big-budget blockbusters. Max Friend is the CEO of Filmbot, the ticketing platform for independent cinemas in the U.S. MAX FRIEND: The concern is that we're going to see less of that risk-taking, less of that experimentation and less of that embracing new directors, new filmmakers in the future.

President Trump has decided that the U.S. will completely boycott the conference over what he considers the discriminatory treatment of Afrikaners by the South African government. They are the largest subset of the country's white minority, and Afrikaners ran South Africa's government for much of the 20th century and famously oversaw the racist system of apartheid until 1994. Trump has  repeated false claims  that the South African government is stealing land from white farmers and that there is an ongoing \"white genocide\" and \"extermination\" of Afrikaners, even taking the unprecedented step of offering refugee status to Afrikaners who want to flee. The first 59 Afrikaner refugees  arrived in the U.S.  in May. South African officials — including President Cyril Ramaphosa — have said Trump's claims are untrue and point to official government data showing that attacks against rural Afrikaners are rare, and that the country's Black majority bear the brunt of South Africa's rampant crime. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Lindie Koorts, a historian at the University of Pretoria, said the false narrative has strained some of the progress made in post-apartheid South Africa, as Afrikaners whose ancestors perpetrated apartheid adjust to being a political minority. \"This is a minority that used to be protected by apartheid laws\" who now don't have the same job security and other economic benefits, said Koorts, who is an Afrikaner. \"It turns into something of existential dread, and that is very, very easily manipulated by the right wing.\" Here's what to know about the history of the Afrikaners. Who are Afrikaners? Afrikaners descend from colonists of mostly Dutch but also German and French origin who landed on the tip of Africa in the 17th century. Many passed through the  resupply station established  by the Dutch East India Company in present-day Cape Town, an ideal midpoint along the sea routes between Europe and Asia. Some Afrikaners later moved inland to form large farming colonies as their population grew on the continent. They also became known as Boers, which translates to \"farmers.\" Disputes between British colonists and the Boer settlers who spoke Afrikaans led to the  Boer War , which occurred at the turn of the century. The British forces won, but Afrikaners remained the majority of South Africa's white population after the war and gained control of South Africa's government in the early 20th century. In 1948, the Afrikaner-led government began to implement apartheid, a system of institutionalized racial segregation that benefited whites. Black people and other non-white South Africans were displaced and dispossessed. Apartheid ended in 1994 with the formation of a new, democratic government led by anti-apartheid activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner Nelson Mandela. Apartheid helped consolidate wealth among several generations of South Africa's white minority, but its fall stripped them of their political power and has shifted race relations in the country, said Daniel Magaziner, a professor of African history at Yale University. \"Afrikaners — as white people — do quite well since 1994, but they do lose their political privileges, and so there is a rise in a sense of grievance and nostalgia for what has been lost since they lost their political control over the territory,\" he said. Magaziner said there remains in South Africa a strong cultural association of Afrikaners with farming, even though most Afrikaners now live in the suburbs or urban areas. \"But this idea that they're being targeted on farms is something that has a very big afterlife and is one of the reasons the Trump administration claims that these are people worthy — uniquely worthy — of being granted refugee status,\" he said. Some Afrikaners say they're facing discrimination Some Afrikaners say they are at risk of having their land stripped away or even facing physical violence and death because they are white, a claim that's been widely disputed by other Afrikaners, South African officials and Ramaphosa. Right-wing South African groups such as AfriForum  have attacked  a new federal land expropriation law, which replaces another law from the apartheid era. Critics say the new law lets the government take land from private citizens without compensation. Under the law , the government can only seize land without paying for it in limited circumstances, such as if the land is not in use. The government must also first attempt to strike a deal with the owner. Most commercial farmland in South Africa is still owned by the country's white minority, who make up about 8% of the population. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       AfriForum has also claimed there are widespread murders of white Afrikaner farmers, which it says law enforcement is doing too little to combat, though South Africa's government denies this.   And the group has slammed  politicians who've continued to sing  the apartheid-era song, \"Kill the Boer,\" something Ramaphosa said does not represent the policy of the government. AfriForum CEO  Kallie Kriel told Newzroom Afrika  that he wanted the South African government to condemn the song and recognize \"that we are seeing tortures that accompany these murders and declare it a priority crime.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The claims have been boosted by some of Trump's allies in the U.S., including Elon Musk, who is from South Africa. In a  dramatic Oval Office meeting  in May, Trump surprised Ramaphosa with a video montage and news clippings showing what Trump claimed was widespread violence and discrimination against white farmers. \"You do allow them to take land — when they take the land, they kill the white farmer, and when they kill the white farmer, nothing happens to them,\" Trump said to Ramaphosa, who immediately disputed it. This year the Trump administration began offering refugee status to Afrikaners, even as the administration  cut the total number of refugees it would admit  to an all-time low. How South Africa is responding to claims of discrimination against whites Ramaphosa and other South African officials say attacks on farming communities are rare. National police data shows that there were  six murders on farms  in South Africa during the first three months of this year. Most crime victims in South Africa  are Black  — not white — officials say. Of the six farm murders from January to March,  five of the victims were Black  and one was white. South Africa's police minister  said earlier this year  that farm murders have a history of being \"distorted and reported in an unbalanced way.\" Many Afrikaners  have also disputed the idea  that they're being persecuted. A number of Afrikaner journalists, professors and others  signed a public petition , saying they rejected the idea that Afrikaners were \"victims of racial persecution in post-apartheid South Africa\" and didn't want to be \"pawns\" for American politicians. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The group said South Africans of all races were facing a slew of problems. \"To cherry-pick white suffering and elevate it above others is dishonest and harmful,\" the petition reads. \"It feeds extremist ideologies that perpetuate division and have inspired real-world violence, including mass shootings.\" Koorts, one of the signatories, said the allegations of a \"white genocide\" are not true and that Afrikaners have had to do a lot of work to reckon with the violent and racist history of apartheid. \"What we now see is our story being taken out of context, being twisted for an American audience to make Americans fearful of multiculturalism, of multiracialism, of making Americans fearful of essentially becoming a white minority,\" she said. \"Don't. Please don't. That is not our story. That is a twisted version of our story.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5246286","dateOfPublication":"2025-02-27","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-05:00","title":"Curious about exploring your spirituality?

  Curious about exploring your spirituality? Ask yourself these 4 questions \n         By Ruth Tam \n        \n           Thursday, February 27, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         When Gwen Vogelzang was struggling with the pain and grief of infertility, she longed for spiritual comfort to help her \"stay centered and not spiral,\" she says. But she wasn't sure where to find it. As she became a parent through adoption, the challenges she faced advocating for her neurodiverse kids made her feel alienated from her religious community. Finding a new and lasting church community proved difficult after a cross-country move   and a pandemic. As parenting continued to test her in new ways, Vogelzang, who is based in Grand Rapids, Mich., began forming her own spiritual rituals. To stay grounded, she focused on being present while doing everyday tasks, like washing the dishes. To feel connected, she paid attention to the natural world, like the birds outside her window. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \" Spirituality to me is being able to sit in my sunroom and feel the sun on my face and a sense of calm because my ego is not in charge,\" she says. Your spiritual practices are a deeply personal endeavor that you have the agency to personalize, says  Aizaiah Yong , an associate professor of spirituality at the Claremont School of Theology. That's because spiritual rituals, including religious ones, are \"living, not a closed loop,\" Yong says. \"We get to add or change them to bring meaning to our lives.\" Whether you already believe in a particular faith or are trying to tap into your spirituality outside religion, these questions can help you create your own spiritual practices. Grab a pen and a notebook and settle into a cozy nook to answer these prompts. Question 1: What does \"something greater\" mean to you?  Although spirituality can be experienced in different ways, spirituality is often defined as a personal connection between you and \"something greater than yourself,\" says psychiatrist  Anna Yusim , author of  Fulfilled: How the Science of Spirituality Can Help You Live a Happier, More Meaningful Life . So, consider what that \"something greater\" is to you. \"For some people, that's God; for others, it's collective consciousness or values like faith, love, trust and perseverance,\" Yusim says. This means that spirituality can be felt by both religious and non-religious people. You might believe in a religion, but not necessarily feel spiritual. Likewise, you could be very spiritual, but not religious. Question 2: Where do your spiritual beliefs come from? In order to connect to something greater, Yong says it's important to know who you are. He asks: \"How do you build a meaningful relationship if you don't know yourself at all?\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Examine your spiritual history and influences. What early connections did you feel to something bigger than yourself?   It can help you identify which rituals and connections you want to keep, let go of or explore. Yong's own spirituality, for example, is informed by his blended upbringing. His Chinese Malaysian father was raised Buddhist and his Mexican American mother was raised Catholic, and he grew up visiting Hindu temples and Buddhist meditation circles. Although he is now an ordained Pentecostal Christian minister, Yong says he practices his faith \"interreligiously.\" He draws from his Buddhist and Catholic roots to experience a relationship with God. Question 3: What activities connect you to your spirituality?  Think about experiences you've had in the past that have made you feel close to your \"something greater.\" How might you incorporate them, as rituals or traditions, into your life? These practices might be religious, like praying or fasting; or secular, like going for a walk in the woods or writing in your journal. Rayna Jhaveri, a musician, chef and writer based in Cambridge, Mass., has spent decades thinking about her own spirituality. She says she primarily experiences it when \"listening to, playing and making music.\" So as part of her spiritual practice, she participates in singing circles in her area where people gather as a group to sing songs that lift each other up. If you're wondering what sets a spiritual practice apart from any regular activity, Yong offers guidance. \"Our spiritualities are about remembering connections\" to our neighbors, our community and the Earth, he says. Any practice that focuses solely on your own individual happiness, like picking up a new hobby, exercising or socializing for the sake of self-improvement, \"falls short of what we can live up to as human beings,\" he says. Question 4: What else can you do to strengthen your spiritual connection?  As you reflect on your spirituality, you might feel drawn to trying something new and deepening your spiritual practices in a more creative way. So take a moment to think about where you might find guidance and inspiration. If you're religious, you may find new practices within your own faith. Yusim says you can ask yourself: \"What can I do to take my faith to the next level? Is it to get a mentor? What does prayer mean in my religion? Is it to be able to pray in a different way?\" You might also pick up secular practices that aren't traditionally part of your religion's teachings. Maybe you'll treat a physical activity like swimming as a spiritual ritual, or find inspiration from other cultures, like  creating an altar to your ancestors . \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       If you are curious about trying cultural rituals you didn't grow up with, take care to ground your interest in personal relationships, Yong says. For example, if you want to explore meditation in the Buddhist tradition, get to know someone at a nearby temple or center first. \"If we really want to take the diversity of the world seriously, and the ways these practices are passed down, then it's important to be in relationship with the communities they come from,\" he says. It won't always be easy to figure out your spiritual practices, but that's part of the journey, Yong says. \"You'll never regret being connected to your own life and being true to the questions and longings that are there.\" Your turn: What does your spiritual practice look like? How do you practice or think about your spirituality? Is your spirituality tied to religion? Or are you building a spiritual life apart from religious faith?

Trump could have chosen to release many of the files on his own months ago. “Democrats have used the ‘Epstein’ issue, which affects them far more than the Republican Party, in order to try and distract from our AMAZING Victories,” Trump said in a social media post as he announced he had signed the bill. Now, the bill requires the Justice Department to release all files and communications related to Epstein, as well as any information about the investigation into his death in a federal prison in 2019, within 30 days. It allows for redactions about Epstein’s victims for ongoing federal investigations, but DOJ cannot withhold information due to “embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity.” It was a remarkable turn of events for what was once a farfetched effort to force the disclosure of case files from an odd congressional coalition of Democrats, one GOP antagonist of the president, and a handful of erstwhile Trump loyalists. As recently as last week, the Trump administration even summoned one Republican proponent of releasing the files, Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado, to the Situation Room to discuss the matter, although she did not change her mind.

He insisted the Epstein matter had become a distraction to the GOP agenda and indicated he wanted to move on. “I just don’t want Republicans to take their eyes off all of the Victories that we’ve had,” Trump said in a social media post Tuesday afternoon, explaining the rationale for his abrupt about-face. The House passed the legislation on a 427-1 vote, with Rep. Clay Higgins, R-La., being the sole dissenter . He argued that the bill’s language could lead to the release of information on innocent people mentioned in the federal investigation. The Senate later approved it unanimously, skipping a formal vote. It’s long been established that Trump had been friends with Epstein, the disgraced financier who was close to the world’s elite. But the president has consistently said he did not know of Epstein’s crimes and had cut ties with him long ago. Before Trump returned to the White House for a second term, some of his closest political allies helped fuel conspiracy theories about the government’s handling of the Epstein case, asserting a cover-up of potentially incriminating information in those files."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/trump-redistricting-gerrymandering-congress-texas-california-2c5587f38df6428953c15ed43d631e53","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"05:11:39+00:00","title":"Trump’s Mid-Decade Redistricting Push Stalls Amid Court Ruling and Democratic Backlash","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump attempted to push for mid-decade redistricting in key Republican-leaning states like Texas and Missouri to bolster Republican gains in the 2026 House elections.

Republicans, the president said, were “entitled” to five more conservative-leaning U.S. House seats in Texas and additional ones in other red states. The president broke with more than a century of political tradition in directing the GOP to redraw those maps in the middle of the decade to avoid losing control of Congress in next year’s midterms. Four months later, Trump’s audacious ask looks anything but simple. After a federal court panel struck down Republicans’ new map in Texas on Tuesday, the entire exercise holds the potential to net Democrats more winnable seats in the House instead. “Trump may have let the genie out of the bottle,” said UCLA law professor Rick Hasen, “but he may not get the wish he’d hoped for.” Trump’s plan is to bolster his party’s narrow House margin to protect Republicans from losing control of the chamber in next year’s elections. Normally, the president’s party loses seats in the midterms. But his involvement in redistricting is instead becoming an illustration of the limits of presidential power. Gov.

Redrawing maps is a decentralized effort that involves navigating a tangle of legal rules. It also involves a tricky political calculus because the legislators who hold the power to draw maps often want to protect themselves, business interests or local communities more than ruthlessly help their party. And when one party moves aggressively to draw lines to help itself win elections — also known as gerrymandering — it runs the risk of pushing its rival party to do the same. That’s what Trump ended up doing, spurring California voters to replace their map drawn by a nonpartisan commission with one drawn by Democrats to gain five seats. If successful, the move would cancel out the action taken by Texas Republicans. California voters approved that map earlier this month, and if a Republican lawsuit fails to block it, that map giving Democrats more winnable seats will remain in effect even if Texas’ remains stalled. “Donald Trump and Greg Abbott played with fire, got burned -- and democracy won,” California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, posted on X after the Texas ruling, mentioning his Republican counterpart in Texas along with the president. Rep. Kevin Kiley, a Republican whose northern California district would be redrawn under the state’s new map, agreed. “It could very well come out as a net loss for Republicans, honestly when you look at the map, or at the very least, it could end up being a wash,” Kiley said. “But it’s something that never should have happened. It was ill-conceived from the start.” California Gov. Gavin Newsom speaks during a rally with Harris County Democrats at the IBEW local 716 union hall in Houston, on Saturday, Nov. 8, 2025.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More For Trump, a mix of wins and losses There’s no guarantee that Tuesday’s ruling on the Texas map will stand. Many lower courts have blocked Trump’s initiatives, only for the conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court to put those rulings on hold . Texas Republicans immediately appealed Tuesday’s decision to the high court, too. Republicans hope the nation’s highest court also weakens or eliminates the last major component of the Voting Rights Act next year, which could open the door to further redraws in their favor. Even before Tuesday, Trump’s push for mid-decade redistricting was not playing out as neatly as he had hoped, though he had scored some apparent wins. North Carolina Republicans potentially created another conservative-leaning seat in that battleground state, while Missouri Republicans redrew their congressional map at Trump’s urging to eliminate one Democratic seat. The Missouri plan faces lawsuits and a possible referendum that would force a statewide vote on the matter. Trump’s push has faltered elsewhere. Republicans in Kansas balked at trying to eliminate the state’s lone swing seat, held by a Democratic congresswoman. Indiana Republicans also refused to redraw their map to eliminate their two Democratic-leaning congressional seats. After Trump attacked the main Indiana holdout, state Sen. Greg Goode, on social media, he was the victim of a swatting call over the weekend that led to sheriff’s deputies coming to his house. Trump’s push could have a boomerang effect on Republicans The bulk of redistricting normally happens once every 10 years, following the release of new population estimates from the U.S. Census. That requires state lawmakers to adjust their legislative lines to make sure every district has roughly the same population. It also opens the door to gerrymandering maps to make it harder for the party out of power to win legislative seats. Inevitably, redistricting leads to litigation, which can drag on for years and spur mid-decade, court-mandated revisions. Republicans stood to benefit from these after the last cycle in 2021 because they won state supreme court elections in North Carolina and Ohio in 2022. But some litigation hasn’t gone the GOP’s way. A judge in Utah earlier this month required the state to make one of its four congressional seats Democratic-leaning . Trump broke with modern political practice by urging a wholesale, mid-decade redraw in red states. Democrats were in a bad position to respond to Trump’s gambit because more states they control have lines drawn by independent commissions rather than by partisan lawmakers, the legacy of government reform efforts. But with Newsom’s push to let Democrats draw California’s lines successful, the party is looking to replicate it elsewhere. Next up may be Virginia , where Democrats recaptured the governor’s office this month and expanded their margins in the Legislature. A Democratic candidate for governor in Colorado has called for a similar measure there. Republicans currently hold 9 of the 19 House seats in those two states. Overall, Republicans have more to lose if redistricting becomes a purely partisan activity nationally and voters in blue states ditch their nonpartisan commissions to let their preferred party maximize its margins. In the last complete redistricting cycle in 2021, commissions drew 95 House seats that Democrats would have otherwise drawn, and only 13 that Republicans would have drawn.

Pete Sessions of Texas told reporters. Incumbents usually don’t like the idea of radically redrawing districts. It can lead to what political experts call a “dummymander” — spreading the opposing party’s voters so broadly that they end up endangering your own incumbents in a year, like 2026, that is expected to be bad for the party in power. Incumbents also don’t like losing voters who have supported them or getting wholly new communities drawn into their districts, said Jonathan Cervas, who teaches redistricting at Carnegie Mellon University and has drawn new maps for courts. Democratic lawmakers in Illinois and Maryland have so far resisted mid-decade redraws to pad their majorities in their states, joining their GOP counterparts in Indiana and Kansas. Cervas said that’s why it was striking to watch Trump push Republicans to dive into mid-decade redistricting. “The idea they’d go along to get along is basically crazy,” he said. ___ Associated Press writers Joey Cappelletti and Kevin Freking in Washington contributed to this report."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/california-governor-election-tom-steyer-1de30f4501b91c3bc9969c54aa13c19d","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"16:54:21+00:00","title":"Tom Steyer Launches Democratic Bid for California Governor","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tom Steyer, a billionaire businessman and political activist, has officially entered the California governor’s race as a Democrat, joining a crowded and open primary field that includes several Democrats and two Republicans.

campaign and spent his own money advocating for President Donald Trump’s impeachment, has launched his bid for California governor as a Democrat. The 68-year-old’s tremendous wealth immediately makes him a notable contender in a free-for-all that includes more than a half-dozen Democrats and two Republicans competing in an all-party June primary, with the top two vote-getters advancing to a November general election to succeed term-limited Gov. Gavin Newsom. Steyer announced his candidacy with a pledge to improve economic conditions and by framing his political record as friendly to consumers, working-class voters and the environment . “Californians deserve a life they can afford,” he said in a video released Wednesday morning. “But the Californians who make this state run are being run over by the cost of living.” The approach puts Steyer on a collision course with other candidates like progressive Congresswoman Katie Porter, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and former U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra.

Steyer’s personal fortune could give him an advantage in reaching voters through television and digital advertising in an expansive state with nearly 40 million people and multiple media markets. Still, tremendous wealth has not necessarily translated to statewide electoral success in California: Carly Fiorina, a former Hewlett-Packard CEO, could not unseat Democratic U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer in their 2010 matchup. Meg Whitman, a onetime CEO of eBay, spent more than $100 million of her own money in a losing governor’s campaign that same year. Steyer’s money quickly became a target for rivals in the race. “Tom Steyer tried to buy the presidency — and he failed. The California governorship is not going to be his consolation prize,” said Democrat Betty Yee, a former state controller. Steyer nodded to his wealth Wednesday, noting his business enterprises made “billions of dollars.” But he also sounded populist tones. “The richest people in America think that they earned everything themselves,” he said, before dismissing that notion with an expletive for bovine excrement. “That’s so ridiculous.” Steyer said he would “make corporations pay their fair share again,” and his campaign cited his previous work on ballot initiatives with similar aims. Steyer was a leading advocate for a 2012 ballot initiative that made it harder for corporations to avoid certain taxes. The new revenue was steered to energy improvements in the state’s public schools. In other referendum work, Steyer helped lead the 2016 campaign that yielded a $2 per-pack tax hike on tobacco products. The money was steered to state health care programs, including tobacco-prevention efforts. And Steyer was a top opponent of a 2010 ballot initiative that would have rolled back California’s clean air and climate law, which has been viewed as a national standard on climate policy. In another development Wednesday, Villaraigosa launched a digital ad spotlighting Becerra’s connection to an unfolding Sacramento scandal as the two skirmish over votes, including those of Latinos. Prosecutors allege longtime Becerra aide Sean McCluskie was at the center of a plan that siphoned money from one of Becerra’s dormant state campaign accounts to pad his salary after he accepted a job as Becerra’s chief of staff in Washington. Becerra is not implicated in the indictment but the ad attempts to raise doubts about his judgment and features clips from a TV interview in which Becerra said he knew payments were being made from his account but didn’t know they were being improperly used. Steyer spent millions of his own money touring the country and pushing for Trump’s impeachment during the Republican president’s first term. He then ran for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, spending more than $200 million of his fortune and receiving no pledged delegates. After distant finishes in the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary, Steyer doubled-down with an expensive push in South Carolina, only to finish a distant third behind eventual nominee and President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Steyer then ended his presidential bid, and he financially supported Biden’s reelection in 2024 before the Democrat bowed out in favor of then-Vice President Kamala Harris, another Californian. Steyer’s latest campaign comes amid some Democrats questioning Porter’s candidacy after her combative exchanges with a TV journalist spread online in October. He has long been mentioned, along with Harris and U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla, as a potential heavyweight candidate who could join the field. Harris, who is on a national tour promoting her 2024 campaign memoir, has said consistently that she has no plans to run — suggesting instead that any future campaign would be for the presidency. “I will be voting,” she told The Associated Press on Oct. 17 when asked about entering the governor’s race. Asked whether she was satisfied with the field as Porter faced her most intense criticism, Harris said only that she wanted Democrats to have “the best and the brightest running and winning” and that she was “not actively involved.” Padilla has said he will remain in the Senate."},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5611088","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00Z","title":"Democrats Have Biggest Advantage for Control of Congress in 8 Years","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the 2026 midterm elections approach, a recent NPR/PBS News/Marist poll reveals a significant Democratic advantage in public support, with a 14-point lead on the congressional ballot since 2017.

\n         By Domenico Montanaro, Elena Moore \n        \n           Wednesday, November 19, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Morning Edition \n        \n      \n\n         Heading into the 2026 midterm elections, there are some very big warning signs for Republicans in the latest  NPR/PBS News/Marist poll . The survey of 1,443 adults, conducted from Nov. 10-13, found: Democrats holding their largest advantage, 14 points, since 2017 on the question of who respondents would vote for if the midterm elections were held today; President Trump's approval rating is just 39%, his lowest since right after the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol; A combined 6-in-10 blame congressional Republicans or Trump for the  government shutdown ; and  Nearly 6-in-10 say Trump's top priority should be lowering prices — and no other issue comes close. \"I don't think rent prices or food prices are at the forefront like they should be,\" said Nicole Stokes of Dallas, Texas, who participated in NPR's poll and voted for Trump last year. \"You know — the American people — it's our pockets that are getting ripped apart to fund things.\" From the political parties and Congress to the Supreme Court and the media, other respondents said they had little to no confidence in these critical institutions. \"I feel lost,\" said poll respondent Wayne Dowdy of Memphis, Tenn., who calls himself a \"lapsed Democrat.\" \"The parties don't speak to me anymore.\" He said he often feels unseen by the Democratic Party, but, given the alternative, he plans to keep supporting Democratic candidates — for now. The disillusionment extends to how people see those in the opposite political party. Big majorities of Democrats and Republicans said the other party is \"dishonest\" and \"closed-minded\" about politics. All of it makes for a volatile political stew heading into the holidays, but with Republicans in charge of all the levers of power in Washington, Democrats have the clear advantage a year out from next year's midterm elections. Democrats in the driver's seat for control of Congress Coming off huge wins up and down the ballot across the country in this year's off-year elections, Democrats lead Republicans, 55%-41%, when people were asked who they would vote for in their district if the election for Congress were held today. It's the largest Democratic advantage on this question, known as the congressional ballot, in the Marist poll since November 2017. The parallel is striking, considering that was at the same point in Trump's first term as this poll now. Democrats wound up winning 40 House seats in 2018. What's more, independents chose Democrats by a 33-point margin on this question. It's all quite the reversal of fortune from a year ago when, just before the 2024 elections when President Trump won back the White House, the parties were tied on the congressional ballot. Historically, Democrats have needed a sizable advantage on the congressional ballot to signal that they would do well in upcoming midterms. Consider: In the fall of 2022, with Democratic President Biden in the White House, Democrats' lead ranged from 0 to 4 points. They  lost nine House seats ; In 2018, during Trump's first term, Democrats' lead ranged between 6 and 12. They won 40 seats;  In 2014, when Democrat Barack Obama was president, Republicans had a 5-point advantage. The GOP gained 13 seats. All that said, with redistricting, the  number of competitive seats  has  shrunk significantly , so major gains are less likely than they were in previous years. Trump has also encouraged conservatives in red states to try and create more Republican districts in rare mid-decade redistricting. Democrats have responded in kind, so the landscape for control of the House for next year remains uncertain at this point. The Trump drag on the GOP A big reason for Democrats' advantage is that Trump is unpopular. Not only is he at 39% approval, the lowest of this second term in the Marist poll, but he gets just a 24% rating with independents as well. Overall, almost half of those surveyed — 48% — said they  strongly  disapprove of the job the president is doing. That's also the highest of this term and the highest since just after Jan. 6, 2021. The president has seen low ratings for his handling of various policy areas, including the  economy  and  foreign policy , and people think he's  gone too far  on immigration. Trump  has said  on  more than one occasion  in this second term that while campaign advisers told him prices were the most important issue, he always felt it was really immigration. But respondents in the NPR survey are sending a clear message: they think the cost of living should be Trump's top priority. Almost 6-in-10 — 57% — said lowering prices should be his top priority. Immigration is a distant second at 16%. Even a plurality of Republicans (40%) said lowering prices should be the priority compared to immigration (34%). Despite Trump's slide in approval ratings, he's holding up well with his base — 9-in-10 Republicans continue to say they approve of the job he's doing. Stokes, the Trump voter from Dallas, said a year into his presidency, said she's pleased by his attempts to tackle illegal border crossings and restrict U.S. foreign aid, but she is concerned that the president hasn't made the economy a focus. But her support of Trump doesn't translate to Republicans on Capitol Hill. Instead, she said, she has little confidence in the elected officials representing either political party. \"They're not in tune with anyone on the ground,\" Stokes said. \"I don't really see anyone in [the House] or in the Senate that's really for the American people right now.\" It's not just Trump. Democrats and others get low marks Trump's approval is low and so is confidence in the office he holds — 61% said they have little to no confidence in the institution of the presidency. But the scores were even poorer for other key institutions. Worst among them was Congress — 80% said they had little to no confidence in it, followed by the media (75%), the Democratic Party (71%), the Republican Party (65%) and the Supreme Court (62%). This is yet another poll that shows Democrats have a problem with their base. While 80% of Republicans have \"quite a lot\" or a \"great deal\" of confidence in the GOP, just 57% of Democrats said the same of their party. Despite long supporting liberal candidates, Dowdy, the Democrat from Memphis, argues the party has become disconnected from everyday voters. \"They don't interact with working people,\" he said, \"regardless of whether they work in an office or on a job site or building homes or working in a factory. They don't know how people like that live... They have no connection to the real people. And there's no attempt to try and reach that.\" And yet, Democrats have a wide advantage on the congressional ballot, which, coupled with the electoral gains earlier this month, indicate that left-leaning voters may rally to Democrats' side when faced with having to choose between them and Republicans. Democrats and Republicans see each other as \"dishonest\" and \"closed-minded\" It's no wonder political acrimony is as high as it is in the country; people have very little respect for where the other side is coming from. The survey found that more than 8-in-10 Republicans and Democrats described people in the other political party as \"closed-minded\"; more than 7-in-10 Republicans and roughly two-thirds of Democrats also see the other as \"dishonest\" when talking about politics. Independents have better views of Democrats than Republicans. They said Republicans were more dishonest and closed-minded than Democrats with a majority of independents (54%) saying Republicans were \"mostly dishonest\" compared to more than 6-in-10 saying Democrats were \"mostly honest\" when it came to politics. Nearly 7-in-10 independents also described Republicans as mostly closed-minded, while a majority (53%) said Democrats were mostly open-minded. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/cherfilus-mccormick-fema-theft-campaign-funds-35b99f987380c9509735c45dd36db1c8","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"00:12:01+00:00","title":"U.S. Rep.

Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick of Florida has been indicted on charges accusing her of stealing $5 million in federal disaster funds and using some of the money to aid her 2021 campaign, the Justice Department said Wednesday. The Democrat is accused of stealing Federal Emergency Management Agency overpayments that her family health care company had received through a federally funded COVID-19 vaccination staffing contract, federal prosecutors said. A portion of the money was then funneled to support her campaign through candidate contributions, prosecutors allege. “Using disaster relief funds for self-enrichment is a particularly selfish, cynical crime,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement. “No one is above the law, least of all powerful people who rob taxpayers for personal gain. We will follow the facts in this case and deliver justice.” A phone message left at Cherfilus-McCormick’s Washington office was not immediately returned. Cherfilus-McCormick was first elected to Congress in 2022 in the 20th District, representing parts of Broward and Palm Beach counties, in a special election after Rep. Alcee Hastings died in 2021. In December 2024, a Florida state agency sued a company owned by Cherfilus-McCormick’s family, saying it overcharged the state by nearly $5.8 million for work done during the pandemic and wouldn’t give the money back. The Florida Division of Emergency Management said it made a series of overpayments to Trinity Healthcare Services after hiring it in 2021 to register people for COVID-19 vaccinations. The agency says it discovered the problem after a single $5 million overpayment drew attention. Cherfilus-McCormick was the CEO of Trinity at the time. The Office of Congressional Ethics said in a January report that Cherfilus-McCormick’s income in 2021 was more than $6 million higher than in 2020, driven by nearly $5.75 million in consulting and profit-sharing fees received from Trinity Healthcare Services. In July, the House Ethics Committee unanimously voted to reauthorize an investigative subcommittee to examine allegations involving Cherfilus-McCormick."},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5593087","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"05:05:00-04:00","title":"3 Massive Changes You'll See as the Climate Careens Toward Tipping Points","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the world approaches critical climate tipping points, scientists warn that global warming is likely to exceed 1.5°C, with projections reaching up to 2.5°C by the century’s end.

They are trying to agree on how to curb global warming and pay for the costs of an increasingly hotter planet. For the past  eight years , one of the primary objectives of the annual negotiations has been to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to the temperatures in the late 1800s. That temperature goal was established after a landmark international scientific report laid out the catastrophic effects of exceeding that amount of warming. But that goal is no longer plausible, scientists say. Humanity has not cut planet-warming pollution quickly enough, and the planet will exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming, likely in the next decade, according to a  recent United Nations report . However, all is not lost. If countries can cut overall greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2035, scientists say the planet would quickly return to lower levels of warming. \"We must move much, much faster on both reductions of emissions and strengthening resilience,\" U.N. climate chief Simon Stiell told world leaders at COP30. Right now, countries are pursuing policies that would cut emissions by just 12% by 2035. \"The science is clear: We can and must bring temperatures back down to 1.5 [degrees Celsius] after any temporary overshoot,\" Stiell said. If countries follow through on current promises to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the latest estimates suggest that Earth's temperature will  top out  around 2.5 degrees Celsius of warming this century. The latest science also makes clear the profound human costs of exceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming, even temporarily. The planet has warmed about 1.3 degrees Celsius, according to the  World Meteorological Organization . And communities are already experiencing more dangerous storms, flooding and heat waves. When the  planet heats up beyond 1.5 degrees , the impacts don't get just slightly worse. Scientists warn that massive, self-reinforcing changes could be set off, having devastating impacts around the world. Such changes are sometimes called climate tipping points, although they're not as abrupt as that term would suggest. Most will unfold over the course of decades. Some could take centuries. Some may be partially reversible. But they all have enormous and lasting implications for humans, plants and animals on Earth. And every tenth of a degree of warming makes these tipping points more likely, according to a  new report  from 160 international climate researchers. Here are the three most important and well-studied changes, from collapsing ice sheets to thawing Arctic permafrost, to disappearing coral reefs. Change No. 1: Coral reefs could be gone forever For coral reefs, the tipping point may have already begun. Widespread coral die-offs have been seen around the globe as ocean temperatures heat up, making it the first domino to fall, according to a  new report . By overall area, coral reefs are a tiny part of the ocean. But they're a bedrock ecosystem for marine life, supporting an estimated 25% of all species. Corals are highly sensitive to heat. When marine heat waves hit, corals come under stress, and they expel the algae that live inside them and that they need to survive. The reefs then turn a ghostly white color. A bleaching event doesn't necessarily mean the end for a coral reef. Corals have the ability to recover, given enough time. But repeated heat waves, as seen at  Australia's Great Barrier Reef  and  off the coast of Florida , can kill a reef, leading to the collapse of the ecosystem. Oceans are also becoming more acidic as they absorb the carbon dioxide emitted by humans from burning fossil fuels. That also stresses corals, making it difficult for them to build their skeletons. High ocean temperatures caused a  global coral bleaching event  in 2023-24, the second in the last 10 years. If the world passes 2 degrees Celsius of heating, an estimated  99% of the world's coral reefs could be lost . The damage is happening faster than scientists expected. Combined with the effects of pollution and human development, half of all reefs worldwide will be in unlivable conditions by 2035, according to a  recent study  from the University of Hawai'i at Mānoa. \"The coming decades will bring, I think, unprecedented change for both these reef systems and humanity in general,\" says Erik Franklin, professor at the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology at the University of Hawai'i at Mānoa, who worked on the study. It's estimated that half a billion people around the world depend on coral reefs for food, income and livelihoods. Losing reefs would destabilize many countries, along with risking extinction for marine life that can only be found on coral reefs. \"There's entire societies and economies that are built around reef systems, especially in equatorial and tropical regions,\" Franklin says. \"So these societies will be in dire straits.\" Many scientists are searching for \"refuges\" — pockets of the ocean where conditions might remain livable for coral reefs. They're also selectively breeding corals, both in  Florida  and  Australia , boosting the corals' natural abilities to withstand heat. The hope is that it might help corals hold on,  surviving just long enough  until humans can get their heat-trapping emissions under control. Change No. 2: Ice sheets in Greenland and West Antarctica could collapse Ice sheets are the massive frozen expanses that cover Greenland and Antarctica and  contain about two-thirds  of the freshwater on Earth. Climate change is already causing them to melt and raising sea levels around the world. But if the Earth lingers at, or above, 2 degrees Celsius of warming, as it is on track to, that melting will steadily accelerate. Scientists warn that will cause parts of the ice sheets to collapse, sending massive amounts of water into the world's oceans. The million-dollar question is how quickly that collapse will occur. \"Collapse tends to be a bit of a loaded word. People think of it like a building collapse,\" says Ian Joughin, a glaciologist at the University of Washington who has spent decades studying how giant glaciers move and change. \"Maybe a better timescale for an ice sheet [collapsing] is the Roman Empire,\" Joughin explains. Like a dying empire, the ice sheets in Greenland and West Antarctica are huge. It will take decades or even centuries for them to disintegrate. This year marks the  29th year  in a row that Greenland has lost more ice than it gained. In 2021,  rainfall was recorded  at the ice sheet's highest point, rather than snow, a sign that warmer temperatures were triggering widespread melting. As temperatures continue to warm, scientists say the 2-mile-thick ice sheet in Greenland is getting out of balance. Snow and ice are melting faster than they're being replaced, and as the ice melt accelerates, the process is difficult to stop. Research suggests that the collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet may already be underway. A massive glacier there, which covers an area about the size of the state of Washington, is melting quickly in response to climate change and could splinter into the ocean in the coming decades. If that glacier melts entirely, it will add so much water to the oceans that sea levels will rise about 2 feet. If the entire West Antarctic ice sheet melts, scientists estimate that sea levels will rise about 12 feet. Due to their enormous size, ice sheets have a huge amount of inertia. Once the melt process gets underway, it's difficult to stop. \"It takes a few hundred years to really get going,\" says Joughin. \"And it's kind of a snowball effect, where the faster it goes, the more it's going to go.\" But it will take a long time for people around the world to feel the most extreme effects of that melt. \"It could be anywhere from two or three hundred years to a thousand years,\" says Joughin. If humans slow down the pace of global warming, it will help slow down the pace of ice melting, giving the billions of people who live along coastlines more time to adapt. Change No. 3: Permanently frozen ground is thawing Climate change is causing permafrost — the permanently frozen ground in the Arctic — to thaw. And as the Earth approaches 2 degrees Celsius of warming, that thawing ground will cause both local and global problems. Let's start local. When permafrost thaws, the ice that's trapped in the ground turns into water and drains away. \"It can have really profound consequences,\" says Merritt Turetsky, a permafrost researcher at the University of Colorado Boulder. \"We can see lakes draining overnight. We can see ecosystems becoming much drier in some areas, because the permafrost was actually holding the water up at the surface.\" That's because when the ground is frozen, it's impermeable to moisture, like the lining of a bathtub. \"When it thaws, we pull the drain out of the bathtub,\" Turetsky explains. Thawing permafrost has profound impacts for the millions of people who live in the Arctic. In many places, the land is sinking as it thaws, cracking the foundations of buildings, buckling roads and runways and kinking pipelines. That will accelerate as the Earth heats up more. Thawing permafrost also has global climate implications. Permanently frozen ground is like the world's freezer: millennia of dead plants and animals are locked up in permafrost. \"When permafrost thaws it's a little like losing power to your freezer. That food starts to rot,\" explains Ted Schuur, a permafrost expert at Northern Arizona University. Bacteria and fungi start to digest the carbon-rich soil, releasing planet-warming methane and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Basically, it's an infinite loop of greenhouse gases: human emissions cause the planet to heat up. That heat thaws permafrost, which releases more emissions. In recent years, advances in Arctic data collection have allowed scientists to measure greenhouse gas emissions from permafrost more accurately, says Schuur. The upshot has been sobering. \"This new science is showing that this is happening right now,\" he explains. The so-called tipping point has  already begun . But how much extra carbon ultimately gets released by Arctic permafrost in the future is up to humans. \"The faster we can decarbonize society today, the more permafrost carbon we can keep in the Arctic ground where it belongs,\" says Turetsky. For example, by using renewable energy sources instead of burning fossil fuels. \"Every tenth of a degree matters. And every act we take matters,\" says Schuur. A version of this story was originally published in 2021. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-98459","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"19:46:00-05:00","title":"Trump administration seeks to roll back protections for imperiled species and habitat","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration announced proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act, aiming to eliminate the 'blanket rule' that automatically protects threatened species, instead requiring species-specific protections.

Wednesday, November 19, 2025 • 6:46 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         BILLINGS, Mont. — President Trump's administration moved Wednesday to roll back protections for imperiled species and the places they live, reviving a suite of changes to Endangered Species Act regulations from the Republican's first term that were blocked under former Democratic President Joe Biden. The proposed changes include the elimination of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's \"blanket rule\" that automatically protects animals and plants when they are classified as threatened. Government agencies instead would have to craft species-specific rules for protections, a potentially lengthy process. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The administration's announcement answers longstanding calls for revisions to the Endangered Species Act from Republicans in Congress and industries including oil and gas, mining and agriculture. Critics argue the landmark 1973 environmental law has been wielded too broadly, to the detriment of economic growth. But environmentalists warned the changes could cause yearslong delays in efforts to save species such as the monarch butterfly, Florida manatee, California spotted owl and North American wolverine. \"We would have to wait until these poor animals are almost extinct before we can start protecting them. That's absurd and heartbreaking,\" said Stephanie Kurose with the Center for Biological Diversity. Scientists and government agencies say extinctions are accelerating globally because of habitat loss and other pressures. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Trump has made oil and gas production a centerpiece of his presidency and sought to strip away environmental regulations that impede development. Other pending proposals from the administration would revise the definition of \"harm\" under the Endangered Species Act and potentially bypass species protections for logging projects in national forests and on public lands. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a statement that the administration was restoring the Endangered Species Act to its original intent while respecting \"the livelihoods of Americans who depend on our land and resources.\" \"These revisions end years of legal confusion and regulatory overreach, delivering certainty to states, tribes, landowners and businesses while ensuring conservation efforts remain grounded in sound science and common sense,\" Burgum said in a statement. Another proposed change tasks officials with analyzing economic impacts when deciding whether habitat is critical to a species' survival. Case of lizard shows potential outcome of proposals The case of the Yarrow's spiny lizard in the Southwest exemplifies the potential consequences of the proposals. Rapidly warming temperatures have ravaged a population of the lizard in Arizona's Mule Mountains, pushing the reptiles further up the mountainsides toward the highest peaks and possibly toward extinction. A petition filed Wednesday seeks protections for the lizard and the designation of critical habitat. Advocates say analyzing the economic impacts could delay protections. Designating critical habitat could be another hurdle because the primary threat to this population of spiny lizard is climate change. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"We think that the species should be listed as endangered. In fact, we are somewhat shocked that it is not already extinct,\" said John Wiens, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Arizona, who co-authored the petition. The Interior Department was sued over the blanket protection rule in March, by the Property and Environment Research Center (PERC) and Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation. The two groups argued the rule was illegal and discouraged states and landowners from assisting in species recovery efforts. Species designated as \"threatened\" under the rule automatically qualify for the same protections as those with the more severe designation of \"endangered.\" PERC Vice President Jonathan Wood said Wednesday's proposal was a \"necessary course correction.\" \"This reform acknowledges the blanket rule's unlawfulness and puts recovery back at the heart of the Endangered Species Act,\" Wood said. Proposals would undermine protections, critic says Kristen Boyles with the environmental law firm Earthjustice said the changes undermine protections even more than in Trump's first term. That includes allowing the Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service to not count negative effects on species if those impacts are not regulated by the agencies themselves, Boyles said. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"The Services are required to prevent harmful consequences to species, not ignore them,\" she said. Trump officials during his first term also rolled back protections for individual species including the northern spotted owl and gray wolf. The spotted owl decision was reversed in 2021 after officials said Trump's political appointees used faulty science to justify opening millions of acres of West Coast forest to potential logging. Protections for wolves across most of the U.S. were restored by a federal court in 2022. The Endangered Species Act protects more than 1,600 species in the United States and its territories. It is credited with helping save the bald eagle, California condor and scores more animals and plants from extinction since Republican President Richard Nixon signed it into law. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/fbi-progress-pride-flag-lawsuit-83c0d9750e9bf6a11a11b858420750a2","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"19:19:09Z","title":"FBI Employee Fired for Displaying LGBTQ+ Pride Flag in Workplace","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"David Maltinsky, a 16-year veteran FBI intelligence specialist and a candidate for special agent status, was fired from the FBI in early 2025 after displaying a 'Progress Pride' flag at his workspace, despite prior approval from supervisors and the flag's previous display at the Los Angeles field office.

2025-11-19T19:19:09+00:00\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — A veteran FBI employee training to become a special agent was fired last month for displaying at his workspace an LGBTQ+ flag, which had previously flown outside a field office, according to a lawsuit filed in federal court. David Maltinsky had worked at the FBI for 16 years and was nearly finished with special agent training in Quantico, Virginia, when he was called into a meeting last month with FBI officials, given a letter from Director Kash Patel and told he was being “summarily dismissed” over the inappropriate display of political signage, Maltinsky’s lawsuit said. The suit, filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Washington, said Maltinsky had been a decorated intelligence specialist working in the Los Angeles field office and most recently was pursuing a longtime dream of becoming a special agent. In June 2021, the Los Angeles field office displayed a “Progress Pride” flag, which consists of a rainbow-colored horizontal stripes and a chevron with black, brown, pink, light blue, and white colors. It’s meant to represent people of color, as well as the LGBTQ+ community. Maltinsky was given that flag after it had come down and was then displayed at his Los Angeles field office workstation with the support and permission of his supervisors, according to the lawsuit. In April, he began training at the FBI Academy to become a special agent and had successfully completed 16 of the 19 weeks of training at the time of his firing, the lawsuit stated.

Maltinsky’s attorney Christopher M. Mattei called the firing an unlawful attack. “This case is about far more than one man’s career — it’s about whether the government can punish Americans simply for saying who they are,” Mattei said in a statement. Other lawsuits challenging the bureau’s personnel moves have been filed since President Donald Trump’s second term began. In September, three high-ranking FBI officials said in a lawsuit they were fired in a “campaign of retribution” carried out by a director who knew better but caved to political pressure from the Trump administration."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/byheart-baby-formula-botulism-recall-98ad391ac5606c980a012d35f5f7637c","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"20:46:41Z","title":"ByHeart Infant Formula Contaminated with Botulinum Bacteria in Growing Outbreak","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Laboratory tests have confirmed that samples of ByHeart infant formula contain *Clostridium botulinum*, a bacterium that causes infant botulism.

The company said on its website that tests by an independent food safety laboratory in Seattle found Clostridium botulinum, a bacterium that produces toxins that can lead to potentially life threatening illness in babies younger than 1.

The FDA did not immediately respond to questions about the findings. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Wednesday reported 31 cases of confirmed or suspected illness in babies who consumed ByHeart formula since August. The most recent case was reported on Nov. 13. No deaths have been reported in the outbreak, which was announced Nov. 8.

ByHeart, a New York-based manufacturer of organic infant formula, recalled all its products sold in the U.S. on Nov. 11. The company, which accounts for about 1% of the U.S. infant formula market, had been selling about 200,000 cans of the product each month. It can take up to 30 days for symptoms of infantile botulism to develop, medical experts said. Here’s what to know about the outbreak and infant botulism. The outbreak begins The outbreak has sickened babies aged about 2 weeks to about 6 months, the FDA said. All the infants were hospitalized after consuming ByHeart powdered formula. California officials earlier confirmed that a sample from an open can of ByHeart baby formula fed to an infant who fell ill contained the type of bacteria that can lead to illness. FDA inspectors have been to the company’s infant formula production plants in Allerton, Iowa; and Portland, Oregon. The FDA is investigating a rise in cases of infant botulism reported since August. “ByHeart brand formula is disproportionately represented among sick infants in this outbreak,” the agency said. Illnesses began between Aug. 9 and Nov. 13, federal officials said. Cases have been reported in Arizona, California, Idaho, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas and Washington. Families of babies treated for botulism after drinking ByHeart formula have sued the company. Lawsuits filed in federal courts allege that the formula they fed their children was defective and ByHeart was negligent in selling it. They seek financial payment for medical bills, emotional distress and other harm. Causes of infant botulism Infant botulism typically affects fewer than 200 babies in the U.S. each year. As of Sept. 20, 133 cases had been reported in the U.S. according to the most recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention records. There were 145 cases reported all of last year. The infection is caused by a type of bacteria that produces a toxin in the large intestine. The bacterium is spread through hardy spores present in the environment that can cause serious illness, including paralysis. Infants are particularly vulnerable to infection because their gut microbiomes are not developed enough to prevent the spores from germinating and producing the toxin. They can be sickened after exposure to the spores in dust, dirt or water or by eating contaminated honey. Symptoms can take weeks to develop and can include poor feeding, loss of head control, drooping eyelids and a flat facial expression. Babies may feel “floppy” and can have problems swallowing or breathing. Baby formula has previously been linked to sporadic cases of illness, but no known outbreaks of infant botulism tied to powdered formula have previously been confirmed, according to research studies. Infant botulism treatment The only treatment is known as BabyBIG, an IV medication made from the pooled blood plasma of adults immunized against botulism. California’s infant botulism program developed the product and is the sole source worldwide. BabyBIG works to shorten hospital stays and decrease the severity of illness in babies with botulism. Because the infection can affect the ability to breathe, infants often need to be placed on ventilators. All of the children in the ByHeart outbreak have received the medication, the CDC said. The treatment costs about $69,300 per child, California officials said. Potential impact on U.S. formula supplies There is little danger of infant formula shortages because ByHeart represents a small share of the market. That’s far different from the crises in late 2021 and 2022, when four infants were sickened by a different germ after consuming formula made by Abbott Nutrition. Two of the babies died. No direct link was found between the Abbott products and the infections caused by a different germ, cronobacter sakazakii, but FDA officials closed the company’s Michigan plant after contamination and other problems were detected. Abbott recalled top brands of infant formula, triggering a nationwide shortage that lasted months. In 2022, ByHeart recalled five batches of infant formula after a sample at the company’s packaging plant tested positive for cronobacter sakazakii. In 2023, the FDA sent a warning letter to the company detailing “areas that still require corrective actions.” A ByHeart plant in Reading, Pennsylvania, was shut down in 2023 just before FDA inspectors found problems with mold, water leaks and insects, inspection documents show. Reviewing infant formula ingredients Federal health officials have vowed to overhaul the U.S. food supply and are taking a new look at infant formula . Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has directed the FDA to review the nutrients and other ingredients in infant formula, which fills the bottles of millions of American babies. The effort, dubbed “Operation Stork Speed,” is the first deep look at the ingredients since 1998. FDA officials are reviewing comments from industry, health experts and public to decide next steps. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

No casualties have been reported. More than 300 residents in the three villages most at risk in the district of Lumajang were evacuated to government shelters, said National Disaster Mitigation Agency’s spokesperson Abdul Muhari. He said increased activity of the volcano on Wednesday afternoon prompted authorities to widen the danger zone to 8 kilometers (5 miles) from the crater. People were advised to keep away from an area along the Besuk Kobokan River, which is the path of the lava flow as searing gas flowed down Semeru’s slopes.

Bad weather and rain forced them to spend the night there, he said. Semeru, also known as Mahameru, has erupted numerous times in the past 200 years. Still, as is the case with many of the 129 active volcanoes in Indonesia, tens of thousands of people continue to live on its fertile slopes. Semeru’s last major eruption was in December 2021 when it left 51 people dead and several hundred others burned in villages that were buried in layers of mud. The eruption forced the evacuation of more than 10,000 people. The government moved about 2,970 houses out of the danger zone.

disruptive U.S. government shutdown, federal SNAP food assistance is again flowing to low-income households. But in the months ahead, many participants will have to abide by new work requirements. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program provides monthly benefits — averaging around $190 per person — to about 42 million people nationwide. During the first couple weeks of November, many of those recipients missed their regular allotments as President Donald Trump’s administration battled in court over whether to tap into reserves to fund the program while the government was shut down. Here’s what to know about SNAP: The benefits are available across the country after lapses For the first part of the month, the situation was chaotic after the federal government said SNAP would not be funded because of the government shutdown. Some states replenished the electronic benefit cards used in the program either fully or partially, using their own funds or federal dollars that were part of court orders. Others didn’t. Most states boosted food charities, but lines were long and some shelves were empty. As soon as the government reopened on Nov. 12, many states rushed to get out benefits. By Tuesday, all states either had loaded full November benefits onto people’s electronic spending cards or were working on it, according to an Associated Press review. Participants should receive December SNAP benefits according to their normal schedule. More SNAP recipients will face work requirements A massive tax and spending bill signed into law in July by Trump expanded requirements for many adult SNAP recipients to work, volunteer or participate in job training for at least 80 hours a month. Those who don’t are limited to three months of benefits in a three-year period. The work requirements previously applied to adults ages 18 through 54 who are physically and mentally able and don’t have dependents. The new law also applies those requirements to those ages 55 through 64 and to parents without children younger than 14. It repeals work exemptions for homeless individuals, veterans and young adults aging out of foster care. And it limits the ability of states to waive work requirements in areas lacking jobs. The Trump administration waived the work requirements in November, but the three-month clock on work-free SNAP benefits will be in full force in December. The new requirements are expected to reduce the average monthly number of SNAP recipients by about 2.4 million people over the next 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Agriculture secretary casts doubt about SNAP In the aftermath of the shutdown, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, whose department administers SNAP, has cast doubt on the program. Rollins has said it is rife with fraud, including deceased people receiving benefits and some people receiving multiple benefits. Rollins suggested that everyone who receives SNAP be required to reapply. But it’s not clear whether Rollins was suggesting an additional requirement or referring to the current one that mandates people to periodically recertify their income and other information. An Agriculture Department spokesperson didn’t clarify but instead said in a statement that the standard recertification processes for households is part of a plan to eliminate fraud, abuse and waste. Under federal law, most households must report their income and basic information every four to six months and be fully recertified for SNAP at least every 12 months. Full recertification can occur every 24 months for households where all adults are age 60 and above or have disabilities. But states can require more frequent eligibility verifications. Last year, 27 states required at least some households to be fully recertified every four to six months, depending on their household circumstances, according to a USDA report."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/epstein-larry-summers-openai-302a596efd87ab8e725ba8f72eeef84b","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"12:45:44+00:00","title":"Larry Summers Takes Leave from Harvard Amid Emails Reveal Friendship with Jeffrey Epstein","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Larry Summers, former U.S. Treasury Secretary and Harvard University president, has abruptly stepped away from all public teaching and leadership roles following the release of emails revealing a close and potentially inappropriate relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender.

Wednesday from teaching at Harvard University, where he once served as president, over recently released emails showing he maintained a friendly relationship with Jeffrey Epstein , Summers’ spokesperson said. Summers had canceled his public commitments amid the fallout of the emails being made public and earlier Wednesday severed ties with OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT . Harvard had reopened an investigation into connections between him and Epstein , but Summers had said he would continue teaching economics classes at the school. That changed Wednesday evening with the news that he will step away from teaching classes as well as his position as director of the Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government with the Harvard Kennedy School. “Mr. Summers has decided it’s in the best interest of the Center for him to go on leave from his role as Director as Harvard undertakes its review,” Summers spokesperson Steven Goldberg said, adding that his co-teachers would finish the classes. Summers has not been scheduled to teach next semester, according to Goldberg. Related Stories What to know about Larry Summers, who has taken leave from Harvard due to Epstein emails 4 MIN READ Trump signs bill to release Jeffrey Epstein case files after fighting it for months 2 MIN READ House gets back to work and quickly falls into a cycle of punishing its own 5 MIN READ A Harvard spokesperson confirmed to The Associated Press that Summers had let the university know about his decision. Summers decision to go on leave was first reported by The Harvard Crimson. Harvard did not mention Summers by name in its decision to restart an investigation, but the move follows the release of emails showing that he was friendly with Epstein long after the financier pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from an underage girl in 2008. By Wednesday, the once highly regarded economics expert had been facing increased scrutiny over choosing to stay in the teaching role. Some students even filmed his appearance in shock as he appeared before a class of undergraduates on Tuesday while stressing he thought it was important to continue teaching. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat, said in a social media post on Wednesday night that Summers “cozied up to the rich and powerful — including a convicted sex offender. He cannot be trusted in positions of influence.” Messages appear to seek advice about romantic relationship The emails include messages in which Summers appeared to be getting advice from Epstein about pursuing a romantic relationship with someone who viewed him as an “economic mentor.” “im a pretty good wing man , no?” Epstein wrote on Nov. 30, 2018. The next day, Summers told Epstein he had texted the woman, telling her he “had something brief to say to her.” “Am I thanking her or being sorry re my being married. I think the former,” he wrote. Summers’ wife, Elisa New, also emailed Epstein multiple times, including a 2015 message in which she thanked him for arranging financial support for a poetry project she directs. The gift he arranged “changed everything for me,” she wrote. “It really means a lot to me, all financial help aside, Jeffrey, that you are rooting for me and thinking about me,” she wrote. New, an English professor emerita at Harvard, did not respond to an email seeking comment Wednesday. An earlier review completed in 2020 found that Epstein visited Harvard’s campus more than 40 times after his 2008 sex-crimes conviction and was given his own office and unfettered access to a research center he helped establish. The professor who provided the office was later barred from starting new research or advising students for at least two years. Summers appears before Harvard class On Tuesday, Summers appeared before his class at Harvard, where he teaches “The Political Economy of Globalization” to undergraduates with Robert Lawrence, a professor with the Harvard Kennedy School. “Some of you will have seen my statement of regret expressing my shame with respect to what I did in communication with Mr. Epstein and that I’ve said that I’m going to step back from public activities for a while. But I think it’s very important to fulfill my teaching obligations,” he said. Summers’ remarks were captured on video by several students, but no one appeared to publicly respond to his comments. Epstein, who authorities said died by suicide in 2019, was a convicted sex offender infamous for his connections to wealthy and powerful people, making him a fixture of outrage and conspiracy theories about wrongdoing among American elites. Summers served as treasury secretary from 1999 to 2001 under President Bill Clinton. He was Harvard’s president for five years from 2001 to 2006. When asked about the emails last week, Summers issued a statement saying he has “great regrets in my life” and that his association with Epstein was a “major error in judgement.” Other organizations that confirmed the end of their affiliations with Summers included the Center for American Progress, the Center for Global Development and the Budget Lab at Yale University. Bloomberg TV said Summers’ withdrawal from public commitments included his role as a paid contributor, and the New York Times said it will not renew his contract as a contributing opinion writer. ___ This story has been corrected to show that Summers is a former treasury secretary, not treasurer; to show that Summers’ statement about stepping back from public commitments was issued late Monday, not Tuesday; and to show that the school is known as the Harvard Kennedy School, not Kennedy Harvard School. ___ Associated Press journalist Hallie Golden contributed to this report."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/17/landslides-kill-dozens-as-heavy-rains-lash-southeast-asia","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"09:47:57Z","title":"Landslides kill dozens as heavy rains lash Southeast Asia","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Heavy rains during the rainy season in Southeast Asia have triggered deadly landslides, killing at least 24 people across Indonesia and Vietnam.

Trump says Mamdani will visit White House on Friday\n\nUnited States President Donald Trump is poised to host New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani for a meeting at the White House, marking an about-face for a duo who have painted themselves as diametrically and ideologically opposed in their political visions for the country.\n\nOn his social media platform Truth Social, Trump wrote late on Wednesday that Mamdani will visit the Oval Office on Friday in a post that also falsely called Mamdani a communist and placed his middle name, Kwame, in quotation marks.\n\n“Further details to follow!” the president added.\n\nThroughout the campaign that culminated in Mamdani’s historic November 4  election victory  as the city’s first Muslim mayor, the president zeroed in on Mamdani as a target for public attacks, slamming the democratic socialist as a “communist”, mispronouncing his name and  threatening to cut off federal funding  to New York if he won.\n\nTrump even  endorsed  the Democrat Andrew Cuomo over the Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa in the final hours before the vote, telling his followers that Mamdani was a “FAILURE”.\n\nMamdani, for his part, has regularly linked the Trump administration to authoritarianism and portrayed his own goals as mayor – tackling the affordability crisis and assuaging income inequality – in direct contrast to the president’s lifelong chase of wealth and power.\n\n“If anyone can show a nation betrayed by Donald Trump how to defeat him, it is the same city that gave rise to him,” Mamdani pledged in his election victory speech, referencing Trump’s New York roots. “And if there is any way to terrify a despot, it is by dismantling the very conditions that allowed him to accumulate power.”\n\nStill, since the election earlier this month – which also saw  sweeping wins  for Democrats in New Jersey and Virginia – Trump has signalled a willingness to defrost relations. In a speech to the American Business Forum in Florida, the president appeared to walk back his funding threat even as he railed against communism.\n\n“We’ll help him, we’ll help him. We want New York to be successful. We’ll help him a little bit, maybe,” he said.\n\nNumerous Republicans and MAGA supporters have launched  vitriolic and racist attacks  on Mamdani in the build-up to the mayoral election and after Mamdani swept to victory.\n\nDays before the election day, Mamdani gave an emotional speech addressing “racist, baseless attacks” from his opponents. Speaking outside a mosque in the Bronx, Mamdani criticised opponents for bringing “hatred to the forefront”, noting that their Islamophobia not only affected him as the Democratic nominee for mayor but also  close to one million Muslims  living in New York.\n\nEarlier this week, Mamdani told reporters his team contacted the White House because he had made a “commitment that showed a willingness to meet with anyone and everyone, so long as it is for the benefit” of New Yorkers.\n\n“The president ran a campaign where he spoke about a promise to deliver cheaper groceries, a promise to reduce the cost of living,” Mamdani said. “We are seeing his actions … leading to the exact opposite effect for New Yorkers. I will go to make the case, to the president, and to anyone, frankly, that these are the kinds of things we need to change.”"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/brandon-lake-christian-grammys-cmas-charlie-kirk-85651b4d0f140415fc99d47f3b2e2ace","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"15:30:24Z","title":"Brandon Lake's Crossover Success and Role in National Spiritual Response Amid Political Violence","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Brandon Lake, a Christian music artist, is gaining widespread mainstream recognition with his 2025 album 'King of Hearts,' which blends pop, rock, country, and hip-hop, reaching No. 7 on the Billboard 200.

2025-11-19T15:30:24+00:00\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — Fifteen miles south of Sin City, Brandon Lake is seated backstage at a packed arena in Henderson, Nevada. In a matter of hours, he will perform an energetic, “family-friendly” show, as he tells The Associated Press, for thousands of people. He’s on the road with his latest album, 2025’s “King of Hearts,” a Christian music release that spans genre — pop, rock, country, hip-hop — a mixture not always associated with worship music. Its eclecticism is one of the many reasons why his music is connecting. The album peaked at No. 7 on the all-genre Billboard 200 chart, an undeniable feat for a contemporary Christian music (CCM) release, and earned Lake his first Top 40 hit: “Hard Fought Hallelujah” with country singer Jelly Roll . “It’s the marriage of awesome production with an awesome message. A message of hope,” says Lake. “There is strength that can be found, and hope that can be found, in the midst of the hell that you are walking through. And then you pair that with like an awesome sound and it’s like, who’s not going to love that?” More coverage Utah campus where Charlie Kirk was shot provided less security than other venues as he toured nation A timeline of Charlie Kirk’s assassination and the arrest of a suspect Charlie Kirk’s AI resurrection ushers in a new era of digital grief Lake’s award-winning moment Earlier this month, Lake was nominated for three Grammys at the 2026 award show in February; he already has five trophies to his name and a total 15 career-nods. “Being recognized, that is to me, that’s recognizing the millions of people’s lives that have been impacted by this music and the message,” he says of the nominations. “It’s definitely a pinch-me moment.” This year, he was nominated for his first Country Music Association Award as well: for musical event of the year, for “Hard Fought Hallelujah.” It’s not a Christian category — he found himself competing against secular artists. (Lake did not win: The category was announced ahead of the CMAs on Wednesday.) “I think it is a crossover moment and I pray that it is. I’m trying to cross over, into any and every space that God will allow that is authentic to who I am,” Lake says. “I grew up on country music; I grew up on Christian music. ... And if you listen to my music, it is very diverse, you know? Quote-unquote Christian music, worship music ... it doesn’t really make sense having a genre, because it’s what we do with our lives. It’s not a sound.” It’s a contemporary approach that reflects modern listening habits, too. Holly Zabka, president of Provident, a Sony subsidiary dedicated to Christian music, uses her daughter as an example to explain the trend. “She doesn’t define her musical taste by genre. I think that’s what we’re seeing. She’ll go from a Luke Combs song to a Brandon Lake song to Harry Styles, that’s how she listens. She’s a fan of everything. And I think that’s where Christian music is finding its footing as well. It can exist alongside every other genre.” A Christian crossover movement Lake is at the forefront of a new musical movement in the U.S., where Christian artists are growing in popularity. According to a midyear report from Luminate, the industry data and analytics company, streams of new music — recordings released in the last 18 months — are slightly down from the same time last year, except in the case of Christian/gospel music. Jaime Marconette, Luminate’s vice president of music insights and industry relations, attributed the genre’s growth to “younger, streaming-forward fanbase,” which is 60% female and 30% millennial. Artists like Lake, Forrest Frank and Elevation Worship are leading the charge. “I pray it’s just the beginning, and I pray that it takes over,” Lake says. “And not the genre of Christian music, but songs — whatever genre they are — that carry the message of the gospel.” He’s also got a few theories on the music’s growing popularity. “The reason why people are turning their ear towards those kinds of songs right now is because that’s what they were made for,” he explained. “Music doesn’t just have to be entertainment. They can have a spiritual experience. They can be educated on who they were made to be. They can receive hope and life and faith. ... I love all kinds of music, but if you have a song that carries that kind of message, it’s just super charged, you know? It does something deeper.” That is especially crucial, Lake says, in a divided world. “I think people are waking up — especially the state of our world and all the craziness that’s going on — everyone’s like, ‘We need to choose love.’ Well, the greatest demonstration of love is the gospel.” The Charlie Kirk connection In September, Lake performed at a memorial service for the late conservative personality Charlie Kirk, who was shot and killed at a Utah college event. His death was one of an escalating number of attacks on political figures, from the assassination of Democratic state lawmaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark Hortman, in Minnesota to last summer’s shooting of Donald Trump, that have roiled the nation. “I didn’t know him at all. And so, the invitation really came out of nowhere,” Lake said of his decision to perform at the ceremony. Lake said his team told him that the Kirk family “listened to my music and, you know, it was a soundtrack of their faith,” and when Lake’s wife urged him to perform, there was no hesitancy. “We quickly said we are not going there to make a political statement. And there will be so much politics represented in the room,” he continued. “We are going to minister to a widow.” “While the world was turning to violence, we watched a lot of millions of people turn to worship and chose to sing praise to God,” he said. “Even though there was politics represented, the gospel was shared so many times. And it was like God was weaving in and out. ... It was just such an incredible honor.” ___ This story corrects the song title “Hard Fought Hallelujah.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/14/at-least-2-dead-21-missing-in-landslides-in-indonesias-java-island","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"05:54:13+00:00","title":"At least 2 dead, 21 missing in landslides in Indonesia’s Java island","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A landslide in Cilacap district, Central Java, Indonesia, caused by several days of heavy rainfall, resulted in at least two deaths and 21 people missing.

Hajjaj remembers from the Israeli bombing of her Gaza City home is that her mother held her and prayed.\n\nWhen Hajjaj woke up, she found herself in a hospital with a machine on her stomach and her “whole body trembling,” Abu Hajjaj told Al Jazeera.\n\n“I touched my body and it was all burned,” she said. “A doctor was speaking to me, and I asked him where my father and mother were. He didn’t answer me.”\n\nThe Israeli attack in Gaza City’s al-Saffaweh area had killed both her parents and left Abu Hajjaj – who is nine years old – with third-degree burns.\n\nShe is not alone in the horrific fallout from  Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza . Nearly 42,000 people – about 2 percent of Gaza’s population – have received “life-changing” injuries, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated in September. As many as a quarter of them are children.\n\nMore than 3,350 people have experienced major burns, making them among the most common injuries the WHO has recorded. Children are “clearly disproportionately affected”, the organisation added. About 70 percent of people receiving burn surgery in Gaza were children, mostly aged under five, and many were burned during bomb blasts.\n\n“When I look in the mirror, I say to myself: ‘Oh God, look at these wounds, they are very bad wounds,'” Abu Hajjaj said, scrolling through photos of heavy scarring on her neck, her arm and her leg. “I have wounds here and here, and on my hand as well.”\n\nStill, she found it difficult to imagine the loss of her parents. Even when her grandfather explained that they were waiting for her in paradise, Abu Hajjaj said, she kept telling herself they must be alive.\n\n“I finally understood they were not when my grandfather took me to live with him,” she said. “Then I realised that my father and mother had died and I started crying.”\n\nMore than 39,000 children in Gaza have  lost one or both  of their parents, the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics said in April, about 17,000 of whom have been parentless since Israel started its war on Gaza in October 2023.\n\nAbu Hajjaj now lives with her grandparents and other relatives who survived, including her brother.\n\nSpeaking from outside the family home – surrounded by rubble from destruction to the neighbourhood – she said she felt “some joy” when she realised her brother was still alive.\n\n“I also found my grandmother, my aunt and my grandfather. They are by my side,” she said. “When we met and I saw my brother, I felt a little happy, but my heart was sad for my father and mother who passed away.”\n\nNow, the little girl has turned to drawing to express her feelings about the loss of her parents and childhood home.\n\n“It helps me forget everything that happened,” she said. “The last drawing I did was of the house that was destroyed.”\n\nShe did not draw her home in its final state, however.\n\n“I rebuilt it in the picture, and I put in a swing and a tree,” Abu Hajjaj said. “I drew the tree because my father had planted a tree.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/11/why-has-canada-lost-its-measles-free-status-and-could-the-us-be-next","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"14:15:46+00:00","title":"Why has Canada lost its measles-free status – and could the US be next?","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Canada has lost its measles elimination status after a widespread outbreak began in October 2024, with cases reported in all provinces and territories and 5,000 confirmed cases and two deaths.

its measles “elimination” status, which, by default, has caused the overall Americas region to lose its status as well.\n\nIn a statement issued on Monday, the country’s Public Health Agency stated that Canada was experiencing a “large, multi-jurisdictional outbreak of measles” which began in October last year.\n\nOver the past year, the agency has recorded cases in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, Saskatchewan and the Northwest Territories. Overall, 5,000 positive cases of the illness and the deaths of two premature babies have been reported.\n\n“Canada can re-establish its measles elimination status once transmission of the measles strain associated with the current outbreak is interrupted for at least 12 months,” the agency said.\n\nBut Antony Black, a senior lecturer in life sciences at the University of Westminster in England, told Al Jazeera that Canada’s loss of its elimination status represented a “major backwards step on the path towards the control of this highly infectious and serious disease”.\n\nHere’s what we know about the loss of the elimination status:\n\nIt is a highly infectious virus which can be life-threatening if not caught early.\n\nThe illness, which is spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes, begins with cold-like symptoms, including a runny nose, high temperature and sore, red eyes.\n\nA few days after infection, small white spots can appear inside the cheeks and on the back of the lips. A rash then begins on the face and behind the ears before spreading across the body – the main telltale sign of the illness, according to information from NHS England.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, measles can cause pneumonia and become life-threatening. Babies and anyone with a weakened immune system are most at risk.\n\nMeasles is widely prevented through the use of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine, which is administered in two doses to children at one year old and three years old.\n\nAccording to the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), two doses of the vaccine are 97 percent effective in preventing a measles infection.\n\nThe “elimination” designation, which Canada has had since 1998, indicates that no locally transmitted infections or outbreaks have been reported in the past 12 months. This is no longer the case.\n\nMark Joffe, Alberta’s chief medical officer until earlier this year, blamed low take-up of vaccinations and told the Reuters news agency last month that more could have been done in the country to boost immunisation rates.\n\n“If the vaccination rates were high, this would never have happened. There may have been [some spread], but nothing like this,” Joffe said.\n\nAccording to the WHO and the US CDC, the main reason measles is spreading is that  fewer people are taking up vaccines  across the Americas region generally.\n\nOne contributing factor for low vaccination rates is a growing distrust of healthcare providers following the COVID-19 pandemic, in which anti-vaccine misinformation spread.\n\nAccording to Black, the pandemic became a “major challenge to health systems worldwide” whose facilities were overstretched meaning people missed opportunities to be vaccinated.\n\nVaccine hesitancy has also increased in many places, Black explained.\n\n“Vaccine hesitancy has been around in different forms for over 200 years, but the huge success of the COVID-19 vaccines in curbing the COVID-19 pandemic had given some hope that vaccine hesitancy would diminish. However, that has not happened,” he said.\n\n“Instead, we see the rise of mistrust of vaccines in general. The causes of mistrust are many and complex, but a main reason is the spread of misinformation and disinformation…there now needs to be a push to counteract this mistrust, for example by public health outreach and awareness campaigns, in addition to strengthening Canada’s vaccination registry system to allow better and more targeted interventions,” he added.\n\nOne of the most persistent myths driving MMR vaccine hesitancy was the claim that it causes autism. This belief stemmed from a 1998 study, which has since been discredited and retracted. There is no scientific evidence of any link between the MMR vaccine and autism.\n\nIn some US states and Canadian provinces, exemptions for vaccine mandates – giving non-medical reasons for declining vaccines, such as for personal or religious reasons – are becoming more common. This has led to the existence of clusters of unvaccinated people who are more vulnerable to outbreaks when exposed to the virus.\n\nSome communities, such as the Mennonites – Anabaptist Christians who have communities in the US, Canada and Mexico – have low vaccination rates, as conservative branches of the community do not believe in modern medicine.  Several outbreaks  in the past year have been traced to Mennonite communities.\n\nOverall in Canada, according to public health data, measles immunisation also fell during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, when lockdowns made it harder to access general healthcare, and continued afterwards.\n\nIn 2019, 89.5 percent of children in Canada received their first dose of the MMR vaccine. But by 2023, that figure had dropped to 82.5 percent.\n\nIn the US, during the 2024-2025 school year, 92.7 percent of children received the vaccine, according to the CDC.\n\nIn Mexico, according to World Health Organization (WHO) figures, 79.86 percent of children received the first dose of the MMR vaccine.\n\nAt least 95 percent of a population is required to be vaccinated in order to achieve “herd immunity” against measles. Herd immunity means enough people have been vaccinated to make it too hard for the disease to spread.\n\nExperts say the safest way to maintain herd immunity is through vaccination programmes.\n\nAccording to the WHO, measles vaccination prevented an estimated 31.7 million deaths globally between 2000 and 2020.\n\nThe MMR vaccine, widely used around the world, provides about 97 percent protection against the measles virus, according to public health agencies.\n\nThe vaccine is normally given to children in two stages: The first dose at 12 months and the second at about three years and four months of age (when the child is nearing pre-school age), as part of routine immunisation programmes in countries like  the United Kingdom .\n\nBreakthrough cases in vaccinated people are rare and usually mild.\n\nAccording to the Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO), part of the wider World Health Organization, Canada’s loss of its status means that “the Region of the Americas has lost its verification as free from endemic measles transmission”.\n\nOnce the MMR vaccine was approved for distribution in 1963, healthcare practitioners and school programmes were initiated in Canada, pushing for families to receive immunisation.\n\nBy 1998, Canada had achieved its measles elimination status. Two years later, the US achieved its elimination status, as well.\n\nBy 2016, the Americas region was declared free from measles, which meant that every country in the region had reached elimination status.\n\nFollowing an outbreak in Venezuela and Brazil in 2018, the Americas lost its regional elimination status, only to have it reinstated last year once the outbreak was brought under control.\n\nNow, the Americas region has lost its elimination status once again because of the Canadian outbreak. While many individual countries within the region still have their elimination status, measles cases are on the rise, generally.\n\nAs of November 7, the PAHO said, there were 12,596 cases of measles across the region, with about 95 percent reported in Canada, Mexico and the  United States .\n\nThe PAHO said this was a “30-fold increase compared to 2024″.\n\nTwenty-eight deaths have been recorded: 23 in Mexico, three in the United States, and two in Canada.\n\nJarbas Barbosa, director of PAHO, said the region’s loss of its elimination status was a “setback – but it is also reversible”.\n\n“Until measles is eliminated worldwide, our region will continue to face the risk of reintroduction and spread of the virus among unvaccinated or under-vaccinated populations. However, as we have demonstrated before, with political commitment, regional cooperation, and sustained vaccination, the region can once again interrupt transmission and reclaim this collective achievement,” Barbosa said.\n\nCurrently, active outbreaks are occurring in Mexico, the US, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Belize, which have been “mostly triggered by imported cases”, according to PAHO.\n\nMexico had reported 5,019 measles cases by October 31, according to  data  from PAHO. The cases are concentrated in the northern state of Chihuahua.\n\nJust seven cases were reported in the whole of Mexico last year. A 31-year-old unvaccinated man from Ascension, Chihuahua, died from the disease in early April this year and at least 14 deaths have been reported since then, according to PAHO.\n\nIn the US, since January, a measles outbreak has led to 1,681 confirmed cases, according to the CDC last week.\n\nIn February, it reported its first measles death in a decade after an unvaccinated child fell ill amid an outbreak in Texas. The school-aged child died overnight after being hospitalised in Lubbock, northwest Texas, the state’s health department said.\n\nOf those who have tested positive for the disease, 92 percent were unvaccinated or had unknown  vaccination status .\n\nDemetre Daskalakis, a former CDC official, told Reuters that the US has a deadline of January 20 to prove that it has curbed the outbreak if it is to retain its elimination status.\n\nYes. In late 2023 and early 2024, there was a surge in measles cases in the UK, particularly in England.\n\nIn 2024 as a whole, there were 2,911 laboratory-confirmed measles cases in England, the highest number of cases recorded in a year, since 2012, according to the UK Health Security Agency.\n\nIn comparison, there were only two confirmed cases of measles across the whole of the UK in 2021 and 54 one year later.\n\nThere was another surge in cases in April 2025 – particularly in London and the northwest of the country – the agency said, but cases have since been declining. In 2025 so far, there have been 811 confirmed measles cases in England.\n\nWestern Australia, where 54 cases of measles have been recorded since the start of this year, is currently experiencing its worst outbreak of measles since 1997, according to Australian media."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/20/chinas-evs-dominate-the-world-why-not-in-the-us-and","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"07:38:38+00:00","title":"China’s EVs dominate the world — why not in the US and Canada?","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"China has become the world’s largest manufacturer and exporter of electric vehicles, producing over 12 million EVs in 2024 and exporting nearly 40% of the global total.

summit, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva helped open a new mega-factory at the site of a former Ford car manufacturing plant.\n\nThe new plant, in Brazil’s Camacari, Bahia, is one of many being built around the world by China’s BYD, the world’s largest manufacturer of electric cars.\n\nBYD’s presence is also being felt at the ongoing  COP30 climate summit  in Brazil’s Belem, where it is a cosponsor alongside GWM, another Chinese electric carmaker.\n\nThe sponsorship is just one of many ways that China’s investments in green technology are being felt at the UN’s top climate meeting, where the Chinese official delegation of 789 people is second only to Brazil’s 3,805.\n\nIt is a stark contrast to the United States, whose federal government has not sent an official delegation. California’s Governor  Gavin Newsom  has accused US President Donald Trump of “handing the future to China” and leaving states like California to pick up the slack, in a speech at the summit.\n\n“ China is here. Only one country’s not here: United States of America,” Newsom said. Trump has called concerns over climate change a “hoax” and a “con job”.\n\nBut the UN Climate Change Conference COP30 is not the only event where the diverging paths that China and the US are taking on addressing the climate crisis are being felt.\n\nBack in the US, and in neighbouring Canada, trade barriers aimed at punishing Chinese electric vehicles have made them far costlier than what the manufacturers want to sell them for.\n\nThese tariffs are a legacy of former US President Joe Biden’s administration, and place North America as an outlier at a time when Chinese EVs otherwise dominate the global market.\n\nJoel Jaeger, a senior research associate with the World Resources Institute, told Al Jazeera that Chinese EVs have “really upended the car market” in recent years.\n\nChina has gone “from basically not a major player five years ago” to becoming “the number one exporter of cars globally in terms of the units”, says Jaeger.\n\nAccording to the International Energy Agency (IEA), China manufactured 12.4 million electric cars in 2024, more than 70 percent of the 17.3 million electric cars manufactured globally last year.\n\nOf these, China exported about 1.25 million cars, representing 40 percent of global exports, while the remaining Chinese-made cars — the vast majority — were sold domestically.\n\nThis dominance has been built on the back of “subsidies that China’s put in place to develop its industry, which I think is a very strategic thing that China has done, both for its own economic growth as well as decarbonisation”, Jaeger said.\n\nBut on the streets of the US or Canada, Chinese EVs are still relatively rare.\n\nAccording to Jaeger, “prohibitive” tariffs mean that Chinese EVs are almost impossible to buy in the US and Canada.\n\n“In the last year, the US and  Canada  both put on basically completely prohibitive tariffs on EVs [of] over 100 percent in both places,” he added.\n\nNotably, the steep import taxes on Chinese EVs in the US were introduced under Biden, a Democrat, who  championed renewable energy , in contrast to Trump, who has pledged to fight it and  “drill, baby, drill”  for oil.\n\nA month after the US introduced 100 percent tariffs on Chinese EVs in September 2024, Canada brought in identical tariffs of its own.\n\nIt means that a car that a Chinese EV manufacturer might be selling at $30,000 actually costs at least $60,000 in the US or Canada. This makes it hard for even cheaper Chinese models to compete with the higher-end US electric models, which on average retail for approximately $55,000.\n\nThese tariffs, along with other US policies, have meant that Chinese manufacturers have yet to set up shop in the US.\n\nIn Canada, Addisu Lashitew, an associate professor of business at McMaster University, told Al Jazeera that the steep tariffs conflict with targets set to transition fully to electric cars by 2035, but are also complicated due to Canada’s close trading ties with the US.\n\n“The problem is that one, we are going through a very complex trade talk with the US now,” said Lashitew. “And two, our supply chain has also [been] very much integrated. Many of the American manufacturers are here, and Canadian firms are mainly suppliers.”\n\nBut while it is almost impossible to buy a cheap Chinese electric car in the US, Jaeger says this does not mean that North America is completely missing out on importing new Chinese technology.\n\n“The US, for example, imports a lot of batteries from China. It’s actually the second-biggest importer of lithium-ion batteries behind Germany in the world, from China. So, they’re using them in US-made EVs,” he said.\n\nIn contrast with the US and Canada, said Jaeger, many other countries have been more open to China’s EV market.\n\n“You see different reactions from different countries, depending on their relationship with China, but mostly depending upon their domestic auto manufacturing presence,” he said.\n\nLashitew told Al Jazeera that Chinese exporters, including BYD as well as some smaller firms, are “targeting many emerging and developing countries”.\n\n“Ironically, we’re in a situation where in the transportation sector, the energy transition is happening much faster in the Global South than in North America, at least.”\n\nChinese electric cars have also continued to sell well in many European countries, says Jaeger, despite those countries also imposing some tariffs, though lower than the US and Canada, “for what they see as unfair competitive practices in China”.\n\nStill, while BYD has built factories in Japan, Hungary and India, as well as Brazil, its biggest presence remains in China, where the company was founded in Shenzhen in 1995. A majority of the 4.27 million electric cars that BYD sold in 2024 were bought by Chinese consumers. BYD also has a manufacturing presence in Lancaster, California, where it builds electric buses and batteries, but not cars.\n\nIn China, the local market has grown in part due to incentives from the government, which also saw electric cars as part of its strategy to  bring down air pollution  in big cities like Beijing and Shanghai.\n\nCustomers in China have benefitted from the government’s approach, including through access to new technology. For example, a new battery, which BYD announced in March with the promise of charging for 400km (about 250 miles) of travel in just five minutes, is first being made available for preorder to customers in China only.\n\nThey used to be costlier than cars that run on petrol or diesel. But according to the IEA, the cost of owning an electric car over the vehicle’s entire lifetime is now less than fossil fuel-powered cars, due to the reduced costs of fuel and maintenance.\n\nBuying an electric car is still often more expensive, though.\n\nThat is where China’s subsidies to manufacturers help. The IEA has found that prices for electric cars in China are similar to petrol and diesel cars, with half of all electric cars being sold for less than $30,000 and a wide range of lower-priced models available.\n\nBy contrast, in the US and Europe, “the range [of available EVs] was skewed towards higher-end models with higher prices”, according to the IEA.\n\nUnder Biden, the US tried to boost its domestic electric vehicle industry, while also trying to get the sector to reduce dependence on China.\n\nBiden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) introduced incentives for US manufacturers that did not use any Chinese parts. The IRA also introduced subsidies for consumers who bought EVs, though these have largely been overturned by Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill, which became law in July.\n\nNevertheless, even with the Biden-era incentives, only one in 10 cars sold in the US in 2024 was electric, while more than half of all new cars sold last year in China were electric.\n\nWhile electric cars grab most headlines on sustainable transport, people are also increasingly turning to electric bicycles, scooters, motorcycles, buses and even trains in many parts of the world.\n\nEven in the US, says Jaeger, there has been a significant growth in the number of electric scooters and two-wheelers imported from China.\n\nAccording to data from the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC), the US imported $1.5bn worth of electric two-wheelers from China in the 12 months up to September 2025, an increase of $275m — or more than 20 percent — from the previous year. Experts say that is because scooters are cheaper than cars, and because US tariffs on Chinese electric scooters are also lower than on electric cars.\n\nMeanwhile, in Vietnam, the government has said it will  ban petrol-powered motorbikes  in the centre of its capital, Hanoi, from July next year, as part of a plan to tackle local air pollution.\n\nAccording to the IEA, some 40 percent of bus sales are now electric in European countries, including Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands and Norway.\n\nThere have also been increases in electric bus sales in Central and South America. In Mexico, for example, “close to 18 percent of all bus sales were electric in 2024, up from just above 1 percent in 2023”, according to the IEA.\n\nStill, the US continues to struggle here, too. Electric bus sales declined in 2024, according to the IEA, after the leading electric bus manufacturer went bankrupt and a second company stopped manufacturing in the US market after suffering sustained financial losses."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/20/explosive-weapons-caused-record-child-deaths-last-year-save-the-children","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"09:26:39+00:00","title":"Explosive weapons caused record child deaths last year: Save the Children","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In 2024, nearly 12,000 children were killed or injured globally due to explosive weapons, with 70% of these cases attributed to such weapons.

weapons caused record child deaths last year: Save the Children\n\nNearly 12,000 children were killed or injured in conflicts worldwide last year, of which 70 percent were a result of explosives, the United Kingdom-based charity Save the Children has said, with those in Gaza suffering the most from Israeli attacks.\n\nThis was the highest number since records began in 2006 and was up by 42 percent on the 2020 total, the group said in a new report published on Thursday.\n\nExplosive weapons killed or injured children at record levels last year, as wars increasingly move into urban areas, the report, called Children and Blast Injuries, revealed.\n\n“The world is witnessing the deliberate destruction of childhood – and the evidence is undeniable,” said Narmina Strishenets, senior conflict and humanitarian advocacy adviser at Save the Children UK.\n\n“Children are paying the highest price in today’s wars … Missiles are falling where children sleep, play and learn – turning the very places that should be the safest, like their homes and schools, into death traps.”\n\nPreviously, children in war zones were more likely to die from malnutrition, disease or failing health systems.\n\nBut as conflicts take place more frequently in urban areas, children are being caught up as bombs and drones strike hospitals, schools and residential areas, Save the Children said.\n\n“Actions once condemned by the international community and met with global outrage are now brushed aside as the ‘cost of war.’ That moral surrender is one of the most dangerous shifts of our time.”\n\nThe conflicts that claimed the most casualties among children in 2024 were in the Palestinian territories of  Gaza and the occupied West Bank , Sudan, Myanmar, Ukraine and Syria.\n\nThe deadliest conflict in recent years for children is in Gaza, where 20,000 children have been killed in  Israel’s genocidal war  on the coastal enclave since October 7, 2023.\n\nThe United Nations children’s agency UNICEF estimates that more than 64,000 children have been killed or injured in Gaza by Israel. Homes, hospitals and schools have been destroyed, while essential medical services have collapsed.\n\nAccording to Save the Children’s report, Gaza now has the “largest cohort of  child amputees  in modern history”.\n\nDespite a ceasefire taking effect on October 10, Israeli attacks have continued,  killing hundreds of Palestinians  across the enclave. According to Gaza’s Health Ministry, at least 46 children have been killed in Israeli attacks since the ceasefire.\n\n“In 2024, the use of explosive weapons in Gaza left an average of 475 children each month with potentially lifelong disabilities such as amputations, severe burns, complex fractures and hearing loss,” the report said.\n\nIn  war-ravaged Sudan , the UK charity revealed some 10 million children were living within 5km (3.1 miles) of “active conflict zones”.\n\n“Explosive weapons have caused devastating child casualties: over 1,200 children were killed or injured in 2023, rising to 1,739 in 2024 – a near-40 percent rise in just one year,” the report said.\n\nIn  Ukraine , the number of children injured or “maimed” by explosive weapons increased by 70 percent – from 339 children in 2023 to 577 in 2024, it added.\n\nChildren’s smaller bodies and developing organs mean injuries from blasts can be much more severe, and recovery can be more complex and prolonged.\n\n“Children are far more vulnerable to explosive weapons than adults,” Paul Reavley, a consultant paediatric emergency physician and cofounder of the Paediatric Blast Injury Partnership, a coalition between Save the Children UK, Imperial College London and other partners, said in a statement.\n\n“Their anatomy, physiology, behaviour and psychosocial needs make them disproportionately affected.”\n\nMeanwhile, Anthony Bull, director of the Centre for Paediatric Blast Injury Studies at Imperial College London, said treating injuries from bomb blasts was “far from straightforward”.\n\n“It takes specialised knowledge and continued research to ensure children can not only recover but grow after amputation or surgery,” he said.\n\nThe report warned that the impact of explosives will last well beyond periods of active bombardment, whether “through explosive remnants of war that continue to threaten lives or the lasting mental health impacts on affected communities”."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/20/eu-says-any-peace-plan-must-consult-ukraine-europe-doubts-russian-intent","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"10:05:39+00:00","title":"EU says any peace plan must consult Ukraine, Europe, doubts Russian intent","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The European Union is firmly opposing a proposed US-backed peace plan for Ukraine that would require Ukraine to surrender parts of the Donbas region and reduce its military, arguing that any lasting peace must include consultation from both Ukraine and European nations.

2025-11-20T10:05:39+00:00\n\nTitle: EU says any peace plan must consult Ukraine, Europe, doubts Russian intent\n\nEuropean leaders are adamant that any plan to end Russia’s war in Ukraine will need support from both the European Union and Ukraine amid speculation of a potential  United States-backed plan  that would heavily favour Moscow’s demands and narrative.\n\nArriving for a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels on Thursday, EU foreign policy head Kaja Kallas told reporters that Europeans have always supported “long-lasting and just peace, and we welcome any efforts to achieve that”.\n\n“Of course, for any plan to work, it needs Ukrainians and Europeans on board,” she added.\n\nOther top diplomats from Germany, Spain and Poland echoed Kallas, with Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski saying that Europe – whose security is “at stake” – expects to be consulted on any potential deal.\n\n“I hope it’s not the victim that has restrictions on its ability to defend itself put on, but it’s the aggressor,” he said.\n\nRussia, however, appeared to push off the idea of negotiations, saying again on Thursday that a deal with Ukraine would have to eliminate the root causes of the conflict and that there are no negotiations ongoing with Washington on such a plan.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined to comment on whether Russian President Vladimir Putin had been briefed on the details of the reported Ukraine peace plan, Reuters news agency reported.\n\nEuropean nations have been increasingly concerned that the war may spill into their borders, and there have been numerous accusations and instances of the Kremlin undertaking actions of shadow war, testing the EU and the United Kingdom’s mettle with aggressive cyberattacks and drone intrusions.\n\nThe UK on Wednesday  warned it is ready to use “military options”  if necessary after a Russian spy ship that has spent weeks on the edge of British waters directed lasers at British pilots sent to monitor the vessel.\n\nWord of the US proposal came as a deadly wave of Russian attacks  killed at least 26  people in Ukraine’s city of Ternopil on Wednesday, including three children.\n\nAnother 22 people were still missing as of Thursday morning, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wrote on X, with more than 230 first responders deployed in search and rescue efforts.\n\n“Once again, the Russians have killed innocent, peaceful people who were simply sleeping in their homes,” the president said.\n\nUkrainian Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko separately welcomed Secretary of the US Army Daniel Driscoll to Ukraine on Thursday, writing on X that the visit was “an important opportunity for the senior military officials accompanying the secretary to assess the situation on the ground and to witness firsthand the consequences of Russian aggression”.\n\nNews reports released on Wednesday, quoting unnamed officials, meanwhile, said the US proposal was created in consultation with Russian officials and closely hews to Russia’s vision for ending the war.\n\nThe Financial Times reported the 28-point plan was delivered by US envoy Steve Witkoff in a meeting with Rustem Umerov, secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defence Council, in Miami, Florida, in the US earlier this week.\n\nIt would require Ukraine to give up the rest of the eastern region of Donbas – long  eyed by Russia  for its industrial history and strategic location, and where fierce fighting rages – including territory under Kyiv’s control. The proposal would also demand cuts to Ukraine’s military, several outlets reported.\n\nUkraine’s Zelenskyy – who  sparred with  US President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance in a dramatic meeting in February – has been clear since Russia’s 2022 invasion that potential peace talks ought not sideline Ukraine, a viewpoint shared by much of the EU’s leadership.\n\n“We, as a sovereign country, simply will not be able to accept any agreements without us,” Zelenskyy  said ahead of that contentious meeting.\n\nHe has since repeatedly made clear several red lines that neither the Ukrainian government nor its constitution would permit, including ceding its territory.\n\nStill, some European leaders have offered less enthusiasm. Hungary’s Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said the EU should stop sending money to Ukraine in seeming reference to an  ongoing corruption probe  involving an alleged $100m energy kickback scheme.\n\nLast week, Ukraine’s Justice Minister German Galushchenko and Energy Minister Svitlana Hrynchuk submitted their resignations as anticorruption authorities said they had detained five people suspected of an alleged plot to control procurement at nuclear agency Energoatom.\n\n“There’s a war mafia, a corrupt system working in Ukraine, and then the European Commission president … instead of stopping the payments and demanding for immediate financial clearance, she wants to send another 100 billion to Ukraine. That is insane,” Szijjarto said.\n\nHungary’s right-wing populist leader Victor Orban, who counts Russian Putin as an ally, has been  blocking Ukraine’s EU bid,  received an  exemption  on Russian energy sanctions from Trump and a “ financial shield ” to safeguard its economy in recent weeks.\n\n“The time is not on the side of Ukraine. It is an illusion to say that the time is on the side of Ukraine,” Szijjarto said, adding that he would support Trump’s peace initiatives."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/20/chinese-woman-who-became-philippines-mayor-gets-life-for-human-trafficking","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"07:38:00+00:00","title":"Chinese woman who became Philippines mayor gets life for human trafficking","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Alice Guo, a Chinese national who falsely claimed Philippine citizenship, was elected mayor of Bamban, a town north of Manila, but was later found ineligible due to her foreign nationality.

mayor of a town north of Manila, was found guilty on Thursday of running a Chinese-operated gambling centre where hundreds of people were conscripted to carry out online scams on members of the public.\n\nState prosecutor Olivia Torrevillas said that Guo – who was  arrested in Indonesia in September 2024  after fleeing the Philippines – and seven other defendants would be jailed for life.\n\n“After over just one year, the court … gave us a favourable decision. Alice (Guo) was convicted along with seven other co-accused. Life imprisonment,” Torrevillas said outside the regional court in Manila.\n\nIn March 2024, police raided the sprawling centre linked to Guo, which included office buildings, luxury villas and a large swimming pool, after a Vietnamese worker escaped and alerted police.\n\nMore than 700 Filipinos, Chinese, Vietnamese, Malaysians, Taiwanese, Indonesians and Rwandans were found at the site, along with documents allegedly showing that Guo was president of a company that owned the compound.\n\nA spokesperson for the Philippine Anti-Organised Crime Commission told reporters that Guo and three others had been convicted of “organising trafficking” inside the compound. Four others were found guilty of “acts of trafficking”, the spokesman said.\n\nAlthough Guo was elected mayor of Bamban town, the location of the scam centre raided by police, a Manila court ruled in June that, as a Chinese citizen, she was never eligible to run for the position in the first place.\n\n“Her appointment and entire mayoral team were also declared void,” Philippine broadcaster ABS-CBN said in a report on Guo’s trial on Thursday.\n\nABS-CBN said that during inquiries into Guo’s activities, politicians alleged that she was “not a Filipino but a Chinese national who skirted Philippine civil registry, immigration and election laws as an asset of the Chinese government”.\n\nThe AFP news agency said the Chinese embassy in Manila did not immediately return calls seeking comment on Thursday.\n\nPhilippine Senator Risa Hontiveros said Guo’s conviction followed after a Senate investigation and was a “victory against corruption, human trafficking, cybercrime, and many other transnational crimes”.\n\n“We will continue to demand accountability from every government agency that failed in their duties, and we will continue to investigate the full extent of Chinese intelligence operations in our country,” Hontiveros said.\n\n“And to all those who enabled Alice Guo’s criminal empire: the Philippines is not a playground for exploitation, infiltration and espionage. Accountability is coming.”\n\nThe cyberscam industry has thrived in Southeast Asia in recent years, particularly in Cambodia, Myanmar and the Philippines, where thousands of scammers are estimated to be involved in the online fraud business.\n\nAccording to a United Nations report, victims in the wider region were conned out of up to $37bn by online scammers in 2023."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/20/nigerias-tinubu-delays-g20-trip-amid-search-for-24-abducted-schoolgirls","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"10:22:28+00:00","title":"Nigeria’s Tinubu delays G20 trip amid search for 24 abducted schoolgirls","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Nigeria’s President Bola Tinubu has postponed his G20 summit trip to South Africa following the abduction of 24 schoolgirls in Maga, Kebbi State, and a deadly attack on a Christ Apostolic Church in Eruku.

of a Ukrainian man suspected of coordinating the sabotage of the  Nord Stream gas pipelines  between Russia and Europe in 2022.\n\nThe suspect, Serhii Kuznietsov, 49, has denied being part of a cell of saboteurs accused of placing explosives on the underwater pipelines in the Baltic Sea, severing much of  Russia’s gas transfers to Europe  and prompting supply shortages on the continent.\n\nAfter Italy originally blocked Kuznietsov’s extradition last month over an issue with a German arrest warrant, Italy’s Supreme Court of Cassation approved the transfer on Wednesday.\n\nKuznietsov “will therefore be surrendered to Germany within the next few days”, his lawyer Nicola Canestrini said.\n\nThe suspect, a former officer in the Ukrainian military, has  denied any role in the attack  and has fought attempts to transfer him to Germany since he was detained on a European arrest warrant in the Italian town of Rimini, where he was vacationing with his family, in August.\n\n“However great the disappointment, I remain confident in an acquittal after the full trial in Germany,” Canestrini said in a statement.\n\nLast month, a court in Poland ruled against handing over  another Ukrainian suspect  wanted by Germany in connection with the pipeline explosions and ordered his immediate release from detention.\n\nKuznietsov faces charges in Germany of collusion to cause an explosion, sabotage and destruction of important structures.\n\nGerman prosecutors said he used forged identity documents to charter a yacht that departed from the German city of Rostock to carry out the attack near the Danish island of Bornholm on September 26, 2022.\n\nAccording to extradition documents, prosecutors said Kuznietsov organised and carried out the detonation of at least four bombs containing 14kg to 27kg (31lb to 62lb) of explosives at a depth of 70 to 80 metres (230ft to 263ft).\n\nThe explosions damaged both the Nord Stream 1 and the Nord Stream 2 pipelines so severely that no gas could be transported through them. In total, four ruptures were discovered in the pipelines after the attack.\n\nKuznietsov says he was a member of the Ukrainian armed forces and in Ukraine at the time of the incident, a claim his defence team has said would give him “functional immunity” under international law.\n\nEarlier this month, members of the European Parliament (MEPs) sent a letter to Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni expressing concern about Kuznietsov’s extradition.\n\n“The destruction of the pipelines dealt a significant blow to Russia’s war machine in its ongoing war of aggression against Ukraine,” the MEPs wrote.\n\n“From the standpoint of international law, actions undertaken in defence against such aggression, including the neutralisation of the enemy’s military infrastructure, fall within the lawful conduct of a just war,” they wrote.\n\n“We, therefore, urge the Italian government to suspend any steps toward extradition until the guarantees of functional immunity and state responsibility are thoroughly and independently assessed,” they added.\n\nKuznietsov, who faces up to 15 years in prison if found guilty by a German court, has been held in a high security jail in Italy since his arrest and at one point staged a hunger strike to protest against his prison conditions.\n\nSix other suspects in the case remain at large."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/20/gustav-klimt-portrait-breaks-modern-art-record-with-236m-sale","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"06:06:07+00:00","title":"Gustav Klimt portrait breaks modern art record with $236m sale","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Gustav Klimt’s Portrait of Elisabeth Lederer sold for $236.4 million at Sotheby’s in New York, setting a new record for modern art.

storms to hit Earth, triggering northern lights: What we know\n\nScientists have issued alerts for approaching solar or geomagnetic storms, which are set to hit Earth this week and will produce bright, stunning displays of light known as auroras over parts of the United States, Canada and Europe, while also temporarily disrupting some communications.\n\nOn Tuesday, forecasters at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said significant geomagnetic disturbances had been recorded in the past few days, specifically in the form of several “coronal mass ejections” (CMEs), which occur when the sun issues bursts of energy. The agency issued a “G4” geomagnetic storm watch signal on a five-level scale, implying that severe storms could be expected.\n\nSome US residents have already shared videos online of northern lights – also known as aurora borealis – which will continue to appear over several US states on Wednesday.\n\nDid you catch the light show between the breaks in the clouds this evening?  #NorthernLights\n\nSpace Weather Center:  https://t.co/M5cIvJxUr1   pic.twitter.com/RiDXgF3BqI\n\n— NWS Reno (@NWSReno)  November 12, 2025\n\nHere’s what we know about the geomagnetic storms and why they occur.\n\nSolar storms occur as a result of sudden, eruptive disturbances on the sun.  A solar storm becomes a geomagnetic storm when it reaches the Earth.\n\nSolar storms can occur in two ways. One way is in the form of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which are sudden swellings of gases on the sun that burst from the sun and travel at more than 1 million mph (1.6 million km/h) towards Earth. Depending on how fast they travel, these can reach the Earth anytime between 15 hours and several days.\n\nSolar storms can also emerge in the form of solar flares, which are sudden eruptions of electromagnetic radiation reaching the Earth from the sun. These travel at the speed of light, reaching Earth in approximately eight minutes, and can last for several minutes or even hours.\n\nBoth phenomena happen when magnetic fields on the sun realign. They often, but not always, occur together.\n\nWhile CMEs can appear through solar telescopes as immense clouds of particles being hurled in a single direction, solar flares appear as bright flashes of light moving in multiple directions. As NASA describes it, think of it as the difference between a cannonball shot in one direction and the flash of a muzzle.\n\nThe NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center said on Tuesday that at least three CMEs would pass over Earth, most likely between Tuesday and Thursday.\n\nIn an update early on Wednesday, the agency noted that two of the CMEs, which first erupted on November 9 and 10, had already impacted Earth. They “packed quite a punch”, Shawn Dahl, a scientist with the agency, said in a video update posted on X.\n\nDahl said the storms were “profoundly more strong than we anticipated” and that while the agency had initially forecasted a G2-level storm, the storms were two levels stronger, at G4.\n\nA third, energetic CME, moving faster than the others, is now set to hit Earth on Wednesday, approximately at midday Eastern Time (17:00 GMT), the space agency said. That one erupted early on November 11 and caused temporary radio blackouts across Africa and Europe, according to Space.com, a leading space exploration publication.\n\nWhen strong bursts of energy erupting from the Sun’s surface as solar flares or CMEs hurtle towards Earth, the highly charged particles they carry collide with gases in the Earth’s upper atmosphere and transfer energy to them, causing the gases to glow and resulting in stunning displays of colourful lights, from emerald greens to intense pinks.\n\nKnown as aurora borealis, those displays can be seen from the Northern Hemisphere, hence the term “northern lights”. “Southern lights” or aurora australis are displays which can be seen in the Southern Hemisphere, although far fewer people inhabit the areas from which they are visible. The lights are only visible close to the poles because the Earth’s magnetic fields, which are strongest at the poles, guide the sun’s charged particles towards them.\n\nLight displays have become more common in recent months because the sun is currently at the maximum phase of an 11-year activity cycle.\n\nEvery 11 years, the sun’s poles swap places, causing intense magnetic activity. This period, called solar maximum, can last for several months. Scientists speculate that the end of the current cycle began last year and will continue at least through to the end of this year.\n\nIn May 2024, the strongest geomagnetic storm in two decades hit Earth and caused dazzling light displays across the US, the United Kingdom and Germany.\n\nThe northern lights shot with my iPhone (just this second) in Boulder, Colorado. This is a very impressive event!  pic.twitter.com/vkHS00PMLt\n\n— Dr. Ryan French (@RyanJFrench)  November 12, 2025\n\nSeveral countries have issued aurora alerts, with some residents already reporting brilliant colours in the sky on Tuesday night.\n\nBrightness and visibility usually depend on what time of day the solar bursts arrive in the Earth’s atmosphere and how they interact with it. Experts recommend leaving brightly-lit areas to see the lights better.\n\nAccording to NOAA, the lights have already appeared or are likely to appear above several areas in the US, including the states of Illinois (Chicago), Colorado, Massachusetts (Boston), Washington (Seattle), California (San Francisco, Los Angeles), Oregon (Portland), Texas (Dallas), Georgia (Atlanta), North Dakota (Bismarck), New York, Wyoming (Cheyenne), North Carolina (Raleigh) and Iowa.\n\nJust keeps going and these are just holding phone in long exposure mode of 3 seconds. Amazing display of Northern Lights captured in Carlow.  pic.twitter.com/ws2JQWUcs3\n\n— Carlow Weather (@CarlowWeather)  November 12, 2025\n\nOther sightings are expected or have been reported in\n\nNot directly to humans, because Earth’s atmosphere protects us from radiation.\n\nHowever, the bursts of energy could temporarily disrupt communication systems, potentially affecting GPS navigation, radio communications, and satellites, including air traffic control radio and satellites in space. The intense activity could also temporarily disrupt power grids.\n\nOn rare occasions, solar eruptions can be damaging. A severe solar storm in September 1859 caused sparks and fires in telegraph stations across Europe and North America. Known as the Carrington Event, those storms were the most intense in recorded history.\n\nIn August 1972, powerful geomagnetic events caused widespread electric and communications disruptions in the US and accidentally detonated US naval mines positioned in Vietnam.\n\nAccording to Dahl of the NOAA, the agency has alerted US air traffic officials, and a planned space launch, the details of which have not been disclosed, is likely to be cancelled. Power grid officials have also been alerted, he said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/4/scientists-watch-flare-with-10-trillion-suns-light-from-massive-black-hole","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"15:09:09Z","title":"Scientists watch flare with 10 trillion suns’ light from massive black hole","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Scientists have observed the most energetic flare ever recorded from a supermassive black hole, located 11 billion light years away in a distant galaxy.

light from massive black hole\n\nScientists have documented the most energetic flare ever observed emanating from a supermassive black hole, a cataclysmic event that briefly shone with the light of 10 trillion suns.\n\nThe new findings were published on Tuesday in the journal Nature Astronomy, with astronomer Matthew Graham of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) leading the study.\n\nThe phenomenal burst of energy was likely triggered when an unusually large star wandered too close to the black hole and was violently shredded and swallowed.\n\n“However it happened, the star wandered close enough to the supermassive black hole that it was ‘spaghettified’ – that is, stretched out to become long and thin, due to the gravity of the supermassive black hole strengthening as you get very close to it. That material then spiralled around the supermassive black hole as it fell in,” said astronomer and study co-author KE Saavik Ford.\n\nThe supermassive black hole was unleashed by a black hole roughly 300 million times the mass of the sun residing inside a faraway galaxy, about 11 billion light years from Earth. A light year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km).\n\nThe star, estimated to be between 30 and 200 times the mass of the sun, was turned into a stream of gas that heated up and shined intensely as it spiralled into oblivion.\n\nAlmost every large galaxy, including our Milky Way, has a supermassive black hole at its centre. But scientists still aren’t sure how they form.\n\nFirst spotted in 2018 by the Palomar Observatory, operated by the Caltech, the flare took about three months to reach its peak brightness, becoming roughly 30 times more luminous than any previously recorded event of its kind. It is still ongoing, but diminishing in luminosity, with the entire process expected to take about 11 years to complete.\n\nBecause of how far away the black hole is located, observing the flash gives scientists a rare glimpse into the universe’s early epoch. Studying these immense, distant black holes helps researchers better understand how they form, how they influence their local stellar neighbourhoods, and the fundamental interactions that shaped the cosmos we know today."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/11/20/live-israel-bombs-house-in-southern-gaza-kills-at-least-3-palestinians?update=4119347","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"06:15:00+00:00","title":"At least 5 people killed in Israeli air attacks on southern Gaza","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israeli air attacks in southern Gaza, specifically near the city of Khan Younis, have killed at least five people.

Pregnant women are advised to consult a doctor before taking the medication.\n\nThe World Health Organization reiterated the point in September, noting that “no consistent association has been established” between the medication and autism, despite “extensive research”.\n\nBut claims to the contrary have already prompted efforts to limit the availability of Tylenol, a popular brand of acetaminophen, a fever- and pain-reducing medication.\n\nOn Tuesday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton launched a lawsuit accusing Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue, the companies behind the over-the-counter pain reliever, of deceptive practices.\n\nIn doing so, he reiterated misinformation shared by President Donald Trump and government officials like Kennedy.\n\n“By holding Big Pharma accountable for poisoning our people, we will help Make America Healthy Again,” Paxton said in a statement, giving a nod to Kennedy’s MAHA slogan.\n\nThe suit alleges that Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue violated Texas consumer protection laws by having “deceptively marketed Tylenol as the only safe painkiller for pregnant women”.\n\nIt was the latest instance of scientific misinformation being perpetuated by top officials. Both Trump and Kennedy have repeatedly spread scientific misinformation throughout their political careers.\n\nTrump linked autism and the painkiller during a news conference in September, without providing reputable scientific findings to back the claim.\n\n“[Using] acetaminophen – is that OK? – which is basically, commonly known as Tylenol, during pregnancy can be associated with a very increased risk of autism,” Trump said on September 22. “So taking Tylenol is not good. I’ll say it. It’s not good.”\n\nKennedy has offered his own sweeping statements about Tylenol and its alleged risks, despite having no professional medical background.\n\n“Anyone who takes this stuff during pregnancy, unless they have to, is irresponsible,” he said in a cabinet meeting on October 9.\n\nKennedy also mischaracterised studies on male circumcision earlier this month. He  falsely  said the studies showed an increase in autism among children who were “circumcised early”.\n\n“It’s highly likely because they’re given Tylenol,” he added.\n\nKenvue stressed in a statement on Tuesday that acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women, noting that high fevers and pain are potential risks to pregnancies if left untreated.\n\n“We stand firmly with the global medical community that acknowledges the safety of acetaminophen and believe we will continue to be successful in litigation as these claims lack legal merit and scientific support,” Kenvue said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/14/whats-behind-a-surge-in-bear-attacks-in-japan","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"14:32:02+00:00","title":"What’s behind a surge in bear attacks in Japan?","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A significant surge in bear attacks across Japan—especially in northern prefectures like Akita, Iwate, and Hokkaido—has prompted urgent public and international concern.

in Japan?\n\nA deadly conflict between bears and humans is playing out across Japan, where authorities have deployed the military to protect locals who are using drone-based alert and surveillance systems to track the bears.\n\nSince April this year, at least 13 people have been  killed  and more than 100 have been injured in bear attacks in the country, according to an October report by the Ministry of Environment. The ministry added that the death toll is the highest since Japan began keeping records of bear attacks in 2006.\n\nJapan is home to big brown bears, which can weigh more than 450kg (1,000 pounds) and live in the country’s Hokkaido region, one of Japan’s northernmost islands known for its hot springs and volcanoes. It is also home to Asiatic black bears – also known as Moon bears – which are smaller in size, weighing between 80-200kg (176-440 pounds), and are found on the mainland, which is more densely populated.\n\nBoth types of bear have been involved in incidents this year, and both are dangerous to humans to varying degrees. Asiatic bear attacks are more frequent, but brown bear attacks are more dangerous.\n\nShota Mochizuki, associate professor at Fukushima University, told Al Jazeera: “This is largely because black bears are widely distributed across Honshu and Shikoku, where many people live, while brown bears inhabit only Hokkaido, resulting in fewer opportunities for encounters with humans.”\n\n“However, attacks by brown bears are far more severe. Brown bears are significantly larger and stronger, and their attacks much more often lead to serious injuries or fatalities,” he added.\n\nBut why is there an increase in bear attacks this year and how is Japan responding?\n\nHere’s what we know:\n\nAccording to Japan’s public broadcaster, NHK, the country’s northern prefectures – districts under the control of a prefect or governor – have been the worst affected by bear attacks.\n\nEarlier this week, NHK said five people had been killed in Iwate, two in Hokkaido, one each in Nagano and Miyagi, and four in Akita so far this year.\n\nBear sightings in Akita prefecture have risen sixfold this year, and bears have attacked more than 50 people since May. Most of the attacks in Akita have been by Asiatic black bears and have taken place in residential areas.\n\nAccording to NHK, on November 9, a bear assaulted a 78-year-old woman in Gojome Town and then attacked a 50-year-old woman who came to help when she heard the older woman screaming. Both were admitted to a hospital in Akita City and are still alive. An elderly woman in Akita city was killed after encountering a bear while working on a farm in late October.\n\nIn an Instagram post last month, the Kenta Suzuki, the governor of the mountainous region, said that “the situation has already surpassed what the prefecture and municipalities can handle on their own”.\n\n“Exhaustion on the ground is reaching its limit,” he added.\n\nIn an interview last month, Billy Halloran, who is from Auckland, New Zealand, and currently lives in Japan, told CNN about a serious black bear attack he had experienced in the woods of Myoko in northern Japan when he went for a run in early October.\n\nHe said he saw two bears staring at him from bushes nearby and, when he tried to back away, one bear started moving towards him. “It was around my size, it was an adult, it was at least 60 or 70 kilos (about 132 to 154 pounds),” he told CNN.\n\nHe held up his arm in front of his face, but the bear seized it and pushed him to the ground. “Then in one bite, my arm was done,” he said.\n\nThe bear attack has left him with a broken arm and an injured leg, Halloran said. He has required three surgeries, and metal plates have been inserted into his arm.\n\nAttacks have also taken place in central Japan. Last month, a bear entered a supermarket in Numata city and attacked shoppers, according to NHK. While nobody was killed, police officials said some people sustained injuries, although they did not say how serious they were.\n\nThe surge in attacks has prompted some countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, to issue travel advisories to citizens living or travelling to Japan.\n\nIn a “wildlife alert” issued on Wednesday, the US Department of State said: “Bear sightings and attacks have increased in parts of Japan, especially in municipalities close to or adjacent to populated zones.\n\n“In Sapporo, authorities closed Maruyama Park in Sapporo, which is adjacent to the US Consulate General, for two weeks following a bear sighting in the park.\n\n“Although the Consulate is located outside of the park, we encourage all visitors for routine or other services to be diligent and aware of your surroundings.”\n\nIn late October, the UK’s Foreign Office warned British travellers not to venture alone into forest areas and to avoid leaving litter and food waste if they do.\n\nMochizuki said one reason is a food shortage for bears in the mountainous regions of the country. He said bears mainly feed on acorns and beech nuts, which have not been abundant this year.\n\n“In years when natural food is scarce, bears are more likely to venture into human settlements in search of food,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Environment, there was a surge of attacks in 2023 following poor acorn yields. Some experts say climate change is a reason for the low production.\n\nMochizuki noted that bear populations have also expanded in the country “due to long-term conservation and reduced hunting pressure” and said that this factor has increased bears’ “contact zones with humans”. According to the government, the overall bear population is currently more than 54,000.\n\nIn 2012, the Environment Ministry’s biodiversity centre said the number of black bears was about 15,000, while brown bear numbers have doubled since 1990, although it did not give numbers.\n\nMochizuki said that another reason bear attacks are rising is rural depopulation, caused by young people leaving their villages and moving to cities for better job opportunities.\n\n“As rural areas age and decline, unmanaged fields and village edges create easy access routes for bears,” he added.\n\nLast week, Japan’s military and riot police were deployed to the scenic mountainous region of Akita to try to contain the surge in bear attacks.\n\nBut while riot police are authorised to shoot the bears, military personnel are not and must work alongside private hunters.\n\n“The Japan Self-Defense Forces are legally restricted to national defence and disaster relief, and therefore have no legal authority to kill wildlife,” Mochizuki said.\n\n“Hunters, by contrast, hold official hunting licences and firearm permits under Japan’s Wildlife Protection and Management Law. They can be formally authorised by prefectural governments to conduct nuisance control, including the shooting of bears when necessary,” he added.\n\nSo the military has been helping the region’s local community by setting up bear traps or removing carcasses of the bears shot by hunters they are working with.\n\nResidents of affected areas, especially Akita, have been using AI-surveillance systems and drones to alert them to the presence of bears, according to Akita’s mayor.\n\nNHK reported that people have also been advised not to leave food around when they go on picnics in the forest, and also to cut down any nut-bearing trees that may attract bears.\n\nMochizuki said three main measures can prove effective.\n\n“Firstly, food sources around human settlements should be eliminated,” he said. “Proper management of garbage, abandoned fruit trees, and garden produce is the most effective preventive measure.”\n\nHe added that physical barriers such as electric fencing around farms or village perimeters “can significantly reduce bear entry”.\n\n“Thirdly, early detection through camera traps, sensors and GPS data, rapid communication through mobile alerts can help communities respond quickly to bear presence,” he said.\n\nMochizuki acknowledged that while the military and police have been deployed to assist bear hunters, the country faces a shortage of hunters and wildlife personnel due to its ageing population.\n\n“Recruiting younger members and increasing municipal staff capacity is essential,” he said.\n\nLast, Mochizuki highlighted the importance of educating residents and tourists about the bears.\n\n“Many people, including international visitors, are unfamiliar with bear behaviour and safety practices and need better guidance,” he said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/20/us-raises-reward-for-ex-olympian-turned-drug-lord-as-7-arrested-in-canada","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"05:41:40+00:00","title":"US raises reward for ex-Olympian turned drug lord, as 7 arrested in Canada","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United States and Canada have intensified efforts to capture Ryan Wedding, a former Olympic snowboarder from Canada who is now a fugitive accused of leading a massive cocaine trafficking operation linked to Mexico’s Sinaloa Cartel.

raised its reward for information leading to the arrest of a former Olympic snowboarder turned alleged drug kingpin, as Canadian authorities announced seven people linked to the fugitive have been arrested.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference in Washington on Wednesday, FBI Director Kash Patel described Ryan Wedding as a “modern-day iteration of Pablo Escobar” – referring to the notorious Colombian drug lord who died in 1993.\n\nThe 44-year-old, who is on the FBI’s “Ten Most Wanted Fugitives” list, is believed to be hiding out in Mexico. Patel said the reward for information leading to Wedding’s arrest now stands at $15m, rising from $10m.\n\n“[Wedding] is responsible for engineering a narco-trafficking and narco-terrorism programme that we have not seen in a long time,” Patel said.\n\nWedding, who was indicted in 2024 for conspiracy to distribute and possess cocaine, conspiracy to export cocaine and conspiracy to commit murder, is “extremely dangerous”, said FBI agent Akil Davis.\n\nDavis added that Wedding, who represented Canada in snowboarding at the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics, finishing 24th in the parallel giant slalom, is “extremely violent” and “extremely wealthy”.\n\nAt Wednesday’s news conference, Attorney General Pam Bondi said Wedding is Canada’s largest cocaine distributor and is behind the trafficking of $1bn worth of drugs each year.\n\nBondi said Wedding works closely with Mexico’s Sinaloa Cartel, transporting about 60 metric tonnes of cocaine annually into Los Angeles in trucks across the southern border.\n\n“We will find you, and you will be accountable and held to justice for your crimes,” Bondi said.\n\n“It’s [drugs] killing our kids. It’s killing our friends. It’s killing our relatives. And this guy is responsible for a tremendous amount of that horror,” she added.\n\nOn Tuesday, Canadian officials arrested seven people in connection with Wedding’s cocaine-smuggling operation, including his lawyer Deepak Paradkar, as part of a coordinated interagency effort by Canada and the US dubbed “Operation Giant Slalom”.\n\nAssistant US Attorney Bill Essayli said the 62-year-old lawyer advised Wedding that if he killed a witness in a pending criminal case, “the case would be dismissed”.\n\nThe witness in question was then murdered after being shot five times in the head in January 2025 at a restaurant in Medellin, Colombia.\n\n“Wedding placed a bounty on the victim’s head in the erroneous belief that the victim’s death would result in the dismissal of criminal charges against him and his international drug-trafficking ring and would further ensure that he was not extradited to the United States,” Essayli said.\n\n“He was wrong,” he added.\n\nBondi said US authorities are offering a $2m reward for information leading to the arrest of those involved in the Medellin killing.\n\nA second man arrested this week by Canadian authorities, named Gursewak Singh Bal, is the founder of a fake news website known as The Dirty News.\n\nBal was allegedly paid to post a photograph of the witness and his wife on his website prior to the murder so they could be “located and killed”, according to the Justice Department.\n\nUS authorities are now seeking the extradition of all seven people arrested in Canada, while three others linked to the Medellin murder were taken into custody in the US.\n\nCommissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Michael Duheme, said Wedding remains “one of the top threats to Canadian public safety”.\n\nAs part of Operation Giant Slalom, the Treasury Department also announced that its Office of Foreign Asset Control is imposing financial sanctions on Wedding and his network."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/7/why-are-scientists-rushing-to-study-a-comet-from-deep-space","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"07:49:12+00:00","title":"Why are scientists rushing to study a comet from deep space?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Scientists are intensely studying the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, the third known object from another star system to pass through our solar system, which was discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope team in Chile.

rushing to study a comet from deep space?\n\nAstrophysicists are scrambling to study an ancient comet from another star system that entered the solar system this year, and which has already swung past Mars.\n\nDubbed 3I/ATLAS, the comet poses no threat to Earth or its neighbouring planets, but has aroused immense interest as space agencies train their sights on what is only one of three interstellar objects detected by scientists.\n\nHere is what we know about the object that is intriguing scientists:\n\nThe comet is only the third interstellar object ever recorded to pass through Earth’s solar system from another star. Comets are celestial bodies made of ice, dust and gas which orbit the sun. They are considered remnants from when the solar system formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago.\n\n3I/ATLAS was first discovered in July by scientist Larry Dennau of the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope team, located in Rio Hurtado, Chile. The project is funded by NASA and is operated by researchers at the University of Hawaii’s Institute for Astronomy.\n\nBefore this, 1I/’Oumuamua, a rocky, cigar-shaped object, was discovered by Canada’s Robert Weryk using the Pan-STARRS telescope at Haleakala Observatory, Hawaii, in October 2017.\n\nIn August 2019, 2I/Borisov, a “rogue comet” – one that is not bound by gravity to any particular star system, so is travelling freely through space – was discovered by the Crimean astronomer and telescope maker Gennadiy Borisov at the MARGO Observatory in Crimea.\n\nComets are typically named after their human or station founders. The “I” in their names stands for “interstellar”, meaning that it has originated from another solar system.\n\nIt zipped past Mars earlier in October, coming within 29 million km (18 million miles) of the red planet at a breakneck speed of 310,000km/h (193,000mph).\n\nThe comet made its closest approach to the sun at the end of October and is expected to pass closest to Earth in December, when it will be about 270 million km (170 million miles) away, according to NASA. It will still be farther from Earth than the sun, which is 150 million km (93 million miles) away.\n\nA host of spacecraft and other assets have already set eyes on the celestial visitor, particularly as its current trajectory has hidden it behind the sun, making it untrackable from Earth for now. NASA notes that it will reappear on the other side of the sun by early December 2025.\n\nScientists are eager to understand more about the comet’s actual size and physical properties.\n\nAside from the Hubble telescope, other space assets owned by NASA will track, or are already tracking, the comet and relaying information about it, including:\n\nSeparately, the ESA’s Juice spacecraft, launched in 2023 and heading to Jupiter and its icy moons, will also keep an eye on the zipping interloper throughout November.\n\nUsing these multiple resources, researchers have been able to capture clear enough images of the object to determine that the object is indeed a comet, as indicated by the hyperbolic shape of its orbital path, that is, the fact that the object does not follow a closed orbital path around the sun, according to NASA.\n\nThe NASA Hubble Space Telescope first captured images in July showing that the comet has a teardrop-shaped cocoon of dust coming off its solid, icy nucleus, according to the agency.\n\nObservations by the Hubble Space Telescope put the comet’s nucleus at no more than 5.6 km (3.5 miles) across. It could be as small as 440 metres (1,444 feet), according to NASA.\n\n3I/Atlas’s coma – the fuzzy halo which appears around comets – is full of carbon dioxide, meaning it must have formed somewhere very cold, and therefore quite far from its star, Darryl Seligman, a planetary scientist at Michigan State University, told US Magazine, Scientific American."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/3/how-will-limited-us-nuclear-tests-avoid-any-explosions","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"12:27:39+00:00","title":"How will ‘limited’ US nuclear tests avoid any explosions?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article examines the controversy surrounding claims by former U.S. President Donald Trump to restart nuclear weapons testing, with U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright clarifying that any planned tests are noncritical and do not involve nuclear explosions.

He said these tests will be conducted on new systems to ensure that replacement nuclear weapons are improvements on earlier models.\n\n“With our science and our computation power, we can simulate incredibly accurately exactly what will happen in a nuclear explosion,” Wright said. “Now, we simulate what were the conditions that delivered that and, as we change bomb designs, what will they deliver.”\n\nAccording to the website of the Washington, DC-based nonpartisan organisation Arms Control Association, several nonnuclear explosive techniques can be used for nuclear weapon development, monitoring and maintenance. These can also include “subcritical” experiments, which use plutonium but avoid nuclear chain reactions.\n\n“In this context, ‘noncritical’ nuclear tests involve testing of nuclear weapons delivery systems or components but not the detonation of a nuclear warhead,” Georgia Cole, a research analyst at the International Security Programme at Chatham House, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Noncritical tests typically take place in laboratories or testing facilities, often using advanced computer simulations to assess the safety and reliability of nuclear warheads without detonation. There are also ‘subcritical’ tests, which are nonnuclear explosions carried out underground, often in former nuclear test sites.”\n\nOn Thursday, Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform: “Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis.” Trump signed an executive order in September to rename the Department of Defense the Department of War.\n\nTrump added in his post that while the US has “more Nuclear Weapons than any other country”, China “will be even within 5 years”.\n\nTrump justified his testing decision by citing China’s rapid build-up of its nuclear arsenal. The announcement came minutes before Trump’s  meeting  with Chinese President Xi Jinping which resulted in a truce on tariffs and some Chinese export restrictions of rare earth metals.\n\nOn Sunday, during an appearance on the CBS News programme 60 Minutes, Trump said in reference to nuclear weapons: “Russia’s testing, and China’s testing, but they don’t talk about it. You know, we’re an open society. We’re different. We talk about it. We have to talk about it.”\n\nTrump added: “We’re gonna test because they test and others test. And certainly North Korea’s been testing. Pakistan’s been testing.”\n\nHowever, none of the countries Trump mentioned has openly conducted nuclear weapons tests in recent years, and he did not provide any evidence to support his claims. It is also unclear why he believes China could catch up with the far larger US arsenal of nuclear warheads in just five years.\n\n“There is no credible evidence that Russia, China or Pakistan are conducting explosive nuclear tests. The only country to have tested a nuclear weapon in the 21st century is North Korea, which has observed a self-declared moratorium since 2018,” Cole said.\n\n“While all nuclear-armed states routinely test their delivery systems, such as missiles, there is no indication that any have resumed nuclear detonations.”\n\nNine states have nuclear arms: the US, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel.\n\nAccording to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) yearbook report published in January, Russia has the highest number of total warheads at 4,309.\n\nRussia is followed by the US, which has 3,700 warheads. China has 600. France has 290. The UK has 225. India has 180. Pakistan has 170. Israel has 90, and North Korea has 50.\n\nA SIPRI report from June stated that China’s nuclear arsenal has been growing more rapidly than any other country’s, increasing by about 100 warheads every year since 2023. A report published by the Pentagon in December estimated that China would likely have 1,000 nuclear weapons by 2030.\n\nThe US has retired 1,477 nuclear warheads while Russia has retired 1,150. A retired warhead is one that has been removed from a country’s military arsenal and is awaiting dismantlement. According to a report published in March by the Federation of American Scientists, a US-based think tank, the retired warheads “are still relatively intact”, however.\n\n“In some cases, retired warheads could technically be restored, depending on how far they are through the dismantlement process. However, this can be a lengthy and resource-intensive process. More commonly, states may reuse components from older warheads in the production or refurbishment of a new weapon,” Cole said.\n\nThe US  began testing nuclear weapons  in 1945 with the first detonation taking place over New Mexico’s desert. The last time it tested nuclear weapons was more than 30 years ago in 1992. In total, the US has conducted 1,032 nuclear tests, according to the United Nations.\n\nThe Soviet Union conducted 715 nuclear tests – the last one in 1990. Russia, which inherited the Soviet nuclear arsenal, has not conducted any nuclear tests.\n\nChina has conducted 45 tests and last tested nuclear weapons in 1996.\n\nFrance last tested nuclear weapons in 1996. It conducted 210 tests from 1945 to 1996. The UK conducted 45 nuclear tests from 1952 with the last one conducted in 1991.\n\nMost countries  have ceased nuclear weapons testing after signing the global Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which was introduced in 1996.\n\nSince then, 10 nuclear tests have taken place: two by India and two by Pakistan in 1998 and six by North Korea in 2006, 2009, 2013, 2016 (twice) and 2017, according to the UN. India, Pakistan and North Korea have not signed the CTBT.\n\nThe US did sign the CTBT in 1996 but did not ratify it. Russia signed the CTBT in 1996 and ratified it in 2000, but in 2023, President Vladimir Putin withdrew Russia’s ratification of the treaty.\n\nWhen a country signs a treaty, it signals its general agreement with the treaty’s terms and its intention to adhere to it in the future. Only upon ratification does the treaty become legally binding for that country under international law.\n\nPolitical and scientific authorities in the US have asserted that the US does not need to conduct new nuclear tests.\n\nThe National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) is a semiautonomous agency within the US Department of Energy. The agency oversees nuclear weapons security, maintenance and stockpile stewardship. The NNSA has repeatedly made it clear that the US does not need new tests.\n\nThe agency’s new administrator, Brandon Williams, said during his Senate confirmation hearing in April: “The United States continues to observe its 1992 nuclear test moratorium and since 1992 has assessed that the deployed nuclear stockpile remains safe, secure and effective without nuclear explosive testing.”\n\nWilliams added that every year, national security lab directors and the commander of the US Strategic Command review the nuclear stockpile to decide if underground nuclear testing is necessary. Previous NNSA Administrator Jill Hruby also stated that new testing was not necessary, according to a 2023 interview with the Arms Control Association.\n\nIf the US breaks this moratorium on testing nuclear weapons – rather than just their components – other countries are likely to follow suit, experts said.\n\n“If the US were to resume explosive nuclear testing, other powers would almost certainly respond in kind. Russia has already stated that it would mirror any US tests, and such moves could prompt China and North Korea to follow. The result would be the collapse of a 30-year moratorium on nuclear testing, undoing decades of restraint and sharply increasing global nuclear risks,” Cole said.\n\nShe added that Wright’s clarification about the tests being noncritical is an important one. “Had [Trump] been referring to explosive tests, as many initially assumed, that would represent a dramatic policy shift and a serious escalation in nuclear tensions.”"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2kpkq90ygno","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"02:03:14.913+00:00","title":"Paris court blocks auction of earliest-known calculator","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Paris court has provisionally blocked the auction of La Pascaline, one of the earliest known calculating machines designed by Blaise Pascal in 1642, preventing its sale by auction house Christie's.

The lab released a statement at the time calling his remarks “reprehensible” and “unsupported by science”.\n\nThe long history of pseudo-scientific theories of racial inferiority being used as a pretext for policies of discrimination or even violent subjugation and elimination makes suggestions of genetic differences based on race and ethnicity especially controversial.\n\n“His outbursts, particularly when they reflected on race, were both profoundly misguided and deeply hurtful,” Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said in 2019.\n\n“I only wish that Jim’s views on society and humanity could have matched his brilliant scientific insights.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/tag/science-and-technology/","dateOfPublication":"1911-11-19","timeOfPublication":"19:00:00Z","title":"Science and Technology | Today's latest from Al Jazeera","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article highlights a range of global technological and policy developments: rising demand for AI chips, Australia’s plan to restrict children’s access to social media, Nvidia’s international expansion amid US-China tensions, OpenAI’s significant capital increase to $500 billion, public health concerns over misinformation from former President Trump linking Tylenol to autism, Delhi’s experimental use of cloud seeding to reduce pollution, and a scientific observation of a star’s close approach to a black hole.

2025-11-20T08:13:33+00:00\n\nTitle: Amnesia, nostalgia, healing: Spain grapples with Franco legacy 50 years on\n\nGranada, Spain -  This summer, Marina Roldan, a lawyer from Granada in southern Spain, finally got the phone call her family had waited decades for.\n\nThe body of Fermin Roldan Garcia, her grandfather, who was one of tens of thousands of people killed by General Francisco Franco’s death squads in the 1936-1939 Spanish Civil War, had finally been located and identified.\n\nHis remains were found in a ravine in the village of Viznar, a few kilometres outside Granada.\n\n“My brother Juan called me. He’d been the family contact with the archaeological team carrying out the excavation,” Roldan told Al Jazeera. \"When Juan told me my grandfather had been found, my first thoughts were for my [late] father.\"\n\nHer father, Jose Antonio Roldan Diaz, was just 10 months old when his father was killed at the age of 41.\n\nRoldan Garcia was a tax inspector, a trade unionist and a member of the Socialist Party who stood unsuccessfully for parliament in the February 1936 elections in Granada.\n\nAs Marina remembers them, her voice falters with the emotion of it all. The noise of passing trams echoes through an open window of her office.\n\n“I thought of [my father] and I thought of my late uncles, who would have liked to have heard the news, and my grandmother too. ... I think they all deserved their husband, their father, to be found.”\n\nOn Thursday, Spain marks 50 years since the end of Franco's dictatorship - four decades that ended with his death on November 20, 1975.\n\nAfter Spain's first fully fledged modern democracy and Second Republic began in 1931 despite ferocious opposition from hardline conservatives, Franco began a right-wing military rebellion on July 18, 1936, to put an end to its political and social reforms.\n\nDespite backing from fascist Italy and Nazi Germany, his uprising encountered greater resistance than expected from a makeshift pro-Republican coalition of left-wing trade unionists, political parties, some parts of the armed forces and pro-democracy activists, leading to a full-scale, brutal Civil War lasting three years.\n\nThe republic finally surrendered on April 2, 1939, leading to his regime.\n\nSince the earliest days of the war, a brutal repression of suspected civilian rivals and their families had begun in the Franco-controlled areas of Spain. It was designed to silence and intimidate any possible opposition.\n\nThe number of victims who were summarily executed is estimated at 130,000 to 200,000.\n\nIn the half-century since Franco's demise, exhumations have been slow and beset by logistical, financial and legal challenges. There are an estimated 6,000 unmarked mass graves dotted around the country, including everywhere from wells and woodlands to gardens, cemeteries and remote hillsides.\n\nBut as Spain remembers the era's victims and analyses exhumation efforts, it is grappling with the steady recent rise of a far-right party, Vox, and nostalgia for the ideals of the dictatorship among young people who did not endure it.\n\nA recent CIS poll suggested that 20 percent of those aged 18 to 24 believed the dictatorship was \"good\" or \"very good\".\n\nAccording to secondary schoolteachers, social media is driving pro-Franco support among teenagers.\n\n“They talk like they are really in favour of the dictatorship and of obligatory military service as well,” Jose Garcia Vico, a secondary school economics teacher in Andalusia, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“The majority of the teachers I know are very worried because even if we’ve explained the difference between dictatorship and democracy, the students are so overrun with content from TikTok and they’re so p***** off with the world in general, they don’t know what they want.”\n\n“The content they get from the hard-right parties on social media aimed at adolescents is considerable, and it has a lot of effect on how they relate to each other.”\n\nWhile emphasising “not everybody in the class” is attracted to the far right, Garcia Vico points to a parallel sharp rise in Islamophobic and anti-transgender comments.\n\n“Above all, it’s the boys who feel superior to the rest. But it’s a problem which involves some of the parents as well. A couple of years ago, some parents told me that it was OK that their child had interrupted me by shouting, 'Viva Franco!’ ['Long Live Franco!'] because that was freedom of expression.”\n\nHundreds of kilometres north in the capital, Madrid, Sebastian Reyes Turner, a 27-year-old teacher, said he has also noticed the impact of hard-right social media influencers.\n\n“In schools, people only see Franco’s dictatorship as one of several topics to mindlessly memorise to pass a history exam they don’t really care about to begin with.\n\n“On the other hand, details are cherry-picked by the far right to make them think it was a better time in which they didn’t face problems like they do today - like how hard it is to find jobs even if they’ve been studying well into their 20s or the housing crisis.”\n\nPolitical analysts said Vox's attitude to the Franco dictatorship shows underlying sympathies for the former regime without any sense of embarrassment.\n\nLast year, Vox lawmaker Manuel Mariscal boasted in parliament that “thanks to social media, many young people are discovering that the post-Civil War era in Spain was not some dark time but a period of progress and reconciliation towards national unity.”\n\n“There is a type of mythification of the Franco years that works well on social media, and it has a big impact on young men in particular. They are told there were no problems in that era because there was no radical feminism and no migrants out there on the streets,” said Oriol Bartomeus, a research professor at the Institute of Political and Social Science at the Autonomous University of Barcelona and author of a book on generational change in Spain, El peso del tiempo, or The Weight of Time.\n\n“You can hear the same kinds of claims now in the United Kingdom, the USA, Germany and Italy - that a return to a simpler past where the white men were in charge of the ship is possible.”\n\nHowever, none of these countries had a dictatorship as recently as Spain, where Vox commands nearly 20 percent of the vote and is steadily rising in polls.\n\nBartomeus noted a generational shift in the right-wing electorate from the traditional Partido Popular (PP) - “it’s increasingly becoming a party for old people” - towards Vox.\n\nOn the other side of the political spectrum, left-leaning voters have a critical stance towards the regime.\n\nAfter democracy returned, there was a \"tendency to keep looking forward, forgetting the past and concentrating on integration into Europe - a kind of collective amnesia”, he said\n\n“It’s only when the generation of Spanish baby boomers, born between 1960 and 1965, starts to impact politically that there’s a clear shift in the Socialist Party to overcome that amnesia. They are the generation who argue the dictatorship can’t be ignored. They’re the ones who say, 'Let’s open up the roadside graves.'\n\n“It started with [Socialist] President Rodriguez Zapatero and his law of 'historic memory' in 2007” - Spain’s first law that fully addressed the Franco regime and began an ongoing process of removing the hundreds of dictatorship-era symbols and architecture from its streets and squares.\n\n“They’re the people that open up the can of worms. And that in turn has created the reaction you’re getting from the neo-Francoists of today.”\n\nSince Franco died, Spain has witnessed massive social progress.\n\nTo take women’s rights as an example, in 1975, the last year of the regime, married women had equivalent legal status to the mentally ill and illiterate and were banned from signing contracts. They could not travel, work or open a bank account without their husbands' permission.\n\nBy 1981, there was a divorce law. By 1985, abortion was decriminalised, and by 2005, same sex marriage was legalised.\n\nBut at the same time as Spain moved away from the dictatorship, the PP was one of the few mainstream parties in Europe that failed to categorically condemn the regime.\n\n“The problem is that unlike Germany's or Italy’s 20th century dictatorships, Franco’s government doesn’t get overthrown. It simply ends,\" Bartomeus said.\n\n“That absence of a formal rejection permits a kind of sociological Francoism to remain in place, and that’s why there can still be a lot of people inside the PP who, even today, are still pro-Franco.”\n\nSpain is only now taking concrete action to ban the Francisco Franco National Foundation, founded in 1976 to, as its website puts it, “promote the study of the life, legacy and work in its human, political and military aspects” of the man who “governed the fate of Spain between 1936 and 1977”.\n\nMeanwhile, Vox opposes exhumations. The party is also furious that Franco himself was  exhumed  from his own specially built mausoleum outside Madrid, previously known as the Valley of the Fallen, and given a more discreet burial in 2019.\n\nThis month, architectural plans were approved for Franco’s former tomb to be remodelled as a politically neutral Civil War heritage museum.\n\nAlthough excavations like the one in Viznar are proceeding at an unprecedented pace, archaeologists are concerned that at some point, a new right-wing government would cut off financing and threaten projects that reckon with the past.\n\n“It has already happened once,” said Francisco Carrion, an archaeology professor at the University of Granada who has overseen the regional and state-backed Viznar investigation and exhumations for the past five years.\n\n“The previous PP government with Mariano Rajoy didn’t suspend the 2007 law of historic memory. But during his time in power, he did cut off absolutely all funding for the exhumations. They cut it right down to nothing.”\n\nLikening the massacres and executions in Franco’s era to the current Israeli attacks on the  Palestinian civilian population  in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, he said among those killed - like Marina Roldan’s grandfather - were trade unionists, teachers, seamstresses and artists.\n\nIn Viznar, his team have even discovered the executed remains of a child aged 11 to 14.\n\nA few metres away from the exhumation site, in the converted mill that acts as the headquarters for Carrion's investigation, his colleague Jose Francisco Munoz Molina, a forensic anthropologist, is working on two of the 166 skeletons that have been exhumed so far.\n\nOne has traces of a bullet wound in the arm, he explained, and the other was shot in the head.\n\n“It’s a complicated process emotionally. It can affect you a lot,” Munoz Molina said. “You’re dealing with people who were very close to our own ages, who were very young in many cases. It’s hard to understand how this all happened.\n\n“My own great-grandparents were executed against the walls of the city cemetery in Granada during the Civil War.\"\n\nAbout 3,400 people in the early part of the Civil War were reportedly executed against Granada's cemetery walls.\n\n\"I’m doing something for families who have been looking for them for such a long time, and it’s going to help heal them, so it’s healing me a little bit as well.”\n\nThe latest series of excavations this autumn produced 12 more bodies, Carrion said.\n\nAlthough it’s much too early to say, he said cautiously, they hope to have found evidence of one of the bigger mass executions of October 1936, including of the rector of Granada University, Salvador Vila.\n\nAs for the still undiscovered remains of Federico Garcia Lorca, Spain’s most famous modern-day poet, Carrion is less hopeful. There are several theories as to where exactly in the hills of Granada he could have been killed.\n\n“It’s true that Garcia Lorca is dead but also that he lives on too, in his books across the world, in so many different translations. On a human level and regardless of his poetic contribution, the 166 other people we’ve so far exhumed are just as important too.”\n\nThe moment of handing over remains to relatives “is the best part of our work. They are very emotive ceremonies. It’s almost magical because we’ve given them closure after so many years,” Carrion said.\n\nHe recalled the case of two daughters, aged 92 and 93, who were both suffering from Alzheimer’s disease but who were somehow able to have brief moments of mental clarity when the box containing the remains of their relative was handed over.\n\n“When they held the box, they knew what was happening. It makes you cry. You’d have to be made of stone not to be affected.”\n\nIn the case of Marina Roldan, her only impression of her grandfather for years was from the portrait in the bedroom she shared with her grandmother - “one of those old ones where it looks as if whatever you do, his eyes are following you, so I always had the impression that if I did something wrong, in my head he’d tell me off”, she said with a laugh.\n\n“Now there’s a real story, a real background. But I don’t have the sensation of an open wound being closed, more a kind of calm because I feel that my dad would be happy and that he too is resting now.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/5/australia-adds-reddit-kick-to-social-media-ban-for-children-under-16","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"06:55:24+00:00","title":"Australia adds Reddit, Kick to social media ban for children under 16","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Australia is implementing a ban on children under 16 from accessing major social media platforms, including Reddit, Kick, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, and YouTube, effective December 10, 2025. The move stems from concerns over algorithmic manipulation, harmful content, and the psychological impact of 'endless scroll' features. The government, led by Communications Minister Anika Wells and eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant, has engaged with platforms to ensure compliance, with failure to comply facing civil fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars.

under 16 years old will include the online forum Reddit and livestreaming platform Kick in addition to seven other well-known sites, according to the country’s online safety commissioner.\n\nThe social media ban will go into effect on December 10 and will also restrict access to Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X and YouTube, Communications Minister Anika Wells said on Wednesday.\n\n“Online platforms use technology to target children with chilling control. We are merely asking that they use that same technology to keep children safe online,” Wells said.\n\n“We have met with several of the social media platforms in the past month so that they understand there is no excuse for failure to implement this law,” Wells told reporters in Canberra.\n\n“We want children to have a childhood, and we want parents to have peace of mind,” she said.\n\nSocial media platforms have had 12 months to prepare for the ban since  Australia passed its landmark  online safety legislation in November last year.\n\nInitial discussions focused primarily around Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, X and YouTube, but the list was later expanded, and Wells said the list could continue to change.\n\nWhile more than 140 Australian and international academics signed an open letter to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese last year opposing the age limit ban as a “blunt” instrument,  Canberra’s move  is being closely watched by countries that share concerns about the impacts of online platforms on children.\n\n“Delaying children’s access to social media accounts gives them valuable time to learn and grow, free of the powerful, unseen forces of harmful and deceptive design features such as opaque algorithms and endless scroll,” eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said.\n\nInman Grant said she would work with academics to evaluate the impact of the ban, including whether children sleep or interact more or become more physically active as a result of the restrictions on using social media.\n\n“We’ll also look for unintended consequences, and we’ll be gathering evidence” so others can learn from Australia’s ban, Inman Grant said.\n\nCritics have questioned how the restrictions will be enforced because users cannot be “compelled” to submit government IDs for an age check, according to a government fact sheet.\n\nDiscussions are under way with platforms about how to comply with the new rules, the commissioner said, while failure to comply could lead to civil fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars (US$32.1m).\n\nNews that Australia would add more names to the list of banned platforms came as French authorities said they had opened an investigation into the social media platform TikTok and the risks of its algorithms pushing young people into suicide.\n\nParis prosecutor Laure Beccuau said the probe was in response to a parliamentary committee’s request to open a criminal inquiry into TikTok’s possible responsibility for endangering the lives of its young users.\n\nBeccuau said a report by the committee had noted “insufficient moderation of TikTok, its ease of access by minors and its sophisticated algorithm, which could push vulnerable individuals towards suicide by quickly trapping them in a loop of dedicated content”.\n\nTikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Paris police cybercrime unit will look into the offence of providing a platform for “propaganda in favour of products, objects, or methods recommended as means of committing suicide”, which is punishable by three years in prison.\n\nThe unit will also look into the offence of enabling “illegal transactions by an organised gang”, punishable by 10 years in prison and a fine of 1 million euros ($1.2m).\n\nWith more than 1.5 billion users worldwide, TikTok, owned by China-based ByteDance, has come under fire from governments in Europe and the United States in recent years.\n\nConcerns raised over the platform have included content encouraging suicide, self-harm or an unhealthy body image as well as its potential use for foreign political interference.\n\nA TikTok spokesman told the French news agency AFP in September that the company “categorically rejects the deceptive presentation” by French MPs, saying it was being made a “scapegoat” for broader societal issues."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yl1y5gep8o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"01:12:04.198+00:00","title":"Why trying too hard may be holding you back at work","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the psychological and professional downsides of perfectionism, emphasizing how the pursuit of flawless outcomes can lead to anxiety, procrastination, burnout, and poor mental health.

It's one of the most common answers used in a job interview to spin the dreaded \"What's your weakness?\" into a humblebrag.\n\nFor many, it's about striving for excellence or working tirelessly to reach the highest standard.\n\nBut what happens when these high (and sometimes unrelenting) expectations of yourself are exactly what's holding you back?\n\n\"I know perfectionism is an illusion, but I am always trying to chase it,\" admits 25-year-old Aswan.\n\nEven in the workplace, she feels the pressure, \"I know that I can make a mistake and I won't lose my job, yet I constantly feel like I'm one strike away from being fired\".\n\nIt's an anxiety shared by many perfectionists, says health psychologist Dr Sula Windgassen. Speaking on  the BBC Sounds podcast Complex , she explains: \"Poor self-esteem tends to go hand in hand with perfectionism because there is this fear of failing\".\n\nThat fear often fuels procrastination. Aswan remembers taking her driving theory test: \"I got so pent up about passing it first time that when I failed by a couple of points I've never tried to get it back.\" That was almost four years ago.\n\nPerfectionism can be rooted in personality, but childhood experiences, school environments, and parental expectations can also shape what we grow up believing is \"good enough\".\n\nWhile perfectionism isn't a clinical diagnosis, its effects are very real - from anxiety and tiredness to stress-related physical symptoms such as a weakened immune system.\n\nStill, experts say the cycle can be broken. Dr Windgassen suggests beginning what's known in psychology as a behavioural experiment.\n\nIt starts by asking yourself what you think will happen if the outcome isn't perfect - writing down your predictions, and then testing them in real time.\n\nWas the outcome as bad as you expected? And what positive things came from this new approach? It might be that you manage to go to sleep at 10pm rather than 1am, leaving you feeling more refreshed.\n\nFor 26-year-old Dayna, who describes herself as a \"former perfectionist\",   it's a trait she is relieved to have left behind. She once sacrificed her wellbeing in pursuit of flawless results and it's something she never wants to repeat.\n\n\"I kept a journal to gain more self-awareness about my tendencies and read self-help books,\" says Dayna.\n\n\"I had to learn the hard way how to develop coping mechanisms and strategies to not sacrifice everything and that being a perfectionist is not a noble quality as I used to think it might be.\"\n\nAt times, her harsh inner critic took over and eventually the path to perfectionism led to burnout.\n\nLooking back, Dayna remembers feeling chronically anxious and stressed.\n\n\"Right now I have become content with just trying my best and accepting that I can't always get the outcome I want but the outcome I get will be more than good enough and I am at peace with that now.\"\n\nNot all perfectionism is necessarily harmful. One form, known as perfectionistic striving, focuses on setting more ambitious personal goals. When these goals can be adapted in response to changing circumstances, they tend to cause less stress and lead to more positive outcomes. For example, an athlete setting tough goals, but cutting back on training when they're injured.\n\nBut it still has its limitations. A research paper published in July 2025 by the British Psychological Society found that aiming for excessively high goals often leads to long working hours, with only marginal gains in performance.\n\nWorking through these perfectionistic tendencies can be uncomfortable, says Dr Windgassen - but that discomfort is part of the process.\n\n\"That's not a sign that you shouldn't do it - it's a sign that you should,\" she says."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/15/thousands-march-for-climate-action-outside-cop30-summit-in-brazil","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"16:17:00+00:00","title":"Thousands march for climate action outside COP30 summit in Brazil","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Thousands of people marched in Belem, Brazil, during the COP30 climate summit, demanding that Indigenous voices—particularly from the Amazon—be heard and that urgent action be taken to protect the environment.

for crimes against humanity is testing India-Bangladesh ties\n\nFor India, few friendships have been as strategically valuable - and as politically costly - as its long embrace of Bangladesh's former leader Sheikh Hasina.\n\nDuring 15 years in power she delivered what Delhi prizes most in its periphery: stability, connectivity and a neighbour willing to align its interests with India's rather than China's.\n\nThese days she is across the border in India but  has been sentenced to death  by a special tribunal in Bangladesh for crimes against humanity over her crackdown on student-led protests, which led to her ousting.\n\nThe 2024 demonstrations forced her to flee and paved the way for Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus to lead an interim government. Elections are due early next year.\n\nThe fallout from all this has created a diplomatic bind: Dhaka wants Hasina extradited, but Delhi has shown no inclination to comply - making her death sentence effectively unenforceable.\n\nWhat Delhi intended as humanitarian asylum is turning into a long and uncomfortable test of how far it is willing to go for an old ally, and how much diplomatic capital it is prepared to burn in the process.\n\nMichael Kugelman, a South Asia expert, says India faces four unappealing options.\n\nIt could hand Hasina over - \"which it really doesn't want to do\". It could maintain the status quo, though that will become \"increasingly risky for Delhi once a newly elected government takes office next year\".\n\nOr, it could press Hasina to stay silent and avoid  statements  or  interviews , something she is \"unlikely to accept\" as she continues to lead her Awami League party - and something Delhi is unlikely to enforce.\n\nThe remaining option is to find a third country to take her in, but that too is fraught: few governments are likely to accept a \"high-maintenance guest with serious legal problems and security needs\", Mr Kugelman says.\n\nExtraditing Hasina is unthinkable - India's ruling party and opposition alike view her as a close friend. \"India prides itself on not turning on its friends,\" according to Mr Kugelman.\n\nWhat makes this moment especially awkward for Delhi is the sheer depth - and asymmetry - of the India–Bangladesh relationship, rooted in India's pivotal role in Bangladesh's birth.\n\nBangladesh is India's biggest trading partner in South Asia, and India has become Bangladesh's largest export market in Asia. Total trade reached nearly $13bn (£10bn) last year, with Bangladesh running a sizeable deficit, heavily dependent on Indian raw materials, energy and transit routes.\n\nIndia has offered $8bn-$10bn in concessional credit over the past decade, provides duty-free access to some goods, built cross-border rail links, and supplies electricity - plus oil and LNG - from Indian grids and ports. This is not a relationship either side can easily walk away from.\n\n\"India and Bangladesh share a complex interdependence - relying on each other for water, electricity and more. It would be difficult for Bangladesh to function without India's co-operation,\" says Sanjay Bhardwaj, a professor of South Asian studies at Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University.\n\nYet, many believe, Bangladesh's interim government, under Yunus, appears to now be moving quickly to rebalance its external ties. His first months in office have been a burst of diplomatic outreach aimed at \"de-Indianising\" Bangladesh's foreign policy, according to political scientist Bian Sai in a  paper  published by the National University of Singapore.\n\nA government that once aligned itself with India at every regional forum is now cancelling judicial exchanges, renegotiating Indian energy deals, slowing India-led connectivity projects, and leaning publicly on Beijing, Islamabad and even Ankara for strategic partnership. Many believe the message could not be clearer: Bangladesh, once India's most dependable neighbour, is hedging hard.\n\nThe deterioration is already visible in public sentiment. A recent  survey  by the Dhaka-based Centre for Alternatives found more than 75% of Bangladeshis viewed ties with Beijing positively, compared with just 11% for Delhi - reflecting sentiments after last year's uprising. Many blame Delhi for supporting an increasingly authoritarian Hasina in her final years, and see India as an overbearing neighbour.\n\nProf Bharadwaj says that long-standing economic and cultural ties often endure beyond political shifts: data show that trade between India and Bangladesh grew between 2001 and 2006, when the \"less friendlier\" Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), in coalition with Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI), was in power.\n\n\"While diplomatic and political relations often fluctuate with changes in government, economic, cultural and sports ties tend to remain largely stable. Even if a new administration is less friendly toward India, it does not automatically disrupt trade or broader bilateral relations,\" he says.\n\nFor Delhi, the challenge is not just managing a fallen ally in exile, but preserving a neighbour central to its security - from counterterrorism and border management to access to its restive north-eastern region. India shares a 4,096km (2,545 mile) largely porous and partly riverine border with Bangladesh, where domestic turbulence could trigger displacement or mobilisation of extremists, experts say.\n\n\"India should not be in a hurry,\" says Avinash Paliwal, who teaches politics and international studies at SOAS University of London. The path forward, he argues, requires \"quiet, patient engagement with key political stakeholders in Dhaka -including the armed forces\". Diplomacy can buy time.\n\nDr Paliwal believes the relationship is likely to remain turbulent over the next 12–18 months, with the intensity depending on developments in Bangladesh after next year's elections.\n\n\"If the interim government is able to pull off elections with credibility, and an elected government takes charges, it could open options for the two sides to renegotiate the relationship and limit the damage.\"\n\nThe uncertainty has Delhi weighing not just immediate tactical moves, but the broader principle: How can India reassure friendly governments that it will stand by them \"through thick and thin\" without inviting accusations that it is shielding leaders with troubling human rights records?\n\n\"There are no silver-bullet operational solutions to this dilemma. Perhaps the deeper question that requires mulling is why India faces the dilemma in the first place,\" says Dr Paliwal. In other words, did Delhi put too many eggs in one basket by backing Hasina so consistently?\n\n\"You deal with whoever is in power, is friendly, and helps you get your job done. Why should you change that?\" says Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty, former Indian high commissioner to Bangladesh. \"Foreign policy isn't driven by public perception or morality - relations between states rarely are.\n\n\"Internally, we can't control Bangladesh's politics - it's fractious, deeply divisive, and built on fragile institutions.\"\n\nWhether India can repair the deeper political rupture remains uncertain. At the same time, much depends on Bangladesh's next government. \"The key is how much Bangladesh's next government lets the Hasina factor impact bilateral relations. If it essentially holds the relationship hostage, then it will be tough to move forward,\" says Mr Kugelman.\n\nUltimately, the next elected government will need to balance Bangladesh's core interests - border security, trade and connectivity - against domestic politics and public anti-India sentiment, he says.\n\n\"I don't anticipate a serious crisis in ties, but I suspect they'll remain fragile at best.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8jrjr4wrr2o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"10:12:36.100+00:00","title":"Woman jailed for 20 years over murder of Australian surfer brothers in Mexico","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 23-year-old woman, Ari Gisell, has been sentenced to 20 years in prison for instigating the carjacking and murder of Australian surfers Jake and Callum Robinson and their American friend Carter Rhoad in April 2024 in Baja California, Mexico.

It was my life’s work. Only less than a year ago, I had finished constructing the second floor, and now there is nothing,” the 36-year-old father of three children told Al Jazeera.\n\nAhmad’s was among nearly 20 houses in Sarh lost to the Chenab River that night, including one belonging to his brother, as dozens of families helplessly watched their farmlands, shops and other properties worth millions of rupees vanish without a trace.\n\n“We don’t even have one inch of land left to stand on,” said Ahmad from a government school in Sarh, where his family and other villagers were sheltering after the deluge.\n\nThe tragedy at Sarh was among the latest of increasingly frequent climate disasters across India that destroy lives and livelihoods, and displace millions of people to an uncertain future.\n\nAccording to the Geneva-based Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC), climate-related disasters forced more than 32 million people from their homes in India between 2015 and 2024, with 5.4 million displacements recorded in 2024 alone – the highest in 12 years. This makes India one of the three nations most affected by  internal displacements  due to climate change in that period, with China and the Philippines being the top two.\n\nMoreover, in the first six months of 2025, more than 160,000 people were displaced across India due to natural disasters, as the country received above-average rainfall, triggering huge floods and landslides, and submerging hundreds of villages and cities.\n\nTo help millions of people like Ahmad who are vulnerable to the climate crisis, India’s Ministry for Environment, Forest and Climate Change launched a National Adaptation Fund on Climate Change (NAFCC) in 2015. Its goal was to finance projects that help communities cope with floods, droughts, landslides, and other climate-related stresses across India.\n\nManaged by the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), the flagship scheme supported interventions in agriculture, water management, forestry, coastal protection, and climate-resilient infrastructure. Between 2015 and 2021, it financed more than two dozen projects, benefitting thousands of  vulnerable households .\n\nDuring a roundtable in Brazil’s Belem city last month – before the 30th United Nations climate change conference, or COP30, which officially opened on November 17 – India’s minister for environment, forest and climate change, Bhupender Yadav, said the global meet should be the “COP of adaptation”.\n\n“The focus must be on transforming climate commitments into real-world actions that accelerate implementation and directly improve people’s lives,” he said, according to a statement released by the Indian government on October 13. He highlighted “a need to strengthen and intensify the flow of public finance towards adaptation”, said the statement.\n\nIn another statement last Tuesday, a day after COP30 opened, India said climate “adaptation financing needs to exceed nearly 15 times current flows, and significant gaps remain in doubling international public finance for adaptation by 2025”.\n\n“India emphasised that adaptation is an urgent priority for billions of vulnerable people in developing countries who have contributed the least to global warming but stand to suffer the most from its impacts,” said the statement.\n\nBut the actions of the Indian government back home do not match those words at the climate summit.\n\nGovernment records show NAFCC received an average of $13.3m annually in the initial years of its launch. But the allocation steadily declined. In the financial year 2022-2023, the fund’s spending was just $2.47m. In November 2022, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change moved NAFCC from the category of a government “scheme” to a “non-scheme”, providing no clear outlay for funds.\n\nSince the financial year 2023-2024, zero money has been earmarked for the crucial climate adaptation fund.\n\nAs a result, several climate adaptation projects in areas prone to floods, cyclones and landslides have been stalled even as widespread climatic devastation continued to kill and displace people. While presenting the federal budget in parliament in February this year, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman did not even include the words “climate change” and “adaptation” in her hour-long speech.\n\n“Announcing lofty adaptation goals abroad while starving the fund that safeguards our own citizens is misleading and a moral failure,” Raja Muzaffar Bhat, an environmental activist in Indian-administered Kashmir, told Al Jazeera, calling Yadav’s statements in Brazil “a gross distortion of reality and a dangerous distraction”.\n\nAl Jazeera reached out to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change for their comments on cutting NAFCC funds, but has not received any response.\n\nAn official in the Environment Ministry, however, defended the government’s shift in funding priorities, claiming the authorities have not abandoned climate adaptation efforts.\n\n“Funds are now being channelled through broader climate and sustainability initiatives rather than standalone schemes like the NAFCC,” the official told Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media.\n\nMeanwhile, climate crises continue to kill and displace people across India.\n\nIn the Darbhanga district of Bihar, India’s poorest state, 38-year-old Sunita Devi has been displaced five times in seven years as floods in the nearby Kosi River repeatedly destroyed her mud house built on bamboo stilts.\n\n“We live in fear every monsoon. My children have stopped going to school because we shift from camp to camp,” she said, holding on to the family’s only lifeline: A government ration card that allows them to buy food grains at subsidised rates or get them for free.\n\nThis year saw one of the worst monsoons across India, as above-average rains killed hundreds and displaced millions. In Bihar alone, floods affected more than 1.7 million people, killed dozens and submerged hundreds of villages.\n\nIn Odisha, another impoverished eastern state, fisherman Ramesh Behera*, 45, watched his house in Kendrapara district’s Satabhaya village collapse into the Bay of Bengal in 2024, as rising seas continue to erase entire hamlets. “The sea swallowed my home and my father’s fields. Fishing is no longer enough to survive,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nBehera was forced to give up his family’s traditional livelihoods – fishing and farming – and was driven into distress migration to survive. He now works as a manual labourer in Srinagar, the main city in Indian-administered Kashmir.\n\nIn West Bengal state’s Sundarbans Islands, one of the largest mangrove forests in the world, rising seas and coastal erosion have consumed lands and homes, forcing thousands of families in the fragile ecosystem to relocate.\n\nIn the southern state of Tamil Nadu’s Nagapattinam district, 29-year-old Revathi Selvam says saltwater intrusion from the Bay of Bengal has poisoned her farmland and their paddy harvest has collapsed.\n\n“The soil is no longer fertile. We cannot grow rice any more. We may have to leave farming altogether,” she told Al Jazeera, adding that many in her village are considering migrating to the state capital, Chennai, to work as construction workers.\n\nIn the Himalayan state of Himachal Pradesh, 27-year-old hotel worker Arjun Thakur saw his livelihood vanish when a cloudburst in 2024 buried the small tourist lodge where he worked. “The mountain broke apart. I saw houses collapse in seconds,” he recalled.\n\nThakur now stays with his relatives in the state capital Shimla, unsure if he can ever return to his native place.\n\nYet, with funds for NAFCC gone, people like Devi, Behera, Selvam and Thakur have no access to a government scheme that helps them cope with their tragedies.\n\nA government official, who previously worked with NAFCC, told Al Jazeera several schemes approved by the government under NAFCC were never implemented after funds began to dry up as early as 2021, exposing thousands of households to a recurring climate crisis.\n\n“The fund was created to help vulnerable communities adapt before disasters struck, and to reduce the kind of repeated displacement we are now witnessing,” the official said on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media.\n\n“Once the allocations stopped, states lost a key channel to protect people living on the front lines of floods, landslides, and droughts. Now, these families are left to rebuild on their own, again and again.”\n\nActivist Bhat said the government’s attitude to the NAFCC “signals that adaptation is no longer a priority, even as India faces record internal displacement from climate extremes”.\n\n“People are losing homes, farms, and livelihoods, and the government has left them entirely to their fate. If this continues, the next generation will inherit a country where climate refugees are a daily reality,” he said.\n\n“This is climate injustice at its most blatant.”\n\nClimate Action Network South Asia is a Dhaka-based coalition of about 250 civil society organisations, working in eight South Asian countries to promote government and individual action to limit human-induced climate change. Its estimate says roughly 45 million people in India could be forced to migrate by 2050 due to the climate crisis – a threefold increase over current displacement figures.\n\n“We are a vast nation with hot and cold deserts, long coastlines, and Himalayan glaciers. From tsunamis on our shores to flash floods, cloudbursts, and landslides in the mountains, we face the entire spectrum of climate extremes,” Bhat told Al Jazeera.\n\nBhat said it is not just nature causing displacement, but also unchecked “development” of vulnerable areas.\n\n“Earlier, floods or cloudbursts were occasional, and population density was low. Now, haphazard construction around mountain passes, waterways and streams, along with rampant deforestation, has amplified these disasters,” he said.\n\n“People who once fled New Delhi’s air pollution to settle down in [the Himalayan states of] Himachal Pradesh or Uttarakhand now find themselves living under a constant threat of landslides. Migration is no longer a choice but a survival strategy.”\n\nBhat warned that neglecting people affected by climate-related displacement could cause the world’s largest climate migration crisis.\n\n“We are no longer behaving like the welfare state promised in our constitution. We pay taxes like a developed country but get services that leave people to die in a climate crisis… We are utterly unprepared for the mass migrations that will inevitably come from both our mountains and our plains,” he said.\n\nBack at the temporary government shelter in Kashmir’s landslide-hit Sarh village, Ahmad fears an uncertain future for him and his family.\n\n“If land and shelter are not provided, we will not merely be homeless; we will become refugees in our own land, cast aside without place or protection,” he said.\n\n“When the state neglects the consequences of climate change, it issues a declaration: You are free to drown, but not free to rebuild.”"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce868dmz2mdo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"02:44:38.735+00:00","title":"Ex-Harvard president Larry Summers stops teaching while university investigates Epstein emails","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Larry Summers, former U.S. Treasury Secretary and Harvard president, has stepped back from teaching and public roles after newly released emails revealed his correspondence with Jeffrey Epstein until the day before Epstein's 2019 arrest.

teaching while university investigates Epstein emails \n\nHarvard University professor Larry Summers is taking leave while the school investigates his and others' ties with late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, a spokesperson confirmed.\n\nThe former US treasury secretary and onetime Harvard president will stop teaching and step back as director of the Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government at the Harvard Kennedy School.\n\nA spokesperson told the BBC's US partner, CBS News, that Summers believes \"it's in the best interest of the Center\".\n\nRecently released emails indicate that Summers corresponded with Epstein until the day before the financier's 2019 arrest for the alleged sex trafficking of minors.\n\nIn a statement to The Harvard Crimson, the university said it was \"conducting a review of information concerning individuals at Harvard included in the newly released Jeffrey Epstein documents\".\n\nThe BBC has contacted Summers for comment on Harvard's new review.\n\nOn Tuesday, Summers addressed his communication with Epstein to students in a class he had been teaching at Harvard.\n\n\"Some of you will have seen my statement of regret, expressing my shame with respect to what I did in communication with Mr. Epstein. And that I've said that I'm going to step back from public activity,\" Summers told his students, according to a video recorded by a student.\n\n\"I think it's very important to fulfill my teaching obligations. So with your permission, we're going to go forward and talk about the material in the class.\"\n\nBut on Wednesday night, Summers spokesperson Steven Goldberg said in the statement provided to CBS that \"co-teachers will complete the remaining three class sessions of the courses he has been teaching with them this semester, and he is not scheduled to teach next semester\".\n\nThe public fallout for Summers began after Congress released over 20,000 pages of documents from the so-called Epstein files last week, which included multiple emails between Epstein and Summers.\n\nTime stamps from the emails showed the two communicated up until the day before Epstein's arrest - a decade after he pleaded guilty for soliciting prostitution from an underage girl.\n\nA married father of six, Summers messaged Epstein in November 2018 seemingly asking for romantic advice related to his interest in someone he said viewed him as an \"economics mentor\".\n\n\"Think for now I'm going nowhere with her except economics mentor,\" Summers wrote in one exchange where Epstein referred to himself as Summers' \"wing man\".\n\n\"Am I thanking her or being sorry re my being married. I think the former,\" he wrote in another email.\n\nThe emails also indicated that Summers and Epstein dined together frequently, with Epstein often trying to connect Summers to prominent global figures.\n\nNo Epstein survivor has accused Summers of misconduct, and there is no publicly available evidence indicating that he was involved in any of Epstein's crimes.\n\nSummers announced earlier Wednesday that he was leaving the board of OpenAI, and the artificial intelligence company said it respected Summers' decision to resign.\n\n\"We appreciate his many contributions and the perspective he brought to the Board,\" OpenAI said.\n\nHe joined the board of OpenAI, which makes ChatGPT, in 2023 - following a failed attempt to oust its chief executive, Sam Altman.\n\nSummers said in a statement to the BBC about the move that he was \"grateful for the opportunity to have served, excited about the potential of the company, and look forward to following their progress\".\n\nAfter the emails were shared with the public, Summers said he took \"full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr Epstein\".\n\nHe added that he wanted \"to rebuild trust and repair relationships with the people closest to me\".\n\nSummers held senior posts under two Democratic presidents; serving as treasury secretary under Bill Clinton, and as director of the National Economic Council under Barack Obama. He led Harvard from 2001 to 2006 and remains a professor there.\n\nThe Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank in Washington where Summers was a senior fellow, also has confirmed that Summers is no longer affiliated with the organisation.\n\nBoth chambers of Congress agreed on Tuesday to pass a measure to require the US justice department to release its files on Epstein, setting up the possible release of tens-of-thousands more documents.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed the bill on Wednesday, after reversing his position on the issue following pushback from his supporters."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdeger2k625o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"09:49:00.138+00:00","title":"US approves $93m arms sale to India amid easing trade tensions","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United States has approved a $92.8 million arms sale to India, including Javelin anti-tank missiles and Excalibur precision artillery projectiles, to enhance India's defense capabilities.

a bill ordering the release of government files related to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe bill requires the US justice department to release within 30 days all information that it holds on investigations into Epstein.\n\nHowever, some of these documents could be withheld if they relate to an active investigation or are deemed to invade personal privacy.\n\nTrump reversed his opposition to releasing the files, after pushback from Epstein's victims and members of his own Republican Party. With his support, the legislation overwhelmingly cleared both chambers of Congress earlier this week.\n\nUntil recently, Trump had dismissed the need to release the documents, recently calling it a Democrat-led \"hoax\" to \"deflect\" attention away from his party's work. That position was itself a change from the stance he took ahead of the 2024\n\n\"Perhaps the truth about these Democrats, and their associations with Jeffrey Epstein, will soon be revealed, because I HAVE JUST SIGNED THE BILL TO RELEASE THE EPSTEIN FILES!\" he wrote.\n\nAlthough a congressional vote was not required to release the files - Trump could have ordered the release on his own - lawmakers in the House passed the legislation with a 427-1 vote. The Senate gave unanimous consent to pass it upon its arrival, sending the bill to Trump for his signature.\n\nThe Epstein files subject to release under the legislation are documents from criminal investigations into the financier, including transcripts of interviews with victims and witnesses, and items seized in raids of his properties. Those materials include internal justice department communications, flight logs, and people and entities connected to Epstein.\n\nThe files are different from the more than 20,000 pages of documents from Epstein's estate released by Congress last week, including some that directly mention Trump.\n\nThose include 2018 messages from Epstein in which he said of Trump: \"I am the one able to take him down\" and \"I know how dirty donald is\".\n\nTrump was a friend of Epstein's for years, but the president has said they fell out in the early 2000s, two years before Epstein was first arrested. Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Monday night, Trump said Republicans had \"nothing to do with Epstein\".\n\n\"It's really a Democrat problem,\" he said. \"The Democrats were Epstein's friends, all of them.\"\n\nThe family of Virginia Giuffre, who  died by suicide earlier this year , said in a statement Trump signing the bill was \"nothing short of monumental\", for Giuffre and other survivors.\n\n\"As we look towards the next chapter, we remain vigilant. This work is not finished. Every name must be revealed, regardless of power, wealth, or party affiliation,\" her brother and sister-in-law, Sky and Amanda Roberts, said.\n\nEpstein was found dead in 2019 in his New York prison cell in what a coroner ruled was a suicide. He was being held on charges of sex trafficking. He had been convicted previously of soliciting prostitution from a minor in 2008.\n\nThe once high-flying financier had ties with a number of high-profile figures, including Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, the brother of King Charles and former prince; Trump; Trump's former advisor Steve Bannon; and a cast of other characters from the world of media, politics and entertainment.\n\nOn Wednesday, former Harvard president  Larry Summers took a leave  from teaching at the university while the school investigated his links to Epstein, revealed in a series of chummy email exchanges.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi is required to release \"all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials\" related to Epstein and his co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell no later than 30 days after the law is enacted. Maxwell currently is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking.\n\nBut based on the law's text, portions could still be withheld if they are deemed to invade personal privacy or relate to an active investigation.\n\nThe bill gives Bondi the power to withhold information that would jeopardise any active federal investigation or identify any victims.\n\nOne of the bill's architects, Republican Congressman Thomas Massie, said he had concerns about some files being withheld.\n\n\"I'm concerned that [Trump is] opening a flurry of investigations, and I believe they may be trying to use those investigations as a predicate for not releasing the files. That's my concern,\" he said."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gpgj6d4e6o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"22:42:44.708+00:00","title":"Yantar: How serious is the Russian spy ship move?","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Russian vessel Yantar, officially designated as a research ship but widely believed to be a spy vessel operated by the Main Directorate for Deep Sea Research (GUGI), has been accused of targeting Royal Air Force pilots with lasers and mapping Britain’s undersea data cables — which carry over 90% of the UK’s data and billions of financial transactions.

is the Russian spy ship move?\n\nTo Russia, the Yantar is an oceanic research vessel - to others, including the UK, it's a spy ship, and a worry for Britain's defence chiefs.\n\nThe vessel has long been suspected of secretly mapping out Britain's undersea cables, where more than 90% of our data, including billions of dollars of financial transactions, are transferred.\n\nBut now, a new escalation, with revelations the Yantar's sailors  targeted Royal Air Force pilots in patrol planes with lasers .\n\nShining lasers into a pilot's eyes is provocative, and to use the Defence Secretary John Healey's words, \"deeply dangerous\". It's illegal in the UK and can lead to a prison sentence.\n\nHealey's direct message to Russia and its leader Vladimir Putin was stark: \"We see you. We know what you're doing. And if the Yantar travels south this week, we are ready.\"\n\nBy that, he is implying should the Yantar cross inside Britain's 12-mile maritime boundary there would be a military response.\n\nThis isn't the first time the Yantar has popped up near Britain's shores  - at the start of the year a Royal Navy submarine made the highly unusual move to surface right in front of the ship as a sort of deterrent measure.\n\nThe concern is that this is part of an ongoing operation by the Kremlin to locate and map all the vital undersea cables and pipelines that connect the UK to the rest of the world.\n\nIt is also part of a wider pattern of Russian activity, as it tests Nato's reactions, resolve and defences. We've seen similar moves with the recent drone incursions across Europe, and Russian warplanes flying into Nato airspace.\n\nWhen three Russian fighter jets entered Estonian skies without permission in September, Italy, Finland and Sweden scrambled jets under Nato's mission to bolster its eastern flank.\n\nThis is all interesting intel for Russia.\n\nAs an island nation, Britain is heavily reliant on its network of undersea cables that carry data. There are also vital oil and gas pipelines connecting Britain to North Sea neighbours such as Norway.\n\nThese cables and pipes are largely undefended and apparently of great interest to Russia's research vessels.\n\nNato has identified deep-sea cables as part of the world's critical infrastructure. But they are also strategic pressure points, it says, warning that adversaries could exploit them through sabotage or hybrid warfare, threatening both civilian and military communications.\n\nRetired Royal Navy Commander Tom Sharpe made clear what the spy ship could be doing: \"The most obvious one is they sit above our cables and our critical undersea infrastructure and they nose around in the cables that transfer up to $7tn worth of financial transactions every day between us and America alone\".\n\nThe Yantar may be described by Moscow as a research vessel, but it is part of Russia's secretive Main Directorate for Deep Sea Research, or GUGI, which reports directly to the defence ministry.\n\nAnd while the ship bristles with hi-tech communications equipment, it's what we can't see that is of most concern.\n\nIt can operate remotely-piloted miniature submarines that can dive down to sea beds many thousands of metres below the surface. These are capable of mapping the locations of cables, cutting them or planting sabotage devices that could, potentially, be activated in a time of war.\n\nThe Royal Navy is experimenting with various means of combating the threat, such as a new vessel called Proteus, but critics fear much of the damage to Britain's coastal security may already have been done.\n\nAny foreign vessel operating in British waters must comply with UK national laws and international maritime conventions.\n\nThe cornerstone of these complex rules is the UN Convention on the Law of The Sea (UNCLOS). This allows foreign ships to navigate through coastal waters provided that their passage is \"innocent\" - meaning it doesn't threaten the peace or security of a coastal nation like Britain.\n\nPresident Putin was at an AI conference in Moscow on Wednesday, and gave no immediate reaction on the situation unfolding north of Scotland.\n\nRussia's Embassy in London says it's not undermining UK security and it has condemned UK Defence Secretary Healey's statement as provocative.\n\nBut all this is happening while war rages in Ukraine, a conflict Putin blames on the West and which seemingly he has no intention of stopping soon.\n\nAdditional reporting by Tiffany Wertheimer and Stuart Hughes"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8r08zmkjlzo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"00:46:01.888+00:00","title":"Ukraine: Teenage saboteurs paid to attack their own country","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In July 2025, a 17-year-old Ukrainian teen named Vlad was recruited via Telegram by a man named Roman to plant a bomb in a van used by Ukraine’s military conscription service, receiving $2,000 in promised payment.

When they later talked on the phone, Vlad says Roman spoke Russian with a street accent.\n\nVlad says he was initially reluctant but was persuaded to take on a series of increasingly dangerous tasks. First, he was told to collect a grenade but when he reached the designated location it wasn't there. He was paid $30 anyway.\n\nA few days later came another job - to set fire to a van belonging to a conscription centre, film it and run.\n\nFor that attack, Vlad says he received about $100 in cryptocurrency - much less than the $1,500 he'd been promised. Roman told him he would get the rest if he planted the bomb in Rivne.\n\nThe Telegram channels the BBC has seen where recruitment takes place are not explicitly pro-Russian, but they amplify anger felt by some Ukrainians towards the conscription service, which has been  dogged by allegations  of brutality and corruption.\n\nUsing a burner phone and an alias we joined several we were tipped off about.\n\nThe channels contained clips of fires and explosions which they claimed were carried out on their orders. But the BBC has not been able to verify the circumstances surrounding those videos.\n\nOne account we contacted immediately offered payment, either in cryptocurrency or via bank transfer, to carry out arson. We were told to contact a second account for more details and then received a message with a price list detailing how much they offered to pay for different targets.\n\nThe payments ranged from $1,500 for setting fire to a post office to $3,000 for a bank. Banks were worth more, they explained, because security glass made them harder to attack.\n\n\"You either need to pour petrol inside or throw a few Molotov cocktails inside,\" the account advised.\n\nBut even ordinary Ukrainians looking for employment can find themselves offered money to carry out sabotage.\n\nWe found adverts offering high pay for unspecified part time work posted in a variety of unrelated Ukrainian Telegram groups, including some geared at refugees and even beauty tips. When we followed one up, a recruiter again offered thousands of dollars for arson attacks and asked us to send videos as proof.\n\n\"I need all the arson I can get,\" they messaged. \"Finding a reliable person is far more difficult than parting with money. That's why I pay exactly what I say and I do it very quickly, usually within a couple of hours after receiving the video.\"\n\nThe BBC reported a number of these channels, accounts, chats and bots to Telegram, which removed a few but not most of them. One of the channels that is still active has grown by over 750 subscribers since we started monitoring it, meanwhile an account that we told Telegram had directly offered us payment for an arson attack is still live.\n\nIn a statement, Telegram said: \"Calls to violence or destruction of property are explicitly forbidden on Telegram and are immediately removed whenever discovered.\"\n\nUkrainian officials have publicly named members of Russia's intelligence agencies they suspect of acting as handlers to saboteurs.\n\nThe BBC has not been able to independently verify that the Russian state itself is responsible.\n\nHowever, several European governments have said that they have evidence of Russian agents recruiting young men to carry out acts of vandalism, arson, or even surveillance in their countries.  In the UK, six men were jailed  for their part in a Russian-ordered arson attack on a London warehouse providing aid to Ukraine.\n\nIn Ukraine, hundreds of alleged saboteurs are awaiting trial, but for some the consequences can be deadly. Several suspects have been killed by explosives they were carrying.\n\nThe SBU claims Russian handlers have deliberately detonated devices remotely, knowing their agents would be killed.\n\nIn March, a 17-year-old died and a 15-year-old was badly injured when a bomb they were believed to be taking to a rail station in Ivano-Frankivsk exploded.\n\nThe BBC put the SBU's allegations to the Russian Embassy in London. In a statement it accused Ukraine of a similar sabotage campaign  using Russian citizens .\n\n\"The practices that you mention have become a trademark of the Ukrainian special services. In particular: recruitment of civilians, including children, to carry out arson, sabotage or bombings against people, buildings or vehicles.\"\n\nThere have been reports attributing acts of sabotage inside Russia to Ukrainian recruitment on Telegram. But again, it is notoriously difficult to verify who exactly is behind these attacks.\n\nMeanwhile Vlad has a message for others tempted by the recruiters.\n\n\"It's not worth it. They will either cheat you, and then you will end up in prison just like me, or you can take a bomb in your hands and it will simply blow you up.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c78zy20ydlmo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"00:12:50.970+00:00","title":"The private notes and secret documents that tell the inside story of the UK's Covid response","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article details the internal political and scientific decision-making behind the UK's response to the Covid-19 pandemic, using private notes, WhatsApp messages, and official documents to reveal how key decisions—such as lockdowns, economic measures, and public health strategies—were made during 2020–2021.

2025-11-20T00:12:50.970+00:00\n\nTitle: The private notes and secret documents that tell the inside story of the UK's Covid response\n\nIt was the most momentous event in UK history since World War Two. As a new virus took hold, millions of us were told to stay at home and billions of pounds were spent propping up the country's economy.\n\nThe Covid inquiry will publish its second set of findings on Thursday, looking in detail at the huge political choices made at the time - including how lockdowns were introduced, the closure of businesses and schools, and bringing in previously unthinkable social restrictions.\n\n\"Did the government serve the people well, or did it fail them?\" asked the lead counsel at the start of this part of the inquiry in 2023. Since then more than 7,000 documents have been made public from the time, including WhatsApp chats and emails, private diaries and confidential files.\n\nHere, BBC News has picked out some of the urgent messages and scribbled notes that shine a light on how critical decisions were taken in 2020.\n\nOn 2 January 2020  an update appears on ProMed , a service used by health workers to warn of emerging diseases.\n\n\"World Health Organization in touch with Beijing after mystery viral pneumonia outbreak,\" it says.\n\n\"Twenty-seven people - most of them stallholders at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market - treated in hospital.\"\n\nThe next day England's deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van Tam, sends the bulletin on to Peter Horby, a professor at Oxford University and chair of Nervtag, a group that advises the government on new viral threats.\n\nBy the end of January, it's clear the health authorities in Wuhan have a major problem on their hands.\n\nThe deputy ambassador to China, Christina Scott,  sends a cable back to London marked DIPTEL BEJING (Sensitive)  comparing the situation to the outbreak of another virus - SARS - in 2003.\n\n\"Hubei province on lockdown; multiple cities have transport restrictions. Memory of SARS cover-up ensures residual distrust of government response,\" it says.\n\n\"They will do everything they can to quickly control this outbreak. But the challenge of doing so is substantial.\"\n\nThe virus spreads to Thailand and South Korea and then to Iran and northern Italy.\n\nAt lunchtime on Saturday 7 March the UK's then prime minister, Boris Johnson, is  chatting on WhatsApp to his health secretary Matt Hancock  ahead of the England vs Wales game at Twickenham.\n\nDays later, the Cheltenham horse racing festival goes ahead and Atletico Madrid fans are allowed to fly from Spain to Liverpool to watch their team play in the Champions League.\n\nThe government's strategy, backed by its scientific advisers, is to try to contain early outbreaks by isolating those with the virus and tracing any contacts.\n\nThe plan is then to move to a \"delay phase\" as full community transmission is established – using policies like home isolation advice for those with symptoms to \"flatten the curve\" of the pandemic so that hospitals do not become overwhelmed.\n\nBut the virus is spreading much faster than expected and it‘s quickly becoming clear to many scientists that far stronger action will be needed.\n\nOn Friday 13 March, two senior No 10 officials are sitting in a key meeting of scientific advisers in Whitehall.\n\n\"WE ARE NOT READY,\"  one writes in capital letters in his notepad . The other leans over and crosses out \"NOT READY\", replacing it with an expletive.\n\nThat weekend, the prime minister's chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, is locked in a series of meetings with the PM and a handful of select staff as a new strategy takes shape.\n\nGrainy smartphone images show whiteboards in No 10  full of hand-drawn charts  and  scrawled bullet points .\n\nOne graph suggests that, if the virus was allowed to run its course without any restrictions in place, then more than 100,000 people would die \"in [hospital] corridors\" in the coming wave.\n\nOn Sunday 15 March, Cummings  sends a WhatsApp to Johnson :\n\n\"FYI – [Patrick] Vallance [the chief scientific adviser] is on board with what will NEVER be discussed as Plan B.\"\n\n\"[In a] nutshell: we move through the gears to [do] whatever we need to stop NHS collapse and buy time to increase capacity.\"\n\nOver the following week, Covid rules across the UK are tightened.\n\nPeople are advised, but not legally required, to avoid all non-essential contact and work from home where possible. Then schools are closed, followed by pubs, restaurants, gyms and cinemas.\n\nBut still there are concerns that even those measures are not strong enough. On Sunday 22 March, London's mayor, Sadiq Khan,  writes a private letter to Johnson .\n\nThe next evening, in a televised address watched by 27 million people, the prime minister tells the public they must stay at home as he announces the first national lockdown.\n\nIt will now be up to the inquiry to decide if making that call earlier could have saved lives and ultimately reduced the total time that people had to stay locked indoors.\n\nOver the next month some hospitals do come under severe pressure with intensive care units spilling into corridors and side rooms. Pre-planned or elective care is put on hold but at no point does the NHS have to turn away emergency patients.\n\nCovid infections, hospitalisations and deaths start to fall.\n\nBut the cost of lockdown restrictions is huge: education is disrupted, loneliness and mental health problems get worse, and jobs and businesses are impacted.\n\nOn 22 May, Johnson  sends a handwritten note to his officials  asking for a plan to \"start operation BOUNCEBACK\".\n\nThat month some restrictions begin to be lifted – soon groups of six are able to meet outdoors and schools start a phased re-opening.\n\nIn the summer, then-chancellor Rishi Sunak tries to boost the economy with his Eat Out to Help Out scheme - 50% off food and drinks for three days a week in August.\n\nThe idea is well received by the hospitality industry but there are concerns about the health impact.\n\nOn WhatsApp (with spelling mistakes), Hancock warns Simon Case, then the most senior civil servant in Downing Street, that it's  causing problems in intervention areas  - that’s those local authorities with the highest infection rates.\n\nIn his evidence to the inquiry,  Sunak plays down a link between his scheme and the spread of the virus  saying a second wave \"happened in every other country in Europe\".\n\nBut that tension – between controlling Covid and protecting the economy – becomes even more intense through the autumn.\n\nMany scientists advising the government want to see tighter rules. They campaign for a short \"circuit breaker\" lockdown to try to drive down infections.\n\nAt times the documents suggest the prime minister supports tougher restrictions, at others he appears determined to avoid another strict national lockdown at all costs.\n\nOn WhatsApp  Johnson's closest aides complain about his decision-making  – using an emoji of a broken trolley as he appears to swerve from one policy position to another.\n\n\"This government doesn't have the credibility needed to be imposing stuff within only days of deciding not to,\" writes Case, who is now the new cabinet secretary, to Cummings and Lee Cain, No 10 director of communications, on 14 October.\n\n\"We look like a terrible, tragic joke. If we were going hard, that decision was needed weeks ago. I cannot cope with this.\"\n\nIn his testimony to the inquiry, Case later says he regrets expressing his \"at-the-moment frustrations\" with Johnson, whom he \"barely knew\" at the time.\n\nIn his evidence, Johnson defends his own leadership style, saying his views changed with the scientific evidence, and he often adopted certain positions because he wanted to hear the counter arguments.\n\nAs the nights draw in that autumn, it becomes clear that existing restrictions in England - including a 10pm curfew and the so-called tiered system of local controls - are not going to be enough to control the virus.\n\nBy the end of October, the prime minister's frustration is obvious in the long note he  scrawls at the end of a Covid briefing document  marked OFFICIAL/SENSITIVE.\n\nIn tightly spaced handwriting, Johnson pens 22 detailed points over two A4 pages of the document.\n\nHe approves of strengthening some local restrictions but bemoans the \"terrible cost\" and wonders \"for HOW LONG?\"\n\n\"Is NHS T&T [test and trace] actually achieving ANYTHING?\" he asks at one point.\n\nA week later, on 5 November 2020, England does enter its second national lockdown, this time lasting four weeks, although most schools remain open.\n\nBy this point many decisions are being taken independently by the four nations of the UK. Both Wales and Northern Ireland put in place versions of a circuit breaker lockdown, while in Scotland stricter rules are imposed in the central belt.\n\nThe plan is still to allow families and friends to meet up at Christmas.\n\nBut by mid-December a new, more infectious variant of the virus is spreading and millions living in the south-east of England are told at short notice that Christmas mixing will be cancelled.\n\nIn January 2021, a third and final full national lockdown follows across the UK, as the winter wave peaks and the NHS starts rolling out millions of doses of the first Covid vaccines.\n\nFive years on from those dramatic 12 months, the inquiry's findings are long-awaited, particularly by the 235,000 families who lost loved ones in the pandemic.\n\nThe messages and documents highlighted here are just a snapshot - the report due later will run to around 800 pages.\n\nIt will examine some of the key questions in much more detail: the timing of lockdowns, the impact of restrictions on the most vulnerable, and public confidence in the rules amid reports of partying in Downing Street and other alleged rule breaches.\n\nGroups representing thousands of bereaved families want individuals working in government at the time to be held to account for any pandemic failings.\n\nBut - above all - they want the state to learn lessons from any mistakes and be better prepared if and when the next unknown virus arrives on our shores.\n\nSome documents in this article have been recreated. All contain the original texts including spelling mistakes and typographical errors.\n\nAdditional reporting: Pilar Tomas and Ely Justiniani, BBC Visual Journalism Unit.\n\nTop image credit: Getty/BBC\n\nGet our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

department to release all its files from its investigation into convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe legislation, which calls for the release of the files \"in a searchable and downloadable format\" within 30 days, was approved overwhelmingly in both chambers of Congress, the House of Representatives and Senate, on Tuesday.\n\nTrump then announced on his Truth Social platform that he had signed it on Wednesday, starting the clock on release of the files.\n\nUnder pressure from Epstein's victims and rank-and-file Republicans, Trump on Sunday made a major reversal in his stance on the files and gave his blessing to passing the legislation. For months, he had resisted unsealing many documents from the federal investigation into the late financier.\n\nCongress' lower chamber began debating the measure on Tuesday morning and voted within hours. Several of Epstein's victims spent the day on Capitol Hill advocating for the bill's passage.\n\nNearly all the House lawmakers voted in favour of the resolution, which passed  427-1. Clay Higgins, a Louisiana Republican, was the only lawmaker who voted against the bill. Two Republicans and three Democrats did not vote. The Senate then passed the resolution.\n\nThe House Oversight Committee has already  made public thousands of documents  from the Epstein estate relating to the late financier, but the resolution covers material currently in the possession of the justice department.\n\nThose records could, in theory, include files about imprisoned Epstein co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell, as well as figures - including government officials - mentioned in the case. It could also include internal justice department documents.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the Senate confirmed that it had passed the Epstein bill and sent it to Trump.\n\nLater that evening, Trump posted on social media that he had signed it into law.\n\nWhile the press and others are often invited to witness Trump's bill-signings, this was done out of public view, and the announcement was included in a long post that also blasted Democrats he claimed were tied to Epstein, touted the president's record during this second term, and addressed the two impeachment trials of his first term.\n\n\"Perhaps the truth about these Democrats, and their associations with Jeffrey Epstein, will soon be revealed, because I HAVE JUST SIGNED THE BILL TO RELEASE THE EPSTEIN FILES!\" he wrote.\n\nHe added that because he had asked Republican lawmakers to support the measure \"the votes were almost unanimous in favor of passage.\"\n\nThe justice department now has 30 days to release its materials on Epstein.\n\nBut there are obstacles to the files being shared.\n\nThe House bill said the justice department can hold back any documents that \"jeapordise an active federal investigation or ongoing prosecution, provided that such withholding is narrowly tailored and temporary\".\n\nThat could potentially lead to delays, given that Trump has called for investigations into Epstein's links with prominent Democrats, such as Bill Clinton  and Larry Summers , \"to determine what was going on with them, and him\".\n\nClinton has strongly denied he had any knowledge of Epstein's crimes, whereas Summers has apologised for his \"misguided decision\" to continue communicating with Epstein until 2019.\n\n\"That's a potential hurdle,\" Jonathan Entin, a constitutional law professor at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio, told the BBC.\n\n\"If, in fact, this is a serious investigation, presumably the prosecutors will not want everything out there while they're sorting out whether they bring charges.\"\n\nFor those who have campaigned for the release of the files, anything short of full disclosure is likely to spark further questions and even outrage.\n\nSeveral Republican lawmakers have expressed worries that Trump's order to the justice department to investigate Epstein's ties could slow the release of the files.\n\nThomas Massie, a Kentucky congressman, vowed that he and fellow Republican dissident Marjorie Taylor Greene, of Georgia, would \"absolutely\" go to the floor of the House and read out the names of \"some of the men\" in the files if the records were not duly released by the justice department.\n\nIn addition to possible delays, the public is also likely to see lots of redactions in any release of new Epstein documents.\n\nIn the tranche of files released by the House Oversight Committee last week, names and phone numbers were frequently blacked out to protect privacy.\n\nThe latest bill says the attorney general can \"withhold or redact\" records that include victims' names, medical files and other personal information that \"would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\".\n\n\"Simply letting anything out could reveal a lot of private information that's not relevant or appropriate for public consumption,\" Prof Entin said.\n\nThe attorney general can also withhold classified material and images of sexual abuse.\n\nThe justice department has already said that a \"large volume\" of its 300 gigabytes of data from Epstein investigations includes images and videos of minors and thousands of downloaded videos and images of child sex abuse.\n\nOther information in the documents could be protected by grand jury secrecy rules, which the latest bill does not explicitly address.\n\nUS Attorney General Pam Bondi said on Wednesday morning when asked about the Epstein files during an unrelated news conference: \"We'll continue to follow the law with maximum transparency, while protecting victims.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgdgrqwnq9o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"11:55:36.825+00:00","title":"US military officials in Kyiv as Europe warns against reported Russia peace plan","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Senior US military officials, led by Army Secretary Dan Driscoll, have arrived in Ukraine to discuss ending the war with Russia, marking the most senior military visit since President Trump took office.

Russia peace plan\n\nSenior Pentagon officials have arrived in Ukraine to \"discuss efforts to end the war\" with Russia, the US military has said.\n\nThe team, led by US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll, held talks with Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko on Thursday morning. They are expected to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky later in the day.\n\nReports began surfacing on Wednesday that the US and Russia had prepared a new proposed framework to end the war, requiring major concessions from Ukraine including giving up territory and dramatically shrinking its military.\n\nIt was reportedly drafted by President Donald Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff and Russian special envoy Kirill Dmitriev.\n\nNeither Washington nor Moscow have officially confirmed the plan.\n\nHowever, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio wrote on X that achieving a \"durable peace will require both sides to agree to difficult but necessary concessions\".\n\nHe said the US was consulting both sides of the conflict to \"develop a list of potential ideas for ending this war\".\n\nDriscoll's team is the most senior military group to travel to Kyiv since Trump took office in January. He is joined by Army chief of staff Gen Randy George, top US army commander in Europe Gen Chris Donahue, and sergeant major of the army Michael Weimer.\n\nDetails of the draft Witkoff-Dmitriev 28-point plan emerged more than three weeks after the two men are said to have spent three days in meetings in Miami, Florida.\n\nCiting people familiar with the matter, Axios, the Financial Times and Reuters reported that the plans call for Kyiv to give up areas of the Donbas in eastern Ukraine that it still controls, to cut significantly the size of its armed forces, and to forego many of its weapons.\n\nZelensky has repeatedly ruled out any territorial concessions to Russia.\n\nKirill Dmitriev's team declined to comment on the reports. The BBC has also asked the White House and a representative for Witkoff to comment.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday that \"contacts\" had taken place with the US, but no \"consultations or negotiations\" were happening.\n\nNeither European nor Ukrainian officials are believed to have been involved in drafting the new proposal, sparking fears it could be overwhelmingly favourable to Russia.\n\nEU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas warned on Thursday that for any plan to work, it would need to have Ukrainians and Europeans on board, and French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot said \"the Ukrainians do not want any form of capitulation\".\n\nAfter meeting US officials, Ukraine's Prime Minister did not address the rumoured plan - but said their visit provided \"an opportunity for representatives of the American administration to assess the situation on the ground and see the consequences of Russian aggression\".\n\nReports of the plan emerged on Wednesday, the same day Ukrainian officials said  at least 26 people had been killed in a Russian missile and drone attack on blocks of flats in Ukraine's western city of Ternopil . Another 22 people were missing at the site, Zelensky said on Thursday.\n\nZelensky was in Turkey at the time of the Ternopil attack, and unconfirmed Ukrainian reports suggested that talks had been planned with Trump's envoy in Ankara, but were called off.\n\nThere was no mention of the proposed framework when the US army secretary arrived in Kyiv late on Wednesday. Army spokesman Col David Butler said only that Driscoll and his team were there \"on behalf of the [Trump] administration on a fact-finding mission to meet Ukrainian officials and discuss efforts to end the war\".\n\nA Ukrainian official told CBS, the BBC's US media partner, that talks on the trip would focus on the military situation on the ground - as well as plans for a possible ceasefire.\n\nThe unnamed official said: \"Presidents Zelensky and Trump have already agreed to stop the conflict along the existing lines of engagement, and there are agreements on granting security guarantees\".\n\nAfter talks with the US army secretary on Wednesday, Ukrainian Defence Minister Denys Shmyhal posted on X: \"We focused on the next steps for implementing the historic defence agreements reached by President Zelensky and President Trump.\"\n\nKyiv and its Western allies, including the US, have been calling for an immediate ceasefire along the vast front line, but Moscow has ruled that out, repeating demands that Ukraine says amount to its de facto capitulation.\n\nEarlier this month, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow's pre-conditions for a peace deal - including ceding territory, tough curbs on the size of Ukraine's military and the country's neutrality - had not changed since Putin laid them out in 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, a White House official confirmed to the BBC that special envoy to Ukraine Keith Kellogg would leave his post in January.\n\nHe reportedly decided that this would be a natural end to his time in the post, which requires Senate approval beyond 360 days.\n\nKellogg has been seen as an important advocate for Ukraine in the White House during a time when Trump has often appeared to side with Russia in the conflict."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz919xyx7weo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"17:31:45.316+00:00","title":"Instagram and Facebook-owner Meta notifies Australian teens of accounts shutdown","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Meta, the parent company of Instagram, Facebook, and Threads, is notifying Australian teenagers aged 13 to 15 of upcoming account deactivation, ahead of a nationwide ban effective 10 December 2025 that prohibits under-16s from creating new accounts on major platforms including TikTok, YouTube, X, and Reddit.

'AI factory' at the heart of the tech race\n\nGoogle's ultra-private CEO Sundar Pichai is showing me around Googleplex, its California headquarters. A walkway runs along the length of it, passing by a giant dinosaur skeleton, a beach volleyball pitch and dozens of Googlers lunching under the hazy November sun.\n\nBut it's a laboratory, hidden away at the back of the campus behind some trees, that he is most excited for me to see.\n\nThis is where the invention that Google believes is its secret weapon is being developed.\n\nKnown as a Tensor Processing Unit (or TPU), it looks like an unassuming little chip but, says Mr Pichai, it will one day power every AI query that goes through Google. This makes it potentially one of the most important objects in the world economy right now.\n\n\"AI is the most profound technology humanity [has ever worked] on,\" he insists. \"It has potential for extraordinary benefits - we will have to work through societal disruptions.\"\n\nBut the confusing question lingering over the AI hype is whether it is a bubble at risk of bursting - as, if so, it may well be a spectacular burst akin to the dotcom crash at the start of the century, with consequences for us all.\n\nThe Bank of England has already warned of a \"sudden correction\" in global financial markets, saying \"market valuations appear stretched\" for tech AI firms. Meanwhile. OpenAI boss Sam Altman has speculated that \"there are many parts of AI that I think are kind of bubbly right now\".\n\nAsked whether  Google would be immune  from a potential bubble burst, Mr Pichai said it could weather that potential storm - but for all his starry-eyed excitement around the possibilities of AI, he also issued a warning: \"I think no company is going to be immune, including us.\"\n\nSo why, then, is Google investing more than $90bn a year in the AI build-out, a three-fold increase in just four years, at the very moment these suggestions are being discussed?\n\nThe AI surge - of which Google is just one part - is, in cash terms, the biggest market boom the world has seen.\n\nIts numbers are extraordinary - there is $15 trillion of market value at Google and four other tech giants whose headquarters are all within a short drive of one another.\n\nChipmaker turned AI systems pioneer Nvidia in Santa Clara is now worth more than $5 trillion. A 10-minute drive south, in Cupertino, is Apple HQ, hovering around $4 trillion; while 15 minutes west is $1.9 trillion Meta (previously Facebook). And in the centre of San Francisco, OpenAI was recently valued at $500bn.\n\nThe purely financial consequences of this trend are significant enough.\n\nThe value of the shares in these companies (and a few others outside Silicon Valley, such as Microsoft in Seattle) have helped cushion the US economy from the impact of trade wars, and kept retirement plans and investments buoyant - and not just in the US.\n\nYet it comes with a big risk. That is, the incredible dependence of US stock market growth on the performance of a handful of tech giants. The Magnificent 7 - Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla - collectively comprise one third of the valuation of America's entire S&P 500.\n\nAnd that market value is now more highly concentrated in a few firms than it was during the dotcom bubble in 1999, according to the IMF.\n\nMr Pichai points out that every decade or so come these \"inflection points\": the personal computer, then the internet in the late 1990s, followed by mobile and cloud. \"Now it's clearly the era of Artificial Intelligence.\"\n\nBut as for the big question - is it a bubble?\n\nMr Pichai argues there are two ways of thinking about it. First, there is \"palpably exciting\" progress of services that people and companies are using.\n\nBut he concedes: \"It's also true when we go through these investment cycles, there are moments we overshoot collectively as an industry…\n\n\"So I think it's both rational and there are elements of irrationality through a moment like this.\"\n\nNow, a distinction is emerging in the markets between those businesses that rely on often borrowed money and  complicated deals to access the chips that power their AI, and the biggest tech companies, such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon, which can fund investment in chips and data from their own pockets.\n\nWhich brings us to Google's own silicon chips, or their prized TPUs.\n\nThe lab, where they are tested, is the size of a five-a-side football pitch with a mesh of multi-coloured wires and deep blue blinking lights. Signs all around read: \"restricted\".\n\nWhat's striking is the sheer noise - this is down to the cooling systems, which are needed to help control the temperature of the chips, which can get incredibly hot when crunching trillions of calculations.\n\nThe TPUs are designed to help power AI machines. And they work differently from other types of chips.\n\nThe CPU (central processing unit) is the primary component of a computer - essentially its brain - that performs most of the processing and control functions, while GPUs (graphics processing units) perform more specialised processing, executing many parallel tasks at once - this can include AI.\n\nHowever Asics (application-specific integrated circuits), are chips custom-built for a specific purpose, for example, a specific AI algorithm. And the TPU is a specialist Google-designed type of Asic.\n\nA core aspect of the AI boom has been the mad dash to amass lots of top-performing chips and put them into data centres (or the physical facilities that store, process and run large amounts of data and software).\n\nNvidia's boss Jensen Huang once coined the term \"AI factories\" to describe the massive data centres full of pods and racks of super chips, connected to huge energy and cooling systems.\n\n(Tech bosses such as Mark Zuckerberg have referred to some being the size of Manhattan. The Google TPU lab is somewhat more modest, testing out the technology for deployment elsewhere.)\n\nStories abound of tech bros begging chip makers for hundreds of thousands of these highly engineered pieces of silicon. Take the recent dinner at Nobu in Palo Alto, where Elon Musk and Larry Ellison, the founder and head of Oracle, tried to woo Nvidia's Jensen Huang, to sell them more of them.\n\nAs Mr Ellison put it: \"I would describe the dinner as me and Elon begging Jensen for GPUs. Please take our money - no, no take more. You're not taking enough. We need you to take more, please!\"\n\nIt is precisely the race to access the power of as many as possible of these high performance chips, and to scale them up into massive data centres, that is driving an AI boom - and there's a perception that the only way to win is to keep spending.\n\nThe terrace of the Rosewood Sand Hill hotel, a sprawling 16-acre estate near the Santa Cruz mountains that serves crab rolls and $35 signature vodka martinis, is where the big Silicon Valley deal-making gets done. It's close to Stanford University and Meta's HQ, as well as the headquarters of major venture capital firms.\n\nThere are whispered rumours about who will be next to announce customised AI chips - Asics - to compete with Google and Nvidia.\n\nJust before I visited, something of a storm was brewing about the investment plans of OpenAI, which Elon Musk co-founded.\n\nThe firm, which started as a not-for-profit but has since established a commercial structure, has been the focus of a web of cross-investments involving buying up chips and other computer hardware needed for AI processing.\n\nFew in the industry doubt OpenAI's phenomenal user growth - in particular the popularity of its chatbot, ChatGPT. It has ambitions to design its own custom AI chips, but some have speculated about whether it might need government support to achieve this.\n\nIn a podcast episode that aired last month, an OpenAI investor questioned how the company's spending commitments tallied with its revenues, to which co-founder Sam Altman shot back, challenging the revenue figures quoted, and adding: \"If you want to sell your shares, I'll find you a buyer. Enough.\"\n\nHe has since shared a lengthy post on X, explaining, among other things, that OpenAI is looking at commitments of about $1.4 trillion over the next eight years and why he believes now is the time to invest in scaling up their technology.\n\n\"I do not think the government should be writing insurance policies for AI companies,\" he said.\n\nBut he also said: \"What we do think might make sense is governments building (and owning) their own AI infrastructure.\"\n\nElsewhere, there have been notable very recent falls in share prices of AI infrastructure companies - Coreweave, a start-up that supplies OpenAI, saw its shares lose 26% of their value earlier this month.\n\nPlus, there have been some reactions in markets for perceived credit risk among other firms. And while most of these tech share prices have generally climbed higher over the course of 2025, there has been a mild dip more generally in the past few days.\n\nNone of this has dampened the excitement over AI's potential within the industry. Google's consumer AI model, Gemini 3.0, launched to great fanfare earlier this week — this will pitch Google in a direct battle with OpenAI and its still-dominant ChatGPT for the market share.\n\nWhat we don't yet know is whether it marks an end to the days of chatbots going rogue and recommending glue as a pizza ingredient. So, is the end result of all this fantastic investment is that information is less reliable, I asked Mr Pichai.\n\n\"I think if you only construct systems standalone and you only rely on that, [that] would be true,\" he told me. \"Which is why I think we have to make the information ecosystem has to be much richer than just having AI technology being the sole product in it.\"\n\nBut I put it to him that truth matters. His response: \"truth matters\".\n\nNor is the other big question facing tech today dampening the enthusiasm around advancing AI's potential. That is: how on Earth to power it?\n\nBy 2030, data centres around the world will use about as much electricity as India did in 2023, according to the IMF. Yet this is also an age where energy supply is under pressure by governments committing to climate change targets.\n\nI put this to Google's Mr Pichai, asking if it is coherent to have ambitions to generate 95% of electricity from low-carbon sources by 2030 - as the UK government does - and also be an AI superpower?\n\n\"I think it's possible. But I think for every government, including the UK, it's important to figure out how to scale up infrastructure, including energy infrastructure.\n\n\"You don't want to constrain an economy based on energy,\" he adds. \"I think that will have consequences.\"\n\nYears ago, as a fledgling reporter I cut my teeth in the 2000 dotcom bubble. It followed a famous speech by Federal Reserve Governor Alan Greenspan about \"irrational exuberance\".\n\nIn that time I interviewed Steve Jobs twice, and a few years later questioned Mr Pichai's predecessor Larry Page, and commentated live on the collapse of WorldOfFruit.com.\n\nThrough it all, one lesson became clear: that even in the worst-case scenarios and the toughest of crashes, catastrophe isn't guaranteed for all.\n\nTake Amazon - its share price slumped to $6 and its market capitalisation fell to $4bn during that crash, yet some 25 years on Jeff Bezos and his company are very much going strong. Today Amazon is worth $2.4 trillion.\n\nThe same would, inevitably, be true of companies shaken by a potential AI bubble burst.\n\nPlus there is another looming factor that may well explain why so many in Silicon Valley - and beyond - are blind to, or perhaps choosing not to, acknowledge this risk, and pushing on regardless.\n\nThat is, the attraction of the glittering prize at the end: achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI).\n\nThis is the point at which machines match human intelligence, something many believe is within reach. Or beyond that, reaching artificial super-intelligence (ASI), the point at which machines surpass our intelligence.\n\nBut I was also told something else that was thought-provoking by a Silicon Valley figure - that it doesn't matter whether there really is a bubble or if it bursts. Step back and what is going on in the bigger picture is a global battle for AI supremacy, with the US against China taking centre stage.\n\nAnd while Beijing funds these developments centrally, in the US it is a messy but productive free market free for all, which means trial and error on an epic scale.\n\nFor now, the US has superiority in silicon over China - companies like Nvidia with their GPUs and Google with their TPUs can afford to accelerate into the storm.\n\nOthers will surely fail, and spectacularly so, affecting markets, consumer sentiment and the world economy. The physical footprint left behind, however, containing sheer computing firepower for the deployment of mass AI technologies, will inevitably shape our economy and could well also shape how we work and learn - and who dominates the world for the rest of the 21st Century.\n\nBBC InDepth  is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

revenues, easing investor concerns about heavy artificial intelligence (AI) spending that have unsettled markets.\n\nThe company said revenue for the three months to October jumped 62% to $57bn, driven by demand for its chips used in AI data centres. Sales from that division rose 66% to more than $51bn.\n\nFourth-quarter sales forecasts in the range of $65bn also topped estimates, sending shares in Nvidia about 4% higher in after-hours trading.\n\n\"There's been a lot of talk about an AI bubble. From our vantage point, we see something very different,\" said chief executive Jensen Huang.\n\nIn a statement, Mr Huang said sales of its AI Blackwell systems were \"off the charts\" and that \"cloud GPUs [graphics processing units] are sold out\".\n\n\"We excel at every phase of AI.\"\n\nNvidia, the world's most valuable company, makes chips that are crucial for AI data centres and is seen as a bellwether for the AI boom.\n\nIts latest results were under even more attention than usual on Wall Street amid mounting concern that AI stocks are overvalued - fears that may persist despite the blockbuster results.\n\nThose fears had fuelled four consecutive daily drops in the S&P 500 index leading up to Wednesday, as questions swirl about returns on AI investments. The benchmark index has fallen nearly 3% so far in November.\n\nSome analysts have compared the surge in AI stocks to the dotcom boom of the late 1990s. This saw the values of early internet companies soar amid a wave of optimism over the then-new technology before the bubble burst in early 2000.\n\nThis collapse in share prices led to some companies going bust, and also hit the value of people's savings including their pension funds.\n\nThe bar was high heading into Nvidia's results.\n\nAdam Turnquist, chief technical strategist for LPL Financial, said the question was not whether the company would beat expectations, \"but by how much\".\n\nMatt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"While AI valuations are dominating the news feeds, Nvidia is going about its business in style.\"\n\nHe said valuations for certain areas of the AI sector \"needed to take a breather, but Nvidia is not in that camp\".\n\nMr Huang had previously said he expected $500bn in AI chip orders through next year. Investors were looking for details about when the company expects those revenues will come to fruition, and how it plans to fulfill the orders.\n\nColette Kress, Nvidia's chief financial officer, told analysts the company would \"probably\" be taking more orders on top of the $500bn that had already been announced.\n\nBut she also expressed disappointment about regulatory limits that stymie the company's ability to export its chips to China, saying the US \"must win the support of every developer\" including those in China.\n\nShe said Nvidia was \"committed to continued engagement\" with the American and Chinese governments.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday at the US-Saudi Investment Forum in Washington, Mr Huang joined Elon Musk to announce a massive data centre complex in Saudi Arabia that will have Musk's AI company, xAI, as its first customer.\n\nThe facility will be outfitted with hundreds of thousands of Nvidia chips.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported the US Commerce Department has approved the sale of up to 70,000 advanced AI chips to state-backed companies in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, reversing an earlier decision.\n\nThe agreement was brokered following talks between US President Donald Trump and Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Salman, who visited the White House this week.\n\nThe titans of the technology sector are ramping up their spending on AI, as they rush to reap the benefits of a boom that has pushed stocks to record highs.\n\nEarnings reports from Meta, Alphabet and Microsoft last month  reaffirmed the colossal amounts of money  these firms are shelling out for everything from data centres to chips.\n\nSundar Pichai, the head of Google's parent firm Alphabet,  told the BBC  that while the growth of AI investment had been an \"extraordinary moment\", there was some \"irrationality\" in the current AI boom. His comments came amid other warnings from industry leaders.\n\nSimon French, chief economist at Panmure Liberum, said there were some parallels with the dotcom bubble of 25 years ago.\n\n\"The issue is not so much these big cash generative companies like Nvidia, but it's the wider part of the tech ecosystem, quite a lot of which isn't currently profitable,\" he told the BBC's Today programme.\n\nNvidia is at the heart of a web of deals among key players in the AI space such as OpenAI, Anthropic and xAI.\n\nThe deals have drawn scrutiny for their circular nature, as AI firms increasingly invest in one another. The agreements include Nvidia's  $100bn investment in OpenAI , the firm behind ChatGPT.\n\nEileen Burbidge, a tech investor and founding partner at Passion Capital, told the Today programme: \"A lot of what is fuelling some of the scepticism or concern about a bubble is that there is seen to be a lot of circular deals going on, whereby Nvidia is committing to invest in a company which in turn is committing to invest in Nvidia or is committing to buy Nvidia chips.\n\n\"So it goes round and round, maybe with one or two other people inside the circle, but yes it is about 10 to 20 companies that all seem to have these deals going back and forth.\"\n\nAdditional reporting by Lily Jamali, North America Technology Correspondent, San Francisco"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2l20jzp30o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"04:09:31.531+00:00","title":"Alice Guo: Philippines jails 'Chinese spy mayor' for life","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Alice Guo, a former mayor of Bamban in the Philippines, was found guilty of human trafficking and sentenced to life in prison for her role in operating a massive scam center disguised as online casinos (Pogos) targeting Chinese clients.

Epstein saga reveals Republican rifts - and power of Trump's base\n\nAfter Congress voted to force the justice department to release its files on Jeffrey Epstein, the legislation will now move to President Donald Trump's desk.\n\nAnd if Trump does sign it into law as expected, it will mark the final action in what has been a remarkable and abrupt change in his position.\n\nFor months, Trump was dismissive of calls to release the government's full trove of documents about the late financier and convicted sex offender. He described the case in July as \"pretty boring stuff\".\n\nThat was until Sunday, when - with a snowballing number of Republicans in the House signalling they would vote to release them - the president relented and encouraged them to do so. His shift opened the floodgates for an overwhelming 427-1 vote on Tuesday.\n\nHis reversal was a rare instance of Republican politicians pressuring Trump into action, and into a very public change in stance, rather than the other way around.\n\nRegardless of what new information any future files may contain, the saga exposed fractures within the Republican Party and highlighted the power of Trump's Make America Great Again (Maga) base.\n\nIt also has shown that, despite his best efforts, he may have struggled to move attention away from the Epstein files if he had not backed the vote.\n\n\"I think he sees that this is an issue he's underwater in with average Republicans,\" said Martha Zoller, a conservative radio host and Republican strategist in Georgia.\n\n\"I think Trump had to do this in this point in time because he wants to be back on the right side,\" she added.\n\nA NPR/PBS News/Marist poll taken at the end of September - when Trump was yet to back the release of the files - suggested that 67% of Republican registered voters supported the release of all Epstein files with victims' names redacted. Another 18% supported releasing some of the files with similar redactions.\n\n\"Transparency on what happened is extremely important to the voters,\" Chris Ager, the former chair of the New Hampshire Republican Party, told the BBC.\n\nHe praised Trump's reversal, arguing it was the sign of a healthy party \"that you can have a disagreement on an issue... and come to a conclusion where essentially everyone is agreeing: Let's release the files\".\n\nFor much of this year, however, there were sharp disagreements on the issue. Trump's reversal came as it looked increasingly likely he could face a revolt in the House.\n\nThe most notable defector, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, said at a press conference with Epstein survivors on Tuesday that the saga had \"ripped Maga apart\".\n\nDue to her vocal opposition, Trump dubbed her a \"traitor\" on Truth Social. Typically, such a public attack from the president would quiet dissent from a Republican, especially one up for re-election. But in a sign of the political potency of the Epstein issue, Greene pushed back.\n\n\"He called me a traitor for standing with these women and refusing to take my name off this discharge petition,\" Greene said on Tuesday.\n\nThe House would advance the legislation, Greene said, \"because the American people who we serve as representatives here in Congress demanded this vote happen\".\n\nGreene, who first broke with Trump in the spring, has been the public face of building dissent within Trump's Maga movement - not just on Epstein, but on other issues such as the US bombing of Iranian nuclear sites in June and the president's continuing focus on foreign wars.\n\nBut on the Epstein issue in particular, Greene and others in the movement have called for greater transparency despite Trump's desire to focus on other issues. And after Tuesday's votes in Congress, they can claim real success.\n\n\"The saga reveals how much power the Republican base now wields,\" party strategist Rina Shah told NPR in the summer. \"MAGA voters are furious.\"\n\n\"This pressure is forcing even the most loyal Trump allies to break ranks. And it signals a Republican Party that's increasingly populist, where the grassroots can push leaders to act or they have to pay a price.\"\n\nThe Epstein vote has also overshadowed other White House initiatives. Last week,  President Trump announced he would roll back tariffs on groceries  like coffee, bananas and beef as Americans' cost of living concerns increased.\n\n\"I think he'd rather people talk about those things than Epstein,\" Zoller, the Republican strategist in Georgia, said.\n\nOne senior Trump administration official told Axios  that the president decided to drop his opposition to the legislation because the noise around the Epstein issue was proving to be a \"major distraction\".\n\nGreene herself has said the White House was going down the wrong track by resisting the release of more Epstein files, instead of focusing on other issues.\n\n\"It's insanely the wrong direction to go,\" Greene  told POLITICO . \"The five-alarm fire is healthcare and affordability for Americans. And that's where the focus should be.\"\n\nThe White House, meanwhile, said in a statement to the BBC that \"by releasing thousands of pages of documents, co-operating with the House Oversight Committee's subpoena request, and President Trump recently calling for further investigations into Epstein's Democrat friends, the Trump Administration has done more for the victims than Democrats ever have.\"\n\nEven beyond Epstein, Trump's influence on the party has been tested - and even rebuffed this week. And there are signs of potential rifts, too.\n\nHis public efforts to encourage Indiana's leaders to redraw their congressional maps to favour Republicans before the 2026 midterm elections hit a potentially critical roadblock on the same day as the Epstein vote.\n\nThe Republican-controlled Indiana Senate voted on Tuesday to adjourn until January, signalling it would not take up the issue of redistricting. That is despite major pressure from the president as well as the state's Republican governor who has asked lawmakers to work on redrawing maps.\n\nTrump has even threatened to back primary challenges to senators who oppose redistricting. But as with the Epstein issue, there has been defiance within the party.\n\n\"I've been a legislator 42 years. I'm not going to change my vote,\" Republican Senator Vaneta Becker told CNN.\n\nReferring to the nickname for people from Indiana, she said: \"Hoosiers are not used to being sort of in a blackmail position. It does not bode well.\"\n\nBut as those close to Trump have noted, he has navigated fallouts and internal opposition in the past. Despite this defiance on several fronts, the president remains the most powerful figure in the party.\n\n\"I think the president is going to be praised for the fact that the information gets released and is out. At the end of the day, it's results, not the sausage making that got us there,\" said Mr Ager, referring to the Epstein files.\n\nTrump said as much himself in a Truth Social posted Tuesday night, remarking that he did not care when Senate Republicans passed the bill. “I just don't want Republicans to take their eyes off all of the Victories that we've had.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1m3ddkn3gdo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"11:57:48.036+00:00","title":"Wicked: For Good leaves critics less spellbound than the first film","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The sequel to the critically acclaimed film Wicked, titled Wicked: For Good, has received mixed reviews, with some critics praising its emotional depth and performances—particularly from Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande—while others criticize its thin narrative, lack of strong new songs, and shift to a less peppy, more glum tone compared to the original.

from critics - but many are far less spellbound than they were by the first film.\n\nThe much-anticipated sequel, released on Friday, sees Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande reprise their roles as Elphaba and Glinda in the origin story of the Wicked Witch of the West.\n\nWicked: For Good is \"not quite Wicked: For Great\",  said Empire's John Nugent  in a three-star review.\n\nTotal Film's Molly Edwards  praised the film as an \"absolute triumph\", but added it \"suffers slightly from thinner source material and weak new songs\".\n\nThe Wizard of Oz spin-off, adapted from the hugely successful stage musical, is originally based on a 1995 book by Gregory Maguire.\n\nThe second film provides fresh origin stories for Dorothy's travel companions in Oz - the Cowardly Lion, Scarecrow and Tin Man.\n\nWicked: For Good also sees Jeff Goldblum return as the Wizard, alongside Michelle Yeoh as Madame Morrible and Jonathan Bailey as Fiyero.\n\nThe i paper's Francesca Steele said:  \"It doesn't quite reach the heights of Part One, but this is still a highly entertaining display of what musical theatre can do on screen with top level performances and a true affection for the world-building.\"\n\nMany critics were less enthusiastic. \"There's no magic in this aimless slog of a sequel,\"  said the Independent's Clarisse Loughrey  in a two-star review.\n\n\"If your complaint about last year's Wicked was that it was so oddly lit that you could barely see what was going on, then fear not – in Wicked: For Good, you won't mind so much, because there's so little to look at.\"\n\nIn a one-star review,  the Telegraph's Robbie Collin said:  \"It doesn't amount to two hours of story – the stage show clips through the same plot in around half the time – and the padding is as obvious as it is exhausting.\"\n\nHe suggested the central pair's friendship \"rings false\", adding: \"What should be piercing, impassioned moments are by turns frivolous and sappy.\"\n\nHowever,  Kevin Maher of the Times was  much more positive, awarding the film four stars.\n\n\"They've only gone and done it,\" he said. \"The makers of this musical sequel have delivered a film that surpasses last year's box-office smash in verve, ambition and emotional ache.\"\n\nBoth movies have been directed by Jon M Chu, who was also behind Crazy Rich Asians, In The Heights and Now You See Me 2.\n\nChu is also set to direct a new big-screen adaptation of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, pencilled in for release in 2027.\n\nMany critics highlighted Grande's performance in Wicked: For Good, with several predicting another supporting actress nomination at the Oscars in March.\n\nVariety's Peter Debruge said  the pop star shows \"fragility\" in her more \"nuanced\" performance.\n\n\"Whereas Grande had a relatively one-dimensional role to play in part one, Glinda now faces a complex evolution,\" he said.\n\n\"Grande has been acting since she was a kid,\"  noted the Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney,  \"and her quiet moments of introspection, anxiety or sadness show tender depths, as does her loyalty to Elphaba.\"\n\nBut he also praised her co-star. \"Make no mistake, Erivo remains a powerhouse, with pipes that shake the heavens and a wellspring of unforced emotional intensity that never runs dry.\"\n\n\"What a performance from Erivo,\"  agreed the Guardian's Peter Bradshaw  in a four-star review.\n\nHe added the sequel as a whole \"keeps the rainbow-coloured dreaminess and the Broadway show tune zinginess from part one\".\n\nThe stage musical was split into two parts for its film adaptation, but the two movies were filmed in one go.\n\nThe first was released last November and grossed more than £750m at the box office worldwide.\n\nIt went on to win two Oscars and two Baftas, for costume and production design, as well as the cinematic and box office achievement prize at the Golden Globes.\n\nOne problem facing the sequel is that most of Wicked's best-known songs, including Popular and The Wizard and I, appeared in the first film.\n\nIt's an issue it shares with the Broadway and West End musical. \"On stage, the second act lacks a song as strong as Defying Gravity,\" Debruge noted.\n\nIn his Empire review of Wicked: For Good, Nugent concluded: \"The tone is different from that of the first film: less peppy, more glum.\n\n\"With the exception of Goldblum - who appears to be acting in his own film, delighting in stuttery drollness - all the characters are much less cheerful than they were last time around, and as a result it's less enjoyable for us to watch.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4pjjzd784o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"12:53:04.159+00:00","title":"Ultra-processed food

warn\n\nAction is needed now to reduce ultra-processed food (UPF) in diets worldwide because of their threat to health, say international experts in a global review of research.\n\nThey say the way we eat is changing - with a move away from fresh, whole foods to cheap, highly-processed meals - which is increasing our risk of a range of chronic diseases, including obesity and depression.\n\nWriting in The Lancet , the researchers say governments need \"to step up\" and introduce warnings and higher taxes on UPF products, to help fund access to more nutritious foods.\n\nHowever some scientists say this review can not prove that UPFs directly cause health harms and more research and trials are needed to show that.\n\nUltra-processed foods are defined as containing more than five ingredients you would not find at home in your kitchen cupboard, such as emulsifiers, preservatives, additives, dyes and sweeteners.\n\nExamples of UPFs include sausages, crisps, pastries, biscuits, instant soups, fizzy drinks, ice cream and supermarket bread.\n\nSurveys indicate these industrially-manufactured foods are on the rise in diets around the world, worsening the quality of what we eat with too much sugar and unhealthy fats and a lack of fibre and protein.\n\nThis review of evidence on the impact of UPFs on health, carried out by 43 global experts and based on 104 long-term studies, suggests these foods are linked to a greater risk of 12 health conditions.\n\nThese include type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, depression and dying prematurely from any cause.\n\nReview author Prof Carlos Monteiro, from the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil, who set up the Nova classification system for categorising food, said the growing consumption of ultra-processed foods \"is reshaping diets worldwide, displacing fresh and minimally processed foods and meals\".\n\n\"This change in what people eat is fuelled by powerful global corporations who generate huge profits by prioritising ultra-processed products, supported by extensive marketing and political lobbying to stop effective public health policies to support healthy eating,\" he added.\n\nCo-author Dr Phillip Baker, from the University of Sydney, said the answer was \"a strong global public health response - like the coordinated efforts to challenge the tobacco industry\".\n\nThe review acknowledges a lack of clinical trials showing exactly how UPFs damage health - but says that should not delay action to protect people worldwide from potential health harms.\n\nSome scientists have commented that it is difficult to untangle the effects of UPFs in people's diets from other factors in people's lives, such as lifestyle, behaviour and wealth.\n\nCritics of the Nova classification system say it relies too much on the level of processing in foods, and not on how nutritious that particular food is. For example, wholegrain bread, breakfast cereals, low-fat yoghurts, baby formula milk and fish fingers all count as ultra-processed but have lots of good in them.\n\nProf Kevin McConway, emeritus professor of applied statistics at the Open University, said: \"A study like this can find a correlation, but it can't be certain about cause and effect.\"\n\nHe said there was still \"room for doubt and for clarification from further research\".\n\n\"It seems to me likely that at least some UPFs could cause increases in the risk of some chronic diseases. But this certainly doesn't establish that all UPFs increase disease risk.\"\n\nIt is still not clear what it is about ultra-processed foods that could be causing or contributing to diseases.\n\nProf Jules Griffin, from the University of Aberdeen, said there were some positive sides to food processing, and more research to understand how it influences our health was \"urgently needed\".\n\nThe Food and Drink Federation (FDF), which represents the industry, says UPFs can form part of a balanced diet, like frozen peas and wholemeal bread.\n\n\"Companies have been making a series of changes over many years to make the food and drink we all buy healthier, in line with government guidelines,\" says Kate Halliwell, chief scientific officer at the FDF.\n\nThe amount of sugar and salt in products on sale in shops and supermarkets has gone down by a third since 2015, she added.\n\nThe UK's Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition  said earlier this year that the association between higher consumpton of ultra-processed foods and adverse health outcomes was \"concerning\".\n\nBut it added it was \"unclear\" whether these foods are unhealthy due to processing or because many of them are high in calories, saturated fat, salt and free sugars.\n\nCurrent UK government advice on diet is to eat more fruit, vegetables and fibre, and cut back on sugar, fat and salt."},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/19/business/pif-saudi-arabia-fund-problems.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"19:08:10-05:00","title":"Saudi Arabia’s Prince Has Big Plans, but His Giant Fund Is Low on Cash","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reveals that despite Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s public claims of a $1 trillion investment in the U.S., the Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF) is facing severe financial strain due to failed or delayed projects like Neom, a coffee chain, and an electric vehicle startup.

In the Oval Office on Tuesday, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told reporters, without providing details, that his nation would invest $1 trillion in America.\n\nBut a different reality is being whispered about in the power corridors of Riyadh and Wall Street: The kingdom’s vaunted Public Investment Fund, which Saudi Arabia has typically used to fulfill commitments like the one it made this week in Washington, is running low on cash for new investments.\n\nThat’s in large part because Prince Mohammed and his deputies have spent a vast portion of the nation’s bounty on projects that are in financial distress, and they are frantically trying to turn things around, according to 11 people briefed on its operations, including current employees, board members, investors and their representatives.\n\nThere is Neom, a vast would-be utopian region on the nation’s northern tip that was to feature robot workers, a ski resort and beaches of crushed marble but has instead confronted mountains of delays.\n\nThen there are other, more conventional projects in the ever-expanding PIF portfolio that are nowhere near fruition, such as a coffee chain with one shop so far and dreams of exporting beans to Austria; a cruise line with one ship; and an electric vehicle start-up begun three years ago that has yet to deliver a car.\n\nThe kingdom still sits on deep oil wealth. Its ability to pump, however, is heavily constricted by geopolitical agreements to curtail supply and a low price for crude overall. The government is running a growing budget deficit and taking on debt to fulfill Prince Mohammed’s domestic promises.\n\nWhile PIF says it holds nearly $1 trillion in assets, a huge portion of its portfolio is tied up in hard-to-sell assets for which no public valuations are available. Its representatives have begun telling international investors that it is all but unable to allocate any more money for the foreseeable future, six people with knowledge of those discussions said.\n\nUnlike some other comparable sovereign wealth funds, PIF posts only a page and a half of annual financial figures.\n\nA spokesman for the fund, Marwan Bakrali, said it had $60 billion in cash and similar financial instruments. He described it as “very liquid by regional standards.”\n\nBehind the scenes, PIF is actively restructuring its operations under the watchful eye of the crown prince, said the people briefed, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential business plans.\n\nThe prince has fired the head of at least one of its more imperiled projects, Neom, according to two people briefed on the matter. Meanwhile, the fund is furiously slashing internal financial projections for various investments, including a string of luxury resorts on the Red Sea that sit mostly empty.\n\nIts board is also drawing up plans to act differently in the future by investing in more conventional areas such as publicly traded stocks and bonds, one of the people said. It hopes to double in size to $2 trillion in the next five years, although it’s unclear how much of that would come from investment gains and how much would be new money from the Saudi government.\n\n“As a long-term investor,” Mr. Bakrali said, “our investments will be judged over generations, not quarters, and the returns will be measured both financially and through economic and societal impact.”\n\nIn the meantime, PIF’s bigger moves in recent months have been yet more private investments, this time in artificial intelligence companies.\n\nThe largest investment by PIF this autumn was bid for a controlling stake in the world’s largest video game maker, Electronic Arts. PIF’s representatives say it’s a long-term investment that will eventually double in value. People close to the fund point to another motivating factor: Prince Mohammed is an avid gamer.\n\nThe world of sovereign wealth funds can be a staid place. The world’s largest, Norway’s $2 trillion Government Pension Fund Global, invests largely in publicly traded stocks.\n\nOther countries’ funds look inward, such as India’s, which is barred from investing outside the nation.\n\nFor much of its history, PIF was not much different. It was created in 1971, funded by the Saudi government squarely to finance domestic companies such as nationally run banks and electric utilities.\n\nBy 2015, it had roughly $100 billion in assets, 50 staff members and zero name recognition. That March, a new Saudi king transferred control of the entity to his third wife’s eldest son, Prince Mohammed, then 29 years old.\n\nAnd the prince turned PIF into a central tool in his roll-up of power, so much so that PIF now says that was the year it was “reborn.”\n\nPrince Mohammed packed PIF with government cash, took out loans and redirected some of the nation’s oil sales (currently estimated by outsiders at $500 million per day) to the fund. He also transferred in assets that had been seized from political opponents and family members in what was termed an “anti-corruption” effort.\n\nThe government has attributed 1.1 million Saudi jobs to PIF projects, though that claim cannot be independently verified.\n\nPIF itself now has more than 3,000 staff members. Its annual report, released in August, indicates that its revenue increased 25 percent in the preceding year.\n\nThe expansion has also been huge for Yasir al-Rumayyan, the fund’s governor. A regional banker for most of his career, he said in one podcast interview that Prince Mohammed initially tapped him to find candidates to lead PIF. The royal, Mr. al-Rumayyan said, “wasn’t fully satisfied with the majority” and chose the man searching instead.\n\nHe has reveled in the role — showing one visitor a photo of his yacht — and goes so far as to sharply correct those who pronounce the fund’s name “Piff,” as opposed to spelling out the initials, according to three people who have heard him say so.\n\nMr. al-Rumayyan attended the Super Bowl last year with Benjamin Horowitz, whose venture capital firm manages money for PIF, and sat at Mr. Trump’s side last November at the post-election Ultimate Fighting Championship match at Madison Square Garden.\n\nHe has taken stakes for Saudi Arabia in American companies like Uber and Citi, and created a global league around his personal hobby, golf. Sports leagues and teams — including big brands like Formula 1 and the English Premier League team Newcastle United — sold stakes to PIF’s funds.\n\nPIF has also made some opportune bets in the public markets, including building a huge portfolio in U.S. stocks amid their pandemic nadir, which proved profitable when prices rebounded.\n\nMr. al-Rumayyan declined to be interviewed.\n\nRegarding PIF’s restructuring, Ahmed al-Khateeb, a PIF board member and Saudi Arabia’s tourism minister, characterized the moves as natural steps in Prince Mohammed’s broader effort to overhaul the Saudi economy.\n\n“You stop, you assess what went right, what went wrong, and then you improve,” Mr. al-Khateeb said.\n\nA major symbol of the influence of PIF and Mr. al-Rumayyan has been the Future Investment Initiative, dubbed Davos in the Desert, an annual gathering that hosts thousands of people in the nation’s capital.\n\nHistorically, among the most sought-after parties coinciding with the event has been a gathering at Mr. al-Rumayyan’s palm-tree-lined villa, formerly owned by a magnate jailed in Prince Mohammed’s infamous 2017 roundup of political opponents.\n\nSo when about 100 titans of global finance and industry convened at his villa, there would have seemed little reason to expect anything other than the usual cavalcade of abu al-karavatta, the dismissive term that some locals use to refer to tie-wearing out-of-towners seeking the kingdom’s cash.\n\nAs Mr. al-Rumayyan rose to give welcoming remarks in his personal ballroom, with waiters poised to serve lamb and rice, he was greeted by an unusual sight.\n\nAn unoccupied seat was marked with a place card for the private-equity billionaire Stephen A. Schwarzman, who had attended every prior annual dinner and whose firm, Blackstone, has made a small fortune off its relationship with the kingdom.\n\nMr. Schwarzman’s absence was noted by attendees, but he did arrive, hours late (after dessert). His spokeswoman blamed traffic.\n\nThroughout the conference, there was a sense of change, with wistful talk of a headier time for Westerners when it felt like most visiting businesspeople to Riyadh would return home with cash.\n\nThis year, PIF’s representatives told asset managers of new conditions for future investments: The only way it would give them more is in exchange for help bailing out its older investments, according to two of the fund’s staff members and five investors or their representatives.\n\nIn one illustrative deal outlined by a person who was in negotiations for an investment from PIF, the Saudi fund said it would allocate more money only if more than double its investment was funneled back into private Saudi companies.\n\nThe upshot would be international money flowing into PIF-owned projects, bolstering their status.\n\nOf reinvesting PIF’s money into private Saudi companies, another PIF spokesman, Rupert Trefgarne, said: “There’s no requirement. There’s certainly an encouragement.”\n\nEven the company that runs the annual conference itself is on the block. Majority owned by PIF, earlier this year it hired a U.S. investment bank to explore options, including selling itself to an outsider for cash, according to two people consulted by Future Investment Initiative executives.\n\nNo such buyer could be found. PIF now hopes to list shares in the conference organizer on the Saudi Stock Exchange, which it also owns. PIF’s spokesman said that had always been the plan.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70922w8z8wo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"10:52:36.492+00:00","title":"Daniel Radcliffe reveals 'sweet' response to his letter to new Harry Potter actor","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Daniel Radcliffe, who played Harry Potter in the original film series, has shared that he personally wrote a heartfelt letter to Dominic McLaughlin, the new actor cast as Harry in HBO’s reboot of the franchise.

to $31.9 Billion. Is It Enough for Wall Street?\n\nPublished: 2025-11-19T16:41:37-05:00\n\nJust three weeks ago, Nvidia became the first publicly traded company to be worth more than $5 trillion thanks to the cutting edge computer chips it makes for artificial intelligence.\n\nOn Wednesday, Nvidia provided a reminder of just how much the world craves those chips. The company said that in its most recent quarter, its profit was $31.9 billion, up 65 percent from a year ago and 245 percent from the year before that. Among the tech industry’s giants, only Google’s parent company, Alphabet, made more money in the same quarter.\n\nNvidia controls about 90 percent of the market for the chips used in A.I. projects, and its financial performance has become a bellwether for what can be expected of the rest of the tech industry, which is investing trillions of dollars in big data centers all over the world.\n\nNvidia’s eye-popping profits could be enough to calm nerves on Wall Street, where there are increasing concerns that lavish spending is getting way ahead of demand for the products and services Silicon Valley’s engineers are building.\n\nThe S&P 500 is down 3.6 percent since Nvidia, the most valuable publicly traded company in the world, hit its $5 trillion milestone. Shares of Nvidia have fallen 10 percent during that time, though they are still up 34 percent so far this year.\n\nNvidia has experienced heady growth since the A.I. boom started three years ago, and the most recent quarter was no different. In the three months that ended in October, the company said sales of its chips for A.I. data centers rose 44 percent to $51 billion. The business helped lift the company’s total revenue to $57 billion, eclipsing Wall Street’s expectations for sales of $55.2 billion.\n\nImportantly, Nvidia also provided hints that a company with a stranglehold on an essential product can continue growing fast, even as total sales mushroom. Nvidia’s revenue in the current quarter is projected to rise 65 percent from a year ago to $65 billion, in line with recent quarters. The forecast blew past Wall Street’s forecast for sales of $57 billion.\n\n“Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out,” Jensen Huang, the company’s chief executive and co-founder, said in a news release. “Compute demand keeps accelerating.”\n\nShares of the company rose more than 3 percent in after-hours trading.\n\nIn recent months, Nvidia has worried investors because it is making investments in some of the customers that buy its chips. The deals have raised questions about whether Nvidia is paying itself. For example, it announced it would invest $100 billion in OpenAI, which makes ChatGPT. The start-up receives that money as it buys or leases Nvidia’s chips.\n\nOn Tuesday, it announced a similar deal with another A.I. company: Nvidia will invest $10 billion in Anthropic, which will purchase $30 billion in A.I. computing backed by Nvidia chips. Goldman Sachs has estimated that Nvidia will make about 15 percent of its sales next year from what critics call circular deals.\n\n“The fundamentals for the company are still intact, but you have these clouds that keep popping up,” said Daniel Morgan, a senior portfolio manager at Synovus, a bank.\n\nJensen Huang, Nvidia’s chief executive, has defended Nvidia’s investments. Speaking at a news briefing in Washington last month, he said that Nvidia hadn’t invested any of the $100 billion yet and that the deal was really an invitation to invest “along the way” as OpenAI builds toward an eventual public listing.\n\nNvidia is also facing questions about increased competition. AMD, which also makes high-quality A.I. chips, recently struck its own deal with OpenAI; and Qualcomm, another chipmaker, struck a deal to sell its A.I. products to Saudi Arabia.\n\nMr. Huang has remained optimistic about Nvidia’s prospects. Last month, he revealed that the company was expecting $500 billion in sales through the end of next year, which would more than double what it made over the previous two years.\n\nThe company’s sales are growing, even as it remains blocked from selling to China. Beijing has discouraged Chinese companies from buying Nvidia’s chips, hindering its access to the world’s largest semiconductor market. Mr. Huang had been campaigning President Trump to approve the sale of Nvidia’s latest line of chips to China and encouraging Beijing to allow companies to buy them.\n\nBut Mr. Trump’s advisers discouraged him from weighing in on the issue for national security reasons when he recently met with China’s leader, Xi Jinping. Mr. Trump instead said that Mr. Huang would have to negotiate directly with the Chinese.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/19/us/cherfilus-mccormick-fema-florida-indictment.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"20:57:56-05:00","title":"Florida Lawmaker Stole FEMA Funds for House Campaign, Prosecutors Say","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Representative Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick, a Democratic congresswoman from Florida’s 20th Congressional District, has been charged with stealing $5 million in FEMA disaster funds intended for a pandemic vaccine registration program and using it to finance her congressional campaign.

negotiated between the Trump administration and Russia, would require Kyiv to surrender territory, significantly reduce the size of its army and relinquish some types of weaponry, according to officials familiar with the proposal.\n\nThe 28-point proposal, drafted without Ukrainian involvement, reflects the maximalist demands the Kremlin has made throughout the war, which Ukraine has long denounced as amounting to capitulation. Parts of the plan were described by two officials who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly — one Ukrainian and one who did not want to be identified by country.\n\nIt is the latest effort by the Trump administration to reinvigorate stalled settlement talks in the nearly four-year-old war. But some Ukrainian commentators also saw the proposal as a bid by Russia to press Ukraine for concessions while the government of President Volodymyr Zelensky is weakened by a high-level corruption scandal, which could dissuade allies from sending aid. Kyiv is also under growing pressure on the battlefield, as Moscow’s forces make gains against a Ukrainian military that is stretched thin.\n\n“One thing is clear,” said Kostiantyn Yelisieiev, a former presidential foreign policy adviser. “Ukraine’s position right now is not strong, and this is seen not only inside the country but also by our partners, including the United States, and of course by the aggressor.” Mr. Yelisieiev is in the political opposition to Mr. Zelensky.\n\nThe White House did not comment on the contents of the proposal. Asked by reporters about the plan, Stephen Miller, a White House deputy chief of staff, said, “Don’t have any news or announcement to make on that.”\n\nThe United States is reviving its diplomatic efforts after meetings over the summer between Ukrainian and Russian officials, and between President Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, produced no breakthroughs. As part of this push, the Trump administration has pressed Russia and Ukraine to present in writing terms for a settlement that could become a basis of negotiations.\n\nA delegation of senior U.S. military officials arrived in Kyiv on Wednesday for talks with Ukrainian officials about breaking the impasse.\n\nMr. Zelensky, too, is seeking to resurrect long-dormant peace talks. He met on Wednesday in Turkey, where Ukraine and Russia have engaged in previous rounds of discussions, with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Mr. Erdogan has offered to mediate between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nThe U.S.-Russian plan emerged from talks between Steve Witkoff, a Trump administration envoy, and a Russian counterpart, Kirill Dmitriev. A senior Ukrainian official said the Trump administration had informed Ukraine of the talks but had not sought Kyiv’s input. The terms in the plan were unacceptable to Kyiv, the official said.\n\nThe proposal would require Ukraine to surrender to Russia the entire eastern Donbas region, even lands that Russian forces have not captured, according to the Ukrainian official. At the current rate of advance, Russia would have to fight an additional four years to seize that territory, according to DeepState, a group with ties to the Ukrainian military that maps the battlefield.\n\nThe proposed settlement would also cap the size of Ukraine’s army far below its current levels and would recognize the Crimean Peninsula and other occupied areas as Russian, the senior Ukrainian official said.\n\nAnother official familiar with the proposal said Russia was demanding that foreign troops be prohibited on Ukrainian-controlled territory after a cease-fire. This would rule out a French and British proposal to deploy what has been called a reassurance force to stabilize security in postwar Ukraine.\n\nThe plan, that official said, would also require Ukraine to relinquish some long-range weapons. Ukraine now routinely fires domestically made exploding drones at targets in Russia hundreds of miles from its border, including in Moscow.\n\nThe settlement proposal is similar to one that Russia presented in talks in 2022. Moscow subsequently lost about half of the territory it had captured in the initial invasion, before recapturing some in bloody, drawn-out fighting.\n\nThis fall, the tide has turned in Russia’s favor, as its forces have menaced long-held Ukrainian positions on the battlefield. Russia is advancing in small units into a partially surrounded city in eastern Ukraine, Pokrovsk, signaling momentum. Most analysts expect the city to fall soon.\n\nThe Ukrainian Army is strained, running short of soldiers. Analysts and members of Ukraine’s Parliament say gaps of more than 600 yards have opened along some stretches of the front line. Increasingly, Ukraine is relying not on infantry in trenches but on soldiers flying exploding drones to slow the onslaught.\n\nRussia has signaled a willingness to keep up its costly, incremental advances until Ukraine acquiesces to concessions limiting its security ties to the West. Kyiv says that such concessions would reward Russian aggression and leave Ukraine weak and vulnerable, arguing that Russia would use a cessation in fighting to recoup its strength for another invasion in the future.\n\nErica L.

Stirm, Returning P.O.W. in Pulitzer-Winning Photo, Dies at 92\n\nPublished: 2025-11-19T19:56:12-05:00\n\nRetired Colonel Robert L. Stirm, an Air Force pilot whose return home to his family after more than five years of captivity in North Vietnam was the subject of a jubilant Pulitzer Prize-winning photo — an image that hid the painful truth about his marriage ending, died on Nov. 11 in Fairfield, Calif. He was 92.\n\nHis death, in a senior living community, was confirmed by his daughter, Lorrie Stirm Kitching.\n\nOn March 17, 1973, then-Lieutenant Colonel Stirm arrived home with 19 other former prisoners of war to Travis Air Force Base in Fairfield, about 50 miles northeast of San Francisco. Lorrie, who was 15 at the time and his eldest daughter, raced to him on the tarmac in a moment immortalized by a photojournalist: Grinning ecstatically, she had her arms outstretched for a hug, and her feet were off the ground as if levitating.\n\n“It was like when you’re a little kid, and Santa is going to be coming, and you know it’s going to be amazing but you don’t know how amazing it’s going to be,” Ms. Stirm Kitching, now 68, said in an interview.\n\nHer sister and two brothers also hurried toward their father, smiling, as did their mother, Loretta, who wore a large corsage for the occasion.\n\nSlava Veder, an Associated Press photographer known as Sal, was on assignment to cover the reunions and rushed to a makeshift darkroom inside a women’s bathroom on the base after rival photographers from United Press International took the men’s bathroom.\n\n“It was a hell of a moment and, in that moment, you are grabbed,” said Mr. Veder, who is now 99. “It was overwhelming.”\n\nHis published photograph, titled “Burst of Joy,” appeared in newspapers across the country and was awarded the 1974 Pulitzer Prize for feature photography. Lt. Col. Stirm, dressed in his military uniform, back to the camera, face unseen, served as a representative of every serviceman who returned to loved ones from Vietnam, Mr. Veder told Smithsonian magazine in 2005.\n\nDonald M. Goldstein, a co-author of “The Vietnam War: The Story and Photographs” (1997), described the moment to the magazine as “a hero’s welcome for guys who weren’t always seen or treated as heroes.” After a lost war that “tore us apart,” Mr. Goldstein said, “it was finally over, and the country could start healing.”\n\nFor Colonel Stirm, the joyous homecoming captured on camera obscured the agonizing reality he had braced for on the flight home: the dissolution of his marriage.\n\nHis will to survive as a P.O.W., he later said, was built on memories of his domestic life and the hope of returning one day to his family. Those thoughts sustained him after he was shot down and was forced to eject from his F-105 Thunderchief during a bombing mission over North Vietnam on Oct. 27, 1967, and they continued to sustain him in prison camps, including the notorious “Hanoi Hilton,” where he was starved, tortured and subjected to mock executions.\n\nHe held the rank of major at the time he was taken prisoner and was eventually elevated to colonel. He was among 591 American prisoners of war released as part of Operation Homecoming after the Paris Peace Accords ended the United States involvement in the Vietnam War. Three days before he landed at Travis Air Force Base, he was handed what he described as a “Dear John” letter from his wife.\n\n“I have changed drastically — forced into a situation where I finally had to grow up,” his wife of 18 years wrote. “Bob, I feel sure that in your heart you know we can’t make it together — and it doesn’t make sense to be unhappy when you can do something about it. Life is too short.”\n\n“I love you — we all love you,” she continued, “but you must remember how very unhappy we were together.”\n\nMs. Stirm Kitching said her mother acknowledged in the letter of having an affair during her husband’s captivity that ended before his return.\n\n“She was a really great mother,” Ms. Stirm Kitching added, recalling that she led the family in nightly prayers for Colonel Stirm’s safe return and kept his memory alive for the children by explaining, when asked, the date and place and circumstance of each photograph of him that hung on a wall in the family room.\n\nThe affair, Ms. Stirm Kitching said, was a “sad, unfortunate thing.”\n\n“She met somebody who pursued her and called her and sent her flowers,” she said. “She was feeling like, ‘Oh gosh, I’ve been this mom, just taking care of my kids, making sure they’re good and growing up well, and then somebody wants to pay attention to me.’”\n\nDespite the painful letter to her husband, Loretta Stirm offered to try to make her marriage work, her daughter said.\n\nColonel Stirm later told The Associated Press that he had found it impossible to forgive his wife for the affair. Days after a bitter divorce in 1974 that made the news, both remarried. Colonel Stirm kept several copies of the picture autographed by Mr. Veder but, while his children displayed them, he did not.\n\nRobert Lewis Stirm was born on March 22, 1933, in San Francisco and grew up in Hillsborough, Calif. His father, H. Glenn Stirm, owned a steel-fabrication business. His mother, Virginia (Lewis) Stirm, ran the household.\n\nHe joined the Air Force aviation cadet program in 1953, graduated from the University of Colorado in 1954 with a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering and earned his pilot wings in 1959. After numerous postings and advanced training, he served as an F-105 pilot with the 333rd Tactical Fighter Squadron at Takhli Royal Thai Air Force in Thailand from August 1967 until he was shot down that October.\n\nHe said little about Vietnam after returning home, Ms. Stirm Kitching said, but he told a story about a fellow P.O.W., John S. McCain, the Navy pilot and future U.S. senator, who told a joke by tapping on the wall in code to Colonel Stirm in an adjacent cell. “My Dad said it was the first time he laughed in jail,” she said, adding, “I wish I knew the joke.”\n\nColonel Stirm retired from the Air Force in 1977 and worked as a corporate pilot and in the family steel-fabrication business. His military decorations included three awards of the Silver Star as well as two awards of the Legion of Merit and the Distinguished Flying Cross.\n\nHis marriages to Loretta Mrosko and Nancy Smith ended in divorce.\n\nIn addition to his daughter Lorrie, he is survived by two other children, Cynthia Pierson and Roger Stirm; three sisters, Virginia Hall, Marjorie Stirm and Nancy Stirm Bronstein; a brother, John Stirm; nine grandchildren; and eight great-grandchildren. His son Dr. Robert “Bo” Stirm Jr., a dentist, died in 2023.\n\nIn 2005, Ms. Stirm Kitching told Smithsonian that when she looked at the Pulitzer-winning photograph, she felt fortunate because many families had not been reunited during or after the Vietnam War.\n\nToday, she said, she feels “joy and happiness” when seeing herself, always running to hug her father, whom she called her hero. She keeps the photo in the foyer of her home near San Francisco. When guests arrive, she said, she likes to tell them, “This is my way to welcome you; I’m so happy you’re here.”\n\n"}]}
