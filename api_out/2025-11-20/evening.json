This week alone, lawmakers had already weighed three different complaints in just as many days.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, retiring Democratic  Rep. Chuy García  of Illinois was censured for allegedly coordinating his own retirement to ensure his hand-picked replacement would win his seat next year. It was fellow Democrat, Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington, who forced the House to take up the symbolic resolution against García, infuriating members of her party.\n \n\n   \n  Ultimately, 22 Democrats voted with Gluesenkamp Perez to reprimand Garcia, along with 213 Republicans.\n \n\n   \n  The same day, a vote to censure  Democratic Del. Stacey Plaskett , for texting convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein during a 2019 congressional hearing, failed on a 209-214 vote. Three Republicans joining Democrats in opposing the measure and three Republicans registering as “present.”\n \n\n   \n  If the vote to censure Plaskett had passed, Democrats had planned to bring up a resolution against Florida GOP Rep. Cory Mills, who has faced a swirl of controversies in his time in Congress, including an  allegation of assault  against Mills and  accusations from  an ex-girlfriend that he threatened to release sexually explicit images and videos of her.\n \n\n   \n  But on Wednesday, Republican Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina brought a complaint against Mills, pointing to individuals who served with Mills in the Army disputing his version of events that led him to be recommended for the Bronze Star, which was reported on by  NOTUS . The complaint was  referred to the House Ethics Committee  after a vote to censure him failed despite seven Republicans joining Mace in favor of the measure.\n \n\n   \n  In response to the wave of complaints this week, Democratic Rep. Don Beyer and GOP Rep. Don Bacon have sponsored a bill to raise the threshold for a censure resolution to 60%.\n \n\n   \n  “I just think we’ve got out of control,” Bacon said Thursday. “It should be more bipartisan when we do one.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Alison Main, Aileen Graef, Sarah Ferris, Ellis Kim and Arlette Saenz contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/asia/philippines-alice-guo-jailed-scams-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"20:59:00-05:00","title":"Philippines Jails Former Mayor - Who Officials Say Faked Her Nationality to Get the Job - for Human Trafficking","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Philippine court has convicted former mayor Alice Guo—alleged to be a Chinese national named Guo Huaping who faked her Filipino nationality to run for office—of human trafficking for operating an illegal online scam complex in Bamban, Tarlac province.

The UN has estimated that hundreds of thousands of people have been trapped in virtual slavery by gangs who force them to financially exploit people around the world through false romances, bogus investment pitches and illegal gambling schemes.\n \n\n   \n  In the Philippines, scam operations rapidly built vast compounds with buildings or rented upscale offices in Manila’s financial districts and moved around large numbers of workers by bribing authorities.\n \n\n   \n  Philippine authorities allege that Guo is a Chinese national named Guo Huaping, who faked Filipino citizenship to run for mayor of the town of Bamban in northern Tarlac province, where she ran a sprawling illegal scam compound near the town hall.\n \n\n   \n  “They used the parcels of land and buildings to house the trafficked workers and to force them to work as scammers,” the court said in its decision.\n \n\n   \n  Last year, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. ordered a ban on hundreds of mostly Chinese-run online gaming operations, which proliferated under the administration of previous President Rodrigo Duterte. Marcos accused the gaming operations of crimes including financial scams, human trafficking, torture, kidnapping and murder.\n \n\n   \n  Many have been raided and shut down since then, with tens of thousands of trafficked workers rescued and sent back to their home countries.

The Philippines is the oldest US treaty ally in Asia.\n \n\n   \n  “We will continue to demand accountability from every government agency that failed in their duties, and we will continue to investigate the full extent of Chinese intelligence operations in our country,” Hontiveros said. “And to all others who enabled Alice Guo’s criminal empire: the Philippines is not a playground for exploitation, infiltration and espionage.”\n \n\n   \n  Guo has not been charged with espionage and she denies any connection to spying.\n \n\n   \n  The town of Bamban is located several kilometers (miles) from a Philippine air force base, where American forces have been allowed to maintain a rotating presence with their aircraft and weapons under a 2014 defense pact.\n \n\n   \n  Guo was dismissed from her post as mayor last year by a state Ombudsman, who cited grave misconduct.

I’m happy.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s been hard,” she said. “I can’t sleep, but now I’m gonna go sleep.”\n \n\n   \n  Martinez had been accused of closely pursuing Customs and Border Protection agent Charles Exum and hitting his car on October 4. But Martinez’s defense attorney, Christopher Parente, alleged the opposite, saying it was actually the agent who sideswiped Martinez. Parente said, “This case was going to be a winner at trial regardless.”\n \n\n   \n  “These agents were lying about what happened,” he added following the dismissal. “Miss Martinez never rammed anybody. These agents hit Miss Martinez. These agents jumped out and shot Miss Martinez, a US citizen whose only crime was warning her fellow community members that ICE was in the neighborhood.”\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors had alleged Martinez and Ruiz “aggressively and erratically” followed and then rammed into Exum and other agents inside his vehicle who were on security detail in Chicago.\n \n\n   \n  Joseph Fitzpatrick, spokesperson and assistant US attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, said in a statement Thursday his office is “constantly evaluating new facts and information relating to cases and investigations arising out of Operation Midway Blitz, the largest ever law enforcement surge in the Northern District of Illinois.”\n \n\n   \n  “This continuous review process applies to all matters — whether charged or under investigation,” Fitzpatrick said. “It helps ensure that the interests of justice are served in each and every case, and that those cases that are charged are appropriately adjudicated through our federal court system.”\n \n\n   \n  When reached by CNN for comment on the judge dismissing charges against Martinez, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin restated previous claims that Martinez was one of the drivers who rammed agents and referred questions on the charges to the Justice Department.\n \n\n   \n  After the collision last month, Exum stepped out of his vehicle and fired his weapon five times at Martinez, according to the charging complaint. Martinez suffered five gunshot wounds, Parente previously told CNN. McLaughlin called the shots “defensive.”\n \n\n   \n    Text messages and the federal vehicle were key in the court case\n \n\n   \n  Text messages from Exum were displayed in court earlier this month as Parente sought to prove his claim  the government potentially destroyed evidence  that may have supported the defense when it released Exum’s damaged vehicle and allowed the agent to drive it more than 1,000 miles to his home state of Maine.\n \n\n   \n  Exum texted an  article from The Guardian  on October 7 to a group of other agents, which quoted Parente saying Martinez had “seven holes in her body from five shots from this agent.”\n \n\n   \n  “Read it. 5 shots, 7 holes,” Exum wrote in the next text message.\n \n\n   \n  Another message to the group read, “I have a MOF amendment to add to my story. I fired 5 rounds, and she had 7 holes. Put that in your book boys.”\n \n\n   \n  Exum explained to the judge an “MOF” is a “Miserable Old F**ker” who is always trying to one-up someone wherever possible.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not clear what exactly Exum was responding to, because the text conversations were redacted when presented to the court.\n \n\n   \n  When asked to explain the text message, Exum said, “That means illegal actions have legal consequences.”\n \n\n   \n  Exum defended his use of force against Martinez, saying his life was at risk and “I did what I had to do.”\n \n\n   \n  Referencing the messages, Parente said, “He’s going to pay for those shots, and he’s not going to be as proud and as arrogant as he was when he testified in this courthouse a few weeks ago.”\n \n\n   \n  Alexakis  said she was skeptical  about why the cars of Martinez and Ruiz were kept in Chicago as evidence, while the Border Patrol agent’s car was released and allowed to travel normally.\n \n\n   \n  “What gives me great pause is the fact the cars have been treated differently,” Alexakis said previously.\n \n\n   \n  Government attorneys defended federal agents’ decisions, saying the FBI had preserved any evidence they believed was relevant before releasing the car back onto the street.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information.  \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Whitney Wild, Omar Jimenez and Elizabeth Wolfe contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/sport/ncaa-mack-rhoades-resigns-from-baylor","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"19:00:00-05:00","title":"Baylor AD Mack Rhoades Resigns, a Week After Taking Leave for Personal Reasons","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Mack Rhoades, Baylor University’s athletic director and former chairman of the College Football Playoff selection committee, resigned effective immediately, following a one-week leave of absence for personal reasons.

leave of absence for personal reasons.\n \n\n   \n  Rhoades had also stepped down last week from his role as chairman of the College Football Playoff selection committee.\n \n\n   \n  Linda Livingstone, the school’s president, said in a letter Thursday that Rhoades had informed her of his decision to step away from his position at Baylor. She said the move was effective immediately.\n \n\n   \n  After Rhoades began his leave of absence November 12, the private Big 12 school said it was investigating unspecified allegations against him. The status of that investigation, or if it is still ongoing, was not immediately clear after he left the job.\n \n\n   \n  The school, without giving further details, said last week that allegations against Rhoades did not involve Title IX, student-athlete welfare or NCAA rules violations, and did not involve the football program.\n \n\n   \n  Rhoades took over as Baylor’s AD in July 2016, in the wake of the revelation of a sprawling sexual assault scandal that cost two-time Big 12 champion football coach Art Briles his job. That NCAA case against the Bears wasn’t resolved until 2021, when the school was placed on four years of probation.\n \n\n   \n  Livingstone said co-interim ADs Jovan Overshown and Cody Hall will continue in their current roles leading the department during the search for a new athletic director.\n \n\n   \n  “Be assured we remain deeply committed to competing at the highest levels of athletics, both in competition and the classroom,” Livingstone wrote. “I am certain that we will find a new AD who shares in this competitive commitment, aligns with and supports Baylor’s Christian mission, and can lead us into this next era of intercollegiate athletics.”\n \n\n   \n  Rhoades was in the second year of a three-year CFP selection committee appointment, and his first season as chairman. He was replaced as chairman by Arkansas athletic director Hunter Yurachek, while Utah AD Mark Harlan was appointed to fill Rhoades’ vacancy on the committee as the Big 12 representative after previously serving a one-year term in 2023.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/politics/justice-department-adam-schiff-ed-martin-bill-pulte-christine-bish","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"19:52:00-05:00","title":"Justice Department Investigates Alleged Impersonation in Mortgage Fraud Probes of Democrats","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Justice Department is investigating whether individuals impersonated federal agents in mortgage fraud probes targeting prominent Democrats, including U.S. Senator Adam Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James.

Devan Cole, Casey Gannon, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:52 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Justice Department is investigating whether people impersonated federal agents in mortgage fraud probes of prominent Democrats, a development that could complicate efforts to prosecute political enemies of President Donald Trump, people briefed on the matter told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The new probe led by the Maryland US Attorney’s Office and the Federal Housing Finance Agency inspector general is examining the handling of the mortgage fraud investigations into California Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James, according to sources.\n \n\n   \n  One witness in the Schiff matter, a Republican from California named Christine Bish, said she traveled to Greenbelt, Maryland, on Thursday morning in response to a grand jury subpoena. Bish said she spoke to federal investigators inside the courthouse who asked her about people who told her they were working with Trump administration officials leading the mortgage probes.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re investigating each other,” Bish later told CNN in a telephone interview. “It’s stupid.”\n \n\n   \n  The subpoena Bish received demanded she give to the prosecutors in Maryland any communications she had with “any person or persons claiming to be” working under the Federal Housing Finance Director  Bill Pulte , the Justice Department official  Ed Martin , or others “claiming to be acting at the direction or request” of them or their offices, according to the subpoena reviewed by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Pulte helped to prompt the Schiff and James investigations, as well as mortgage fraud-related inquiries into other prominent Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  Pulte in particular has played an extraordinary role in the probes by publicly making criminal referrals to the Justice Department, a step normally taken through mortgage investigators in his agency. And Martin has touted his pursuit of Trump’s political foes.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors are also looking into whether grand jury materials gathered in the James case were illegally shared with people who were not authorized to review it, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter. James has pleaded not guilty to fraud charges.\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department declined to comment. The FHFA, its inspector general’s office and Martin didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. Attempts to reach Pulte also were unsuccessful.\n \n\n   \n  Bish, who previously ran for office in California, has publicly said she had information to share about Schiff related to his mortgages. She told CNN on Thursday that when she came to the Greenbelt courthouse, she believed she was going to provide grand jury testimony on Schiff and mortgage fraud, but that prosecutors “seemed more concerned” about looking into whether “there was conspiracy or collusion between me and Pulte or me and Ed Martin.”\n \n\n   \n  Bish said she passed her independent findings on Schiff to Pulte’s office earlier this year, after she said his office contacted her directly.\n \n\n   \n  Schiff is one of Trump’s longtime political foes, with the president in September pushing in a Truth Social post for Attorney General Pam Bondi to prosecute him.\n \n\n   \n  “Pam: I have reviewed over 30 statements and posts saying that, essentially, ‘same old story as last time, all talk, no action,”  Trump wrote in the post . “Nothing is being done. What about Comey, Adam ‘Shifty’ Schiff, Leticia??? They’re all guilty as hell, but nothing is going to be done.”\n \n\n   \n  Yet prosecutors from the Maryland US Attorney’s Office have been hesitant to proceed with charges against Schiff, CNN previously reported. Schiff has denied any wrongdoing, has not been charged with any crime, and his attorney declined to comment for this story Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “If they’re trying to tie me into some kind of clandestine conspiracy, it’s not there, and the best way to protect myself is to be open and honest and public,” Bish said Thursday, adding later: “Something’s not adding up. And I haven’t gotten to the bottom of it yet, but I will.”\n \n\n   \n  The interview questions Bish was asked on Thursday went beyond any probe into Schiff, she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “They assured me, when they interviewed me, that the focus of the investigation was Adam Schiff. And I kept pulling the testimony back to Schiff, but it seemed like they were looking for more — stuff that doesn’t exist,” Bish said at the courthouse on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators focused their questions on two people whom Bish said reached out to her for information on Schiff.\n \n\n   \n  One of the people worked in the first Trump administration and claimed to work for Pulte, and Bish said she spoke to the person several times. The other person said he was affiliated with the mortgage agency Freddie Mac, according to Bish, and she said she spoke to him once.\n \n\n   \n  “You know – had I ever talked to Director Pulte? Had I ever talked to Ed Martin? Did I have any communication with them? And that’s where the conversation kept going back,” she added. “So I don’t know if they’re on a fishing expedition or you know what’s going on.”\n \n\n   \n  Bish said she has never spoken with Martin.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Evan Perez and Kara Scannell contributed to this report. \n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments and comment. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/style/frida-kahlo-portrait-record-woman-scli-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"19:54:00-05:00","title":"Frida Kahlo self-portrait sells for $54.7 million, setting new record for female artists","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Frida Kahlo’s self-portrait 'El sueño (La cama)', created in 1940, sold for $54.7 million at Sotheby’s in New York, becoming the most expensive artwork by a female artist ever auctioned.

Frida Kahlo  has become the most valuable work by a female artist sold at auction after selling for $54.7 million.\n \n\n   \n  “El sueño (La cama)”  –  “The Dream (The Bed)”  –  grabbed the title at Sotheby’s in New York, after it surpassed the existing record held by the late American artist Georgia O’Keeffe. Her “ Jimson Weed/White Flower No.1 ,” which had previously hung in the White House, sold for $44.4 million in 2014.\n \n\n   \n  Kahlo’s surrealist self portrait, which was sold by a private collector, had been valued at between $40 million and $60 million. Another of the Mexican artist’s self portraits “Diego y yo” (Diego and I) previously held the title for second most expensive artwork sold by a female artist after also being auctioned by Sotheby’s, New York, in 2021.\n \n\n   \n  When sold, that painting became the most expensive piece of Latin American art ever. It’s now been overtaken by Kahlo’s more recent sale, and drops down to second place  –  and third for the most valuable artwork by a woman.\n \n\n   \n  Prior to the auction, the painting, which had not been seen publicly for almost three decades, was shown in London, Abu Dhabi, Hong Kong, Paris and New York.\n \n\n   \n  It sees Kahlo lying on a bed that floats against the backdrop of a pale blue sky. Curling green vines envelop her body, while a skeleton wired with dynamite and holding a bouquet of dried flowers lies above her.\n \n\n   \n  The bed was a regular motif in Kahlo’s work. She was confined to her bed for long periods of time as she endured a life of chronic pain following a near-fatal bus accident and subsequent surgeries.\n \n\n   \n  During the long recovery after the accident, Kahlo’s family set up an adapted easel and fitted a mirror to the canopy of the bed so she could continue to paint while lying flat. “I am not dead and I have a reason to live. That reason is painting,” she wrote at the time.\n \n\n   \n  Kahlo painted the piece in 1940, which was a turbulent time for the Mexican artist. It was the year that she remarried Diego Rivera after divorcing the fellow artist a year earlier, and was also the year that her former lover, the Russian revolutionary Leon Trosky, was assassinated.\n \n\n   \n  In an email to CNN prior to the auction, Anna Di Stasi, Sotheby’s head of Latin American art, said “El sueño (La cama)” had been “one of very few works of this calibre still in private hands.”\n \n\n   \n  “Frida Kahlo occupies a completely singular place in art history. There’s an almost spiritual connection people have with her paintings, which are so deeply personal yet at the same time resonate universally. We’ve seen it this season while El sueño (La cama) has been on display around the world, with lines out the door,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “This painting has all the hallmarks of a signature Frida: the self-portrait, a surrealist imagery, and most importantly, a psychological intensity and that sense of communion between artist and viewer.”\n \n\n   \n  The painting formed part of the private collection auction “Exquisite Corpus.” It featured more than 80 surrealist paintings, drawings and sculptures, including pieces by René Magritte and Salvador Dali.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/us/border-patrol-charlotte-gregory-bovino","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"19:45:00Z","title":"Charlotte officials say Border Patrol operation has ended, but DHS insists immigration enforcement will continue","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A five-day federal immigration enforcement operation in Charlotte, North Carolina, led by Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino and named 'Operation Charlotte’s Web,' resulted in over 370 arrests, more than 30,000 student absences, and widespread fear among residents, prompting local officials to announce its end.

But moments later, a top Department of Homeland Security official rejected that characterization.\n \n\n   \n  DHS dubbed the operation in Charlotte, which led to over 370 arrests, “Operation Charlotte’s Web.” Over more than five days, enforcement actions disrupted life across the city, resulting in business closures, children kept out of school, and widespread fear in the community.\n \n\n   \n  At the helm of the operation was top Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino, who, along with some of his federal agents, left Charlotte Thursday, according to a Homeland Security official, fueling confusion about the state of the operation.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after the sheriff’s statement was released, Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said, “Wrong. Operation Charlotte’s Web isn’t ending anytime soon.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to DHS for clarification on the operation’s status. The Mecklenburg County Sheriff’s Office says it stands by its statement.\n \n\n   \n  Immigration enforcement will continue in the area, similar to  what happened in Chicago  after Bovino and his team departed, other law enforcement officials said.\n \n\n   \n  Bovino and his agents are  expected to launch an operation in New Orleans  after the Thanksgiving holiday ,  as early as December 1, continuing the recent focus on city-specific immigration enforcement operations.\n \n\n   \n  Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles said  in a post  following McFadden’s announcement that she is “relieved for our community,” and urged the city to “come together” as they move forward.\n \n\n   \n  “We will continue to build relationships, mend bridges, and listen to the voices of everyone in our community,” McFadden said in a statement Thursday. “As we move forward, I want the city of Charlotte to know, I will keep fighting for clarity, accountability, and trust.\n \n\n   \n    Federal agents leave behind a city rocked by fear and confusion\n \n\n   \n  In the few days that federal agents focused their immigration enforcement crackdown on North Carolina’s largest city,  fear and confusion  swept through the Charlotte community.\n \n\n   \n  Charlotte teacher Jamie Roldan told CNN’s Gustavo Valdes she had been getting questions from students such as, “What is going to happen if I go home and my parents aren’t there?” and “What does that mean if my parents get taken away?”\n \n\n   \n  She described having only nine students show up on one day this week, as parents were afraid to send their children to school or, in some cases, parents with legal status drove the children of undocumented parents to class.\n \n\n   \n   More than  30,000 students — about 20% of district enrollment — were absent from Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools on Monday as the Department of Homeland Security’s immigration enforcement mission in Charlotte continued, the district said, citing updated data from the beginning of the week.\n \n\n   \n  “We just understand that they were not in school receiving education, advancing their social skills and we know that there was an impact to those homes where parents had to modify their work schedules,” Charlotte Mayor Pro Tem Danté Anderson told CNN Wednesday. “They had to have an economic impact out of fear that something would occur at those schools.”\n \n\n   \n  When a CNN crew in a black SUV was parked near a school this week, an official asked them to move their vehicle because it resembled a CBP vehicle and was frightening parents picking up their children.\n \n\n   \n  One  nonprofit  estimates about half of the mom-and-pop businesses it works with have  closed at some point  during the immigration crackdown.\n \n\n   \n  A family-run Colombian bakery, which has closed only once in its 28-year history,  closed last week, with the family unsure of when it will reopen .\n \n\n   \n  While some in the community are expressing relief that the operation may be over, others remain skeptical.\n \n\n   \n  The Carolina Migrant Network, a nonprofit that provides legal services to people in removal proceedings,  warned the community  not to “let your guard down” as ICE is still operating in the area and other parts of the state.\n \n\n   \n  “CBP might be leaving but ICE is still here!” the group said in an Instagram post.\n \n\n   \n    Charlotte and Chicago could help New Orleans prepare\n \n\n   \n  While the Charlotte operation appears to have concluded, an immigration enforcement operation in New Orleans is expected as early as December 1.\n \n\n   \n  Some in Charlotte’s community  adopted tactics  they saw activists use in Chicago, such as watching for raids, blowing warning whistles, and carrying signs advising people of their rights. In Charlotte,  some  also  stood outside the entrance  of a local ICE processing facility to block federal agents, a method frequently seen at the  Broadview ICE facility  near Chicago.\n \n\n   \n  Both cities  quickly mobilized  to train community members on how to respond if they saw an immigration raid or ICE presence.\n \n\n   \n  Charlotte was a departure from what is typical in these operations, notably being much shorter — at less than a week — than the operation in Chicago, which started in early September.\n \n\n   \n  The operation also  took Charlotte by surprise , as President Donald Trump had not mentioned the city as a target. In contrast, while local and state officials in Chicago said federal officials  hadn’t shared details  about the operation or its timing, Trump  frequently named Chicago  as a  target  for a federal crime crackdown.\n \n\n   \n  The focus now appears to be shifting to New Orleans, a city President Trump considered sending the National Guard to  as early as September . New Orleans would be one of the first Democratic-led cities in a Republican-led state targeted for an immigration enforcement operation. CNN has reached out to local and state officials to see how they are preparing for the potential operation.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/entertainment/lawsuit-diddy-assault-jonathan-hay","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"10:07:00.000-05:00","title":"New Investigation Into Alleged Sexual Assault by Sean 'Diddy' Combs, Centered on Claims by Music Producer Jonathan Hay","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Jonathan Hay, a music producer and publicist, alleges that Sean 'Diddy' Combs sexually assaulted him in 2020 and 2021, including incidents involving masturbation and forced oral sex during a tribute project to Notorious B.I.G.

Now, his claims are at the center of a new investigation involving Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs \n       \n  By Elizabeth Wagmeister, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:07 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In March 2023 – eight months before Cassie Ventura filed the bombshell lawsuit against her ex-boyfriend Sean “Diddy” Combs that would ignite his  public downfall  and ultimately lead to  his criminal conviction  – another accuser was contemplating coming forward.\n \n\n   \n  Music producer and publicist Jonathan Hay had contacted a civil attorney in the spring of 2023 to discuss his claims of being sexually battered by Combs.  After speaking with the attorney’s office, Hay got cold feet, fearful of standing up against a figure as powerful as Combs. He was, he said, “terrified.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reviewed email correspondence showing Hay reached out to the civil attorney’s office in March 2023.\n \n\n   \n  “I was like, I can’t do this,” Hay said of his first attempt to come forward with his claims against Combs in early 2023. “I’m just not ready.”\n \n\n   \n  Hay finally filed his claims against Combs – then as a “John Doe” – in July 2025, shortly after Combs was convicted by a New York jury on two federal prostitution-related counts that would lead to him being sentenced to more than four years.\n \n\n   \n  Once Ventura filed her lawsuit and dozens of other civil accusers came forward with lawsuits, he felt encouraged to tell his story. Hay said that he’d never considered that there could have been others who had allegedly been abused by Combs.\n \n\n   \n  Combs denies all accusations against him.  Roughly 70 accusers  have brought civil lawsuits, some of which have been dismissed.\n \n\n   \n  “Once Cassie’s lawsuit came out,” Hay said, “I was like, ‘Oh my gosh, here we go. And then once the raids happened, I was like holy crap. That’s when I was like, ‘Okay, now is my time. Finally, I just decided that, alright, I’m going to go forward with this.”\n \n\n   \n  “I just wanted someone to listen,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Now, Hay’s claims are at the center of a new investigation, launched this week by the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for the Sheriff’s Department confirmed that their Special Victims Bureau is investigating Hay’s claims after receiving a copy of his police report, first documented in September 2025 by police in Largo, Florida, where Hay resides.\n \n\n   \n  In the police report, Hay says he suffered from sexual battery by Combs in 2020, and then again in 2021, when he was working on a remix of Christopher “The Notorious B.I.G.” Wallace’s music as a tribute project, honoring one of Combs’ closest collaborators. Hay worked on the new music with the rapper’s son, CJ Wallace.\n \n\n   \n  In the 2020 incident, Hay said he was working at a photoshoot when he found himself in the same room as Combs, who began to masturbate into one of Biggie’s shirts. The police report details that Combs “removed the shirt to uncover his penis and told Hay to come finish him off.” The report states that Hay told police he was in shock and “stated that Combs then finished himself off and ejaculated on one of Notorious B.I.G. shirts” and then threw the shirt on Hay, “simultaneously saying, ‘Rest in peace BIG.’”\n \n\n   \n  In 2021, Hay told police that Combs forced him to perform oral sex on him, which he said made him feel suicidal.\n \n\n   \n  Hay said that a detective from the LASD’s Special Victims Bureau contacted him on Tuesday this week to notify him that she had been assigned to his case.\n \n\n   \n  Hay is cooperating with authorities, hopeful that their active investigation may lead to further criminal charges.\n \n\n   \n  “Biggie was like his supposedly his best friend,” he said. “To just do that in a shirt and to attack me like he had?” Hay said. “He doesn’t need to be out on the streets.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘A complete fantasy, totally devoid of reality’\n \n\n   \n  Hay’s allegations first became public this July when he filed his lawsuit anonymously against both Combs and Wallace.\n \n\n   \n  Wallace is named as a defendant with Hay claiming that he and others “conspired” with Combs to “allow or assist in Combs’ ability to carry out” his actions against Hay.\n \n\n   \n  Wallace has filed a defamation suit against Hay. In it, he claims that Hay falsified these accusations because he was “irate” that Biggie’s estate decided not to release the majority of the songs produced back in 2020.\n \n\n   \n  “Jonathan Hay’s allegations against CJ Wallace will be shown to be a complete fantasy, totally devoid of reality,” Jeremiah Reynolds, an attorney for Wallace, told CNN. “We look forward to Hay eventually being held liable in court for defamation.”\n \n\n   \n  “CJ knows what happened,” Hay said. “He was there. He lived it.”\n \n\n   \n  Combs also denies Hay’s claims, as he has done with the dozens of accusers who have sued him.\n \n\n   \n  When contacted by CNN, a lawyer for Combs issued a blanket denial statement.\n \n\n   \n  “As Mr. Combs’ legal team has repeatedly stated for over a year now, he cannot address every meritless allegation in what has become a media circus. Let me make it absolutely clear, Mr. Combs categorically denies as false and defamatory all claims that he sexually abused anyone,” Jonathan Davis, a civil attorney for Combs, said in a statement. “He looks forward to vindicating himself in court, where such matters are decided – and not in the media – based on admissible, material evidence, not rank speculation and unsubstantiated allegations.”\n \n\n   \n  Hay said he is not surprised that Combs continues to deny his allegations, and he remains focused on pursuing justice through his case.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m hoping that when he gets out of jail,” Hay said, “that he is taken straight to jail in California, or to go through the court proceedings in California, and that he spends the rest of his life in jail.”\n \n\n   \n  After a two-month federal trial in New York earlier this year, Combs is currently serving his four-plus year sentence at Fort Dix federal prison in New Jersey.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve got to respect the jurors and the decision that they made,” Hay said of the conviction, which Combs is currently appealing. “At least he got some time. And hopefully we can add more.”\n \n\n   \n   Jason Kravarik contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/weather/texas-flash-flood-hill-country-climate-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"10:26:00.000-05:00","title":"Flood threat for soaked Dallas and Texas Hill Country persists overnight as storms keep firing","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Significant flooding continues in the Texas Hill Country due to persistent storm activity, with over 9 inches of rain falling in some areas since Thursday morning, leading to a flash flood emergency for nearly 1,300 people in parts of Concho, McCulloch, and Menard counties.

Dallas and Texas Hill Country persists overnight as storms keep firing \n       \n  By CNN Meteorologists Briana Waxman, Chris Dolce, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:26 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Significant flooding is underway in Texas Hill Country as storms crawl across the South. Parts of the region are still recovering from devastating flooding that  killed more than 130 people  this July.\n \n\n   \n  Over 9 inches of rain has fallen since Thursday morning in parts of western Hill Country, prompting a flash flood emergency – the highest level of flood alert   – for nearly 1,300 people in southeastern Concho, western McCulloch and central Menard counties Thursday afternoon.\n \n\n   \n  The significant rainfall led authorities to issue precautionary evacuations at local RV parks and area campsites, county judge Brandon Corbin said in a statement Thursday afternoon.\n \n\n   \n  The flash flood emergency has been downgraded to a regular flood warning Thursday evening, but officials are not letting down their guard. Western Hill Country could pick up another inch or less of rain before the night is through.\n \n\n   \n  Several flash flood warnings have been issued Thursday in the region, where a Level 2 of 4 risk of flooding rainfall is in place. The rest of central and northern Texas could also see localized flooding Thursday, including Dallas-Fort Worth. And a second round of downpours could pile onto the state’s flood worries beginning Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  Storms were “training” over Hill Country, or lining up and moving over the same spot one after another, like train cars on a railroad track. The storms will begin to move east away from the soaked region this evening, ending the threat of additional heavy rainfall.\n \n\n   \n  The Hill Country’s terrain makes torrential rain especially dangerous. Narrow canyons and fast-responding creeks can’t handle a few hours of training storms.\n \n\n   \n  Farther north, storms in Dallas-Fort Worth triggered flash flood warnings Thursday morning. Several roads were closed because of flooding in the north Dallas area, according to the National Weather Service. Between 2 to 4 inches of rain had fallen. Additional rounds of rain through the early evening could bring another 1 to 4 inches.\n \n\n   \n  Flood watches extend along much of the Interstate 35 corridor from the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex to Austin into early Friday morning.\n \n\n   \n  After drying out Friday and Saturday, a second soaking storm is expected to arrive in Texas as the weekend comes to an end. A Level 2 of 4 risk of flooding rainfall has been issued by the Weather Prediction Center for northern and central parts of Texas from Sunday into Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Rainfall this heavy is usually confined to the summer months, but ongoing unseasonable heat in the South is raising the bar on how much moisture these storms could wring out of the atmosphere.\n \n\n   \n  If you’re in the Hill Country and other parts of Texas, keep phones charged and alerts on and avoid driving through flooded roads.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/asia/us-navy-south-china-sea-aircraft-salvage-intl-hnk-ml","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"10:31:00.000-05:00","title":"US Navy Trying to Pull Crashed Aircraft from Bottom of South China Sea","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Navy is conducting a recovery operation to retrieve an F/A-18 Super Hornet and an MH-60 helicopter from the South China Sea floor, following their crashes in late October 2025 during routine operations off the USS Nimitz.

aircraft from bottom of South China Sea \n       \n  By Brad Lendon, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:31 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US Navy is trying to recover two aircraft from the bottom of the South China Sea that US experts say could yield sensitive information to China if Beijing were to get to them first.\n \n\n   \n  The aircraft – an F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jet and an MH-60 helicopter –  crashed within 30 minutes of each other  while operating off the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz during routine operations in late October.\n \n\n   \n  No official cause has been given for the crashes, but US President Donald Trump suggested to reporters shortly after the incidents that contaminated fuel may be to blame. All crew members were rescued.\n \n\n   \n  The Navy confirmed to CNN on Friday that a salvage ship was operating in the South China Sea, while not revealing the specific location where the aircraft crashed or where the salvage ship is now.\n \n\n   \n  “USNS SALVOR (T-ARS 52), a Safeguard-class salvage ship operated by Military Sealift Command, is on-scene conducting operations in support of the recovery efforts,” said Cmdr. Matthew Comer, a spokesperson for the Navy’s 7th Fleet in Japan.\n \n\n   \n  The Salvor is capable of lifting objects weighing up to 300 tons off the seafloor, according to Navy documents. The maximum takeoff weight of the newest F/A-18 models on the Nimitz is about 33 tons while the MH-60 weighs around 11 tons.\n \n\n   \n  While neither the F/A-18 nor the MH-60 are the most modern of the Navy’s aircraft, experts say the wrecks could yield useful intelligence if they fall into the hands of an adversary.\n \n\n   \n  “Acquiring an air frame and surviving systems will … provide valuable insights into its technological strengths and how to defeat it tactically,” said Carl Schuster, the former head of the US Pacific Command’s Joint Intelligence Center.\n \n\n   \n  He noted that an F/A-18 has never fallen into Chinese hands, but if one did, Beijing could gather information that could help it improve People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) carrier-based J-15T jets, which are not considered as advanced as the F/A-18.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the MH-60 carries anti-submarine warfare systems that are likely more advanced than China’s, Schuster said.\n \n\n   \n  “China is now prioritizing the upgrading of its anti-submarine warfare systems. So, recovering that helicopter should enjoy a high priority,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  CNN cannot confirm whether China is making any attempt to get to the lost US aircraft.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing asserts ownership over almost all of the South China Sea, in defiance of an international court ruling.\n \n\n   \n  The current US recovery effort follows  a similar mission  in 2022, when an F-35 jet, the Navy’s most-advanced fighter,  crashed while attempting to land  on the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson.\n \n\n   \n  The F-35 was eventually pulled up from 12,400 feet (3,700 meters) of water by a Navy recovery team.\n \n\n   \n  Over the past two decades, China has fortified its territorial claims by constructing military installations on contested islands and reefs in the South China Sea. The US says China’s assertions and military buildup threaten freedom of navigation in the waterway, through which trade worth trillions of dollars passes every year.\n \n\n   \n  US forces maintain a steady presence in the region to push back on Chinese sovereignty claims and support Washington’s allies and partners.\n \n\n   \n  But Schuster said Beijing has an edge on getting to wrecks in the South China Sea just based on proximity.\n \n\n   \n  “If China makes it a race, it enjoys homefield advantage, if you will, and can be expected to impede our recovery efforts” if possible, he said.\n \n\n   \n  The Chinese Foreign Ministry said after the crashes that it could offer humanitarian assistance to the US Navy if needed.\n \n\n   \n  But a spokesperson also said that the crashes occurred during what he called “US military exercises.”\n \n\n   \n  “The US has been flexing muscles by frequently sending military vessels and aircraft to the South China Sea. This is the root cause of security issues at sea and disruption to regional peace and stability,” spokesperson Guo Jiakun told a regular press briefing.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/sport/ncaa-sports-gambling-rule-recission-tally","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"20:58:00Z","title":"NCAA Currently Falling Short to Rescind Rule That Would Allow College Athletes to Gamble on Professional Sports, Source Says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The NCAA is facing a final deadline to rescind a rule allowing college athletes, coaches, and staff to gamble on professional sports, with only 188 out of 361 Division I schools having submitted requests to reverse it—falling short of the required 241 signatures.

the source said.

Horse racing, for example, was OK; baseball, football, basketball and hockey were not. But citing the growth in legal sports betting nationwide – now permissible in 38 states – and arguing that sports betting was now available to regular college students, the NCAA agreed to change its policy. Betting on college sports would still be against the rules.\n \n\n   \n  The rule change originally was meant to go into effect on November 1 – a week after the sweeping indictments involving the NBA and members of New York crime families.

Mexico’s Fatima Bosch crowned Miss Universe winner in glittering finale of scandal-hit pageant \n       \n  By Lex Harvey, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:24 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Fatima Bosch of Mexico has been named Miss Universe 2025 in a scandal-hit competition where she emerged as a fan favorite after she was berated by a Thai pageant director during a live-streamed meeting, triggering a walk out by contestants.\n \n\n   \n  The 25-year-old humanitarian and vollunteer was crowned by last year’s winner Victoria Kjær Theilvig from Denmark.\n \n\n   \n  Miss Universe is widely known as the “Super Bowl” of beauty pageants and draws millions of viewers each year. Delegates for each country are selected via local pageants that license local rights from the Miss Universe Organization.\n \n\n   \n  Thailand’s Praveenar Singh came runner up, with Venezuela’s Stephany Abasali, Philippines’ Ahtisa Manalo and Ivory Coast’s Olivia Yacé also making it to the top 5.\n \n\n   \n  Thailand, this year’s host country, has a vibrant and lucrative pageant industry with one of the largest fanbases in Asia,  alongside the Philippines. \n \n\n   \n  This year’s event featured representatives from 120 countries. Nadeen Ayoub became the first woman to represent  Palestinian people  at the pageant, and made it to the final 30 semifinalists before she was eliminated.\n \n\n   \n  Friday’s finale was hosted by American comedian Steve Byrne and opened with a performance by Thai singer Jeff Satur.\n \n\n   \n  Following the swimwear round, the top 30 contestants were narrowed down to 12, and then down to 5 after the evening round.\n \n\n   \n  Finalists were asked questions including which global issue they would speak about in front of the United Nations General Assembly, and how they would use the Miss Universe platform to empower young girls.\n \n\n   \n  “Believe in the power of your authenticity,” Bosch said. “Your dreams matter, your heart matters. Never let anyone make you doubt your worth.”\n \n\n   \n  The competition took place over three weeks, with delegates traveling around the country to rehearse and participate in events.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, the beauty queens competed in the national costume showcase, which saw contestants donning flamboyant outfits designed to highlight their homelands. Miss USA, Audrey Eckert, paid homage to her home with an  elaborate bald eagle costume  designed by Simon Villalba.\n \n\n   \n  The contestant from Jamaica, Gabrielle Henry, took a scary tumble during the evening gown round at Wednesday’s preliminaries and was carried away in a stretcher, according to social media videos which circulated of her fall. Miss Universe President Raul Rocha said in an  update to Instagram  that Henry was “under good care” in hospital and that she had not broken any bones.\n \n\n   \n    Pageant controversies\n \n\n   \n  This year’s Miss Universe competition was beset by scandal, which sparked conversations over the merits of the international beauty pageant which claims to promote female empowerment.\n \n\n   \n  At a live-streamed pre-pageant meeting earlier this month, Miss Universe Thailand director Nawat Itsaragrisil  publicly scolded Bosch, Miss Mexico , for not posting enough promotional content, appearing to call her a “dumbhead,” though Nawat denied this, insisting that he had actually accused her of causing “damage.”\n \n\n   \n  After Bosch pushed back against the insults, Nawat called security to escort her out of the room. Other contestants then stood up and walked out in solidarity.\n \n\n   \n  The incident sparked widespread allegations of misogyny and drew global backlash, including from Mexico’s president Claudia Sheinbaum, who described it as an “aggression” that Bosch handled with “dignity.”\n \n\n   \n  The Miss Universe Organization condemned Nawat’s behavior and limited his role in the pageant. Nawat apologized in a livestreamed welcome ceremony and declined to comment further on the incident to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Then, in an Instagram live video discussing the incident, Miss Universe 1996, Alicia Machado, sparked backlash for racist comments.\n \n\n   \n  Machado referred to Nawat as “that despicable Chinese,” and when a commentor pointed out he is Thai, Machado said “Chinese, Thai, Korean. To me all these people with slanted eyes like this are all Chinese,” while pulling up the corners of her eyes.\n \n\n   \n  Machado’s representative did not respond to a request for comment from CNN.\n \n\n   \n    Judge steps down, says pageant is rigged\n \n\n   \n  Two judges abruptly stepped down from the competition days before the winner was crowned, with one accusing the pageant of being rigged.\n \n\n   \n  Composer Omar Harfouch said on Instagram he had resigned from the eight-member judging panel, and claimed there was a secret, “impromptu” panel of judges who had pre-selected the top 30 contestants in advance of the final.\n \n\n   \n  “I could not stand before the public and television cameras, pretending to legitimize a vote I never took part in,” Harfouch said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  The Miss Universe Organization said Harfouch’s claims “mischaracterize” the judging process.\n \n\n   \n  “The Miss Universe Organization firmly clarifies that no impromptu jury has been created, that no external group has been authorized to evaluate delegates or select finalists, and that all competition evaluations continue to follow the established, transparent, and supervised MUO protocols,” the organization said in a  statement. \n \n\n   \n  The Miss Universe Organization did not respond to a request for comment from CNN.\n \n\n   \n  A second judge, former French soccer star Claude Makélélé, stepped down the same day, citing “unforeseen personal reasons.”\n \n\n   \n  “I hold Miss Universe in the highest regard,” he said  on Instagram .\n \n\n   \n  The Miss Universe Organization saw a leadership shakeup after Thai media tycoon Anne Jakkaphong Jakrajutatip stepped down in June. Mario Búcaro was  appointed the new CEO  at the end of October, just days before delegates arrived. Jakkaphong, who is also a transgender rights advocate,  bought the organization for $20 million in 2022 , but her company  filed for bankruptcy  in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  Next year’s Miss Universe contest will take place in Puerto Rico.\n \n\n   \n   This article will be updated with results and details of the competition.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/sport/football-nfl-cowboys-ceedee-lamb-missed-curfew-explanation","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"19:08:00-05:00","title":"CeeDee Lamb Says Casino Visit Led to Curfew Violation with Fellow Cowboys Receiver George Pickens","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"CeeDee Lamb and George Pickens, Dallas Cowboys wide receivers, were benched for the first series of their 33-16 victory over the Las Vegas Raiders due to a curfew violation at the Red Rock Casino the night before the game.

settler violence.\n \n\n   \n  According to witnesses and WAFA, the official Palestinian news agency, settlers torched a vehicle scrapyard in the town of Huwara in the northern West Bank.\n \n\n   \n  The Israeli military said its soldiers were dispatched to Huwara after receiving reports of Israeli civilians throwing rocks toward Palestinian vehicles, setting fire and damaging property.\n \n\n   \n  Footage obtained by CNN shows numerous cars on fire as firefighters try to extinguish the blaze. Thick, black smoke pours into the night sky from the fire that appears to spread over a sizable area.\n \n\n   \n  Mohammed Dalal, who owns the scrapyard, says more than a dozen settlers descended on the site, smashing cars and starting the fire. He says no one was in the scrapyard at the time, but he estimated that 150 cars were torched or damaged.\n \n\n   \n  “I have children in university, I have grandchildren, I have a family; we all depend on this scrapyard,” Dalal told CNN. “Like many Palestinians, I have olive trees, but I haven’t been able to harvest my olives and so this is our only source of income. All I can do is ask God to compensate us.”\n \n\n   \n  The attack happened the same evening Netanyahu convened a security meeting on settler violence in the West Bank, according to two Israeli officials, which has surged in recent weeks and months. It’s unclear if any decision was reached on how to respond to the escalating attacks. On Monday in a rare condemnation of settler violence, Netanyahu said the attacks were being carried out by “a small, extremist group.”\n \n\n   \n  Last year, Defense Minister Israel Katz declared that Israel will no longer use administrative detention against Israeli settlers, preventing the country’s security apparatus from using one of its most powerful tools to incarcerate settlers while still employing it widely against Palestinians.\n \n\n   \n  The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) acknowledge that cars had been set on fire in the Palestinian town, not far from the settlement of Yitzhar, which is known for its extremist ideology. The IDF said there were no injuries following the incident and soldiers conducting searches did not find any suspects.\n \n\n   \n  This latest attack is the second major arson in a matter of days after dozens of settlers set fire to Palestinian homes and vehicles to the south of Bethlehem. Last week, settlers launched a  major arson attack  on an agricultural area in the northern West Bank, setting fire to trucks, metal sheds and more.\n \n\n   \n  Huwara has come under settler attack before. In June 2023,  settlers rampaged through the town , killing one Palestinian man and wounding hundreds of others in what the former IDF military chief later called a “pogrom.” The large-scale attack was billed as “revenge” after a Palestinian gunman killed two brothers who lived nearby.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/china/china-japan-takaichi-analysis-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"19:36:00Z","title":"The real reason behind China’s fury toward Japan’s Takaichi","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the wake of Japan’s new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi suggesting a potential military response to China’s action over Taiwan, Beijing has escalated its response with economic pressure, nationalist propaganda, and military saber-rattling.

The article highlights how China's official media and political leadership frame the issue as a defense of historical justice and sovereignty, while also signaling that any challenge to Beijing’s position on Taiwan—especially from a Japanese leader—will face strong retaliation. The diplomatic meeting between Japanese and Chinese envoys has taken on symbolic meaning, with China portraying itself as historically assertive and Japan as deferential, reinforcing its narrative of national resilience against foreign aggression.","keyTakeAways":["China views Japan’s new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s suggestion of a military response to a Chinese military action in Taiwan as a

Analysis by Simone McCarthy, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:36 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Weeks into the job,  Japan ’s new leader has come face-to-face with what it means to cross  China ’s red line on Taiwan.\n \n\n   \n  In the days since  Sanae Takaichi  suggested her country could respond militarily if China were to move to take control of Taiwan by force, Beijing has pulled out its economic pressure playbook: warning its citizens against travel and study there, suggesting there’ll be no market in China for Japan’s seafood exports, and unleashing a wave of wall-to-wall nationalist fervor pointed at the prime minister.\n \n\n   \n   The furor  appears carefully calibrated to send a warning to Japan – and other countries in the region – of what could happen if they even consider taking a stance at odds with China on Taiwan, the self-ruled democratic island that Beijing claims as its own territory.\n \n\n   \n  But the spat, which shows no sign of abating roughly two weeks on, also reveals something else: Beijing’s deep-seated concerns about the potential for changing military postures in Asia – as US allies ramp up defense spending and coordination in the face of its own  rising military might .\n \n\n   \n  No other country piques those concerns like Japan, whose Imperial Army in the 20th century invaded, occupied and waged atrocities on China and, decades earlier, colonized Taiwan – key pain points in China’s so-called “century of humiliation” at the hands of foreign powers.\n \n\n   \n  Anti-Japanese sentiment has simmered in the country since that time – flaring up and gaining traction in recent years with nationalist hardliners’ voices becoming increasingly mainstream in China under strongman leader Xi Jinping.\n \n\n   \n  Reinforcing the ruling Communist Party’s longstanding determination to ensure history can never repeat itself, Xi has rapidly modernized China’s military and grown its global influence.\n \n\n   \n  Now, in Beijing’s eyes, Takaichi’s comments reveal that Japan does not respect the vast rebalancing of power that’s positioned China as an ascendant superpower – and that it has military ambitions that could threaten China’s rise.\n \n\n   \n  “For the first time, a Japanese leader has expressed ambitions for armed intervention in Taiwan and issued a military threat against China,” a commentary in the Communist Party mouthpiece People’s Daily  said  earlier this week. “Behind this lies the dangerous attempt by Japan’s right-wing forces to break free from the constraints of the pacifist constitution and seek the status of a ‘military power.’”\n \n\n   \n    Japan’s ‘militarism’\n \n\n   \n  Japan has made a  sweeping shift  in its security posture in recent years, veering away from the pacifist constitution imposed on it by the United States in the aftermath of World War II, to boost its defense budget and acquire counterstrike capabilities.\n \n\n   \n  That’s come as Beijing has ramped up its military activities in the region, including around Taiwan – and as the US has pushed its allies for more burden-sharing on defense spending.\n \n\n   \n  Previous Japanese leaders avoided discussing Taiwan in the context of a military response, but politicians – particularly among right wingers in Takaichi’s party – are increasingly wary of the implications for Tokyo if Beijing attacks Taiwan, which sits strategically to Japan’s south. This sentiment has resulted in a growing impetus to further expand Japan’s defense spending and even change the constitution.\n \n\n   \n  Now Takaichi, a hawkish figure who has previously drawn Beijing’s ire for questioning some of the narratives around imperial Japan’s culpability for its war atrocities, has taken the step of speaking plainly on the Taiwan issue. In the first days of her term, she also called for closer security ties with the US and is moving to accelerate the country’s defense build-up.\n \n\n   \n  In Beijing’s eyes,  according to  a social media account linked to the Chinese military, such efforts run the risk of seeing “the ‘ghost’ of militarism” reemerge “to wreak havoc in the world.”\n \n\n   \n  And that’s why some on the Japanese side feel that Beijing is lashing out now “to box Takaichi in and put her on the back foot early on – so she will be more reluctant to push forward on Japan’s investment in defense,” according to Chong Ja Ian, an associate professor at the National University of Singapore.\n \n\n   \n  Japanese troops killed more than 200,000 unarmed civilians during its occupation, and raped and tortured tens of thousands of women and girls, in what is known as the Nanjing Massacre, one of the most notorious wartime atrocities of the 20th century. Japan has repeatedly apologized and expressed remorse for its wartime atrocities.\n \n\n   \n  That era, however, has been front and center in China this year as Beijing marks the 80th anniversary of the end of the World War II, when Japan’s surrender to Allied Forces freed China from its occupation and saw Taiwan handed over to the Nationalist-run Chinese government.\n \n\n   \n  The Chinese Communist Party established the People’s Republic of China in 1949 after emerging victorious from a civil war, while the defeated Nationalists retreated to Taiwan. Beijing has used the anniversary to justify its claim to the island – and broadcast concern about what it sees as Japan’s turn toward militarism.\n \n\n   \n  China sees taking control of Taiwan as a core piece of the “national rejuvenation” that it must complete by mid-century – a goal that, if Beijing decides must be achieved by force, could be heavily complicated by a stronger Japan.\n \n\n   \n  For Beijing, Takaichi’s comments can be summed up as “the wrong person, talking about the wrong thing” at the “wrong time,” according to Wang Yiwei, director of the Institute of International Affairs at Renmin University in Beijing.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Defending its sovereignty’\n \n\n   \n  Despite Tokyo dispatching an envoy to Beijing earlier this week to calm the dispute, Beijing has showed no signs of dialing back its deluge of rhetoric.\n \n\n   \n  It’s instead insisting Tokyo retracts the comment – a position that offers neither side an easy way to find an off-ramp.\n \n\n   \n  In the meantime, China has continued to stoke nationalist feelings, including sabre-rattling from China’s military, which on Wednesday released a video titled “Don’t be too cocky.” Without mentioning Japan by name, it includes a rap crooning: “We’ve honed our skills through rigorous training, how can we allow you to be so cocky?”\n \n\n   \n  But it may be an image of Japan’s foreign ministry envoy Masaaki Kanai and his Chinese counterpart Liu Jinsong following their meeting in Beijing earlier this week that underscores why China won’t want to ease up pressure just yet.\n \n\n   \n  That image – showing Liu standing straight with his hands in his pockets, talking to Kanai who tilts his head forward while listening – has gone viral across Chinese social media.\n \n\n   \n  Commentators have referred to the Japanese diplomat as “bowing,” while they hailed the choice of Liu’s attire – a suit whose style is associated with China’s May Fourth anti-Imperialism movement of 1919.\n \n\n   \n  The symbolism, it appears, was no coincidence: “China’s stance in defending its sovereignty remains unchanged for a century,” said a caption on a post from state broadcaster CCTV.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/politics/hang-democrats-trump-seditious-behavior","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"19:33:00Z","title":"Why Democrats Are Warning About Trump Giving Illegal Orders","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A group of congressional Democrats released a video urging military personnel not to obey illegal orders that President Donald Trump might issue, prompting a sharp response from Trump, who claimed the lawmakers were advocating sedition and even death.

\nUpdated: \n        7:33 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump has yet again suggested that his  political   opponents  deserve to be executed. And yet again, he’s basing this argument on a rather novel legal theory and a dubious interpretation of the facts.\n \n\n   \n  A half-dozen congressional Democrats cut a video this week urging members of the military  not to obey unlawful orders  that Trump might issue. Trump then responded by issuing a series of social media posts suggesting these members had committed sedition and possibly even deserved to die.\n \n\n   \n  Trump went from saying they should be arrested, to re-posting someone who said George Washington would “HANG THEM,” to saying “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!”\n \n\n   \n  White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt clarified Thursday that Trump  does not, in fact, want members of Congress put to death .\n \n\n   \n  But she otherwise stood by the idea that these members were acting dangerously and undermining the commander in chief. She said the members were urging members of the military to “defy the chain of command.”\n \n\n   \n  “They are literally saying to 1.3 million active-duty servicemembers to defy the chain of command – not to follow lawful orders,” Leavitt said.\n \n\n   \n  But that is not what they were literally saying.\n \n\n   \n  In fact, the members were not urging anyone to disobey “lawful orders.” They explicitly referred in the video only to  unlawful  orders – and repeatedly so.\n \n\n   \n  The other problem is that “defying the chain of command” isn’t just something military servicemembers are  allowed  to do in such cases; it’s something they’re often  required  to do.\n \n\n   \n  The section of Article 92 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice dealing with failing to obey orders states that members can only be sanctioned for disobeying lawful orders. And servicemembers are generally obligated to not follow orders that are “manifestly unlawful.”\n \n\n   \n  If there’s a potentially more legitimate objection to Democrats’ video, it’s that they’re erecting a straw man – basically that they’re inventing out of whole cloth the prospect of Trump issuing illegal orders, in order to make military servicemembers hesitant to abide his orders.\n \n\n   \n  This is the argument that some of Trump’s allies have gone for on Fox News.\n \n\n   \n  “If you can’t name the unlawful orders that these guys are bringing up in their video, you know, that just shows me that you don’t have the courage to even call out what you’re talking about,” Republican Rep. Eli Crane of Arizona said.\n \n\n   \n  Fox News anchor Martha MacCallum in a separate segment pressed Democratic Rep. Jason Crow, one of the lawmakers in the video, repeatedly on the same subject.\n \n\n   \n  “What specific order from the commander in chief that we are asking our military to carry out are you objecting to?” MacCallum said. “This is very, very vague.”\n \n\n   \n  But it’s not as if this is a prospect Democrats have invented out of whole cloth. Trump has given them plenty to work with, including some things  Crow mentioned in the interview .\n \n\n   \n  Trump has repeatedly proposed doing things – with the military and otherwise – that appear to be illegal. People who served with him have said he suggested illegal action. And Trump is certainly testing the bounds of the law with his use of the military even as we speak.\n \n\n   \n  The big example right now is Trump’s strikes on alleged drug vessels in the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean – strikes that have  killed more than 80 people  without a legal process.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reported that both the United Nations and top allies like the United Kingdom regard the strikes  as illegal extrajudicial killings . Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky has echoed those claims, while other GOP senators have questioned their legality as well. The administration has also declined to publicly detail its legal justification, even as the Justice Department has produced a  classified legal opinion  authorizing the strikes. It has released survivors of the strikes who, if they had been kept in US custody, could have  forced it to defend itself in court . Also, a top commander who CNN has reported  raised questions about the legality of the strikes  is now retiring early.\n \n\n   \n  There is a very real question about whether the servicemembers involved in those strikes are carrying out illegal orders. And the administration has proactively avoided a more robust legal process that could settle that question.\n \n\n   \n  But that’s hardly all. Here are some other key data points:\n \n\n   \n  It’s certainly provocative for Democrats to raise this issue like they have. But it’s not as if they’ve conjured it out of thin air.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/weather/polar-vortex-cold-snowy-december-stratosphere","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"18:17:00Z","title":"Polar Vortex Disruption Expected in November: Rare Cold Spell on the Way","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A rare and significant sudden stratospheric warming event is unfolding in the stratosphere above the North Pole, causing a major disruption of the polar vortex in November — a time when such events are almost unheard of.

Once the polar vortex is disrupted, it can take a month or more to recover, said Andrea Lopez Lang, a meteorologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n \n\n   \n  What’s most difficult to predict is where the polar vortex will deliver its icy blast, and the temperature outlooks aren’t taking it fully into account, yet.\n \n\n   \n  “We can see more active and shifted storm tracks and increases in cold air outbreaks in regions across the Northern Hemisphere,” she said in an email.\n \n\n   \n  Both Butler and Lopez Lang said having accurate forecasts for polar vortex events can help make 7- to 10-day forecasts better, which can be beneficial for decision-making.\n \n\n   \n  “Even though the stratospheric polar vortex is miles above us, it’s sometimes connected to our weather via invisible puppet strings we describe with atmospheric dynamics and thermodynamics,” Lopez Lang said.\n \n\n   \n  For example, other polar vortex events early in the winter have been followed by colder and snowier Decembers in the US, she said. Polar vortex events like these tend to generate a ridge of warm, high pressure over Alaska, which triggers a dip, or trough, in the jet stream to the east. That trough can usher in colder, snowier weather over the Central states and portions of the Eastern US.    \n \n\n   \n  As impactful as these polar vortex events are, scientists are losing some of their eyes on this layer of the atmosphere, Lopez Lang said.\n \n\n   \n  Satellites are crucial to observing the stratosphere and making predictions about sudden stratospheric warming events,   she said, and some of that data is blinking out as satellites age and  NOAA makes budget and program decisions  that affect the availability of current and future measurements. She cited some  newly missing data from polar-orbiting satellites  as an example.\n \n\n   \n  “The only way that we really observe these phenomena is via satellite data,” she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/health/cdc-website-autism-vaccines","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"18:44:00Z","title":"CDC Website Changed to Include False Claims Linking Autism and Vaccines","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The CDC updated its website to include false and scientifically invalid claims suggesting that vaccines may cause autism, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.

They’re very clear, and it’s time to move on.”\n \n\n   \n  The preponderance of scientific evidence shows that vaccines do not cause autism, Singer said.\n \n\n   \n  “ No environmental factor has been better studied as a potential cause of autism than vaccines . This includes vaccine ingredients as well as the body’s response to vaccines,” the Autism Science Foundation said in a statement Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Paul Offit agrees. In a  post on Substack  on Thursday, Offit, a pediatrician and director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said scientific studies can “never prove never.”\n \n\n   \n  “If RFK Jr. wanted to be honest with the American public, he would make it clear on the CDC’s website that chicken nuggets also might cause autism, which has never been and will never be disproven,” Offit wrote.\n \n\n   \n  HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said Thursday, “We are updating the CDC’s website to reflect gold standard, evidence-based science.”\n \n\n   \n  However, Dr. Marty Makary, commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration, recently told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta on an episode of his  “Chasing Life” podcast  that he doesn’t think vaccines cause autism.\n \n\n   \n  “I think there’s no medicine that’s 1,000% safe,” Makary said. “And I think we have to remember that with everything. I think the absolutism around some of this stuff creates mistrust. And when we say they’re 1,000% safe and it’s impossible for there to be a single complication of a vaccine, that’s the kind of rhetoric, I think, that doesn’t resonate well. So I think we have be humble and take a very honest approach.”\n \n\n   \n    Studies find no relationship\n \n\n   \n  Other bullets on the updated CDC page say studies supporting a link between vaccines and autism have been ignored by health authorities. This too is not true: Studies showing a connection between vaccines and autism have proved to be poorly done or were fraudulent. There are, however, many well-done, credible studies that find no such relationship.\n \n\n   \n  One of the  largest studies  looking at this question was published in 2019. Researchers in Denmark enrolled more than 650,000 children born between 1999 and 2011 and followed them from the time they were 1 year of age until the end of August 2013. Roughly 6,500 children were diagnosed with autism during the study period.\n \n\n   \n  When the researchers compared those who received the MMR vaccine with those who did not, they found no significant difference in the risk of developing autism. That held true whether the kids got other vaccines, such as the diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccine; whether they had siblings with autism; or a host of other factors, such as whether certain kids might be prone to developing a form of regressive autism after getting their shots.\n \n\n   \n  “This study strongly supports that MMR vaccine does not increase the risk for autism,” the authors wrote in the conclusion.\n \n\n   \n  This study is not cited on the CDC’s updated “state of the evidence” on MMR vaccines, however. Instead, it mentions older evidence reviews and raises questions about aluminum, an ingredient added to some vaccines to boost their protection.\n \n\n   \n  The new CDC updates do mention another recent Danish study, published in 2025, which found no link between aluminum in childhood vaccines and any of 50 disorders, including neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism. But instead of accepting the overall conclusion of the study, the new CDC page tries to cast doubt on it by homing in on details of data in a supplementary table, saying the findings and other “warrant further investigation” into aluminum exposure and chronic diseases.\n \n\n   \n  The CDC page also says the US Department of Health and Human Services has launched a comprehensive assessment of the causes of autism, including investigations on plausible biologic mechanisms and potential causal links.\n \n\n   \n  Singer said this is a waste of valuable research money and a distraction from strong science showing that most cases of autism can be traced to genes that affect a baby’s brain development.\n \n\n   \n  The main heading  on the page  states that “Vaccines do not cause Autism,” but it has an asterisk that directs readers to a footnote: “The header ‘Vaccines do not cause autism’ has not been removed due to an agreement with the chair of the U.S. Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee that it would remain on the CDC website.”\n \n\n   \n  The footnote seems to refer to a commitment by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to Sen. Bill Cassidy, a physician and Republican from Louisiana,  during his confirmation process  that language on the CDC website “pointing out that vaccines do not cause autism” would not be removed. Cassidy described the promise in a speech in which he explained his support for Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist.\n \n\n   \n  Cassidy told CNN on Thursday that he had spoken with Kennedy.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement posted on X on Thursday, Cassidy said, “I’m a doctor who has seen people die from vaccine-preventable diseases. What parents need to hear right now is vaccines for measles, polio, hepatitis B and other childhood diseases are safe and effective and will not cause autism. Any statement to the contrary is wrong, irresponsible, and actively makes Americans sicker.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Dangerous health disinformation’\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Peter Hotez, who is director of the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children’s Hospital and wrote a book called “Vaccines Did Not Cause Rachel’s Autism” about his daughter’s diagnosis, said the updated information on the CDC’s page follows a well-worn playbook.\n \n\n   \n  “They’ve decided they want to prove vaccines cause autism. So they keep making a series of assertions,” Hotez said, going back to debunked research that claimed the MMR vaccines caused autism and a retracted 2005 Rolling Stone article by Kennedy that asserted the preservative thimerosal caused autism.\n \n\n   \n  There have also been claims that aluminum in vaccines was a cause of autism, and those have been disproved, Hotez said.\n \n\n   \n  Hotez says the updates to the CDC’s page are “pure garbage.”\n \n\n   \n  “I consider it a piece of dangerous health disinformation, and it needs to be removed right away,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, who recently resigned as director of the CDC’s National Center on Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said on social media late Wednesday that the changes are “a national embarrassment.”\n \n\n   \n  “The weaponization of the voice of CDC is getting worse. This is a public health emergency,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Daskalakis said the agency’s scientists were completely blindsided by the page update.\n \n\n   \n  “This distortion of science under the CDC moniker is the reason I resigned with my colleagues,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Rather than restoring trust in America’s health agencies, moves like this have undermined it, said Dr. Sean O’ Leary, a pediatrician who chairs the Committee on Infectious Diseases for the American Academy of Pediatrics.\n \n\n   \n  “I fear that it’s going to lead to fewer children being vaccinated, children suffering from diseases they didn’t need to suffer from,” O’Leary said.\n \n\n   \n  This is the latest move by the Trump administration to alter longstanding US vaccine policy and practice and cast doubt on vaccinations.\n \n\n   \n  Kennedy has hired longtime anti-vax allies – including David Geier, a discredited researcher who was  once disciplined  by the Maryland State Board of Physicians for practicing medicine without a license, and Lyn Redwood, a nurse who was president of the World Mercury Project, which later became Children’s Health Defense, an anti-vaccine group Kennedy ran before campaigning for office – to undertake new evaluations of government data in an effort to prove conspiracy theories that hazards of vaccines have long been hidden from the public.\n \n\n   \n  The rate of routine childhood vaccinations has dropped in the United States, allowing preventable diseases including measles and whooping cough to surge. In a call with state health officials Monday, the CDC disease detectives leading the measles response suggested that the US status as a country that has eliminated continuous measles spread was in jeopardy.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/politics/north-korea-operatives-fake-job-portal-ai-firms","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"18:18:00-05:00","title":"North Korean Operatives Running Fake Job Portal Targeting US AI Firms","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"North Korean operatives have launched a new cyber espionage campaign by creating a fake job application platform that mimics the well-known headhunting service Lever.

November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  North Korean operatives created a fake job-application platform targeting applicants to major US artificial intelligence and crypto firms as part of a new effort to steal money and know-how for the Kim Jong Un regime,  researchers said  on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  It’s a twist on a yearslong campaign to infiltrate Fortune 500 companies: Instead of simply impersonating employees of those companies,  North Korean  tech workers are now working to gain long-term access to the computers of applicants before they join a company, according to security firm Validin, which discovered the scheme.\n \n\n   \n  “Going after job seekers gives North Korean actors a huge advantage. Instead of trying to slip past an employer’s defenses, they take over the entire hiring process and make it feel completely legitimate to individuals,” Validin’s chief executive Kenneth Kinion told CNN. “People assume they’re doing a normal coding test or following steps for a promising job opportunity, so they’re far more likely to run whatever the interviewer sends them.”\n \n\n   \n  The fake jobs platform mimics the style and substance of Lever, a headhunting platform that boasts tens of thousands of customers. Among the fictional jobs advertised on the North Korean-built platform are a “product manager” related to Claude, the popular AI model developed by San Francisco-based firm Anthropic.\n \n\n   \n  Anthropic’s technology is in high demand. The firm committed to spending $30 billion on Microsoft’s compute capacity to expand the use of Claude, Microsoft announced this week.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has requested comment from Lever, Anthropic and all the other companies impersonated in the scheme. The North Korean diplomatic mission in London did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “Because many candidates don’t want their current employer to know they’re looking elsewhere, they’re less likely to report anything suspicious, making it even easier for the attackers to slip through unnoticed,” Kinion said.\n \n\n   \n  Kinion, whose team discovered the fake job portal this week, said he wasn’t aware of anyone who has fallen victim to the scheme yet, but many have fallen for past industrial espionage campaigns tied to Pyongyang.\n \n\n   \n  For years, North Korean workers have used fraudulent identities and sometimes passed interview screenings to infiltrate American companies big and small. The workers then send the money back to Pyongyang to support the regime’s rogue weapons program, according to private experts and US officials.\n \n\n   \n  A previous CNN  investigation  showed how the founder of a California-based cryptocurrency startup had unwittingly paid tens of thousands of dollars to a North Korean engineer. The entrepreneur was unaware of the situation until the FBI notified him, he said.\n \n\n   \n  North Korean hackers have also  stolen billions of dollars  from banks and cryptocurrency firms over the last several years, according to reports from the United Nations and private firms. A White House official  estimated  in 2023 that half of  North Korea’s  missile program had been funded by cyberattacks and cryptocurrency theft.\n \n\n   \n  A series of US indictments and sanctions has raised awareness of the insider IT worker threat. Pyongyang has evolved its tactics in response, according to experts.\n \n\n   \n  “These operators appear to hold elevated privileges, far beyond what a standard IT worker receives, which is evident from their more malicious activities,” Michael Barnhart, a North Korea-focused researcher at insider threat firm DTEX Systems, told CNN. “This reinforces the notion that these activities are part of a broader, well-integrated ecosystem within North Korea’s cyber operations.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2024/11/27/health/food-safety-thanksgiving-wellness","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"19:35:00-05:00","title":"How long can a Thanksgiving buffet sit out?

A doctor explains \n       \n  By Katia Hetter, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:35 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   Nearly 82 million  Americans are expected to travel over the Thanksgiving holiday, including many of you.\n \n\n   \n  As family and friends gather together to share meals, it may be good to remember that foodborne illnesses are  on the rise . These are mostly preventable with the right precautions.\n \n\n   \n  I want to make sure that the food my family and I are preparing is safe—and so are the leftovers, so I turned to CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at George Washington University. She previously served as Baltimore’s health commissioner, where her responsibilities included overseeing food safety.\n \n\n   \n   CNN:   What causes foodborne infections? \n \n\n   \n   Dr.   Leana Wen:  Foodborne infections are caused by pathogens, like bacteria, viruses and parasites. In the US, the most common form of foodborne infection is  norovirus , which is a contagious virus that spreads from person to person through sharing utensils or touching objects that an infected person has touched and then touching your mouth. There are also several bacteria that cause foodborne illness, including salmonella, E. coli, Campylobacter and listeria.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: What symptoms do people experience? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  Typical symptoms of foodborne illness include abdominal cramping, nausea, diarrhea and vomiting. Many people recover within 24 hours, but some can become very ill, depending on the pathogen and their underlying medical conditions. Those at highest risk for complications are young children, pregnant women, older individuals and people with immunocompromising medical illnesses.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: I’ve seen a lot of recalls for food products.  How do I make sure that the food I’m preparing is OK before placing it out at meals? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  Rhere have been  several instances of high-profile food recalls , but it’s important to remember that the majority of foodborne illnesses occur in everyday settings that don’t involve high-profile cases. Definitely be aware of food recalls (the US government maintains a  comprehensive list of recent recalls ) and make sure that you don’t have products in your fridge or pantry that are deemed unsafe. But don’t obsess over it, as chances are that the food you buy will be safe. However, there are many other things that you can and need to do make sure you abide by safe food preparing practices.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: Let’s talk about some of these best practices. How do I defrost my turkey safely? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  This is a great question and applies not only to turkey but also to other poultry and meat. The concern is to keep bacteria from growing when the turkey thaws.\n \n\n   \n  There are  three ways to safely thaw turkey . The easiest, though the one that takes the longest, is to thaw in the refrigerator. You put the turkey in a container to prevent it from dripping onto other food. It generally takes 24 hours for each four to five pounds of turkey, so an 8-pound turkey could take two days, and a 12-pound turkey could take three days.\n \n\n   \n  The second way is to wrap the turkey in a leak-proof bag and submerge it in cold water. This takes about 30 minutes per pound, so the 8-pound turkey will take about 4 hours to thaw. You could use tap water and change the water every 30 minutes. It’s important to cook the turkey immediately after it is thawed to prevent bacteria growth.\n \n\n   \n  The third way is to use a microwave. How long it will take depends on the specific microwave. This is the fastest method, but because some parts of the turkey will start to cook during microwaving, it’s essential to cook the turkey right after thawing.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not a good idea to leave the turkey thawing on the counter in a warm room. That’s because parts of the turkey may still be frozen while some parts reach high enough temperature for the bacteria to rapidly multiply.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: How long can a Thanksgiving buffet sit out? Does it vary by dish? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  The rule of thumb to keep in mind is the “two-hour rule.” Once the food is cooked, it should not be left at room temperature for  more than two hours . In the summer, if this is an outdoor picnic and the temperature is over 90 degrees Fahrenheit, food should be refrigerated after an hour.\n \n\n   \n  This rule applies to all perishable foods, including meat, fish and milk products. Cooked leftovers should be refrigerated. The foods that do not need to be refrigerated according to the two-hour rule are baked goods such as cookies and cakes, dried meat such as jerky, whole fruit that is not chopped, and nuts.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: What if the food is on a burner or in a slow cooker to keep it warm? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  The temperature at which bacteria multiples rapidly is between 40 degrees Fahrenheit and 140 degrees Fahrenheit. If the food is being kept warm by an appliance such that is over 140 degrees Fahrenheit — or if it’s being kept cooled at below 40 degrees Fahrenheit — this does not count toward the two-hour rule. But  within two hours  of removing from the warming or cooling apparatus, it needs to be refrigerated.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: The fridge is my friend, right? Can food go into the fridge so we can enjoy leftovers the next day? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  Yes, if it is stored in a timely manner in the refrigerator. Leftovers can typically be kept in the fridge for  three to four days . They can also be frozen for three to four months.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: What other safety tips people should keep in mind before gatherings? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  We’ve talked about thawing and storage of leftovers, and we also need to discuss cooking or reheating to the right temperature. The temperature varies  depending  on the type of meat or fish. An internal meat thermometer is crucial for monitoring the temperature. Make sure that fish is cooked to 145 degrees Fahrenheit and chicken, turkey and poultry to 165 degrees Fahrenheit.\n \n\n   \n  Be aware of cross-contamination. Do not use containers or utensils you have used with raw meat or fish to touch other products, like vegetables and fruits.\n \n\n   \n  Also, remember that norovirus is the most common cause of foodborne illness. People who have nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach cramps or other symptoms of norovirus should not prepare food. Everyone should wash their hands often and well with soap and water.\n \n\n   \n  Event hosts should also ask that those who are experiencing signs of respiratory infection to stay home. And those who are especially vulnerable to severe illness due to underlying conditions should take additional precautions that are appropriate for their individual circumstance.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/us/brian-walshe-guilty-plea-legal-defense","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"17:00:00Z","title":"Brian Walshe pleads guilty to disposing of wife’s body; murder trial to proceed","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Massachusetts man, Brian Walshe, pleaded guilty to misleading police and illegal disposal of his wife Ana Walshe’s body, but maintains he did not murder her.

Here’s what that could mean for his murder trial \n       \n  By Lauren del Valle, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:44 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A Massachusetts man on trial for murdering his wife in 2023 admitted this week that he disposed of her body in dumpsters and misled police, but his lawyers insist he is not admitting to her murder.\n \n\n   \n  Now, with the court having chosen the jury that will consider the murder charge still haunting him, the question becomes: How will  Brian Walshe’s  legal team defend him?\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, minutes before jury selection was set to begin for his murder trial, Walshe pleaded guilty to misleading police and the improper conveyance – or illegal disposal – of a human body stemming from the death of his wife, Ana Walshe. The   corporate real estate manager and mother of three  vanished around New Year’s 2023 .\n \n\n   \n  Walshe pleaded guilty to the lesser charges without a deal with prosecutors, who “refuse to negotiate,” according to a defense filing, “unless negotiations included the indictment charging murder.”\n \n\n   \n  Walshe still faces one count of first-degree murder, which, if convicted, carries a mandatory life sentence without the possibility of parole.\n \n\n   \n  The eleventh-hour guilty pleas Tuesday came as a shock – and piqued interest in Walshe’s defense strategy.\n \n\n   \n  The decision to have Walshe plead guilty to those charges is an “incredibly bold move by the defense,” said Ronald Sullivan, a Harvard law professor, and will allow the defense to focus the trial solely on the question of whether the defendant killed his wife, potentially limiting what evidence the jury will see about Walshe’s disposal of Ana’s remains.\n \n\n   \n  “It may well be a good strategic move for the defense,” said Sullivan.\n \n\n   \n  It’s also possible Walshe’s attorneys are maneuvering for their client to face lesser homicide charges in the hopes of avoiding life without parole.\n \n\n   \n  Under Massachusetts law, Walshe cannot plead guilty to first-degree murder, so the commonwealth would have to change course and agree to Walshe pleading guilty to a lesser homicide charge like second-degree murder or voluntary manslaughter, which could allow for the possibility of parole.\n \n\n   \n  As of now, Walshe’s attorneys have made clear he isn’t admitting to Ana’s murder, despite his change of pleas.\n \n\n   \n  “Mr. Walshe is prepared to admit to the recitation of facts with respect to the indictment that the government just read in so far as it alleges he did impede and obstruct the criminal investigation into the disappearance of Ana Walshe. We obviously object, and he’s not admitting to … murder,” defense attorney Kelli Porges said in court Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Jury selection was completed on Thursday.  CNN affiliate WCVB  reported 16 panelists had been chosen, 12 of whom will decide the case. The other four will be alternates.\n \n\n   \n  Judge Diane Freniere has ordered the chosen panelists to stay off social media and avoid the news to reduce their risk of exposure to coverage of Walshe’s case.\n \n\n   \n    How we got here\n \n\n   \n  Ana Walshe’s employer reported her missing on January 4, 2023, sparking a search that drew national media attention. When local police went to the Walshe home, Brian Walshe told officers his wife had left early New Year’s Day to return to Washington, DC for a work emergency, and he hadn’t seen or heard from her since.\n \n\n   \n  Ana Walshe, who lived and worked in DC, commuted to the Boston suburbs to see her family on December 30, 2022. Her former boss joined the family to celebrate on New Year’s Eve around 8 p.m. and told authorities he left around 1 a.m. the following day.\n \n\n   \n  The guest didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary, and told authorities the couple seemed happy, according to court records. He is expected to testify at trial.\n \n\n   \n  Walshe reportedly called Ana’s employer, Tishman Speyer, on January 4, 2023, asking about his wife, court records say, but he never reported her missing to the police.\n \n\n   \n  Walshe was arrested on January 8, 2023, for misleading police in connection to Ana’s disappearance. He was charged with her murder later that month, and he has been in commonwealth custody since his arrest.\n \n\n   \n  The trial was originally slated to begin last month, on October 20. But Judge Freniere granted a delay for Walshe to undergo a mental health evaluation.\n \n\n   \n  Walshe’s attorneys lobbied for the delay after he was stabbed in jail in September, expressing concern their client could not adequately assist in his defense following the attack. He was deemed competent to stand trial last week after a 40-day stint in a state hospital.\n \n\n   \n    Possible defense strategies\n \n\n   \n  Walshe’s defense team has kept its strategy close to the vest, rarely commenting in the media about the case since his arrest almost three years ago.\n \n\n   \n  Following his guilty pleas Tuesday, Walshe faces up to 10 years in prison for the charge of misleading police – which could be enhanced up to 20 years if he is convicted of Ana’s murder. He also faces up to three years in prison for pleading guilty to the conveyance charge.\n \n\n   \n  Separately, Walshe is serving a 37-month prison sentence tied to a federal case from 2018, in which Walshe pleaded guilty to charges connected to selling forged Andy Warhol artwork. That sentence is set to run concurrently with his prison time for the state case connected to his wife’s death.\n \n\n   \n  Walshe faces a charge of first-degree murder for Ana’s death. But before the jury begins deliberating, his attorneys could ask the judge to allow the panel to consider less severe homicide charges.\n \n\n   \n  It’s possible the judge would not grant the request, Sullivan said. But she would consider “if there are enough facts to support something, or the absence of contradictory facts – like nobody was there.”\n \n\n   \n  Brian and Ana Walshe and their three young children are the only people said to have been in their home after ringing in the New Year. At this point, there is no publicly released evidence to suggest how Ana Walshe died. Her body  has not been found .\n \n\n   \n  The success of the defense case could hinge on testimony by Walshe himself, who could take the stand to offer the jury a narrative of what happened after their dinner guest left around 1 a.m. on New Year’s Day. For example, his lawyers could claim Walshe is innocent of murder because a terrible accident caused Ana’s death, or provide some justification to support a theory that Walshe caused her death in self-defense.\n \n\n   \n  “The problem with these sorts of defenses is that there’s no corroboration, and the alleged victim is unable to say anything, because the person is deceased,” said Sullivan, who was on the defense team that secured an acquittal in the 2017 double homicide case against one-time NFL player Aaron Hernandez.\n \n\n   \n  “If he testifies and says, ‘We got into an argument, you know, she pulled a knife on me, and I defended myself,’ he gets to testify to that because there are no contrary facts there,” he said. “And, you know, no one else was around, and that’s the evidence.”\n \n\n   \n  “The jury can credit it or not credit it,” Sullivan added, “but that’s on the record at this point.”\n \n\n   \n    What we might see at trial\n \n\n   \n  Sullivan indicated Walshe’s guilty pleas this week for misleading the police and improper conveyance of a body suggested the defense felt the evidence against their client was substantial.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re saying, ‘We will eat everything for which there’s such overwhelming evidence … We’re not going to win that fight so let’s just say we did it,’” Sullivan said, channeling the defense’s possible perspective.\n \n\n   \n  “Now all (they’re) fighting over is whether the defendant caused the death of the decedent,” Sullivan said. “So, one thing instead of several things.”\n \n\n   \n  Before Walshe changed his plea on two of the three counts in the indictment, prosecutors had said they could call up to 60 witnesses in the commonwealth’s case against him. But the commonwealth’s witness list will likely be trimmed down now that prosecutors don’t need to establish that Walshe disposed of his wife’s body and belongings or that he lied about his activities in the days after her disappearance.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors will likely show the jury some evidence of Walshe’s activities in the days after he claims he last saw his wife – but less than what would have been necessary to prove the charges to which he’s now pleaded guilty.\n \n\n   \n  “What the judge will likely do is say, ‘Well, some of that will come in because it goes to your state of mind,’ and the jury can reasonably infer consciousness of guilt from some of these actions,” Sullivan said.\n \n\n   \n  For instance, records and video surveillance put Walshe at Lowe’s and Home Depot on January 1 and 2, 2023, buying a bevy of cleaning supplies with cash. Walshe was also seen on video surveillance throwing several black bags into dumpsters.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators searched a dumpster at the complex where Walshe’s mother lived and recovered a number of items, including a Tyvek suit, a hatchet, a hacksaw and several items with  Brian and Ana Walshe’s blood  and DNA on them. They also found some of Ana’s belongings, including her Hunter boots, a Prada purse and her Covid-19 vaccination card.\n \n\n   \n  Ana’s blood was also found in the basement of the Walshe family home.\n \n\n   \n  Additionally, prosecutors have alleged Walshe used his 6-year-old son’s iPad for  dozens of Google searches  on the morning of January 1, 2023, like, “How to get blood out of hardwood floors,” “how to dispose of a body in the trash” and “how to stop a body from decomposing.”\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors have suggested Walshe had a financial motive to kill his wife, to cash in on life insurance policies that would help him pay restitution tied to his federal art fraud conviction.\n \n\n   \n  They have also said it’s fair to assume Walshe knew his wife was  having an affair  with a man in Washington, DC and suggested he could have been motivated to kill her because of the romantic entanglement. The jury is expected to see text messages between Ana and the man, who is also expected to testify.\n \n\n   \n  Walshe’s attorneys argue there is no proof he knew about the affair before Ana’s disappearance. But prosecutors say Walshe Googled the man days before Ana vanished.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/politics/trump-democrats-seditious-behavior","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"17:43:00-05:00","title":"Trump accuses Democratic lawmakers who urged military to disobey illegal orders of ‘seditious behavior, punishable by death’","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump issued a stark threat on his Truth Social platform, claiming that Democratic lawmakers who urged military and intelligence personnel to disobey illegal orders should be executed, describing their actions as 'sedition' punishable by death.

orders of ‘seditious behavior, punishable by death’ \n       \n  By Samantha Waldenberg, Arlette Saenz, Kit Maher, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:43 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   President Donald Trump  on Thursday suggested that Democratic lawmakers who urged service members and intelligence officials  to disobey illegal orders  should be put to death, sparking an outcry among Democrats on Capitol Hill that the president was seeking to incite violence.\n \n\n   \n  “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform, responding to a video from half a dozen members of Congress who previously served in the military and intelligence community urging people currently in those roles to “refuse illegal orders.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s called SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL. Each one of these traitors to our Country should be ARRESTED AND PUT ON TRIAL,” Trump wrote. He also reposted several other users’ posts, including one that read: “HANG THEM GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD !!”\n \n\n   \n  The comments drew a swift rebuke from Democrats, who condemned Trump’s comments as an attempt to incite violence, and even drew the scrutiny of members in his own party.\n \n\n   \n  GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham, a staunch Trump ally who served as a lawyer for the military reserves, said the president’s remarks were “over the top,” though he also said he considered the Democrats’ video “despicable.” And GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky said he didn’t think it was “really a good idea to talk about jailing your political opponents, or hanging them, or whatever else.”\n \n\n   \n  White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt later denied that Trump was calling for lawmakers to be executed, arguing that the members of Congress with national security backgrounds should not be encouraging anyone to defy orders from the administration.\n \n\n   \n  “These members knew what they were doing. They were leaning into their credentials, as former members of our military, as veterans, as former members of the national security apparatus, to signal to people serving under this commander in chief, Donald Trump, that you can defy him and you can betray your oath of office,” Leavitt said. “That is a very, very dangerous message. And it perhaps is punishable by law.”\n \n\n   \n  In a joint statement, the six Democratic lawmakers in the video – Sens. Elissa Slotkin and Mark Kelly and Reps. Jason Crow, Maggie Goodlander, Chris Deluzio and Chrissy Houlahan – vowed they “will not be intimidated.”\n \n\n   \n  “What’s most telling is that the President considers it punishable by death for us to restate the law. Our service members should know that we have their backs as they fulfill their oath to the Constitution and obligation to follow only lawful orders. It is not only the right thing to do, but also our duty,” the lawmakers said in part.\n \n\n   \n  “But this isn’t about any one of us. This isn’t about politics. This is about who we are as Americans. Every American must unite and condemn the President’s calls for our murder and political violence. This is a time for moral clarity.”\n \n\n   \n  Slotkin was accompanied by USCP officers to an event in Washington, DC, on Thursday. Her team requested the additional presence from USCP for the event that took place off Capitol Hill, a source familiar with the matter said.\n \n\n   \n   “I think when a lion’s share of Americans understand that it is in their own power to push back on this kind of rhetoric and this kind of threat, that’s when we actually turn the tide,” she said at the event.\n \n\n   \n  Deluzio called for both parties to unite against what he called Trump’s “outrageous call for political violence.” “It’s a moment where Democrats and Republicans and everyone else in the country should condemn his calls for political violence,” he said on CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Crow, meanwhile, warned on CNN that Trump’s comments should be taken seriously. “We have to take everything that Donald Trump says seriously. He throws a lot of stuff out there, but some of the things he carries through on,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called the comments “an outright threat” and that Trump was “calling for the execution of elected officials.” He added from the Senate floor: “This is an outright threat, and it’s deadly serious.”\n \n\n   \n  House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and his leadership team said they had been in touch with law enforcement authorities to make sure lawmakers were protected.\n \n\n   \n  “We have been in contact with the House Sergeant at Arms and the United States Capitol Police to ensure the safety of these Members and their families. Donald Trump must immediately delete these unhinged social media posts and recant his violent rhetoric before he gets someone killed,” they said.\n \n\n   \n  Asked about the president’s comments, Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he didn’t agree with them but dismissed the video that sparked his reaction as “unnecessary.”\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t agree with that. Obviously, everyone has their First Amendment rights. But what they did was ill-advised and provocative and unnecessary,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, similarly called the video “wildly inappropriate,” as he defended Trump. Though he later conceded he wouldn’t have used the same language.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to allow others to make legal judgments about how that…the words that the President chose are not the ones that I would use, OK,” Johnson said Thursday evening.\n \n\n   \n  “Obviously, I don’t think that this is…these are crimes punishable by death or any of that,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The lawmakers who posted the video that sparked Trump’s reaction did not specify which orders service members received, or might receive, that could be illegal. “No one has to carry out orders that violate the law, or our Constitution,” they said in the video, adding, “Know that we have your back. … Don’t give up the ship.”\n \n\n   \n  Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said Wednesday that the Justice Department will be taking a “very close look” at those lawmakers’ actions, calling it a “disgusting and inappropriate display of supposed leadership from the Democrat Party.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/politics/nigeria-christians-trump-military","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"17:30:00Z","title":"Nigerian Officials in Washington After Trump’s Threats of Military Action Over Violence Against Christians","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Nigerian officials, led by National Security Adviser Mallam Nuhu Ribadu, are meeting with US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau in Washington in response to President Donald Trump's designation of Nigeria as a country of particular concern due to threats against Christians.

month  he would be designating Nigeria as a country of particular concern over conditions for Christians, saying Christianity is “facing an existential threat” and threatening US military action as a result.\n \n\n   \n  Experts and analysts have cautioned that the situation is  far more nuanced , as both Christians and Muslims in Nigeria have come under attack by Islamic extremists.

The administration has claimed that the National Guards presence added significant preventative measure that helped decrease crime in the district.\n \n\n   \n  “President Trump is well within his lawful authority to deploy the National Guard in Washington, DC, to protect federal assets and assist law enforcement with specific tasks,” White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in response to the ruling. “This lawsuit is nothing more than another attempt — at the detriment of DC residents — to undermine the President’s highly successful operations to stop violent crime in DC.”\n \n\n   \n  In her ruling, Cobb, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, acknowledged the complexities of the case given “the unique constitutional position of the District of Columbia.”\n \n\n   \n  Cobb, however, said that “at its core, Congress has given the District rights to govern itself. Those rights are infringed upon when Defendants approve, in excess of their statutory authority, the deployment of National Guard troops to the District.”\n \n\n   \n  “From the beginning, we made clear that the U.S. military should not be policing American citizens on American soil,” DC Attorney General Brian Schwalb said in a statement following the decision.\n \n\n   \n  “This unprecedented federal overreach is not normal, or legal,” he added. “It is long past time to let the National Guard go home – to their everyday lives, their regular jobs, their families, and their children.”\n \n\n   \n  Cobb found that “the deployments at issue entail the day-to-day presence of more than 2,000 National Guard troops,” which the judge noted is about two-thirds the size of the local police force.\n \n\n   \n  “The Court finds no authority in Title 49 of the D.C. Code that supports the President’s ability to call out the (DC National Guard) to patrol the District under these circumstances,” Cobb wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “There is also the risk that this incursion may become permanent, or at least enduring, given the creation of a (DC National Guard) unit specifically established to conduct law enforcement in the District,” which the judge notes runs contrary to the statutes that govern their deployment.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments and comment. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/politics/state-department-freedom-speech-human-rights","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"17:00:00Z","title":"State Department to focus on freedom of speech in next human rights report, likely targeting European governments","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. State Department is shifting its upcoming human rights report to prioritize freedom of speech, particularly in Western European countries like the UK, France, and Germany, where it alleges significant restrictions on expression.

That report alleged “significant human rights issues” in allied countries including the United Kingdom, France and Germany over “serious restrictions on freedom of expression.”\n \n\n   \n  The State Department instructed all embassies and consulates in a diplomatic cable Thursday to begin preparing the congressionally required annual report. The official said they are encouraging diplomats to “go out in the field, talk to people, collect data that then informs the report.”\n \n\n   \n  The future report is “really going to reflect what’s going on in the country,” they said.\n \n\n   \n  “For instance, in Western Europe, we see a backsliding of the protection of freedom of expression. So of course, we’re going to prioritize that versus another country that is maybe not curtailing free speech as much,” the official said.\n \n\n   \n  Top Trump administration officials, including Vice President JD Vance, have  lambasted European nations  over allegations of free speech backsliding while also meeting with far-right European political figures. At the same time, the administration has also revoked and denied visas for alleged antisemitic speech and comments made about the murder of right-wing commentator Charlie Kirk.\n \n\n   \n  “When it comes to Western Europe, we’re not saying that we’re favoring one opposition party or one particular political group. We’re saying all groups, all parties, all people should be able to speak freely, and that includes on the internet. That includes on social media,” the senior State Department official said Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “In Europe, the (Digital Services Act) is a regulatory regime that restricts speech online,” the official said, referencing a sweeping EU law that requires Big Tech platforms to take meaningful steps to reduce illegal and harmful content.\n \n\n   \n  The official noted that the human rights report, formally known as the Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, is used “as a tool to change the behavior of governments.”\n \n\n   \n  “When our European friends are restricting free speech, we’ll have a conversation, and if they make changes, we will note that in the future report,” they said.\n \n\n   \n  The official also noted that they “are moving away from group identities, group labels, and focusing on the fact that when a person is persecuted for whatever reason, that is a violation of the moral law.”\n \n\n   \n  “We’re making sure that we’re promoting individual freedom not based on some group identity,” they said.\n \n\n   \n  The latest human rights report released in August had already been stripped of specific sections of reporting on alleged abuses based on sexual orientation, violence toward women and systemic racial or ethnic violence.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/americas/colombia-holy-grail-shipwreck-san-jose-treasures-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"17:09:00-05:00","title":"Colombia recovers first treasures from 300-year-old ‘holy grail of shipwrecks’","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Colombia has recovered valuable artifacts—including gold, silver, a porcelain cup, and a cannon—from the sunken Spanish warship San José, which sank in 1708 during the War of the Spanish Succession.

Security’s aggressive immigration actions in the Chicago area earlier this year, according to a court filing Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Last Wednesday, US District Court Judge Jeffrey Cummings ordered the Trump administration to release on $1,500 bond hundreds of detainees after he determined the arrests violated a local consent decree barring warrantless arrests of immigrants.\n \n\n   \n  Court records showed last Friday the Department of Justice submitted a list of more than 600 people to be assessed for release. The list showed only a fraction of those detained were considered “high risk” by federal officials.\n \n\n   \n  The list included criminal histories for just 16 defendants. Those criminal histories included convictions or arrests for aggravated assault, driving under the influence, indecent exposure, battery and enticement of a minor and kidnapping.\n \n\n   \n  A CNN analysis of the DOJ filing showed migrants arrested in the Chicago area were transferred to detention facilities as far away as Texas and Kentucky.\n \n\n   \n  The 7th Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday sided with the Trump administration to keep those on the list in custody, just one day before detainees were set to be released.\n \n\n   \n  Tensions between the Trump administration and local leaders, protesters and journalists in Chicago and Illinois have boiled over since Operation Midway Blitz got underway over the summer. The government is fighting a multi-front legal battle as groups challenge agents’  use of force  on demonstrators, treatment of media and clergy, and warrantless detentions.\n \n\n   \n  The federal immigration crackdown has drawn pushback from community members concerned about the potential for racial profiling and  constitutional rights  violations – for both documented and undocumented people – as  the mass deportation agenda  has swept up people of all ages, from  children  and  families  to  suspected criminals , by making arrests at  Home Depots  and farms, outside courtroom hearings, during traffic stops and in workplaces.\n \n\n   \n  In its request to pause the release of migrants, the Trump administration argued Judge Cummings’ orders in the case incorrectly interpreted the law, exceeded the scope of the consent decree and the court’s “legal and equitable authority” and infringed upon the immigration officers’ ability to operate.\n \n\n   \n  Though the appeals court did not explain why it sided with the Trump administration in the detention case, its decision comes just a day after a three-judge panel with the 7th Circuit blocked  a different judge’s order  because they believed the judge had overstepped their authority by imposing strict limits on how federal agents could operate in Chicago.\n \n\n   \n  In that ongoing case, US District Judge Sara Ellis responded to concerns from demonstrators, clergy and media about federal agents’ escalating crowd-control methods. Ellis prohibited agents from using several types of force, issued detailed requirements for body cameras and identification, and ordered the government to produce reams of internal records.\n \n\n   \n  Ellis called the Trump administration’s claims of rampant violence and obstruction in Chicago “not credible” in a written order released Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “Defendants would have people believe instead that the Chicagoland area is in a vise hold of violence, ransacked by rioters, and attacked by agitators – which justifies the unprecedented swath of indiscriminate uses of force unleashed on journalists, peaceful protestors, and religious practitioners. That narrative simply is untrue.”\n \n\n   \n  Both cases under judges Cummings and Ellis are still ongoing. The 7th Circuit will hear oral arguments in the case on migrant detentions on December 2.\n \n\n   \n  The National Immigrant Justice Center and the American Civil Liberties Union, the lead attorneys in the class-action lawsuit, said they are “deeply disappointed” by Thursday’s decision.\n \n\n   \n  “The Seventh Circuit stay means that Chicago-area families will face, at minimum, weeks more separation, and people will continue to languish in inhumane immigrant detention centers, at risk of deportation without due process. This is especially sad given that families already have been separated from loved ones for weeks,” the organizations said in a joint statement.\n \n\n   \n  Even after Judge Cummings’ order paved the way for detainees’ release, the fate of those in custody remained unclear. Several of those arrested had filed their own individual cases, and some, according to the DOJ filing, were already released.\n \n\n   \n  ﻿Of the 3,000 people arrested between June and October, 615 – one-fifth – are not subject to mandatory detention and don’t have final orders of removal, according to Cummings’ ruling. The judge had ordered that those who remain detained out of that group, as long as they don’t pose a high public safety risk, must be granted bond by noon on November 21.\n \n\n   \n  Multiple attorneys CNN spoke with were unsure how Cummings’ ruling would impact their clients who were transferred out of Judge Cummings’ jurisdiction.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/us/melodee-buzzard-disappearance-timeline","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"17:37:00Z","title":"A timeline of 9-year-old Melodee Buzzard’s disappearance and her mother’s arrest","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 9-year-old girl, Melodee Buzzard, vanished from her home in Lompoc, California, on October 14, 2025, after being absent from school.

2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The search for Melodee Buzzard began on October 14 when a school administrator reported the 9-year-old had been absent for a prolonged time.\n \n\n   \n  The investigation into her whereabouts has now stretched for nearly a month, focusing on a 1,000-mile road trip from California to Nebraska and closely examining the actions of her “uncooperative” mother, Ashlee Buzzard.\n \n\n   \n  Buzzard was initially charged with a felony in an incident involving an unrelated different person, but the charge has since been dismissed.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s a closer look at the timeline of the child’s disappearance and the search for her.\n \n\n   \n    Mother-daughter life in SoCal\n \n\n   \n  Melodee and Ashlee Buzzard lived in a home on Mars Avenue in Lompoc, California, about an hour’s drive west of Santa Barbara.\n \n\n   \n  Melodee’s father died from a motorcycle crash when she was only 6 months old,  CNN affiliate KSBY  reported.\n \n\n   \n  Family members said they had lost touch with Melodee and Ashlee Buzzard in recent years. In an interview  with NewsNation  last month, Melodee’s aunt, Lizabeth Meza, said she had not seen her niece in four years.\n \n\n   \n  One of the most recent photos of Melodee was from 2023.\n \n\n   \n  Melodee participated in the Lompoc Unified School District’s remote study program and was seen in  August 2025 , according to the  Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office .\n \n\n   \n  The sheriff’s office described her as about 4-feet-6-inches tall, 60 pounds, with brown curly hair and brown eyes.\n \n\n   \n    The ‘critical’ road trip\n \n\n   \n  On  October 7 , Ashlee Buzzard left California with Melodee, driving a rented white 2024 Chevrolet Malibu, and returned three days later without the girl. That period is now a “critical” time frame for investigators, the sheriff’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  Surveillance footage from the rental car business in Lompoc showed the mother-daughter pair wearing what appeared to be wigs on  October 7 , the sheriff’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  “Investigators also believe that Ashlee swapped wigs throughout the trip, changing to a darker wig that is similar in color and style to the one Melodee was seen wearing,”  the sheriff’s office said . “This change in appearance is believed to have been intentional to avoid recognition during travel.”\n \n\n   \n  The vehicle’s travel route spanned as far as Nebraska, and the return route detoured into Kansas. It is unclear when the car began to head back west.\n \n\n   \n  During the journey, the license plate on the Malibu, which was originally a California plate (9MNG101), appears to change. The car was seen with a New York license plate (HCG9677) beginning  October 8 . “The plate does not belong to the vehicle or Buzzard and is believed to have been used as a false or switched plate to avoid detection,” the sheriff’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  Per the sheriff’s office, on  October 9 , the Chevy Malibu traveled through cities in at least four states, including Green River, Utah; Panguitch, Utah; Northwest Arizona; Primm, Nevada; and Rancho Cucamonga, California.\n \n\n   \n  On  October 9 , surveillance footage captured Melodee in an area near the Colorado–Utah state line on the return trip, the last confirmed sighting of her.\n \n\n   \n  The next day, the Malibu was returned to the Lompoc rental agency with its original California plates.\n \n\n   \n    The investigation begins\n \n\n   \n  Melodee’s disappearance was reported on  October 14  by Lompoc school administrators, who noticed she had not been participating in the remote study program her mother had recently enrolled her in. The sheriff’s office said an administrator contacted police for a welfare check after her “prolonged absence.”\n \n\n   \n  Officers searched the home, but Melodee was nowhere to be found. Her mother could not provide a “reasonable” explanation for her whereabouts, the  sheriff’s office said .\n \n\n   \n  Ashlee Buzzard “has been uncooperative with investigators,” the  sheriff’s office said  on  October 17 .\n \n\n   \n  The FBI joined the investigation on  October 18 .\n \n\n   \n  With public interest growing, the  sheriff’s office  on  October 20  asked the public “not to attempt to conduct their own searches or investigations. While well-intentioned, these efforts could unintentionally interfere with investigative work already in progress.”\n \n\n   \n  On  October 22 ,  investigators released  to the public a timeline of Melodee’s movements, and on  October 24 , they  released  surveillance images of her at the rental car agency.\n \n\n   \n  Members of Melodee’s father’s side of the family held a candlelight vigil for the missing girl on  October 24 , according to  KSBY .\n \n\n   \n  On  October 30 ,  investigators served  follow-up search warrants at the Buzzard home, a storage locker and the rental car.\n \n\n   \n  Further,  investigators released  on  November 6  a short video of Melodee and Ashlee Buzzard at the rental agency weeks earlier.\n \n\n   \n    Arrest and dismissal of false imprisonment charge\n \n\n   \n  On  November 7 , the sheriff’s office  announced  they had arrested Ashlee Buzzard on a false imprisonment charge unrelated to Melodee’s disappearance.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators said they learned of an incident a day earlier in which the mother “prevented a victim from leaving a location against their will.” Buzzard faced a felony charge of false imprisonment by violence, according to the Santa Barbara County District Attorney’s Office.\n \n\n   \n  The alleged victim in the false imprisonment case posted a statement on social media – which he later removed – saying he went to Buzzard’s house on  November 6  to offer help finding Melodee.\n \n\n   \n  “[D]uring an interaction at her residence, the situation escalated. Ms. Buzzard became visibly distressed after sharing information she appeared to regret disclosing,” the man wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “A box cutter was produced, and despite multiple requests to be allowed to exit the home, I was not immediately permitted to leave. The door was secured by several locks, which delayed my ability to exit. This incident was reported to law enforcement.”\n \n\n   \n  Buzzard appeared in court  November 12  and pleaded not guilty to the false imprisonment charge.\n \n\n   \n  Her defense attorney Adrian Galvan argued she was not a flight risk, but prosecutors disagreed, noting her use of wigs and the license plate swaps during her road trip with Melodee last month.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s apparent that she has taken lengths to conceal her identity and whereabouts on other occasions, and if she were to be released, that would be a concern,” the prosecutor said.\n \n\n   \n  The prosecutor mentioned the presence of a box cutter but did not provide a detailed account of the alleged incident.\n \n\n   \n  The judge ordered Buzzard be released on GPS monitoring with a no-contact order for the victim.\n \n\n   \n  At a pretrial hearing  November 20 , the judge did not find sufficient probable cause and dismissed the charge and the pre-trial supervision, a spokesperson for the Santa Barbara District Attorney’s Office told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The hearing featured testimony from the accuser who said he felt threatened by Buzzard when he visited her home on November 6,  KSBY reported . The judge ruled to dismiss the complaint, saying an audio rexcording of their conversation did not show enough evidence for the accuser to have been in fear, according to KSBY.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/us/melodee-buzzard-missing-investigation","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"17:12:00Z","title":"Child Missing: Mother Not Cooperating; FBI Involved in Search","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Nine-year-old Melodee Buzzard has been missing for over a month since being last seen with her mother, Ashlee Buzzard, during a cross-country road trip from California to Nebraska.

I think those are legitimate that something is amiss, but we just don’t know what it is.”\n \n\n   \n    Melodee went missing last month\n \n\n   \n  The search for Melodee began on October 14 when a school administrator reported the girl had been absent for a prolonged period of time.\n \n\n   \n  Officers searched the home, but Melodee was nowhere to be found, officials said. Her mother could not provide a “reasonable” explanation for her whereabouts and “has been uncooperative” with investigators, the sheriff’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  The investigation into Melodee’s whereabouts has focused on her and her mother’s movements during a 1,000-mile road trip from their home in Lompoc, California, to Nebraska. On October 7, Ashlee Buzzard left California with Melodee, driving a rented white 2024 Chevrolet Malibu, and returned three days later without the girl. That period is now a “critical” time frame for investigators, the sheriff’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  Surveillance footage from a rental car business in Lompoc showed the mother-daughter pair wearing wigs on October 7, the sheriff’s office said. Further, the rental car’s license plate was changed midway through the trip in what the sheriff’s office said is believed to be an attempt “to avoid detection.”\n \n\n   \n  “Investigators also believe that Ashlee swapped wigs throughout the trip, changing to a darker wig that is similar in color and style to the one Melodee was seen wearing,”  the sheriff’s office said in a November 6 statement . “This change in appearance is believed to have been intentional to avoid recognition during travel.”\n \n\n   \n  On November 7, the sheriff’s office  announced  the mother was arrested on a felony false imprisonment charge for allegedly using a box cutter and preventing an adult man “from leaving a location against their will.”\n \n\n   \n  She pleaded not guilty and was released from custody with GPS monitoring.\n \n\n   \n  The charge was dismissed and her pre-trial supervision ended on Thursday after the judge did not find sufficient probable cause, a spokesperson for the Santa Barbara District Attorney’s Office told CNN. The hearing featured testimony from the accuser, according to  CNN affiliate KSBY .\n \n\n   \n  Buzzard’s attorney, Adrian Galvan, declined to comment to CNN about the investigation into Melodee’s whereabouts.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office said Wednesday night Ashlee Buzzard was “in consistent contact with investigators and they have not had any additional information that they are prepared to release.”\n \n\n   \n  Family members said they had lost touch with Melodee and Ashlee Buzzard in recent years. Melodee’s father died from a motorcycle crash when the girl was only 6 months old,  CNN affiliate KSBY  reported.\n \n\n   \n    The next steps in the investigation\n \n\n   \n  Investigators are likely to continue tracing the steps of the road trip as they search for physical evidence, digital communications and witnesses, legal experts told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “What they’re doing is what they should be doing,” CNN chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst John Miller explained. “They are taking their time. They are being meticulous. They are building the pieces of a case that may come together if and when they do have evidence to arrest her.”\n \n\n   \n  As for Buzzard, her uncooperative stance may be frustrating for investigators, but the Fifth Amendment guarantees everyone the right to silence in an interrogation.\n \n\n   \n  “There is no legal imperative at all, under any circumstance, no matter how bad things might look for you in public opinion, for you to say anything,” Jackson said.\n \n\n   \n    Other missing children cases\n \n\n   \n  In two high-profile cases involving missing children, the parents were initially charged with lesser counts as investigators continued to search for more evidence.\n \n\n   \n  Florida mother  Casey Anthony , for one, was initially charged with child neglect, providing false statements to police and obstruction in July 2008 in the disappearance of her 2-year-old daughter  Caylee Anthony . The child had last been seen a month earlier and was reported missing by her grandparents.\n \n\n   \n  Months later, in October of that year, Anthony was indicted on a first-degree murder charge. The decomposed body of her daughter was found in December 2008.\n \n\n   \n  A jury ultimately acquitted her of murder but convicted her on four counts of providing false information to police.\n \n\n   \n  Or consider the case of the Idaho mother  Lori Vallow Daybell .\n \n\n   \n  Her children, JJ and Tylee, were last seen in September 2019, and relatives raised concerns about their whereabouts two months later. In  February 2020 , Vallow Daybell was arrested in Hawaii on suspicion of two felony counts of desertion and nonsupport of dependent children.\n \n\n   \n  The children’s bodies were found in June 2020, and Vallow Daybell and her husband, Chad Daybell, were then indicted on murder charges in May 2021. Both were later  convicted  of  murder  in the children’s deaths.\n \n\n   \n  How Melodee’s case will play out remains a mystery.   In the near term, investigators’ focus will remain on finding her and her well-being.\n \n\n   \n  “There are so many open questions at this point,” Levenson said. “Right now, I think the priority is probably less the charges and more finding the kid.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/europe/poland-fighter-jets-russia-ukraine-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"16:07:00Z","title":"Rescuers scour wreckage for survivors after deadly Russian attack on western Ukraine","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following a deadly Russian airstrike on two apartment buildings in Ternopil, western Ukraine, rescuers search for survivors amid concerns that the death toll may rise.

after deadly Russian attack on western Ukraine \n       \n  By Victoria Butenko, Kosta Gak, Todd Symons and Catherine Nicholls, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:07 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Rescuers worked through the night to find survivors of a Russian attack that hit apartment buildings in western Ukraine, killing at least 28 people, according to authorities.\n \n\n   \n  Ukraine’s emergency service said Thursday that 16 people are still missing after the airstrikes on two apartment blocks in the western city of Ternopil. Ukraine’s interior minister said the strikes may have wiped out entire families.\n \n\n   \n  The large-scale Russian attack overnight Tuesday was one of the deadliest to target western Ukraine since the start of the conflict and prompted NATO to scramble fighter jets over neighboring Poland and Romania.\n \n\n   \n  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned that the death toll could rise as people remained trapped under the rubble. Russia “will never stop on its own,” he said. In a post on Telegram, he urged allies to increase pressure on Moscow to halt the violence and restore peace.\n \n\n   \n  Oksana Kobel’s son was in a ninth-story apartment in the building at the time of the attack.\n \n\n   \n  “I went to work, heard the explosions. I called him and said, ‘Bohdan, go to the shelter, get dressed.’ He answered, ‘Mom, I am already up. Everything will be fine,’” she said   Wednesday, according to Reuters.\n \n\n   \n  Russia’s attacks have mostly targeted the eastern part of the country and large cities such as Kyiv, and many Ukrainians have fled to the west.\n \n\n   \n  The Ukrainian air force said Russia fired hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles during the attack. The buildings in Ternopil were most likely hit by Russia’s powerful Kh-101 cruise missile, which is designed to avoid air defenses and is equipped with an advanced precision guiding system, they said.   \n \n\n   \n  Romania’s Defense Ministry said it scrambled two Eurofighters, part of NATO’s fleet, and later two Romanian F-16 fighter jets after a  Russian drone entered its airspace  during the attack.\n \n\n   \n  Polish and allied fighter jets were also launched to protect Polish airspace on Wednesday morning, the country’s  operational command  said.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll and a top-level Pentagon delegation were in Ukraine on Thursday for meetings with officials following reports that Russia and the US were working on peace proposals that call for Ukraine to cede land and reduce the size of its army.\n \n\n   \n  Polish Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski told CNN that any peace plan would have to involve Europe and leave Ukraine with the capacity to defend itself.\n \n\n   \n  “Poland is a neighbor of both Russia and Ukraine, and the (European Union) is helping Ukraine more, including militarily, than the US, and also financially more than the US. So we have a much bigger stake in this than the US,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  NATO allies have  increasingly scrambled fighter jets  in recent months during Russian attacks on Ukraine, or when stray Russian munitions, drones and warplanes have either strayed too close to their borders or crossed them.\n \n\n   \n  The latest move by NATO comes during a tense week. Polish officials have pointed the finger at Russia after a  key train track was destroyed  in what Warsaw said was an “unprecedented act of sabotage” committed by two Ukrainian citizens who were “collaborating with Russian services.” Russian officials have denied the accusation.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, Poland’s Sikorski said he would close the last Russian consulate in the country in response to the destruction of the train track. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov expressed regret over the move.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, the US State Department approved a possible $105 million sale that would allow Ukraine to upgrade its Patriot air defense system – a critical shield against Russian aerial attacks.\n \n\n   \n  “The proposed sale will improve Ukraine’s ability to meet current and future threats by further equipping it to conduct self-defense and regional security missions with a more robust local sustainment capability,” said a Pentagon statement.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this week, Zelensky struck a deal during a visit to Paris to purchase “up to 100” French-made Rafale fighter jets as well as anti-air defenses and drones from France.\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/travel/real-id-tsa-fee","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"15:56:00Z","title":"Travelers Without a REAL ID Could Be Charged $18 by TSA Under Proposed Rule","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has proposed an $18 fee for travelers without a REAL ID to pass through airport checkpoints, as part of the enforcement of federal security standards introduced by the REAL ID Act of 2005.

Neither state’s waters have been open to new drilling for decades.\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump’s Interior Department released a five-year offshore drilling plan on Thursday that would open up vast parts of California’s coastline to drilling, which hasn’t happened in that state since the late 1960s. The Department is also proposing new oil drilling in parts of the Eastern Gulf — located approximately 100 nautical miles off Florida’s coast — a decision opposed by Florida’s Republican leadership.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration’s proposal would open the Eastern Gulf to federal oil drilling auctions starting in 2029. It would open auctions for drilling in central and southern California in 2027 and northern California in 2029.\n \n\n   \n  The oil industry has been advocating for opening up parts of the Eastern Gulf that are adjacent to areas where oil production has been happening for decades in the Central Gulf, an industry source told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The proposal is sure to be met with resistance in California. The state’s coast has not seen drilling since a devastating oil spill in 1969, which drew national attention for destroying coastal wildlife and the state’s fishing industry.\n \n\n   \n  California Gov. Gavin Newsom called the plan “idiotic” in a statement and vowed the state “will use every tool at our disposal to protect our coastline.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s interesting that Donald’s proposal doesn’t include the waters off Mar-a-Lago,” Newsom said in his statement.\n \n\n   \n  During Trump’s first term, Florida’s congressional delegation — including Republicans — repeatedly pushed back against attempts to open the eastern Gulf of Mexico to drilling. The first Trump administration extended the offshore drilling ban for the Eastern Gulf, rather than opening it up.\n \n\n   \n  This new Gulf action has also rankled many Florida Republicans, where memories of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill still shape public opinion. Molly Best, a spokeswoman for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, said the governor’s office still supports the ban on drilling in the area from Trump’s first term.\n \n\n   \n  The DeSantis administration “urges the Department of Interior to reconsider,” Best said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  And a letter from several Florida Republican congressmen to the president urged the administration to withdraw the Eastern Gulf parcels, saying oil exploration there was “incompatible with military operations and recreational uses.” Among the signees is Rep. Byron Donalds, the Trump-endorsed candidate for governor in 2026.\n \n\n   \n  Leading up to the release of Thursday’s five-year plan, Republican Sen. Rick Scott of Florida said he   believed he had assurances from Interior Secretary Doug Burgum that any new drilling in the Gulf would not threaten Florida economically, environmentally or militarily, a source with knowledge of their conversation told CNN. A source close to several Republicans in Florida’s delegation told CNN officials believe the proposal honors those assurances, though congressional staff were still studying the details.\n \n\n   \n  National Ocean Industries Association president Erik Milito called the inclusion of the Eastern Gulf a “forward-looking approach” and American Petroleum Institute president Mike Sommers hailed it as a “historic step.”\n \n\n   \n  The move is part of President Donald Trump’s agenda to open up more parts of the country to drilling for fossil fuels — the oft-repeated campaign promise of “drill, baby, drill.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s plan also proposes holding lease sales in the western and central Gulf of Mexico, where the vast majority of offshore drilling currently takes place. It also proposes auctioning off federal waters along almost all of Alaska’s coastline at the end of the decade and into the early 2030s.\n \n\n   \n  In response to the Trump administration’s new plan, California leaders vowed to push back on the federal government’s move to open waters up to drilling, including possible legal action.\n \n\n   \n  “Time and again, President Trump has shown that his interest lies with his Big Oil friends profiting at the expense of our environment and public health,” said Christine Lee, a spokesperson for California attorney general Rob Bonta. “We won’t stand for this and are exploring our legal options.”\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Alex Padilla and Rep. Jared Huffman, both California Democrats, said in a joint statement that Trump’s plan “targets California and the whole West Coast because they think we will roll over.”\n \n\n   \n  “They are wrong,” Padilla and Huffman said. “We’re going to fight this with everything we have.”\n \n\n   \n  Given Trump’s tariffs, it’s not currently boom time for oil drilling, experts told CNN. Companies instead are trying to curb their spending and hold onto their earnings, said Tom Seng, a professor of energy finance at Texas Christian University.\n \n\n   \n  “Right now, the industry doesn’t have a lot going on,” Seng told CNN. “We certainly have a pro-fossil fuel administration. They’re going to streamline things for us, but the marketplace will always dictate activity.”\n \n\n   \n  However, Seng said, some oil exploration companies will likely want to “take advantage of the lease offerings,” with an eye towards the long-term future.\n \n\n   \n  “The question is, when will they deploy the capital to actually drill on the leases?” he said. “There won’t be a rush to do so. $60 oil won’t help.”\n \n\n   \n  Environmental groups said the plan would pose a threat to marine life and oceanside communities around the country.\n \n\n   \n  “This draft plan is an oil spill nightmare,” said Oceana campaign director Joseph Gordon. “The last thing America needs now is a massive expansion of offshore drilling that could shut down our shores with catastrophic oil spills.”\n \n\n   \n  The latest move follows other steps the Trump administration has taken in recent days and weeks to expand oil drilling around the country. The Interior Department this week announced it was rolling back a Biden-era rule that had banned fossil fuel drilling on nearly half of the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, over 13 million acres.\n \n\n   \n  And environmental groups sounded the alarm as oil company ConocoPhillips proposed more oil drilling exploration in Alaska, including drilling four new exploratory wells in the NPRA. The company is currently developing the massive Willow project in NPRA where it expects to start producing oil by 2029. Willow was approved by former President Joe Biden in a move that roiled the Democratic president’s base.\n \n\n   \n  “The public deserves the right to have a say on what happens on these critically important public lands in the Western Arctic,” Earthjustice attorney Ian Dooley said in a recent statement. “Seismic and drilling activities can cause impacts on this sensitive ecosystem that lasts decades.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/politics/former-congressional-staffer-charged-allegedly-staging-assault","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"15:45:00-05:00","title":"Former Hill staffer charged for allegedly staging her own violent assault","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Natalie Greene, a former staffer in the office of Republican Congressman Jeff Van Drew, has been charged with conspiracy and making false statements to law enforcement for allegedly staging a violent assault on herself.

Trump set about falsely  claiming prices were actually down , that there is “almost no inflation,” and that everything was more or less hunky dory.\n \n\n   \n  It  was bizarre , even from a president who often seems to reside in his own elaborately crafted alternate reality.\n \n\n   \n  And it appears to be falling flat.\n \n\n   \n  New polling conducted since Trump began driving this message shows Americans continue to see things very differently than Trump has cast them. And their reviews of his economic stewardship appear to actually be getting worse.\n \n\n   \n    75% plus say grocery prices are up, despite Trump’s repeat claims\n \n\n   \n  “Our groceries are way down. Everything is way down,” Trump said November 6. “Groceries are way down, other than beef,” he said at another point. He added last week that grocery prices were “already at a much lower level than they were with the last administration.”\n \n\n   \n  But just 12% of Americans said grocery prices have gone down over the last six months, according to a new  Marquette University Law School poll  conducted November 5 through 12.\n \n\n   \n  By contrast, 75% said they’ve gone up.\n \n\n   \n  (Average grocery prices were indeed  up roughly 1.4%  in September compared to when  Trump took office in January, and the 0.6% jump in one month from July to August was the largest in three years.)\n \n\n   \n  Even among Republicans, only 2 in 10 subscribed to Trump’s alternate version of reality in which prices are actually dropping. A majority said prices are up.\n \n\n   \n  The numbers were similar in a Fox News poll released Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  That poll, conducted November 14 to 17, showed 85% of registered voters  said grocery prices are higher than a year ago, with 60% saying they’ve “increased a lot.”\n \n\n   \n  Around two-thirds or more also said the prices of utilities, healthcare and housing were up.\n \n\n   \n  (“A year ago” technically includes two months in which Trump was not yet president, but it stands to reason people perceived the question as being mostly about his tenure.)\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps most striking: The percentage who say grocery prices are up “a lot” (60%) is significantly higher than the percentage who said that about groceries and everyday items back in October 2021 (43%). This despite inflation back then having been about double what it is today.\n \n\n   \n  That suggests this problem is really ingrained – and will be difficult for Trump to defeat with happy talk.\n \n\n   \n    The chasm between Trump’s claims and Americans’ views of inflation\n \n\n   \n  Trump has claimed there is “virtually no inflation,” “almost no inflation” and said inflation is “almost nonexistent.” He has also said “we don’t have any inflation.”\n \n\n   \n  In fact, inflation has remained stubborn throughout Trump’s tenure and is at about 3% on an annualized basis – right where it was when he took over.\n \n\n   \n  And the perception might be even worse.\n \n\n   \n  52% of registered voters  said inflation was “not at all” under control, according to the Fox poll. That includes nearly two-thirds of independents (65%).\n \n\n   \n  Fewer than 2 in 10 overall – and only one-third of Republicans – said inflation was at least “mostly” under control.\n \n\n   \n    Trump blames Joe Biden; the public doesn’t\n \n\n   \n  To the extent Trump has allowed that there are economic pains, he’s generally cast them as remnants of the Biden era.\n \n\n   \n  “Biden was a disaster with affordability,” Trump told Fox News shortly after the election. He added: “When I took over, it was a mess.”\n \n\n   \n  But this, too, appears to be a losing argument.\n \n\n   \n  The Fox News poll asked whether Trump or Biden were more responsible for the current economy, and voters  chose Trump, 62%-32%.\n \n\n   \n  Only around half of Republicans (53%) blamed Biden.\n \n\n   \n    Trump’s numbers appear to be getting worse\n \n\n   \n  The gamble for Trump in pitching this alternate reality is evident: If people don’t ultimately subscribe to it, they might come to view Trump as out of touch and  not taking the problem seriously enough.\n \n\n   \n  Already,  CBS News-YouGov polling  has shown 75% of Americans and a majority of Republicans have said Trump is not focused enough on lowering prices.\n \n\n   \n  And indeed, it seems Trump is doing himself no favors right now. If anything, his political picture on the economy and affordability is worsening:\n \n\n   \n  The same poll shows Americans say by about a 2-to-1 margin that they expected Trump’s policies will continue to increase inflation.\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, Trump has given people plenty of reason to attach whatever happens with the economy to him. That’s what happens when you rock the economy with a series of unilateral global tariffs that weren’t even endorsed by Republicans in Congress.\n \n\n   \n  Trump voluntarily took ownership of the economy. Now he wants to disclaim the reality of what’s followed.\n \n\n   \n  Political analysts love to mine Trump’s actions for secret political strategy and three-dimensional chess moves.

New study casts doubt on universe’s accelerating expansion \n       \n  By Jacopo Prisco, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:48 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The universe’s expansion might not be accelerating but slowing down, a new study suggests.\n \n\n   \n   If confirmed, the finding would upend decades of established astronomical assumptions and rewrite our understanding of dark energy, the elusive force that counters the inward pull of gravity in our universe.\n \n\n   \n  Two separate teams of astronomers, while observing bright, exploding stars called Type 1a supernovas, put forth the idea in 1998   that dark energy might enable the universe to expand at an accelerating rate.\n \n\n   \n  The scientists had   noted that some of the most distant supernovas were dimmer than expected and concluded that they had moved away from Earth faster than anticipated. The discovery won them a  Nobel Prize in physics in 2011 .\n \n\n   \n  However, the nature of dark energy has remained a mystery, and its role in the universe’s expansion has been called into question  before .\n \n\n   \n  Last year, a consortium of hundreds of researchers using data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI)   in Arizona, developed the  largest ever 3D map  of the universe. The observations hinted at the fact that dark energy may be weakening over time, indicating that the universe’s rate of expansion could eventually slow.\n \n\n   \n  Now, a study  published  November 6   in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society provides further evidence that dark energy might not be pushing on the universe with the same strength it used to.\n \n\n   \n  The DESI project’s findings last year represented “a major, major paradigm change … and our result, in some sense, agrees well with that,” said Young-Wook Lee, a professor of astrophysics at Yonsei University in South Korea and lead researcher for the new study.\n \n\n   \n  Lee and his colleagues’ work builds on the evolving understanding of dark energy, suggesting that the universe’s expansion has already started to slow down — something that could alter the fate of the universe itself. “Dark energy is there, but the present universe has already entered a decelerating phase, today,” Lee said. “So the fate of the universe could change. And if you can change the fate of the universe, that is really important progress in cosmology.”\n \n\n   \n    Aging supernovas\n \n\n   \n  To reach their conclusions, the researchers analyzed a sample of 300 galaxies containing Type 1a supernovas and posited that the dimming of distant exploding stars was not only due to their moving farther away from Earth, but also due to the progenitor star’s age.\n \n\n   \n  “Before our work, Type Ia supernovae were thought to explode with nearly identical intrinsic brightness, making them highly reliable ‘standard candles,’” said study coauthor Junhyuk Son, a doctoral candidate of astronomy   at Yonsei University. “However, we found that their luminosity actually depends on the age of the stars that produce them — younger progenitors yield slightly dimmer supernovae, while older ones are brighter.”\n \n\n   \n  Son said the team has a high statistical confidence — 99.99% — about this age-brightness relation,  allowing them to use Type 1a supernovas more accurately than before to assess the universe’s expansion.\n \n\n   \n  “If confirmed, this would represent the most significant shift in cosmology since the discovery of dark energy in 1998,” Son said. “It would suggest that the (expansion of the) universe is no longer accelerating today and that dark energy is not a constant force but something that evolves over time. This discovery would open an entirely new chapter in our understanding of the physical nature of dark energy, how it has changed throughout cosmic history, and what it ultimately means for the fate of the universe.”\n \n\n   \n  Eventually, if the expansion continues to slow down, the universe could begin to contract, ending in what astronomers imagine may be the opposite of the big bang — the  big crunch . “That is certainly a possibility,” Lee said. “Even two years ago, the Big Crunch was out of the question. But we need more work to see whether it could actually happen.”\n \n\n   \n    Extraordinary claims\n \n\n   \n  The new research proposes a radical revision of accepted knowledge, so, understandably, it is being met with skepticism.\n \n\n   \n  ”This study rests on a flawed premise,” Adam Riess, a professor of physics and astronomy at the Johns Hopkins University and one of the recipients of the 2011 Nobel Prize in physics, said in an email. “It suggests supernovae have aged with the Universe, yet observations show the opposite — today’s supernovae occur where young stars form. The same idea was proposed years ago and refuted then, and there appears to be nothing new in this version.”\n \n\n   \n  Lee, however, said Riess’ claim is incorrect. “Even in the present-day Universe, Type Ia supernovae are found just as frequently in old, quiescent elliptical galaxies as in young, star-forming ones — which clearly shows that this comment is mistaken. The so-called paper that ‘refuted’ our earlier result relied on deeply flawed data with enormous uncertainties,” he said, adding that the age-brightness correlation has been independently confirmed by two separate teams in the United States and China.\n \n\n   \n  Other experts in the field who were not involved with the study echoed some of Riess’ concerns. Dan Scolnic, an associate professor of physics at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, noted that the study makes a leap from host galaxy age to supernova age that isn’t physically justified. “The authors are proposing ideas that the community has already tested and corrected for with much larger data sets. The universe is still accelerating just fine,” Scolnic said.\n \n\n   \n  Dillon Brout, an assistant professor in the departments of astronomy and physics of Boston University, pointed out via email that the paper raises a fair question about how the ages of supernova progenitors change over cosmic time, adding that it is always important to challenge our way of thinking in order to a better understand of the universe. “However, the way they model that evolution is not supported by observations nor by our understanding of how these systems form. Modern supernova analyses already account for the connection between brightness and the environments where these stars originate, which captures most of the effect they discuss,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  “Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence,” Dragan Huterer, a professor of physics at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, said in an email, noting that he does not feel the new research “rises to the threshold to overturn the currently favored model.”\n \n\n   \n  Lee is aware that the work might be controversial. “We have a long way to go to convince everyone in the supernova cosmology community,” he said. “There are still many people who are strongly against (our results), so a lot of debate and discussions should happen in the near future.”\n \n\n   \n  However, he added, more clarity on the issue might be around the corner. The new  Vera C. Rubin Observatory , which started operating this year, is set to help settle the debate with the early 2026 launch of the Legacy Survey of Space and Time, an ultrawide and ultra-high-definition time-lapse record of the universe made by scanning the entire sky every few nights over 10 years to capture a compilation of asteroids and comets, exploding stars, and distant galaxies as they change.\n \n\n   \n  “Vera Rubin will discover more than 20,000 new supernova host galaxies with very high-precision age measurement,” Lee said. “It will take three or five years, and it will allow a more direct cosmological test without worrying about this age bias effect.”\n \n\n   \n  “Dark energy is getting weirder and weirder,” Lee concluded. “But there is no good theory that can explain this very weird behavior. So I think we are missing something. Maybe, in five years, an even more surprising result can come up.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/us/ups-plane-crash-ntsb-report","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"14:40:00Z","title":"NTSB releases frame-by-frame images of engine separating during deadly UPS crash in Louisville","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) released a preliminary report detailing the crash of UPS Flight 2976 at Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport in November 2025, where a critical engine mount on the MD-11F aircraft failed moments after takeoff.

left engine attached to the  UPS flight that crashed  in Louisville earlier this month failed only moments after the doomed flight broke ground, according to a new report from the National Transportation Safety Board\n \n\n   \n  The report includes stunning frame-by-frame photos of the left engine of three-engined McDonnell Douglas MD-11F separating from the plane and going up and over the wing and igniting a fireball seen in a sequence of six extraordinary new images obtained by investigators.\n \n\n   \n  The three pilots of UPS flight 2976 and 11 people on the ground  were killed  when the beleaguered jet sliced a half-mile long debris field across a petroleum recycling facility and UPS warehouse, setting off a massive blaze of fire and black smoke visible for miles.\n \n\n   \n  The report highlights fatigue cracks found in the hardware attaching the engine to the wing and symptoms of over-stressing, but more is still to come as the agency conducts its full investigation.\n \n\n   \n  The UPS freighter was a 34-year-old jet and had been in the process of being phased out by the cargo carrier.\n \n\n   \n  The Federal Aviation Administration ultimately  grounded  all MD-11 and MD-11F aircraft until each underwent a thorough inspection. UPS has 26 other MD-11s in their fleet, a company spokesperson told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    The engine and other faulty parts\n \n\n   \n  Investigators who combed the runway shortly after the crash said they recovered and cleaned hardware from the scene—a pair structural fittings which kept the engine pylon snug to the wing. The fittings—known as lugs—showed signs of fatigue cracking and over-stressing, evidenced by “their 2 o’clock and 9 o’clock positions,” investigators said.\n \n\n   \n  The report also lays out a new timeline of the crash sequence along with new data which showed the plane failed to climb higher than 30 feet above Runway 17 Right at Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport.\n \n\n   \n  A witness in the control tower reported the takeoff speed appeared normal for the type of aircraft, but the climb was not. Another witness said the plane stopped climbing and began to lose altitude before rolling to the left, the preliminary report said.\n \n\n   \n  The MD-11 is equipped with three engines: one on each wing and one on the tail. The plane went through some previous maintenance in San Antonio that put it out of commission for six weeks, investigators said. All service records will be reviewed.\n \n\n   \n  The left and right engines of the plane are attached to the underside of pylons that are attached to each wing.\n \n\n   \n    Investigators are still gathering more information\n \n\n   \n  The cockpit voice recorders and the engine and pylon that fell off the airplane’s wing have also been moved to a secure facility, where they are being examined, NTSB investigators said.\n \n\n   \n  The cockpit voice recorder contained two hours and four minutes of “good quality digitally recorded audio,” Inman previously said. The flight data recorder contained 63 hours of data that spanned over 24 flights, including the accident, the NTSB said.\n \n\n   \n  In a rare move, the NTSB drew a parallel to a previous disaster—the 1979 crash of American Airlines Flight 191, in Chicago which killed 271 on board and two on the ground. The plane involved was a McDonnell Douglas DC-10, the forerunner to the MD-11.\n \n\n   \n  During that plane’s takeoff rotation, the left engine, pylon assembly and about three feet of the leading edge of the left wing separated from the plane and fell onto the runway. The plane rolled to the left and crashed.\n \n\n   \n  Multiple specialists in varying factors were deployed to investigate including experts   in air traffic control, human performance, aircraft performance and more.\n \n\n   \n  Notably, the 12-pages of new findings were published just more than two weeks since the November 4 crash, significantly faster than the NTSB’s typical 30-day timeline to put out a preliminary report.\n \n\n   \n  “We appreciate the National Transportation Safety Board’s prompt release of preliminary findings and will fully support the investigation through its conclusion,” UPS said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Boeing, which long ago merged with the planes original manufacturer, McDonnell Douglas, said, “We continue to support the investigation led by the NTSB. Our deepest condolences go out to the families who lost loved ones and our thoughts remain with all those affected.”\n \n\n   \n  A final report from the NTSB is expected in 18 to 24 months detailing the probable causes of the crash. The agency does not place blame, but gives further recommendations to improve safety.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Lauren Mascarenhas, Chris Isidore, Alaa Elassar, Devon M.

died \n       \n  By Don Riddell, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:35 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The aftermath of a  penalty shootout  is always emotional.\n \n\n   \n  One team will be joyfully exuberant, celebrating a victory wrought from the most nerve-wracking tension. That ecstasy will often be peppered with relief because things rarely go perfectly in a shootout. But for the other side, there is only dejection and heartbreak; it’s cruel to come so close to winning and lose.\n \n\n   \n  On November 9 in the Big Ten tournament championship game, it would have been hard to guess the result just from looking at the University of Washington’s  women’s soccer  players. They hugged each other tight, and some were weeping on their knees as they processed both a win and a loss: Just three days before the final, beloved goalkeeper Mia Hamant had died.\n \n\n   \n  Hamant had been diagnosed with an extremely rare and aggressive form of stage 4 kidney cancer in April, upending her soccer dream for her senior season. But as she was tossed into a desperate fight for her life, Hamant remained an integral part of the team, both in the locker room and as their biggest cheerleader on the sidelines for home games. She was also ready to contribute on FaceTime when they were on the road.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s hard to perfectly describe her because Mia was Mia,” the Huskies head coach Nicole Van Dyke told  CNN Sports , adding: “If I didn’t start with her being an exceptional goalkeeper, she might be upset.”\n \n\n   \n  Last season, Hamant’s save percentage ranked her as one of the top three goalkeepers in the college game, but she was valued for so much more than her ability to stop shots.\n \n\n   \n  “She was strong, resilient, an exceptional teammate,” Van Dyke continued. “She was funny, she just regularly kept us laughing, she always brought people with her. She brought us so much joy.”\n \n\n   \n  Hamant documented her fight against cancer on her Instagram page,  @miakickscancer , and she maintained regular contact with the coaches while helping develop some of the players in the team, particularly this season’s sophomore goalkeeper Tanner Ijams.\n \n\n   \n  “She was probably my biggest role model and definitely my biggest inspiration going into this season,” Ijams told CNN Sports. “You could just see how incredibly strong she was throughout all of this because you could tell how much pain she was in and we all knew that she was dealing with this insane battle of her life, and yet she was still laughing with us.”\n \n\n   \n  But on November 6, the laughter stopped. The Huskies had just beaten Wisconsin in their semifinal match when they learned that they had lost their friend and teammate.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s something no one’s prepared for,” explained Van Dyke, “Fortunately, we were surrounded by friends and family, and I know that’s what Mia and Mia’s family wanted for us. To be together in that moment, we’re unbelievably grateful for that.”\n \n\n   \n  They all spent the next day together, united by grief as they tried to make sense of their loss without somebody who would usually be on hand to lift their spirits.\n \n\n   \n  On a team outing to Target, they bought pajamas and candles, and at Chick-fil-A, they drank milkshakes. The next day, on the eve of the final, the senior players were asked whether they should even take the field against Michigan State. The players looked quizzically at their coach, incredulous that they were even having the conversation, but she had to be sure: Was carrying on what they all wanted to do?\n \n\n   \n  “I know she would be up there making fun of us for being so sad,” Ijams recalled. “We knew that she would want us to go out in that finals match and crush them. So, that’s what we did.”\n \n\n   \n  The players could sense Hamant everywhere around the stadium that day, they listened to her playlist in the locker room and they couldn’t help thinking of her when a sunset, which she so admired, glowed in the exact orange hue of the ribbons they’d been wearing in her honor all season. Orange is known as the color of kidney cancer awareness.\n \n\n   \n  Nobody could have known it at the time, but in what would be one of Hamant’s final games for the Huskies, she was the hero. In a quarterfinal match of the Big Ten tournament last season, Washington beat Iowa in a penalty shootout and Hamant made three saves. It seemed tragically poetic that in the first game after her passing, the match against Michigan State would also be settled with spot kicks, during which the goalkeepers play an outsized role in the proceedings.\n \n\n   \n  “Mia loved penalties, and I definitely share that love with her,” Ijams said. “She would have been absolutely thrilled to go to penalties. I knew that we had already won the game before the penalties even started.”\n \n\n   \n  Channeling some of the tricks and mind games that her late teammate had taught her, Ijams imposed herself on the shootout, saving two of MSU’s first three kicks.\n \n\n   \n  There would be no need for a fourth. Washington’s penalty takers all converted, securing an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament and a chance to win the national title – a goal that the team is still chasing.\n \n\n   \n  After their successful spot kicks, each player paid their respects.\n \n\n   \n  Jadyn Holdenried lifted her jersey to reveal a t-shirt with the inscription “For Mia,” Laura Cetina kissed her orange wristband, and Alex Buck blew kisses to the heavens. By the time Julia Hüsch stepped up with the chance to finish the game, Ijams could feel the emotional dam breaking.\n \n\n   \n  “At that point, my job was done because I knew she was going to put it away,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  When the players all rushed into each other’s arms a moment later, the emotion was palpable.\n \n\n   \n  “We felt that our love for (Mia) wasn’t going to be defined by any result,” explained Van Dyke. “We didn’t put pressure on ourselves to do it. I don’t think there was a dry eye in the stadium, or across the nation, to finish in penalties to win that game.”\n \n\n   \n  “Everyone was just sobbing in each other’s arms,” said Ijams, “We were just saying like, ‘Hey, we did it, like we did it for her.’”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/politics/jd-vance-economy-patience-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"14:16:00Z","title":"Vance pleads for ‘patience’ on the economy in sharp departure from Trump’s rhetoric","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Vice President JD Vance has issued a marked shift in tone from President Donald Trump by calling for patience as the Trump administration faces mounting skepticism over its economic record.

Vance pleads for ‘patience’ on the economy in sharp departure from Trump’s rhetoric \n       \n  By Adam Cancryn, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:16 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Vice President JD Vance on Thursday acknowledged that the Trump administration faces growing  skepticism over its economic record , issuing a plea for patience ahead of what he predicted would be an eventual “economic boom.”\n \n\n   \n  “We get it and we hear you, and we know that there’s a lot of work to do,” Vance said during a Breitbart News event. “As much progress as we’ve made, it’s going to take a little time for Americans to feel that.”\n \n\n   \n  The conciliatory tone represented a sharply different approach from the one taken in recent weeks by President Donald Trump, who has  continued to insist  that the economy is thriving while dismissing cost-of-living concerns as little more than a Democratic talking point.\n \n\n   \n  It also underscored the White House’s ongoing efforts to calibrate its messaging on the economy ahead of next year’s midterm elections — and in the  aftermath of GOP losses in New Jersey and Virginia   earlier this month that voters indicated were driven in large part by deep disappointment with Trump’s domestic agenda.\n \n\n   \n  Vance during his remarks conceded that Americans remained unhappy over the affordability issues that have weighed on those approval ratings, such as the  price of groceries . At one point, he went as far as to undercut one of Trump’s key barometers of economic success — a decline in the price of eggs since January — by admitting that the food staple is still too expensive for many people.\n \n\n   \n  “If you’re an American who’s just struggling to get by, you work hard, you pay your taxes, you want your kids to have good opportunities. And then the price of eggs goes from $2 a dozen to $8 a dozen under the Biden administration, and then it goes from $8 a dozen to maybe $6.50 a dozen,” Vance said. “Well, to you that is still a major problem.”\n \n\n   \n  The vice president sought to cast much of the blame for voters’ sour mood on former President Joe Biden, complaining that the prior administration had “put us in a very tough spot.” He also blamed Democrats for any near-term economic fallout from the record-long  government shutdown .\n \n\n   \n  “I do think that actually pumped the brakes a little bit on all the economic news that we’re seeing,” Vance said of the shutdown. “That’s going to cause a little bit of damage.”\n \n\n   \n  The vice president also celebrated a  stronger-than-expected September jobs report  released earlier on Thursday, calling it evidence that Trump’s policies were working.\n \n\n   \n  Yet he allowed that the Trump administration still has plenty of work to do to convince voters that those policies stand to benefit them, departing from the president’s preferred approach of touting his agenda as an unqualified success.\n \n\n   \n  At a US-Saudi Investment Forum a day earlier, Trump dismissed the focus on affordability, calling it a “new word” that Democrats have latched on to since he took office.\n \n\n   \n  “The only thing that we’re going up in is our stock market, okay, we’re bringing prices down,” Trump said, despite the rise in the cost of key products like  beef and coffee  that economists have blamed at least in part on the administration’s tariffs. “But they came up with a new word that they’re using: affordability.”\n \n\n   \n  The president in speeches and social media posts since Democrats’ electoral victories earlier this month has also called affordability concerns a “con job,” urging voters to credit him for falling gasoline prices and an inflation rate that’s come down from its Biden-era peak — but begun over the last several months to slowly climb once again.\n \n\n   \n  The White House has floated a range of initiatives aimed at reining in the cost of living despite Trump’s insistence that prices are falling, including rolling back tariffs on hundreds of products and raising the prospect of sending $2,000 checks to Americans at some point next year. Trump is  also expected to step up domestic travel  in the coming months focused on promoting his economic agenda, as aides try to boost voter awareness of the administration’s accomplishments.\n \n\n   \n  Trump aides are also planning to  pitch a new health reform plan  ahead of the expiration of enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies amid GOP fears that the party will pay a hefty political price if voters’ health insurance costs skyrocket.\n \n\n   \n  But the administration has offered few details about what that plan will look like. Though Vance on Thursday claimed the eventual proposal would get bipartisan support, he did not provide specifics.\n \n\n   \n  The vice president also offered few new strategies for ushering in the booming economy that he said “we really do believe is coming,” arguing only that the administration needed a bit more time to realize its goals.\n \n\n   \n  “The thing I’d ask from the American people is to ask for a little bit of patience,” Vance said. “We just gotta keep it going.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/uk/uk-covid-inquiry-response-thousands-of-deaths-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"14:35:00-05:00","title":"UK’s Covid response was ‘too little, too late’ and cost thousands of lives, inquiry says","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The UK’s early response to the pandemic was widely criticized as 'too little, too late,' with the government failing to act decisively despite global warnings.

coronavirus pandemic, leading to thousands of more deaths, the head of the UK Covid-19 Inquiry said as its latest findings were released.\n \n\n   \n  “The initial response to the pandemic was marked by a lack of information and a lack of urgency,” the inquiry’s report said, adding that “despite clear signs that the virus was spreading globally, all four nations (England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) failed to take sufficiently timely and effective action.”\n \n\n   \n  If the UK government had introduced restrictions earlier, when the number of Covid cases was lower, mandatory lockdown could have either been shorter or avoided all together, it added.\n \n\n   \n  Instead, “this lack of urgency and the huge rise in infections made a mandatory lockdown inevitable.”\n \n\n   \n  “They had no choice by then. But, it was through their own acts and omissions that they had no choice,” said Baroness Heather Hallett, the inquiry’s chair.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, if the lockdown – which began on March 23, 2020 – had been introduced just a week earlier, at least 23,000 people would have survived, according to the report.\n \n\n   \n  “The evidence suggests that the number of deaths in England alone in the first wave up until the 1st of July 2020, would have been reduced by 48%,” Hallett said.\n \n\n   \n  Thursday’s report, the second of 10 areas of investigation for the inquiry, was focused on how political leaders and senior officials made decisions during the pandemic. It examined the core machinery of government, the role of scientific advice, and the relationship between Westminster and the devolved nations as the crisis unfolded.\n \n\n   \n  Calling February 2020 a “lost month,” Hallett said: “The obviously escalating crisis required leadership from the very top. All four governments knew that in the reasonable worst case scenario, up to 80% of the population would be infected, with a very significant loss of life.”\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, rule-breaking politicians and their advisers weakened public confidence in government decisions and increased the likelihood that people would ignore restrictions, the report said, faulting all four UK nations for poor planning and decision-making.\n \n\n   \n  It said that strained relations and low trust between former UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the first ministers of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland made coordination difficult.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson’s response throughout the crisis was criticized by many who said that he wasn’t taking the pandemic seriously enough.   The so-called “ Partygate ” scandal, which saw Johnson found guilty of breaking his own Covid-19 rules by attending a gathering to celebrate his birthday, contributed to his departure as prime minister in July 2022.\n \n\n   \n  “There was a toxic and chaotic culture at the heart of the UK government …this kind of culture is detrimental to good decision making,” Hallett said.\n \n\n   \n  Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, which campaigned for an independent inquiry, said in a Thursday  statement  that “while it is vindicating to see Boris Johnson blamed in black and white for the catastrophic mishandling of the pandemic, it is devastating to think of the lives that could have been saved under a different prime minister.”\n \n\n   \n  “To make mistakes is human. To refuse to listen to frontline workers, vulnerable people, the insights of devolved leaders or scientific experts is unforgivable,” it said.\n \n\n   \n  The report said that children were not given sufficient priority, as ministers did not fully account for the consequences of closing school and that overall, lockdown caused lasting societal harm and heightened existing inequalities.\n \n\n   \n  It did commend ministers for a successful vaccine rollout and for managing the exit from lockdown in early 2021 in a way that protected vulnerable groups.\n \n\n   \n  Thursday’s report follows the inquiry’s initial report, published in July 2024, which delivered a stark assessment of the country’s pandemic preparedness.\n \n\n   \n  That report concluded that the UK entered the pandemic with “fatal strategic flaws” embedded in its emergency planning systems and found that government preparedness was focused almost entirely on influenza rather than respiratory viruses like Covid-19, despite international warnings.\n \n\n   \n  This narrow scenario planning meant that essential protections, such as robust PPE stockpiles, effective surveillance, and diverse expert input were all inadequate once the pandemic began, it said.\n \n\n   \n  Ten recommendations were issued, including a statutory body for emergency preparedness, regular national pandemic exercises, simplified crisis structures, and significantly improved data systems.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/tech/trump-eo-block-state-ai-regulations-safety-concerns","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"12:43:00.000-05:00","title":"Trump renews effort to block states from regulating AI, raising alarms about safety","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has drafted an executive order aimed at blocking state-level artificial intelligence regulations by establishing an AI Litigation Task Force under the U.S. Attorney General to challenge state AI laws.

effort to block states from regulating AI, raising alarms about safety \n       \n  By Clare Duffy, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:43 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump has drafted an executive order that would block states from enforcing regulations around artificial intelligence, renewing an AI deregulation push that’s raising concerns among tech safety advocates and state lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.\n \n\n   \n  The draft order directs the US attorney general to establish an AI Litigation Task Force to challenge state AI laws and preempt them with Trump’s more lax federal policy, according to a copy viewed by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The fast-moving technology is already subject to little oversight as it extends into more areas of life — from personal communications and relationships to health care and policing. In the absence of broad federal legislation, some states have passed laws to address potentially risky and harmful uses of AI, such as the creation of misleading deepfakes and algorithmic discrimination in hiring. Critics of the preemption push worry that if left unchecked, AI companies could evade accountability should their tools harm consumers.\n \n\n   \n  Asked for comment about the pushback, a White House official told CNN that until officially announced by the White House, discussion about potential orders is speculation.\n \n\n   \n  The language in Trump’s draft order mirrors the argument from some in the tech industry, including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, that navigating a patchwork of state laws would slow down innovation and could affect America’s competitiveness.\n \n\n   \n  “It is the policy of the United States to sustain and enhance America’s global AI dominance through a minimally burdensome, uniform national policy framework for AI,” the draft order states.\n \n\n   \n  Trump also suggested adding language blocking state AI regulations to the National Defense Authorization Act, the annual defense policy bill, in a Tuesday  post  on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  Congress killed an earlier attempt by Republicans to prevent states from regulating AI in July. The US Senate voted nearly unanimously to remove a 10-year moratorium on the enforcement of state artificial intelligence regulations from Trump’s sweeping domestic policy bill before the bill passed. Weeks later, the Trump administration released a Silicon Valley-friendly  AI action plan , a package of initiatives and policy recommendations that largely centered on scaling back AI regulation to promote US competitiveness.\n \n\n   \n  While some in Silicon Valley may support easing up on AI regulation, the proposal has received broad pushback as concerns about AI safety have escalated in recent months. A growing  string of reports  have highlighted risks of the technology causing  delusions  or contributing to  self-harm  among users. Companies like OpenAI and Meta have also been scrambling to  block young people  from accessing adult content via AI systems.\n \n\n   \n  Florida Governor Ron DeSantis called the effort “federal government overreach” in a Tuesday  post  on X.\n \n\n   \n  “Stripping states of jurisdiction to regulate AI is a subsidy to Big Tech and will prevent states from protecting against online censorship of political speech, predatory applications that target children, violations of intellectual property rights and data center intrusions on power/water resources,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Senator Ed Markey called out Republicans for “trying to sneak their AI regulation moratorium into the defense bill” and accused Trump of siding “with his billionaire Big Tech buddies,” in an X  post  Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  The renewed preemption push comes as Trump hosted a dinner at the White House this week for business leaders, which was attended by many AI industry leaders, including Elon Musk, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, OpenAI President Greg Brockman and tech investor and White House AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks.\n \n\n   \n  Hundreds of organizations — including tech employee unions and other labor groups, tech safety and consumer protection nonprofits and educational institutions —  signed   letters to Congress  this week opposing the idea of blocking state AI regulations and raising alarms about AI safety risks.\n \n\n   \n  “This draft executive order isn’t about interstate commerce or American competitiveness,” Alejandra Montoya-Boyer, vice president of The Leadership Conference’s Center for Civil Rights and Technology, said in a statement. “It’s about giving the administration’s tech billionaire buddies and corporations a free pass rather than protecting the people it’s meant to serve.”\n \n\n   \n  J.B. Branch, big tech accountability advocate at the consumer protection nonprofit Public Citizen, noted in a statement that “AI scams are exploding, children have died by suicide linked to harmful online systems, and psychologists are warning about AI-induced breakdowns” and that blocking state regulations could “shield Silicon Valley from responsibility.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/politics/ukraine-russia-trump-peace-proposal","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"12:59:00-05:00","title":"New Trump Peace Proposal for Ukraine Could Require Land Concessions and Military Reduction, Source Says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A new peace proposal from the Trump administration, drafted and supported by President Donald Trump, outlines a potential path to end the war in Ukraine.

Some of the points being circulated now – including some that appear weighted toward Moscow’s demands – are not final, officials said, and will almost certainly evolve. During a Thursday afternoon briefing, the White House press secretary said the plan remained “in flux.”\n \n\n   \n  After meeting a top US military official in Kyiv on Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky agreed to work with the Trump administration on the new plan, saying in a social media post that he was prepared for “constructive, honest and swift work” to achieve peace.\n \n\n   \n  The 28-point plan, which President Donald Trump has reviewed and supports, is the White House’s latest attempt to bring  Russia’s war in Ukraine  to an end. Some of the proposal’s provisions — including territorial concessions in areas not currently held by Russia — have previously been nonstarters with the Ukrainians. But US officials see a new window of opportunity to restart peace discussions.\n \n\n   \n  The plan is still in the framework stage, and its many points haven’t been finalized. CNN has not reviewed the proposal.\n \n\n   \n  “President Trump has made it very clear since day one, and even on the campaign trail, that he wants to see this war come to an end. He has grown increasingly frustrated with both sides of this war, Russia and Ukraine alike, for their refusal to commit to a peace agreement,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during her briefing. “Nevertheless, the president and his national security team are steadfast in seeing this war come to an end.”\n \n\n   \n  Leavitt rejected suggestions the plan was overly weighted toward Moscow, and said the administration had “talked equally with both sides” to create it.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a good plan for both Russia and Ukraine, and we believe that it should be acceptable to both sides, and we’re working very hard to get it done,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggested late Wednesday the document was a “list of potential ideas” rather than a completed proposal.\n \n\n   \n  “Ending a complex and deadly war such as the one in Ukraine requires an extensive exchange of serious and realistic ideas,” he wrote in  a post on X.  “And achieving a durable peace will require both sides to agree to difficult but necessary concessions. That is why we are and will continue to develop a list of potential ideas for ending this war based on input from both sides of this conflict.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, some of the provisions being floated are likely to draw criticism from Ukraine and its backers since it would require significant land concessions. The two regions that  form the Donbas , Luhansk and Donetsk, are still partially held by Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  In the other contested territories of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, the current battle lines would be frozen, according to the Western official’s account of the ideas under discussion. Moscow has previously suggested Kyiv concede both of these regions in their entirety.\n \n\n   \n  In one scenario, Ukraine would also be required to reduce the size of its military and roll back some of its military capabilities, including certain powerful weaponry it has received over the course of the war, the Western official said.\n \n\n   \n  Other points under discussion include the status of the Russian language, and the Russian Orthodox Church, in Ukraine when the war ends.\n \n\n   \n  The plan also includes US-backed security guarantees meant to ensure Russia cannot invade further or expand its war into Europe. The details were described by the Western official familiar with the document.\n \n\n   \n  The proposal echoes a  peace proposal from talks  in Istanbul in the early weeks of the war in 2022, repeating some of Moscow’s wider geopolitical demands about Ukraine’s armed forces and allegiances.\n \n\n   \n    Talks in Ukraine\n \n\n   \n  Army Secretary Dan Driscoll met with Zelensky in Ukraine on Thursday and delivered him the Trump administration’s proposed peace plan, a US defense official told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Driscoll and Zelensky discussed “a collaborative plan to achieve peace in Ukraine” and “agreed on an aggressive timeline for signature,” the defense official said. The official clarified that the US expected Zelensky to sign a framework with the US to work toward an eventual peace agreement, not sign onto a final peace deal itself.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not clear how aggressive that timeline is, or whether Zelensky agreed to its points. European and Ukrainian officials told CNN on Wednesday that the plan appears to contain unacceptable and maximalist demands from Russia, including ceding territory in the eastern Donbas region that Russia does not even currently control.\n \n\n   \n  But the Ukrainian presidential office said on X on Thursday that “the President of Ukraine has officially received from the American side a draft plan which, in the American side’s assessment, could help reinvigorate diplomacy.”\n \n\n   \n  “The President of Ukraine outlined the fundamental principles that matter to our people, and following today’s meeting, the parties agreed to work on the plan’s provisions in a way that would bring about a just end to the war,” the Ukrainian presidential office said, adding that Zelensky expects to speak with Trump in the coming days.\n \n\n   \n  Asked why the Army was tasked with delivering the peace plan rather than diplomats, the defense official said the Army “comes from a trusted position” with the Ukrainians, and is also in Ukraine to hold meetings on battlefield innovation — a topic Driscoll has been deeply involved in throughout his tenure as secretary.\n \n\n   \n  “We come from a trusted position. The US Army is a proven Ukraine ally,” the official said.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Groundhog Day’\n \n\n   \n  A European diplomat echoed the Western official’s description of some of the details of the proposal. The person told CNN that the new effort, which repeats many of Moscow’s maximalist demands dating back to 2022, reminded them of “Groundhog Day,” a film in which events repeat themselves over and over.\n \n\n   \n  A European envoy based in Ukraine said the plan had caught the diplomatic community completely by surprise.\n \n\n   \n  “This has all been gone through before and rejected, and now we’re back to square one,” the diplomat said. “For the Ukrainians, it is just a non-starter and with good reason. It would just be inviting the Russians to come back again at a future date. It would be political suicide for any Ukrainian leader (to accept it), and it would be military suicide to hand over that fortified area.”\n \n\n   \n  The diplomat also described foreign ministries in Europe and elsewhere calling contacts in Washington for guidance on the plan only to be told they were equally in the dark.\n \n\n   \n  “We have heard directly from people in the State Department and on Capitol Hill that nobody knew anything about this plan until it was leaked yesterday,” the diplomat said.\n \n\n   \n  “People who should have known about it, knew nothing about it … There’s a lot of annoyance and confusion.”\n \n\n   \n  In her first public comments since reports of the plan emerged, the European Union’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, told reporters Thursday that “for any plan to work, it needs Ukrainians and Europeans on board.” Poland’s foreign minister Radosław Sikorski, meanwhile, told CNN that any plans should involve Europe and leave Kyiv with the capacity to defend itself.\n \n\n   \n  “We have a much bigger stake in this than the US, and therefore Ukraine, but also Europe, has to be involved,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s special envoy,  Steve Witkoff , has been leading the effort, CNN reported on Wednesday, with a source saying the negotiations accelerated this week as the administration feels the Kremlin has signaled a renewed openness to a deal. A US official said Witkoff had been quietly working on the plan for a month, with input from both the Ukrainians and the Russians on the terms they could accept.\n \n\n   \n  The Kremlin, meanwhile, reiterated its denial that it was working with the US on a peace proposal for Ukraine, saying Thursday there were “no new developments.”\n \n\n   \n  “We have nothing new to add to what was said in Anchorage,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said, referencing a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Trump in Alaska in August. “We have no new developments.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Andrew Carey, Nick Paton Walsh, Brian Abel, and Catherine Nicholls contributed to this report. \n \n\n   \n   This headline and story have been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/us/transgender-day-remembrance-victims","dateOfPublication":"2024-04-12","timeOfPublication":"20:30:15-20:30","title":"China Announces New Environmental Regulations and Climate Action Plan for 2024","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Government of China has announced a comprehensive set of environmental regulations effective from April 1, 2024, aimed at reducing carbon emissions and promoting sustainable development.

For transgender Americans, this year’s memorials will take on particular poignance, as the  Trump administration  and  conservative lawmakers  have  taken great strides  to restrict how they can live  publicly  and privately, while also eliminating  federal data collection  about anti-trans hate crimes and ending funding for an  LGBTQ suicide hotline .\n \n\n   \n  Since last November, at least 27 trans and nonbinary people have been killed, according to the nonprofit  Advocates for Trans Equality . The number is likely an undercount as precise data is difficult to collect, the organization notes. Some research has shown trans people are  more than four times  more likely than cisgender people to be victims of violent crime.\n \n\n   \n  “In many ways, in our society, trans people are made to feel invisible,” said Bahari Thomas, the advocacy group’s director of public education.\n \n\n   \n  Trans people, particularly trans youth, are also at heightened risk of suicidal thoughts and attempts, according to the  Trevor Project . The organization notes this may be the result of a lack of social support and exposure to stigma and discrimination.\n \n\n   \n  Gwendolyn Smith – one of the activists who founded Transgender Day of Remembrance – said it’s both heartening to see her community uphold what she started decades later and sobering to see them continue to experience high rates of violence.\n \n\n   \n  It’s crucial, she said, to remember the “very vibrant lives” trans victims led. “That’s our humanity.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has profiled eight trans people who died this year, focusing on the fullness of their lives rather than the tragic circumstances of their deaths. These are their stories.\n \n\n   \n    Tahiry Broom, who stood ‘ten toes down’ for her values\n \n\n   \n  Tahiry Broom could show up anywhere – from a seat at a church service to a night club’s pulsing dance floor – armed with her long, painted nails, shimmery eyeshadow and colorful wigs. Then, like magic, the whole place would belong to her.\n \n\n   \n  And Patricia Bender would most likely be there, too, watching proudly.\n \n\n   \n  Bender is Tahiry Broom’s aunt, but the two grew up more like siblings. With only five years between them, Bender and Broom spent their days in Cleveland, practically inseparable.\n \n\n   \n  “When you see me, you saw her,” Bender said.\n \n\n   \n  Bender said she loved Broom’s fearlessness. Broom taught her to “walk into the room like you own it, every time.”\n \n\n   \n  Broom was outspoken, always standing “ten toes down” for anyone or anything she believed in, ever since she was a kid. She was a social butterfly who “could make fun out of nothing.”\n \n\n   \n  Bender, who is a member of the LGBTQ community, said Broom leaned on her for support before coming into her own as a transgender woman.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m like, ‘Hey, you can’t worry yourself worrying about what the next person is going to feel like or what the next person is going to think, because at the end of the day, you’re killing yourself trying to make everybody else happy,’” Bender said.\n \n\n   \n  She also helped Broom become more acquainted with those in Cleveland’s LGBTQ community. Bender already knew “everything and everybody” and getting to know new people “was a big thing” for Broom.\n \n\n   \n  She was outgoing. She loved everybody, and they loved her back.\n \n\n   \n  Going one to two weeks without hearing from her wasn’t cause for concern. She was independent and tended to mind her own business.\n \n\n   \n  But in February, Bender’s phone began to ring and ring and ring. She hesitated to answer, sensing there may be bad news on the other end of the line.\n \n\n   \n  “Sometimes your phone rings and it rings different,” Bender said.\n \n\n   \n  When she finally answered her cousins’ FaceTime call and saw their rosy and tear-stained faces, she said she felt numb.\n \n\n   \n  Broom – visiting snowy Southfield, Michigan, at the time – had been shot and killed, less than a month before her 30th birthday.\n \n\n   \n  “My little brother, my nephews, my male cousins, I worry about them. They’ll be outside doing only God knows what,” Bender said. “Tahiry? Nobody worries about Tahiry.”\n \n\n   \n  A suspect in Broom’s death has been charged with second-degree murder and remains in custody, awaiting a trial date, according to Southfield police.\n \n\n   \n  Hearing of an arrest in Broom’s case was a “calming feeling” for Bender, but getting her justice would involve the suspect being “in a cell for the rest of his life,” she said. She and her family members keep up with the case by regularly attending the suspect’s Zoom hearings.\n \n\n   \n  Researchers and advocacy groups say Black trans women, like Broom, are disproportionately impacted by violence. Of the 372 trans victims identified by Human Rights Watch between 2013 and 2024, 73% were women of color, and 60% were Black women.\n \n\n   \n  Bender is still Broom’s “ying and yang.” Her “frick and frack.”\n \n\n   \n  Her niece might have thought introducing her to the local LGBTQ scene, being older or being her “auntie” made Bender Broom’s “savior.” But Broom, Bender said, saved her too.\n \n\n   \n  “I may be helping you in a sense or exposing you to this…and I’m helping you live your truth,” she added. “And the whole time, you think you need me. But the whole time, I needed you more.”\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Sydney Bishop \n \n\n   \n    Karmin Wells, a Detroit ballroom legend whose walk rivaled Naomi Campbell\n \n\n   \n  She was the “walking wonder” of Detroit’s queer ballroom scene – a nightlife runway legend whose hip-twisting strut is rumored to have put Naomi Campbell to shame. She wouldn’t hit the runway in anything less than six-inch heels, and the jangle of jewelry and sharp clack of her heels announced her presence almost everywhere she went.\n \n\n   \n  She was Karmin Wells – nothing more and nothing less.\n \n\n   \n  “Her style can’t be mimicked ever again,” said her aunt, Markeitha Bibb. “When she came in, they knew what it is. They knew she was (going to) take the stage.”\n \n\n   \n  The 37-year-old was a staple of the local ballroom community, a historic queer subculture where performers compete in categories that include modeling, dancing and “voguing.” Often, performers compete as members of a “house,” a chosen family that can provide a support system that biological families sometimes cannot.\n \n\n   \n  Wells had worked the stage for years, eventually earning the status of “legend” and becoming the mother of the Detroit chapter of the internationally-renowned House of Revlon.\n \n\n   \n  Monica Hudson met Wells when she was still a teenager. Hudson had been doing LGBTQ community outreach at the city’s Palmer Park when she came across Wells and was instantly charmed by her witty sense of humor.\n \n\n   \n  “Our interaction was so real and so raw and authentic. She ended up becoming my chosen daughter,” Hudson said. When Wells was killed on May 25, Hudson said it felt like “losing a part of myself.”\n \n\n   \n  Wells was shot to death in her home just days before her 38th birthday. Police say the suspect has not been identified or charged.\n \n\n   \n  “The world lost a talented, funny, loving, caring, hardworking hustler. The world has lost a gem,” said Hudson.\n \n\n   \n  She cared deeply for her grandfather, Willie Bibb, and her younger sister, Kimari Howard, her aunt said. And she had formed her own sprawling family of chosen children – younger people she mentored and uplifted, Hudson said.\n \n\n   \n  “Whatever you gave her, she gave it back to you 10 times,” said Marcel Goudeaux-Stanley, Wells’ close friend and former significant other. “You could never outdo her. She had a really, really big heart.”\n \n\n   \n  Never staying in one place for long, Wells’ suitcase seemed to always be packed. She would leave Michigan at a moment’s notice, traveling to Las Vegas to hit the casinos or to Atlanta to compete in balls, Bibb said. Then, she would show up on her aunt’s doorstep, insisting they go out to Gigi’s or the Woodward, popular LGBTQ bars in Detroit.\n \n\n   \n  “She’s always on the go. She’s always hustling,” Hudson said.\n \n\n   \n  But Wells found peace in small ways: through morning devotionals to God, performing alone in the privacy of her living room, and finding the company of those who knew who she was when the aura of entertainment wore off, Hudson said.\n \n\n   \n  “When she’s around people that she loves, that genuinely love her, and when she can be comfortable and she can rest, that’s where she’s genuinely happy,” Hudson said.\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Elizabeth Wolfe \n \n\n   \n    Lia Smith, a curious student athlete and formidable board game opponent\n \n\n   \n  For her parents, Lia Smith’s birth was a dream come true – albeit a little nerve-racking.\n \n\n   \n  Born early at just over 31 weeks and under 4 pounds, Smith arrived just minutes before her twin (a fact she would later point out with pride to her “baby” sister). Her father, Greg Smith, camped out in the NICU for weeks until he and his husband, Keith, were able to take the babies home to meet their other child.\n \n\n   \n  “We were just thrilled beyond belief,” Greg Smith said.\n \n\n   \n  Smith grew into a healthy child and young adult who was deeply empathetic, “intrinsically curious and very hardworking,” her father said.\n \n\n   \n  She filled her days learning piano and trombone, going to swim practice, poring over books on world history, and playing board games and cards with her family. Exceptional with numbers and problem-solving, she eventually learned how to count cards and maximize her odds of winning.\n \n\n   \n  “Over time, I learned to only play games of pure chance with her if I wanted to win,” Smith said at his daughter’s   memorial service earlier this month. “Simply put, she was smarter than me.”\n \n\n   \n  Diving became a “core part of her existence,” he said. At age 8, Smith began training with Stanford’s youth swim program, and by the time she left home for college, her bedroom walls were decorated with hundreds of competition ribbons.\n \n\n   \n  Though she was recruited by several colleges to compete on their men’s teams, she was delighted to be invited to compete on the women’s team at Middlebury College in Vermont, her father said.\n \n\n   \n  It would be the first time she would compete on a team that aligned with her identity. After her first year at Middlebury, Smith stopped competing in diving but continued to practice with the team.\n \n\n   \n  “She was really more focused on being one of the girls,” Smith said. “It was very affirming, and mostly she just wanted to hang out with them and practice.”\n \n\n   \n  This year, Smith returned to Middlebury as a senior, working towards degrees in statistics and computer science. The 21-year-old was somehow able to find time to pursue other interests as well.\n \n\n   \n  “She loved to debate the history of Japan or think about the intricacies of China. She had a keen and eclectic interest, and it made it always fun and interesting to talk to her.”\n \n\n   \n  Though she loved to spend time with family and friends, she was at her core an introvert. In her cherished private moments, she would read, sit down at the piano, or write poetry, which she rarely shared.\n \n\n   \n  But while Lia was deeply loved, her father Greg said at her memorial that she “lived on a daily basis with the quiet whispers of judgment and the furrowed brows of contempt.”\n \n\n   \n  Last month, Lia was reported missing. After a days-long search, her body was found near the college campus. She had died by suicide.\n \n\n   \n  Lia did not leave a note explaining why she killed herself, but her father noted that she had felt the brunt of cultural backlash against transgender people, a feeling he said was only exacerbated by online harassment and  a parade of restrictions  on transgender people under the Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n  “Over time, I believe the relentless negativity exhausted her,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Hundreds of people attended memorial services at Middlebury and at Smith’s high school, her father said. He was stricken by the “infinite love” shared at the services and the outpouring of support he has received from strangers online.\n \n\n   \n  “She was perfect for us in every way,” he said. “We cherished her, and others did, too.”\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Elizabeth Wolfe \n \n\n   \n    Amyri Dior, a mother figure with a musical soul\n \n\n   \n  Even though Amyri Dior didn’t have children, she was like a mother to all. She guided and cared for her loved ones in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, deeply. And when it came to her family and friends’ children, she didn’t play around — she looked after them like her own.\n \n\n   \n  “My child, her friend’s children, she would claim them as her kids,” Alejandra Rederford, Dior’s cousin and best friend, said. “Always giving. She will give her last, even if it’s her last … Amyri was a good, caring, genuine soul.”\n \n\n   \n  Dior also “didn’t discriminate” when it came to music and had a passion for singing, rapping and dancing. Rederford said sometimes she would sing while Dior rapped on the spot. Through giggles, she also recalled a memory of Dior dancing in a parking lot once to the sound of a car alarm.\n \n\n   \n  “She would try to hype the people around her to dance,” Rederford said.\n \n\n   \n  Dior would write her own songs, her grandmother, Carrie Joyner, remembered.\n \n\n   \n  “She sang her own music from her own voice. She loved singing with such character,” Joyner said.\n \n\n   \n  Dior would also take the time to have deep conversations with Rederford and others about her experience as a trans woman. She was confident in her identity, even if some people didn’t accept her.\n \n\n   \n  Rederford and Joyner also highlighted Dior’s immense strength, living in foster care as a child for eight years before ultimately running away to her grandma’s house.\n \n\n   \n  Dior and Rederford were only a year apart, and mid-February was always a special time, with their birthdays on February 15 on February 21, respectively.\n \n\n   \n  On Dior’s 23rd birthday this year, they celebrated with a house party full of food and drinks. Dior sang along to songs she loved while laughing with her friends and family.\n \n\n   \n  Just seven days later, the two were supposed to be celebrating Rederford’s birthday together. While Rederford was still getting dressed, she answered a phone call, thinking it was Dior ready to be picked up for the night of festivities. Instead, the voice on the other line was her aunt, telling her Dior had been shot.\n \n\n   \n  A man has been charged with first-degree intentional homicide in Dior’s death, according to a criminal complaint from the Milwaukee District Attorney’s office obtained by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “She was a shining soul,” Rederford said. “She was really loved. Everywhere she (went), she was loved.”\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Taylor Galgano \n \n\n   \n    Kelsey Elem, who was chasing her dream of modeling\n \n\n   \n  Kelsey Elem’s smile could light up a room the moment she walked in, her mother, Calvenita Brock, said. She said Kelsey moved through the world with love, the kind you could feel just being around her.\n \n\n   \n  “Kelsey would give a person any and everything,” Brock said.\n \n\n   \n  Born in Greenville, Illinois, and raised in East St. Louis, with her mother and two brothers, Elem ran track, sang in the church choir and loved animals. Later, she joined Job Corps and received her nursing certificate, her mother said.\n \n\n   \n  Elem loved fashion. She was always dressed to impress, known for her bold style and her signature long nails. Brock said the two were very close, and Elem often turned to her for styling advice.\n \n\n   \n  “She’ll come by the house like, ‘Ma, I need to go in your closet, and I’m on my way, get me something out. I need something to wear today.’”\n \n\n   \n  Brock said she spoke to Elem daily, up until the morning of her death on April 24. She was 25 years old when she was fatally shot. The suspect, whom Brock has identified as one of Elem’s friends, was arrested and charged with second-degree murder, third-degree domestic assault and armed criminal action.\n \n\n   \n  The day before her death, Elem posted on Facebook about how proud she was of her transition journey and how happy she was with life.\n \n\n   \n  “She fought to be the woman and the queen that she were,” Brock said. Elem strove to show other trans people “that they didn’t have to have shame, they didn’t have to feel unloved, because, you know, some people’s … loved ones don’t accept them, and Kelsey was there to let them know, because I accepted my child.”\n \n\n   \n  At the time of her death, she was traveling around the US as a model, building a dream she had long imagined.\n \n\n   \n  “She been traveling all around and so she kept telling me, ‘Mom, you got to come on,’” Brock said. “So she told me, ‘Well, I’m (going to) make sure I do all this for you, Ma, you wanted to do all this, and you stopped for us.’”\n \n\n   \n  She was laid to rest on May 9 in a red, pink, white and green casket adorned with photos of her and the words “goodbyes are not forever.”\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Amanda Jackson \n \n\n   \n    Sam Nordquist, who dreamed of buying a log cabin filled with animals\n \n\n   \n  A man so kind he would give you the shirt off his back.\n \n\n   \n  That’s how Linda Nordquist describes her son Sam. His kindness permeated every part of his life, from the patient demeanor he assumed at his job caring for vulnerable adults to the loving care he showed his pet cats and lizards, or the way he showered his young nieces and nephews with affection. On drives around Minneapolis, Nordquist would often buy extra food to hand out to the homeless, his sister, Kayla Nordquist, said.\n \n\n   \n  Nordquist’s confidence blossomed after he transitioned, his sister said, buoyed by a close-knit and deeply supportive family. His mother helped administer his testosterone shots and carefully emptied his surgical drains after he got top surgery. Although transgender identity was new to her, “Sam is still Sam to me, and I loved Sam no matter what,” his mother said.\n \n\n   \n  He was close with his family, often jetting off for road trips with his sister and her children or binging true crime shows together. He lived with his mother, and they built a familiar routine: sharing a cigarette before work, walking the dog together, and making plans for the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  Last September, their routine ended when Nordquist traveled to upstate New York to meet a woman he had met online. Nordquist was tortured to death in early February, according to New York State Police. Seven people have been indicted on murder charges for their involvement. He was 24. Authorities have said there is no evidence of a hate crime but said Nordquist was treated “like a dog” before his death: beaten, assaulted, sexually abused, starved, and held captive for weeks.\n \n\n   \n  “My heart is shattered,” his sister said. Kayla Nordquist said she still wakes up every day wanting to text her brother. For his mother, “life will never be the same. Life will never be normal as we used to know it.”\n \n\n   \n  Nordquist had big aspirations, his family said: He dreamed of buying a log cabin, filled with animals. His mother wishes most of all she could have seen Nordquist find “actual true love.” It stings, she said, that she’ll never see her son get married or have children.\n \n\n   \n  In Minnesota, Nordquist’s family is dedicated to keeping his memory alive as they brace for their first holiday season without him. His sister had a portrait of him tattooed on her arm, and both his sister and mother got tattoos of “8,995,” the number of days Nordquist was alive. For Christmas, his mother is decorating the tree with ornaments adorned with her son’s name.\n \n\n   \n  His mother has taken responsibility for his cat, who sometimes wakes her up scratching at the door of Nordquist’s room, which she’s left untouched since he was killed. His sister, meanwhile, took in his bearded dragon – and she’s found herself caring for the lizard just as lovingly as Nordquist did, decorating its tank for Halloween and Christmas.\n \n\n   \n  Nordquist “was the most gentle, kindest, sweetest person that you’ll probably ever meet,” his mother said. “And the world should know that they’re all missing out on him.”\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Zoe Sottile \n \n\n   \n    Laura Schueler, the ‘Beyonce of Cincinnati’ with an eye for consignment shopping\n \n\n   \n  Laura Schueler was the friend you could call for anything.\n \n\n   \n  De’Whitney Hankins said she would text Schueler for help with outfit choices because she trusted her fashion instincts. Schueler, a transgender woman, was known for wearing trendy furs, jackets, shoes and purses often purchased from consignment shops, Hankins said. Her edgy style prompted some in their circle of friends to call Schueler the “Beyonce of Cincinnati,” Hankins said.\n \n\n   \n  “She was very much outgoing,” said Hankins, a transgender woman who befriended Schueler in the 1990s when they were living in the same neighborhood.\n \n\n   \n  But the light Schueler brought to others— along with her fun, selfless and caring spirit— darkened when she was  shot and killed on June 7  in Cincinnati, Hankins said. Schueler was 47. A 19-year-old man was arrested on July 11 in connection with her death and charged with murder, felonious assault, among other charges, court records show.\n \n\n   \n  Hankins said Schueler was confident and secure with herself, which inspired many others in the transgender community. She cared deeply about her family, including her nieces and nephews, Hankins said.\n \n\n   \n  “She was not a taker,” Hankins said. “She was more of a giver. If you were hungry, she would give you money or take you to get something to eat. And she would give you the clothes off her back.”\n \n\n   \n  Hankins said she believes Schueler was targeted because she was a transgender woman and her death was a hate crime.\n \n\n   \n  “She had a lot of love to give, and we still had stuff to do,” Hankins said. “My heart is empty.”\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Nicquel Terry Ellis \n \n\n   \n    Dream Johnson, whose animated personality was made for reality TV\n \n\n   \n  When she began her transition three years ago, Iris Terrell’s daughter chose a new name for herself, one that her mother said fit her perfectly: Dream.\n \n\n   \n  “Dream wanted to be a superstar one day,” said Terrell.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson thought her big, confident personality would be perfect for a reality show and wanted to be on TV, Terrell said.\n \n\n   \n  “She had a beautiful soul and would always, always keep you laughing,” her mother said. “She was the life of the party.”\n \n\n   \n  Johnson’s aunt, Vanna Terrell, said her niece’s desire to be in the spotlight even extended to their holiday gatherings.\n \n\n   \n  “We would say we’re going to color coordinate, and Dream would go outside the box and wear something totally different,” Vanna laughs. “We would have a family function, and she would dress like Diana Ross.”\n \n\n   \n  Johnson’s mother and aunt say the family supported her transition and credit Dream’s closest friends for helping her find her own new style.\n \n\n   \n  “They were pushing her to come out of her shell – to be whoever she wanted to be,” Vanna Terrell said.\n \n\n   \n  “I know for a fact that her friends are definitely going through the hardest time now because they stayed together,” she adds.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson’s life was cut short in July at the age of 28 when she was shot four times on a sidewalk in her hometown of Washington, DC, in a residential neighborhood about two miles from the US Capitol.\n \n\n   \n  According to a court document, witnesses say Dream got into an argument with a group of strangers mocking her and calling her “a boy” and a slur used to attack the LGBTQ community.\n \n\n   \n  Although surveillance footage showed Johnson never physically attacked anyone, according to police, a member of the group allegedly pulled out a handgun and shot her to death. She was unarmed,  prosecutors say .\n \n\n   \n  The suspect is charged with first-degree murder, and the case is classified as a gender identity hate crime.\n \n\n   \n  Although the allegation that Dream was targeted for being transgender is painful to her family, they also feel it is important that the reality of the crime be recognized.\n \n\n   \n  “We were pushing for that. We wanted the hate crime (charge),” Vanna said. “We needed the world to know that this is still out here.”\n \n\n   \n  That kind of hate was something Johnson never had to worry about at home.\n \n\n   \n  “I told her she was kind. She was beautiful,” said Johnson’s mother. “Can’t no one change you from being you, and don’t let no one change you.”\n \n\n   \n  Iris Terrell keeps Johnson’s positive spirit even through the sadness surrounding her death, but said the holidays will be hard this year.\n \n\n   \n  But despite her family’s tragedy, Iris Terrell only has   happy memories of her daughter and the person she became.\n \n\n   \n  “It was one thing that I loved about her – that she was herself.”\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Andy Rose \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/politics/dick-cheney-funeral-washington","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"13:55:00-05:00","title":"Bush, Biden and former vice presidents honor Dick Cheney, while Trump, Vance snubbed for funeral invitation","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The funeral of former Vice President Dick Cheney, held at the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C., was attended by bipartisan political leaders including former Presidents George W.

Vance said Thursday that the former vice president was “a guy who served his country,” and wished his family “all the best in this moment of grieving.” Trump has not publicly expressed his condolences or commented on Cheney’s death.\n \n\n   \n  Cheney received full military honors at the invitation-only memorial service at Washington’s National Cathedral. Former Presidents Joe Biden and George W. Bush and former first ladies Jill Biden and Laura Bush attended as well as former Vice Presidents Kamala Harris, Mike Pence, Al Gore and Dan Quayle.\n \n\n   \n  Bush eulogized his former vice president as a consummate public servant who could be relied on, and who “lifted the standards” of those around him.\n \n\n   \n  “His abilities were self-evident, without need of calculation or self-promotion,” Bush said. “His talent and restraint exceeded his ego.”\n \n\n   \n  The former president recalled that Cheney was initially tapped to help him find a running mate during his 2000 presidential run. But after going over the list of names, Bush said he came to realize that Cheney himself was the best man for the job.\n \n\n   \n  The former president said Cheney rattled off a list of reasons why he should not serve as his running mate when Bush approached him with the idea.\n \n\n   \n  “I told him that, at such a moment, most in his position would have jumped at the chance, but Dick stayed detached and he analyzed it before I made my decision,” Bush said. “He insisted on giving me a complete rundown of all of the reasons I should not choose him.”\n \n\n   \n  Cheney would go on to serve two terms with Bush, becoming one of the most influential and powerful vice presidents in modern history.\n \n\n   \n  Also in attendance at the memorial service were a number of Supreme Court Justices, including Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Elena Kagan. A large number of past and present Cabinet members from both Republican and Democratic administrations were also expected, as well as congressional leaders from both sides of the aisle.\n \n\n   \n  Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi was present along with Senate Majority Leader John Thune and former leader Mitch McConnell.\n \n\n   \n  Cheney, who served as Bush’s vice president from 2001 to 2009, died on November 3 at the age of 84. Prior to being elected vice president, Cheney served as defense secretary, White House chief of staff and as a congressman representing Wyoming.\n \n\n   \n  He was further remembered for his progressive stance on several social issues, including gay marriage, but his role as the architect of the Iraq War saw him leave office  deeply unpopular  and cemented a polarizing legacy.\n \n\n   \n  Pete Williams, who worked as Pentagon press secretary during Cheney’s time as defense secretary, recalled offering to resign from his position after a magazine outed him as gay in 1991.\n \n\n   \n  “He wouldn’t hear of it, and for several days after that article appeared, he would call me on the direct line to my desk at the Pentagon to ask how I was doing and to tell me to get on with the job,” Williams said.\n \n\n   \n  While official Washington funerals usually include invites to the White House, excluding Trump should not be a surprise.\n \n\n   \n  Cheney was a lifetime hardline conservative who endorsed Trump’s 2016 campaign. But he spent the last years of his life speaking out against Trump, particularly after his daughter then-Rep. Liz Cheney drew the president’s ire for her prominent role in a congressional committee investigating the January 6, 2021,  insurrection at the Capitol .\n \n\n   \n  Liz Cheney made a reference to her father’s decision to support Harris over Trump last year. “For him,” she said, “a choice between defense of the Constitution and defense of your political party was no choice at all.”\n \n\n   \n  The funeral’s guest list itself was also a nod to a time when Washington was not so polarized and politicians from both sides of the aisle paid their respects when a dignitary passed away.\n \n\n   \n  In 2022, Cheney  described Trump as a coward  and said no one was a “greater threat to our republic.”\n \n\n   \n  Pence, who similarly broke with Trump over the president’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election, said that Cheney gave him two pieces of advice shortly after Pence was elected vice president in 2016. He urged Pence to spend “a lot of time on Capitol Hill” and to receive the president’s daily brief first thing in the morning, before attending any meeting with the president, in order to be better prepared for what would be discussed.\n \n\n   \n  “It was a way that he said, ‘You will be better equipped to be able to advise the president if you know in advance what’s coming and can run that through the filter of the president’s priorities,’” Pence told CNN’s Jeff Zeleny before the funeral.\n \n\n   \n  The White House offered a muted reaction after Cheney’s death with press secretary Karoline Leavitt telling reporters that Trump was “aware” the former vice president had died and noting that flags had been lowered to half-staff.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the White House for comment on Trump not being invited to the funeral, which  Axios  was first to report.\n \n\n   \n  Honorary pallbearers at Cheney’s funeral included members of his Secret Service detail; his former chiefs of staff, David Addington and Scooter Libby; and photographer David Hume Kennerly.\n \n\n   \n  On one of the last pages of the service leaflet was a quote from the writer and naturalist John Muir, saying: “The mountains are calling and I must go.”\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/middleeast/israel-west-bank-war-crimes-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"12:43:00-05:00","title":"Israel’s Forced Expulsion of Palestinians from West Bank Refugee Camps Amounts to War Crimes, HRW Alleges","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Human Rights Watch alleges that Israel's military operations in the West Bank refugee camps of Jenin, Tulkarem, and Nur Shams in January and February 2025—resulting in the forced expulsion of approximately 32,000 Palestinians—constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity.

\n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:43 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Israel’s forced removal of tens of thousands of Palestinians from refugee camps in the  occupied West Bank  earlier this year amounts to war crimes and crimes against humanity, Human Rights Watch (HRW) has alleged.\n \n\n   \n  According to a 105-page report released by the non-profit organization, 32,000 Palestinians were expelled by Israeli forces from three camps in January and February, while international attention was focused on  Israel’s war in Gaza , and they have not been allowed to return.\n \n\n   \n  As part of its research, HRW said it interviewed 31 displaced Palestinian refugees from Jenin, Tulkarem and Nur Shams refugee camps. The organization also analyzed satellite imagery and Israeli military demolition orders, as well as verified video and images of Israeli military operations.\n \n\n   \n  In response to the report, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told CNN in a statement that the military launched what it called Operation “Iron Wall” in the three camps ten months ago “in light of the security threats posed by these camps and the growing presence of terrorist elements within them.”\n \n\n   \n  The IDF said it destroyed “rows of buildings” to create “new access routes inside the camps.” The military said the decision to demolish the buildings “was made based on operational necessity, with careful consideration and only after alternative options to achieve the same military advantage were examined.”\n \n\n   \n  The IDF said the “demolitions were conducted lawfully, based on military necessity and with the required proportionality” and that “terrorism in Judea and Samaria has decreased by 70%” since the start of the operation, using the biblical term for the West Bank.\n \n\n   \n  The HRW report claims that Israel stormed Jenin refugee camp on January 21, with Apache helicopters, drones, bulldozers, and armored vehicles carrying ground forces, to oust the Palestinians living there.\n \n\n   \n  Similar operations were carried out at Tulkaram on January 27, and Nur Shams on February 9.\n \n\n   \n  Israeli soldiers “were yelling and throwing things everywhere…. It was like a movie scene – some had masks and they were carrying all kinds of weapons,” one 54-year-old woman told HRW.\n \n\n   \n  The displaced Palestinians have not been permitted to return home, the report found, adding that Israeli soldiers fired upon those who did attempt to re-enter. Only a few have been allowed to collect their belongings, it said, while HRW analysis of satellite imagery six months on found that more than 850 homes and other buildings had been damaged or destroyed across the camps.\n \n\n   \n  No shelter or humanitarian assistance was offered to displaced residents by the Israeli military, the report found. Instead, people were left to fend for themselves, seeking shelter wherever they could, including crowding into the homes of relatives or friends, or arriving at mosques or local charities.\n \n\n   \n  All three camps date back to the early 1950s, when they were established by the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) to house Palestinians who were expelled from their homes or forced to flee following Israel’s creation in 1948. Those refugees and their descendants had resided there ever since.\n \n\n   \n  “Israeli authorities in early 2025 forcibly removed 32,000 Palestinians from their homes in West Bank refugee camps without regard to international legal protections and have not permitted them to return,” Nadia Hardman, a senior migrant rights researcher at HRW, said.\n \n\n   \n  “With global attention focused on Gaza, Israeli forces have carried out war crimes, crimes against humanity, and ethnic cleansing in the West Bank that should be investigated and prosecuted.”\n \n\n   \n  Since the Hamas-led attacks of October 7, 2023, the Israeli military has intensified operations across the West Bank, targeting Palestinian militant cells, imposing checkpoints, and cutting communities off from the outside world.\n \n\n   \n  There has also been an escalation in Israeli settler attacks and land grabs in the territory. Israeli settlements in the West Bank are considered illegal under international law.\n \n\n   \n  HRW is now calling for senior Israeli officials to be investigated over the expulsions, including Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu , Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, and Maj. Gen. Avi Bluth, the Central Command commander who oversaw West Bank military operations.\n \n\n   \n  Where found responsible, they should be prosecuted for war crimes and crimes against humanity, the organization said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/sport/football-nfl-week-12-five-things","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"12:43:00.000-05:00","title":"Shedeur starts, the Chiefs need a win and the Bengals can’t catch a break: 5 things to know about NFL Week 12","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Week 12 of the 2025 NFL season brings high-stakes matchups and key team struggles.

12:43 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Week 12 of the  NFL  season brings about a big game for Patrick Mahomes and Co., injury intrigue and a sneakily important  Monday Night Football  game.\n \n\n   \n  From Shedeur Sanders starting for the Cleveland Browns to the Cincinnati Bengals never seeming to catch a break, here are five things to know about Week 12.\n \n\n   \n    Rodgers’ wrist clouds Steelers’ week\n \n\n   \n  Pittsburgh Steelers fans can breathe – at least a little. Head coach Mike Tomlin said Tuesday that Aaron Rodgers will not need surgery on the fracture in his left, non-throwing wrist. Whether he actually plays Sunday in Chicago? Still a coin flip.\n \n\n   \n  The 41-year-old’s practice status on Friday will likely decide everything. Rodgers said his ability to protect himself is going to be the deciding factor, not pain management.\n \n\n   \n  And make no mistake: Rodgers would love nothing more than another crack at the Bears. During his Packers days, he saw them twice a year and went 24-5 against Chicago, famously telling fans – multiple times – that he “owns” the Bears.\n \n\n   \n  If Rodgers can’t go, Mason Rudolph is expected to step in.\n \n\n   \n    Bengals defense reaches historic lows\n \n\n   \n   Joe Burrow  could return on Thanksgiving night against the Baltimore Ravens – but the Bengals may already be out of runway.\n \n\n   \n  At 3-7, Cincinnati can’t afford another slip if it wants any shot at the postseason. The defense, in particular, has put them in a historic hole. The Bengals have allowed 27 or more points in each of the last nine games, becoming the first team in NFL history to do so.\n \n\n   \n  Now, they get a New England Patriots team that’s quietly rolling. Rookie quarterback Drake Maye leads the NFL with 2,836 passing yards, and here’s the wild part: He hasn’t had a single 300-yard game. No explosions – just relentless, efficient production every week.\n \n\n   \n  The Patriots are 9-2 and suddenly staring at a possible No. 1 seed if they keep stacking wins.\n \n\n   \n    Chiefs-Colts: A season-defining test\n \n\n   \n  The AFC’s game of the week features the 5-5 Chiefs hosting the 8-2 Indianapolis Colts, and nothing about Kansas City’s season has gone the way anyone expected.\n \n\n   \n  A year after going 11-0 in one-score games, the Chiefs are 0-5 in those same situations this season. The late-game Mahomes magic just hasn’t shown up. The three-time Super Bowl winner has bluntly put the blame on himself: “We haven’t been consistent enough to win games. It starts with me.”\n \n\n   \n  Since becoming the Chiefs’ starter, Mahomes has never failed to reach at least the AFC Championship Game. A loss on Sunday would drop Kansas City to 5-6, and the margin for error the rest of the way becomes razor-thin.\n \n\n   \n    Another week, another Browns QB\n \n\n   \n  The more things change, the more they stay the same: A new QB is going to be under center in Cleveland. The Browns are turning to rookie Shedeur Sanders on Sunday in Las Vegas, making him the 42nd starting quarterback the franchise has used since returning in 1999 – a staggering reminder of the instability that has defined the position in Cleveland for over 25 years.\n \n\n   \n  Sanders was thrown into the fire last week against the Ravens after Dillon Gabriel exited with a concussion, and the results were rough. The rookie finished just 4-of-16 for 47 yards and an interception, struggling to find any rhythm against a tough Baltimor defense.\n \n\n   \n  Now, he gets his first full start – and his first real opportunity to rewrite the narrative.\n \n\n   \n  For Sanders, it’s a chance to show the Raiders, and every team that passed on him in the draft (which is all other 31 franchises considering he was selected with the 155th pick in the 4th round), that they misjudged him. For the Browns, it’s yet another hope that maybe this time they’ve found a spark.\n \n\n   \n    Niners-Panthers take the MNF stage\n \n\n   \n  Monday Night Football brings a sneaky-important NFC matchup: the 7-4 San Francisco 49ers hosting the 6-5 Carolina Panthers.\n \n\n   \n  Brock Purdy returned from his toe injury last week and hardly missed a beat, throwing 19-of-26 for 200 yards and three touchdowns in a 41-22 win over Arizona. With the NFC wild card picture tightening, this one carries real postseason weight.\n \n\n   \n  San Francisco’s path is tougher – the NFC West has been the best division in football with the Los Angeles Rams (8-2), Seattle Seahawks (7-3), and Niners (7-4) all above water.\n \n\n   \n  The Panthers are coming off a huge overtime win in Atlanta that saw Bryce Young throw for a career-high 448 yards. He could be in for another big game as the Niners’ banged up secondary gives up the  fifth-most passing yards per game  in the league.\n \n\n   \n  And here’s your weird stat of the week: the Panthers are 6-0 when winning the coin toss and 0-5 when losing it. So, we may know how this one goes before the ball ever leaves the tee.\n \n\n   \n    Full NFL Week 12 schedule\n \n\n   \n   Away @ home \n \n\n   \n   Thursday \n \n\n   \n  Buffalo Bills @ Houston Texans, 8:15 p.m. ET\n \n\n   \n   Sunday \n \n\n   \n  Indianapolis Colts @ Kansas City Chiefs, 1 p.m. ET\n \n\n   \n  Seattle Seahawks @ Tennessee Titans, 1 p.m. ET\n \n\n   \n  Minnesota Vikings @ Green Bay Packers, 1 p.m. ET\n \n\n   \n  New York Jets @ Baltimore Ravens, 1 p.m. ET\n \n\n   \n  New York Giants @ Detroit Lions, 1 p.m. ET\n \n\n   \n  Pittsburgh Steelers @ Chicago Bears, 1 p.m. ET\n \n\n   \n  New England Patriots @ Cincinnati Bengals, 1 p.m. ET\n \n\n   \n  Cleveland Browns @ Las Vegas Raiders, 4:05 p.m. ET\n \n\n   \n  Jacksonville Jaguras @ Arizona Cardinals, 4:05 p.m. ET\n \n\n   \n  Philadelphia Eagles @ Dallas Cowboys, 4:25 p.m. ET\n \n\n   \n  Atlanta Falcons @ New Orleans Saints, 4:25 p.m. ET\n \n\n   \n  Tampa Bay Buccaneers @ Los Angeles Rams, 8:20 p.m. ET\n \n\n   \n   Monday \n \n\n   \n  Carolina Panthers @ San Francisco 49ers, 8:15 p.m. ET\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/entertainment/hunger-games-sunrise-first-look","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"12:43:00.000Z","title":"Our first look at ‘The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping’ is already a wild ride","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The teaser trailer for 'The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping' has been released, marking the beginning of the film’s promotional campaign.

If what you report on your return doesn’t match what appears on the 1099-DA form sent to the IRS, its  Automated Underreporter  system may flag the discrepancy and send you a notice to correct the mismatch, said Shehan Chandrasekera,   head of tax strategy at  CoinTracker , a provider of crypto tracking technology.\n \n\n   \n  But there is something in it for you, too.\n \n\n   \n  “The 1099, while it increases compliance, also makes life a lot easier for those who need to report on their investments,” said Tomer Siegal, vice president of product at Ledgible, a crypto tax software provider.\n \n\n   \n    What will not be on your 1099-DA\n \n\n   \n  There are, however, some important exceptions of certain crypto transactions that  do not  have to be   reported on the 1099-DA, but which you will still need to report on your 2025 tax return next year.\n \n\n   \n   Cost basis:  For 2025, centralized exchanges are only required to report the gross proceeds of your crypto sales on the 1099-DA,  not  the cost basis, Chandrasekera said.\n \n\n   \n  The cost basis is what you will need to calculate to determine what your capital gains and losses are.\n \n\n   \n  Starting in 2026, however, exchanges will have to start reporting cost basis. But only for securities purchased on or after January 1, 2026 and only if the purchase and subsequent sale took place on the same exchange, and the asset was held by the exchange the whole time﻿, Siegal said. “No transfers can occur.”\n \n\n   \n  If you do get a 1099-DA with gross proceeds, given that it’s the inaugural year of the reporting requirement, “check that (your crypto exchange) reported it correctly,” Siegal said.\n \n\n   \n   Stablecoin, NFTs and wrapped tokens:  Centralized exchanges issuing 1099-DAs do not have to report any qualified stablecoin sales you made under $10,000, nor any sale of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) below $600, nor transactions involving the transfers of wrapped tokens (which allow for easy use of one form of crypto — eg, bitcoin — on a decentralized platform that is based on another form — eg, Ethereum), Chandrasekera said.\n \n\n   \n  You, however, are still obligated to report them on your tax return.\n \n\n   \n   Crypto ETFs:  Siegal noted that if you sold shares in an SEC-regulated bitcoin or ethereum exchange-traded fund this year, those transactions will be subject to third-party reporting. But they will appear on a  Form 1099-B  – the same form used for any of your sales through a broker involving stocks, bonds or derivatives.\n \n\n   \n    Crypto assets on defi exchanges are not subject to third-party reporting\n \n\n   \n  If you engaged in transactions this year over decentralized exchanges – which allow for peer-to-peer trading of crypto and you, not the platform itself, maintains possession of your holdings – you will not get a 1099-DA from those platforms. What’s more, a requirement that they begin issuing those forms in 2027 was repealed earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  Nevertheless, you are still obligated to report your taxable defi transactions on your tax return. \n \n\n   \n    Mind your gains and losses\n \n\n   \n  Despite the different reporting requirements for your SEC-regulated assets like stocks versus assets on a crypto exchange, the tax treatment of your capital gains and losses are the same.\n \n\n   \n  Namely, that your losses can offset your gains. And if you have more losses than gains, you also may use them as a deduction for up to $3,000 of your ordinary income in any given tax year. Any losses in excess of all that may be carried forward to apply to gains in future tax years.\n \n\n   \n  So, as an oversimplified example: If in 2025 you realized $15,000 in capital losses (meaning you sold your assets for less than you bought them) and you had $8,000 in gains, you can use $8,000 of your losses to cancel out any tax you owe on your gains plus you may use another $3,000 of your losses as a deduction on your 2025 ordinary income (eg, salary and bank interest). Plus, you still will have $4,000 in losses that may be used in future tax years.\n \n\n   \n  It’s important to know, too, that you can use your losses in one asset class (eg, stocks) to offset your gains in another (eg, crypto), Chandrasekera said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/politics/epstein-survivors-house-vote","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"11:53:00-05:00","title":"‘We have power together’: For Epstein survivors, a day of emotion and triumph","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Survivors of Jeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking ring gathered in Washington, D.C., to demand transparency and legislative action, culminating in the passage of the Epstein files bill in both the U.S. House and Senate.

Every time someone new arrived, there was an eruption of hugs and cheerful greetings.\n \n\n   \n  The scene could have easily been a joyful reunion of old friends.\n \n\n   \n  But the group was made up of the  survivors of Jeffrey Epstein , forever bonded by their trauma and abuse at the hands of the convicted pedophile. The women had once again descended on Washington, DC, to hold a press conference and plead with lawmakers to  vote to release the Epstein files .\n \n\n   \n  Dani Bensky, who met Epstein when she was a young ballerina, said she had managed to get just a few hours of sleep the previous night. She had spent the evening with the family of the late Epstein victim  Virginia Giuffre , making the most out of the fact that they are rarely in the same place at the same time. It was past midnight when she realized she still hadn’t written out the remarks she would need to make at a press conference just hours later.\n \n\n   \n  “Who writes a speech at one o’clock in the morning the night before? Ai yai yai, rookie mistake on my part,” Bensky said lightheartedly after the press conference, as she quickly made her way to a meeting that was scheduled with a lawmaker. Her fellow survivors, walking alongside her, were quick to reassure her that she had done just fine.\n \n\n   \n  Throughout the day, the women stayed close together much like this — there to offer each other pep talks and reminders to drink water and eat; quietly squeezing one another’s hands; and making sure nobody got lost in the maze of hallways on Capitol Hill as they hoped for good news.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Can we give you a hug?’\n \n\n   \n  In the late morning, the women found themselves consoling Republican Rep. Nancy Mace.\n \n\n   \n  The South Carolina congresswoman walked out into the foyer of her office in the Longworth building in tears. She has been ensnared in a legal battle of her own after  accusing her ex-fiancé  of crimes including physical assault, rape and sex trafficking — allegations he strongly denies.\n \n\n   \n  “You’ve given me hope that one day I might get justice,” Mace told the Epstein survivors. “It’s very raw for me.”\n \n\n   \n  “Can we give you a hug?” one woman jumped in to ask.\n \n\n   \n  “Yes, I would love a hug,” Mace responded, which prompted several women to take turns embracing the lawmaker.\n \n\n   \n  Mace was one of only four House Republicans to support a discharge petition to force a House vote on the Epstein files. When an Epstein survivor told the congresswoman that the group had been holding their breath and hoping Mace wouldn’t cave to political pressure and abandon her support for the bill, Mace responded: “Yeah, I ran out of fucks to give a long time ago.”\n \n\n   \n  “We rarely get this chance. This moment is historic,” she said. “Women never get this chance.”\n \n\n   \n  Annie Farmer, who said she was 16 when Epstein and his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell abused her, told CNN it was impossible for her now to imagine going through this experience alone.\n \n\n   \n  “Every time a large group gathers, it completely changes the dynamic and the experience,” Farmer said. “It really does move us from feeling fearful to feeling like we are feared. We have power together.”\n \n\n   \n  Her sister, Maria, is one of the earliest known Epstein accusers. As Farmer made her way from meeting to meeting on Tuesday, more than once, she was on the phone, keeping her sister apprised of developments.\n \n\n   \n  At 2:43 p.m., the gavel came down in the House — the  Epstein bill had passed  on an overwhelming 427-1 vote.\n \n\n   \n  As soon as she stepped out of the House gallery after passage, Farmer was back on her phone, calling Maria to share the news.\n \n\n   \n  “It was just incredible to hear her voice and to be able to tell her it passed and it happened and you were such a big part of it,” Annie said.\n \n\n   \n    ‘It kills me that she’s not here’\n \n\n   \n  One Epstein victim was not present on Capitol Hill on Tuesday but her presence could be felt everywhere that the group of survivors went.\n \n\n   \n  Giuffre, one of the most prominent victims of Epstein’s sex-trafficking ring, died by suicide in August. In her  posthumously published memoir  released last month, she wrote about having been lent out to an endless stream of wealthy and powerful people. “I believed that I might die a sex slave,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  When Giuffre’s brother, Sky Roberts, spoke at the survivors’ press conference and credited his sister for having helped to advance the fight for accountability and transparency, tears streamed down the faces of Giuffre’s fellow victims standing behind Roberts.\n \n\n   \n  “Sissy,” Roberts said. “You didn’t just make a small dent. You made a monumental impact, a resounding statement that echoed across the world. You built an unbreakable wall, a barrier that will protect future generations from the horrors of abuse.”\n \n\n   \n  Bensky, who credits Giuffre for having shaped her own decision to go public with her Epstein story, said she has wondered what Giuffre would have made of this moment.\n \n\n   \n  “It kills me that she’s not here to see it,” Bensky said. “It’s so wrong that she’s just not here. It’s kind of devastating to think that we’re doing this without her.”\n \n\n   \n  Many of the other survivors wore brightly colored butterfly pins on their lapels on Tuesday in Giuffre’s memory. For Bensky and Farmer, their green and pink jeweled brooches were all the more meaningful because they were gifts given to them by Roberts.\n \n\n   \n  “Virginia chose the symbol of the butterfly because of the metamorphosis and this real belief she had that there could be post-traumatic growth — that you could go through something like this and come out the other side and have so much to give and share,” Farmer told CNN. “And that’s what she did.”\n \n\n   \n  After the passage of the House’s Epstein bill, the women gathered in the early evening to hold a vigil honoring all of Epstein’s victims, including those who have passed. It was right around when Farmer was paying tribute to Giuffre that Bensky got a whisper in her ear: The Senate had decided to pass the Epstein bill immediately.\n \n\n   \n  Many of the survivors had assumed that the bill’s path through the Senate — and to President Donald Trump’s desk — could be long and arduous and had been preparing for another major battle.\n \n\n   \n  “Words will never ever be able to describe this day,” Bensky said. “We just feel like we never have gotten the win, and we got the win. And that feels so good.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/middleeast/jets-chips-clean-slate-mbs-trump-saudi-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"12:43:00-05:00","title":"Jets, chips and a clean slate: Saudi Arabia’s crown prince got almost everything he wanted from Trump","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, secured significant political and strategic gains during a high-profile meeting with US President Donald Trump in 2025, including designation as a Major Non-NATO Ally, F-35 jet sales, a new strategic defense agreement, and an AI cooperation framework allowing advanced chip exports.

President Joe Biden had vowed to make Mohammed bin Salman a pariah. Even arms sales to one of America’s closest military partners were put under review.\n \n\n   \n  This week, the crown prince and de facto Saudi leader walked into the Oval Office to find a different world - one where President Donald Trump defended him so forcefully that he scolded a reporter for “ embarrassing our guest ” when she pressed him on the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi.\n \n\n   \n  Beyond the Oval Office theatrics, the substance of the administration’s announcements tells the real story of bin Salman’s remarkable rehabilitation in Washington. It also highlights Trump’s willingness to move past the Khashoggi episode and deepen relations with a kingdom that has pledged  nearly a trillion dollars  in US investments and maintains business ties with his own family.\n \n\n   \n  The visit also underscores the crown prince’s growing clout and his ability to skillfully navigate great power rivalries to his advantage.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps his biggest win was persuading Trump to drop the one condition Washington had long insisted on before sealing major defense and trade deals with Riyadh: Full normalization with Israel.\n \n\n   \n  The shift marks another reversal from just a year ago, when the Biden administration insisted that any comprehensive US-Saudi deal could only move forward if  all three of its components  – bilateral defense and trade agreements, Saudi normalization with Israel, and an Israeli commitment to a pathway to a Palestinian state – advanced together. But with Israel rejecting the prospect of a Palestinian state and Saudi Arabia refusing to soften its position, the framework stalled.\n \n\n   \n  Now, the Trump administration appears to have decoupled those components, handing Riyadh most of what it has long sought on defense, economics and regional security.\n \n\n   \n  This week it designated Saudi Arabia a Major Non-NATO Ally, moved forward with plans to  sell it F-35 jets  “pretty similar” to those flown by Israel, and signed a new Strategic Defense Agreement.\n \n\n   \n  In a nod to Riyadh’s singular focus to rewire its economy away from oil dependence, the two countries launched an  AI cooperation framework  which includes clearing of the sale of advanced chips to the kingdom, signed a critical minerals agreement, and opened the door to expand cooperation on nuclear energy.\n \n\n   \n  Trump also delivered on bin Salman’s regional requests as the crown prince tries to reshape the Middle East’s security landscape, agreeing to help end the civil war in Sudan\n \n\n   \n  In the Oval Office, bin Salman framed the new agreements as delivering benefits for both the US and Saudi Arabia.\n \n\n   \n  “Today is a very important time in our history,” bin Salman said in the Oval Office on Tuesday, seated beside Trump.\n \n\n   \n    What Saudi Arabia didn’t get\n \n\n   \n  While bin Salman received almost everything Saudi Arabia has been seeking from the US, there were two notable exceptions: a green light to domestically enrich uranium for future nuclear plants and a formal defense commitment.\n \n\n   \n  The US has long been reluctant to back a Saudi nuclear program that includes domestic uranium enrichment – a process that can produce bomb-grade material if purified to high levels – but CNN understands that Riyadh is reluctant to give up its right to do so, citing its substantial uranium deposits. US Energy Secretary Chris Wright told Fox News on Wednesday that the agreement doesn’t include domestic enrichment.\n \n\n   \n  Among Washington’s Arab allies, Qatar has the strongest defense relationship with the US. It hosts the biggest US airbase in the region, was declared a Major Non-NATO ally in 2022, and this year received the strongest US security commitment for any Arab state, through an executive order declaring that any armed attack on the nation would be regarded as “a  threat to the peace and security  of the United States.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN understands that Saudi Arabia is seeking at least as deep a security commitment from Washington. A senior Saudi source told CNN the kingdom wants a permanent agreement that would last beyond Trump’s presidency, a move that would ultimately require Congressional approval. But a White House statement made no mention of any obligation to defend the kingdom.\n \n\n   \n  “What (bin Salman) reportedly wants is a Senate-ratified defense commitment along the lines of a NATO Article 5 pledge,” wrote Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment think tank, referring to NATO’s mutual defense clause. “The last time Washington delivered that was 65 years ago, with the 1960 US-Japan treaty.”\n \n\n   \n  There is a case to be made for such a pact, he continued. “The United States went to war to protect Saudi and Gulf oil before, a defense pact might prove to be a deterrent to future predators, and it would lock Saudi Arabia into a pro-American alignment for years to come, boxing out our competitors Russia and especially China.”\n \n\n   \n  Over the past few years, Saudi Arabia has been signaling that it is willing to seek defense partners beyond the US should Washington not make a stronger commitment to its security. In late 2023, bin Salman was  explicit about the threat  in an interview with Fox News, saying the US doesn’t “want to see Saudi Arabia shifting their armament from America to another place.”\n \n\n   \n  In recent years, Riyadh has been gradually  improving its ties with Beijing , culminating in the surprise rapprochement  between Saudi Arabia and Iran  in the Chinese capital in March 2023. The message has been that the US is Riyadh’s  first port of call , but there are others too.\n \n\n   \n  And earlier this year, bin Salman followed through on his quest to diversify security partners, securing protection from Riyadh’s closest Muslim ally, nuclear armed Pakistan.

CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:52 AM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A  long-awaited jobs report  offered a mixed picture of the US labor market.\n \n\n   \n  The economy added 119,000 jobs in September, an unexpected rebound for the labor market — but it comes as the overall economy shows signs of slowing.\n \n\n   \n  Economists were expecting 50,000 jobs to have been added and an unemployment rate that remained at 4.3%, according to FactSet.\n \n\n   \n  Delayed for seven weeks due to the government shutdown, the latest snapshot of America’s job market showed that unemployment rose in September to the highest level in nearly four years.\n \n\n   \n  In addition, August’s tepid job gains of 22,000 were revised to a job loss of 4,000 jobs and July was revised down by 7,000 jobs, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data released Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  The health care and social assistance sector continued to drive overall employment growth. Those sectors added an estimated 57,100 jobs in September, accounting for nearly half of the overall gains. Leisure and hospitality contributed 47,000 jobs during a month with unseasonably warm weather.\n \n\n   \n  Jobs were lost in sectors such as transportation and warehousing (-25,300), temporary help services (-15,900) and manufacturing (-6,000).\n \n\n   \n  Although the September employment data has been on the shelf since early October,  it provides a critical snapshot  of the labor market at a time when tariffs, stubborn inflation and elevated interest rates continue to slow the US economy.\n \n\n   \n    Summer of job losses\n \n\n   \n  Plus, Thursday’s report might very well be the last clean jobs report for a couple of months, since the  shutdown mucked up the finely tuned process of data collection and analysis during October  and part of November. The BLS on Wednesday announced that there will not be a separate October jobs report published but instead some of that data will be included in the November report scheduled for December 16.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the stronger-than-expected September gains, this year is still on pace for the weakest employment growth since the pandemic and, before that, the Great Financial Crisis.\n \n\n   \n  “The job market was really weak in the summer, and it didn’t improve much in September,” said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Credit Union. “What we learned today is that both June and August had negative job growth, so, shedding jobs; 119,000 is pretty good for September, but when you step back, the average (monthly job gain) of the past four months is in the low 40,000s.”\n \n\n   \n  “So, it looks very weak,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  Unemployment, a closely watched recession indicator, ticked higher in September, rising to the highest rate since October 2021.\n \n\n   \n  However, driving the jobless rate higher was an increase in the labor force – primarily an uplift in more people looking for work, versus a sharp increase in layoffs, BLS data shows.\n \n\n   \n    Low-fire, low-hire, low-opportunity market\n \n\n   \n  The job gains remain heavily concentrated. Two sectors – health care and social assistance, and leisure and hospitality – accounted for 87% of September’s job growth.\n \n\n   \n  But in a labor market that’s been in a low-hire, low-fire slog, there are also few opportunities for those seeking work. On average, it’s taking people six months to find work, according to the latest BLS data.\n \n\n   \n  The latest unemployment claims data supports that trend: In a separate report on Thursday, the Labor Department reported that an estimated 1.974 million people filed continuing claims for unemployment insurance for the week ended November 8, hitting a fresh four-year high.\n \n\n   \n  Initial claims, which are considered the best proxy for layoff activity, fell to 220,000 last week, remaining well below more concerning thresholds (300,000 to 400,000 range, consistently).\n \n\n   \n  “If I had to characterize it, it still looks a lot like ‘no-hire, no-fire,’” Long said. “I do worry, given the number of industries that are starting to fire, that this is starting to look like ‘no-hire, start-to-fire.’”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Cold water’ for a Fed cut\n \n\n   \n  Despite the mixed bag of data, the September report “could throw cold water” on the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates further when it meets in December, Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide, wrote in a note on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “The sharp rebound in employment gains, up 119,000 in September following the downwardly revised negative 4,000 print in August soothes concerns that the labor market was on the precipice of a large downturn and removes urgency for another rate cut,” she wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Still, because of the historic government shutdown, the September jobs report will be the freshest official monthly employment snapshot available when the Fed makes its next interest rate decision on December 10. The partial October and full November data won’t come out until the following week.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/world/ukraine-russia-war-crimes-bucha-hnk-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"10:44:00.000-05:00","title":"Ukraine Identifies Russian Commander Accused of Mass Murder in Bucha","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ukraine has formally identified Yurii Vladimirovich Kim, a commander in Russia’s 76th Air Assault Division, as accused of orchestrating systematic war crimes in Bucha, Ukraine, between March 7 and April 1, 2022.

November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: Reuters\n \n   \n  A Nigerian court on Thursday convicted separatist leader Nnamdi Kanu on all seven terrorism-related charges at the end of a decade-long trial that has inflamed tensions in the country’s southeast.\n \n\n   \n  Judge James Omotosho said prosecutors, who have called for Kanu to be sentenced to death, proved that his broadcasts and orders to his now banned Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) group incited deadly attacks on security forces and citizens.\n \n\n   \n  The violence was part of his push for an independent Biafra state for the ethnic Igbo-dominated region which attempted to secede as the Republic of Biafra in 1967, triggering a three-year civil war that killed more than 1 million people.\n \n\n   \n  “His intention was quite clear as he believed in violence. These threats of violence were nothing but terrorist acts, which were duly carried out by his followers,” Omotosho said.\n \n\n   \n  Security was tight around the Abuja court amid fears of protests and violence. Analysts warn that the conviction could stoke separatist sentiment and complicate efforts to restore calm in the region, where authorities blame IPOB for a wave of deadly attacks.\n \n\n   \n  Kanu, who has been in custody since his controversial re-arrest in Kenya in 2021, shouted angrily in objection to the proceedings and was kicked out of court ahead of the ruling. He had argued that his unlawful extradition from Kenya undermined any chance of a fair trial.\n \n\n   \n  Thursday’s judgment followed months of legal drama that included four different judges. The government closed its case after calling five witnesses, but Kanu refused to open his defense, arguing that Nigeria’s terrorism law had been repealed and that the charges were invalid.\n \n\n   \n  His  no-case submission  was dismissed in September after sacking his legal team in open court, and the judge gave him multiple opportunities to  present a defence .\n \n\n   \n  Earlier in November, Omotosho ruled that Kanu had  squandered  a six-day window allotted for his defense and the court had no option but to close the case.\n \n\n   \n  Kanu, a dual Nigerian-British citizen, first faced charges in 2015 and briefly secured bail in 2017 before fleeing the country.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/us/transgender-ideology-gender-cec","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"11:52:00-05:00","title":"The White House wants to eliminate ‘gender ideology’ and ‘trans ideology.’ What does that mean?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the growing political campaign across the U.S. and globally to eliminate 'gender ideology' and 'transgender ideology,' driven by conservative leaders including President Donald Trump and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.

It was the newest escalation in a running conflict that began when a student in a summer course on children’s literature recorded video of herself accusing her professor of going “against our president’s laws” by teaching “gender ideology” and declared that she was reporting the purported violation to the administration.\n \n\n   \n  Texas Republican politicians seized on the video as a scandal, with one state representative calling it “TRANSGENDER INDOCTRINATION.” The Trump administration joined in, with Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Harmeet Dhillon calling it  “deeply concerning”  and declaring she would look into it. Within days, the professor had been  fired , students led academic freedom  protests , and the president of the system’s flagship university  resigned  for reasons unspecified — all in the wake of a controversy about whether a class about children’s literature could legally discuss a children’s book about a 12-year-old coming out as nonbinary.\n \n\n   \n  In the past year, the terms “gender ideology” and its sibling, “transgender ideology,” have become ubiquitous — in government documents and policy announcements, in mass media and in online disputes. The White House has declared its intention to stamp them out. Yet what do they mean, exactly?\n \n\n   \n    Donald Trump demands ‘biological truth’\n \n\n   \n  In 2016, North Carolina passed the law HB2, colloquially known as the “Bathroom Bill,” banning people from using public restrooms that did not correspond with the sex listed on their birth certificates. The backlash was immediate: advocates nationwide sprang into action against it, the general public was appalled, the state lost  millions of dollars  in business and the NCAA pulled its high-profile sporting events. One year later, the bill was repealed.\n \n\n   \n  Yet less than a decade later, restrictions on transgender people have taken hold of state and national policy. While HB2 was viewed by some as a blatant form of transgender discrimination, similar mandates are being imposed and upheld by every level of government today.\n \n\n   \n  On President Donald Trump’s first day in office this year, he signed an executive order titled “Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government.” In it, he ordered the federal government to replace the term “gender” with “sex” throughout its policies and documents and declared that “sex” referred to “an individual’s immutable biological classification as either male or female.”\n \n\n   \n  “Gender ideology includes the idea that there is a vast spectrum of genders that are disconnected from one’s sex,” the  executive order read . “Gender ideology is internally inconsistent, in that it diminishes sex as an identifiable or useful category but nevertheless maintains that it is possible for a person to be born in the wrong sexed body.”\n \n\n   \n  Zaya Perysian, however, said Trump’s order brought a new and dangerous inconsistency to her life. Under the new White House rules, Perysian, a content creator who has documented her transition online, was issued a passport that identifies her as male, the sex she was assigned at birth. This left Perysian — with her chest-length curls and low-cut clothes, after more than five years on estrogen and both top and bottom surgery — holding a government ID that didn’t match her other legal documents. All the passport does, she said, is put her at risk.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re 1% of the population and 90% of the conversation,” Perysian said. “It’s just so ridiculous. We’re always being forced to defend ourselves against complete nonsense and complete propaganda.”\n \n\n   \n    Finding ideology everywhere\n \n\n   \n  The term “gender ideology” didn’t originate in the US. The phrase has been part of a larger  anti-gender movement  taking shape across the world — first in Europe in the 2010s and now in Latin America, Africa and the US — particularly among conservative governments, religious groups and civil society groups, according to  a United Nations report . In 2018, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro centered  his right-wing election campaign against  “gender ideology.” Brazil is one of the  deadliest countries  for transgender people.\n \n\n   \n  The worldwide movement against “gender ideology” views the use of the term “gender” in classifying people’s social identities as a way to “destroy the traditional family and family values,” the UN report states. Indeed, much of the opposition is framed as a religious, moral choice: When Bolsonaro visited the White House  in 2019 , he decried “gender ideology” by saying both countries share a “respect to traditional and family lifestyles, respect to God, our creator, against the gender ideology of the politically correct attitudes and fake news.”\n \n\n   \n  “Transgender ideology,” a phrase largely used in the US, is, if anything, even more amorphous. Trump, in various public remarks or executive orders, has vowed to “get  transgender ideology  the hell out of our military,” to stop child abuse by “prohibiting public schools from indoctrinating our children with  transgender ideology ,” and to undo what he called the Biden administration’s efforts to “force Christians to affirm radical  transgender ideology .” During the investigation of the killing of Charlie Kirk, law enforcement leaked a preliminary internal report to the media incorrectly claiming the shooter’s ammunition had been marked with “ transgender ideology .”\n \n\n   \n  The president and his followers now use “gender ideology” and “transgender ideology” more or less interchangeably. A scroll through social media shows both phrases cropping up in conservative and right-wing corners of the internet, largely as a shorthand for anything pertaining to transgender people. Using a transgender person’s  correct pronouns ? That’s transgender ideology. A Glamour magazine cover  celebrating transgender women ? Also transgender ideology.\n \n\n   \n  Sometimes, the content of the “ideology” isn’t even stated. Florida’s commissioner of education removed a sociology professor from a curriculum workgroup for “promoting gender ideology,” he announced on X, without ever specifying how  that ideology had actually been promoted . His replies were filled with hundreds of thank yous anyway.\n \n\n   \n    What makes trans people a unique target\n \n\n   \n  Jay W. Richards is a director at The Heritage Foundation and a contributor to the conservative policy blueprint Project 2025, who wrote about “gender ideology” back in 2023. That people can be divided into two sexes, male or female, is a matter of “biological reality,” he said — though biological research on sex distinctions has yielded  more complicated results . Richards described “gender ideology” as “toxic,” saying it causes people to misunderstand who they are. Having a subjective, internal sense of gender, he told CNN, should not constitute one’s literal identity. Those who are questioning their gender need help “to understand their bodily reality.”\n \n\n   \n  The goal, he said, is to successfully “defeat gender ideology.”\n \n\n   \n  “Say, 25 years from now, it never occurred to a child that he or she might be born in the wrong body, that to be whole, he or she needs to take body and mind-altering drugs and undergo radical surgery in order to be whole,” Richards said.\n \n\n   \n  That goal goes against the advice of major medical organizations. The American Medical Association, the American Psychiatric Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics support what they call  gender-affirming care  — a multidisciplinary approach that includes medically necessary and scientific evidence-based practices that has been shown to be  life-saving for transgender people. \n \n\n   \n  Yet more than half of US states have banned  some care for transgender youth  including puberty blockers, other hormone therapy, and gender-affirming surgery (although research shows such surgeries are  rarely performed on minors  in the US).\n \n\n   \n  By using “gender ideology” and “transgender ideology,” people are explicitly trying to diminish the human nature of gender identity, said Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, an infectious disease physician and former director at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n \n\n   \n  “They want it to be like, this person isn’t a transgender person, they’re an ideologue,” he said. “These are not evidence and science-based things that they’re saying. They’re really trying to destabilize the base of science that brought us to the place where gender diversity was something that we were supporting for people’s health.”\n \n\n   \n  In most other areas of medical care, it’s a generally accepted premise that people and their doctors make decisions together. When it comes to questions like avoiding vaccination, the Trump administration encourages people to follow their subjective beliefs, even amid rampant disinformation and, in some cases, limited access. Yet the government’s program of fighting “trans ideology” means that trans people are excluded from those principles — along with everyday principles like “ call people what they want to be called ” and “don’t  fire people from their jobs  because of their personal identity.”\n \n\n   \n  The usage casts transgender and nonbinary people as having succumbed to an undefined doctrine, rather than experiencing a differing gender identity. Trans personhood isn’t an identity, these terms suggest, it’s a belief imposed on people by outside ideological forces. And those forces, those so-called ideologies, can be overturned.\n \n\n   \n  “When you make our existence into an ideology, it becomes much easier to dismiss us than it is if you approach us as people,” said Laurel Powell, communications director for the Human Rights Campaign.\n \n\n   \n    Ban gender, spread measles\n \n\n   \n  Ultimately, the language is “demonizing transgender people as a group,” said Chase Strangio, attorney and co-director of the ACLU’s LGBT & HIV Project. Using this rhetoric suggests that people’s identities are an ideological threat to a country’s national order.\n \n\n   \n  “Part of what’s happening here is, ‘Oh, the world is changing in scary ways. It’s a threat to the order,’” Strangio said. “‘Gender ideology is at the root. We’re going to root it out.’”\n \n\n   \n  The effects of this rooting out are already seen. Already, between May 2024 and May 2025, hate attacks against transgender people increased by 14% compared with the year before, according  to GLAAD data . More than half of all anti-LGBTQ incidents tracked over the year targeted transgender and gender diverse people specifically. Political rhetoric can have potentially deadly effects.  One study found  that when states pass anti-trans laws, like bans on trans-specific health care or sports participation, there’s a rise in transgender and nonbinary teens’ suicide attempts.\n \n\n   \n  The downstream effects of politicizing gender identity aren’t only harmful to transgender people.\n \n\n   \n  One of the most notable uses of this terminology was earlier this year, when an array of government health webpages were taken down in order to scrub  references to “gender ideology.”  To comply with the executive order, Daskalakis said the CDC had to pull down a 45-minute video educating providers about measles care — in the midst of a  measles outbreak in Texas  — because they uttered the phrase “gender identity” once.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a prime example of what happens when ideology is powered up beyond science and concern for the health of people,” Daskalakis said.\n \n\n   \n  When identity becomes politicized, vulnerable populations start to falter and the entire country is weakened. In the long term, Daskalakis said vulnerable populations “will experience worse health, will get sick, and some will die.”\n \n\n   \n  “The stakes are high,” he said. “There will be people who are going to further demonize and vilify people based on who they are. And we know how that goes in the US.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/politics/trump-reversal-epstein-files","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"10:44:00-05:00","title":"Trump Reverses Course on Epstein Files as Administration Faces Lingering Suspicion","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump reversed his position on the Epstein files by signing a bill that mandates their release, after months of resistance.

Epstein files as his administration faces lingering suspicion about their release \n       \n  By Adam Cancryn, Evan Perez, Kristen Holmes, Kaitlan Collins, Hannah Rabinowitz, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:44 AM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   President Donald Trump  on Wednesday sought to bring a swift end to perhaps the most damaging saga of his term,  signing a measure  compelling the release of the Epstein files after losing a monthslong, tooth-and-nail fight to prevent their disclosure.\n \n\n   \n  The decision represents a stunning reversal for the president aimed chiefly at quelling a brewing GOP revolt and restoring his iron grip over the party. But few believe the path will be so easy from here.\n \n\n   \n  “I HAVE JUST SIGNED THE BILL TO RELEASE THE EPSTEIN FILES,” Trump posted on Truth Social late in the day, framing the overwhelming votes for it in Congress as a result of his involvement.\n \n\n   \n  The measure becoming law is now set to open a fraught new stage in  the push for the files  tied to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, putting the Justice Department under fresh scrutiny and testing the White House’s ability to pivot attention away from the president’s past dealings with Epstein and toward more advantageous political ground.\n \n\n   \n  At an unrelated press conference earlier Wednesday, Attorney General Pam Bondi would only say that the Justice Department would “follow the law” when asked about the Epstein files.\n \n\n   \n  But already, officials face growing suspicion from Capitol Hill and their MAGA base that the administration will use a just-opened, Trump-ordered criminal investigation as an excuse to keep some of the Epstein case file under wraps.\n \n\n   \n  Justice officials, meanwhile, are scrambling to balance their probe with a looming December deadline for releasing the documents after being caught off-guard by both Trump’s demand for a new investigation and his subsequent sudden support Sunday evening for making all the Epstein files public, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  And even as the White House tries to accelerate past the controversy to focus on next year’s midterm elections, there remains little sign that Trump’s supporters are anywhere near ready to leave it behind.\n \n\n   \n  “This is a storyline that’s going to continue to dog the president into the second year of his presidency,” said Alex Conant, a longtime GOP operative. “The Epstein conspiracies have reached moon landing status. And we’ll never stop talking about it.”\n \n\n   \n  The relentless intrigue surrounding the Epstein files marks the rare issue that has driven a wedge between Trump and the Republican Party he’s led for the last decade, exposing a vulnerability for the White House made all the more frustrating by the fact that it’s largely the result of a series of self-inflicted wounds.\n \n\n   \n  Since it became clear that he could not suppress the files’ release, Trump has tried to reunify the GOP behind a new effort to tie Epstein directly to the Democratic Party.\n \n\n   \n  In announcing he’d signed the bill, Trump focused squarely on Democrats, writing, “Perhaps the truth about these Democrats, and their associations with Jeffrey Epstein, will soon be revealed,” and adding, “This latest Hoax will backfire on the Democrats just as all of the rest have!”\n \n\n   \n  The offensive has drawn on newly disclosed Epstein emails that mention various prominent Democrats, alongside numerous references to Trump — a development that White House officials hope will put them back on offense after months under siege. (Corresponding with Epstein would not be a crime, and there’s no evidence in the emails that any of them participated in Epstein’s wrongdoing.)\n \n\n   \n  “All of a sudden there existed a real opportunity to change the narrative,” one official told CNN, noting that aides had only limited knowledge of what was in the documents compiled by Epstein’s estate until a House committee released them last week.   \n \n\n   \n  But the strategic shift comes after months of failed gambits, dismissals and outright resistance to releasing the files — all of which has sapped precious attention and time from the administration’s core agenda.\n \n\n   \n  The president now faces some of the lowest approval ratings of his term so far, as well as the twin challenges of waging an uphill battle toward the midterms while keeping a lid on the simmering divisions over Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the president was in the right position at the end,” GOP Sen. Mike Rounds said of his support for the Epstein measure. “The rest of the story now is that they will have to deliver on that package in very short order, and then it’s going to depend upon what’s in the package and what’s been withheld.”\n \n\n   \n    Pressure for the files was a problem of Trump’s own making\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s signature on the bill — and the credit he claimed for its success — capped a public push for the files that the president himself first fueled nearly a year-and-a-half ago, after he pledged on the campaign trail to release the materials if elected.\n \n\n   \n  His team then leaned into that off-hand commitment   as a way to energize a segment of the GOP base that’s been fixated on the Epstein files and has been convinced they would implicate a range of powerful figures in the late financier’s sexual abuse of young girls.\n \n\n   \n  The administration further heightened expectations in February, when Bondi distributed “Epstein Files” binders to conservative influencers at the White House. The event was a dud; virtually all of the information was already public, sparking public backlash and opening the door to months of private tensions among top DOJ officials.\n \n\n   \n  Bondi later claimed the administration was poring over newer materials, only for the DOJ to announce months later that no “further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted.”\n \n\n   \n  The ensuing firestorm pitted the White House against many of the MAGA figures who had aided Trump’s rise, sparked a bipartisan effort on Capitol Hill to force the release of the files and prompted an internal scramble to tamp down an issue that threatened to consume the administration through much of the summer.\n \n\n   \n  That effort became more challenging in the wake of revelations that magnified Trump’s past connections to Epstein, including that the president’s name had surfaced in the files. (Trump has not been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.)\n \n\n   \n  Within the White House, aides sought to manage the expectations of their allies, trying to explain that publicizing the rest of the files risked harming victims and violating the privacy of people whose names were in the documents but not credibly accused of wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, meanwhile, repeatedly took to social media to try to browbeat Republicans in line, insisting that the files he once vowed to release were now little more than a Democratic “hoax.” Yet neither approach succeeding in quelling the calls for more disclosure.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re trying to explain to people that they’re believing in something that does not exist,” a senior White House official said. “That’s why it’s so frustrating.”\n \n\n   \n    New investigation raises fresh questions about what will be released\n \n\n   \n  At one point, as the congressional effort to compel the Epstein files’ release gained steam, officials floated launching the new DOJ investigation as a way to alleviate the pressure and block any more documents from being released, an administration official said.\n \n\n   \n  But it’s not clear whether the option made it to Trump. A White House official said the idea of an investigation into Democrats came after the emails were released by the House oversight panel last week. The Justice Department declined to comment.\n \n\n   \n  During Wednesday’s unrelated press conference, Bondi said that “new information” obtained by investigators had prompted her to reopen the Epstein matter without specifying what that was.\n \n\n   \n  So last Friday, as the House vote on releasing the files loomed, Trump abruptly called for the DOJ to probe Epstein’s connections to a handful of Democrat-aligned figures including former President Bill Clinton. He also sought an inquiry into the banking giant JPMorgan Chase’s associations with Epstein.   (Responding to the probe, spokespeople for Clinton and JPMorgan maintained they were not involved in Epstein’s crimes.)\n \n\n   \n  The White House insists Trump has always been on the side of releasing the files. “President Trump has never been against releasing the Epstein files — rather, he has always been against Republicans falling into the Democrat trap of talking about this rather than focusing on the historic tax cuts signed into law, the fact that zero illegal aliens have entered our country in five months, and the many other accomplishments of the Trump Administration on behalf of the American people,” White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  And since the opening of the new investigation, multiple White House officials have insisted to CNN that Trump will not stand in the way of the documents being released and that aides have little reason to believe the new investigation will affect that process, though Bondi declined to offer any explicit assurances on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Within the DOJ, some officials have lamented that Trump’s novel support for releasing the files amounts to a lose-lose — with Bondi and her department now facing dueling directives to both run an investigation and make public its pertinent documents.\n \n\n   \n  The White House’s belated bid now to lean into the Epstein files as a political attack line has also generated some grumbling among allies on Capitol Hill and in the broader Trump orbit who had hoped to move on from a challenging period.\n \n\n   \n  In the last two weeks, some of these allies noted, Trump oversaw an end to the record-long government shutdown, promoted the administration’s efforts on key affordability issues and hosted a series of high-profile diplomatic events.\n \n\n   \n  Yet as Trump and his aides try to turn the tables on Democrats over Epstein, “this is all anyone’s talking about,” Conant said.\n \n\n   \n  “The power of the presidency is the ability to set the agenda,” he added. “And to the extent that this is a distraction, it does undermine what else he can do.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/entertainment/kevin-spacey-home-scli-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"10:44:00-05:00","title":"Kevin Spacey Says He Has No Home After Allegations of Sexual Assault","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Kevin Spacey, the Oscar-winning actor known for 'American Beauty' and 'House of Cards', has stated he has 'no home' due to the immense financial burden of legal costs stemming from allegations of sexual assault made against him in 2017 involving minor actor Anthony Rapp. Although a New York jury and a London court cleared him of battery and sexual assault charges in 2022 and 2023 respectively, the industry has largely distanced itself from him, with key productions removing him from roles and refusing to reinstate him.

details about the capture of one of America’s most notorious serial killers \n       \n  By Faith Karimi, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:04 AM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Joseph DeAngelo   moved through California neighborhoods like a shadow.\n \n\n   \n  He stalked his victims for days, learning their routines before slipping into their homes in a mask to torture, rape and kill. At first, he preyed on women who lived alone but later expanded his attacks to include couples. He pocketed wedding rings, photos and other grim tokens from crime scenes.\n \n\n   \n  What started as burglaries and break-ins escalated into brutal attacks and murders that left entire neighborhoods too terrified to sleep. Each wave of terror in a different part of California came with a new nickname: The Visalia Ransacker. The Original Night Stalker. The East Area Rapist. And finally, the  Golden State Killer .\n \n\n   \n  DeAngelo killed at least 13 people and raped dozens more in the 1970s and 1980s. In April 2018, nearly four decades after his last known crimes, police armed with DNA evidence surrounded his house in the quiet Sacramento suburb of Citrus Heights and arrested him.\n \n\n   \n  Dressed in a T-shirt, cargo shorts and tube socks, a shocked DeAngelo offered no resistance when detectives moved in after he stepped into his yard. In a jarring contrast to the cruelty he once inflicted, the predator who’d terrorized residents in 11 counties did not fight back. But he protested in a high-pitched voice, ‘I have a roast in the oven!’”\n \n\n   \n  Once inside the cold and bare interrogation room of the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Department, he slumped into a plastic chair. Alone, he quietly stared at the fluorescent-lit walls for nearly two hours, drawing in large gulps of air.\n \n\n   \n  “He reminded me of a sloppy grandpa or an alcoholic uncle whom you avoided at Thanksgiving dinner. He did not seem … particularly menacing,” writes Thien Ho, the lead prosecutor in the case, in his new book, “ The People vs. the Golden State Killer. ” “The monsters of our imagination can look and feel very different in the bright light of reality.”\n \n\n   \n  Detectives offered DeAngelo a can of Dr Pepper – the same drink he’d left behind at several crime scenes. He didn’t touch it nor acknowledge it. Investigators believe he feared he’d leave his DNA on it – unaware that they’d already obtained it from his trash can, said Ho, now the District Attorney of Sacramento County.\n \n\n   \n  DeAngelo was convicted of multiple murders in August 2020 and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.\n \n\n   \n  Ho’s book, released this month, offers a rare look inside the investigation that brought down one of California’s most notorious killers.\n \n\n   \n  CNN talked to Ho about the new revelations in his book. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n \n\n   \n    Why do you think DeAngelo shut down in the hours after his arrest?\n \n\n   \n  He was being calculating and manipulative. When he was sitting inside that room for those two hours, I was watching the video of it, and I thought a couple times that the video kind of just froze because he’s sitting there, not moving at all. And after he was confronted with the murders and rapes, he started mumbling to himself, talking to himself, saying, “I didn’t want to do it. Jerry made me do it.”  He was trying to present this mental defense of a split personality … where he was blaming Jerry for taking over and kind of forcing him to do these things.\n \n\n   \n  He didn’t realize that his mental defense didn’t work, because this isn’t the first time he tried it. In 1979, when he was arrested for shoplifting dog repellent and a hammer, he was caught by store security, and he was acting like he was crazy, mumbling to himself, saying crazy things. And when the police came, he admitted he was pretending to be crazy, hoping that security wouldn’t call them. He has used this technique of pretending to be crazy, so we knew it was fake.\n \n\n   \n    At the beginning of his crime spree, he was a police officer, even working on task forces hunting him. Did that help him evade capture?\n \n\n   \n  It did. The first series of crimes, he was the Visalia Ransacker from 1974 to 1975. There were 120 burglaries in a three-mile square radius. It turned out he was a police officer in a nearby town, and he was on the task force to find the Visalia Ransacker, and he was the ransacker. He left Visalia in central California and moved up to Sacramento, where he started committing rapes there. As a police officer, he knew how everything operated, how long it took to respond to the scene, where they would set up their blockades and how to get around that. He used his expert knowledge as a police officer to commit his crimes, find his victims and then escape.\n \n\n   \n    What drove his escalation from voyeurism and burglary to rape and murder?\n \n\n   \n  It was that insatiable appetite for power.\n \n\n   \n  When we caught him, I tried to recreate every aspect of his life, from when he was born in Bath, New York, all the way to his arrest. We found out that in his personal life, he felt … like he didn’t have control or power. For example, when he was a young boy, he witnessed his little sister, who was 8 or 9 at the time, get raped by two military service members, and he was held down and had to watch that. His parents constantly beat him.\n \n\n   \n  And … many of the victims talked about how small his penis was. So when we arrested him, … we did a search warrant to take pictures of his penis, and it was micropenis. He felt very small and powerless all his life.\n \n\n   \n  And when he became a police officer, it was his way of exerting control and power over other people. When he went in and raped and tied up people, he was drinking their beer, eating their food in their home, violating their marriage. He would take one earring and leave the other behind. He would take the wedding band. And when he would bludgeon them to death … he was playing God over their lives. He had power and control over their lives, because he didn’t have any in his life.\n \n\n   \n    Some of the survivors made their voices heard in court. How did you track them down decades later and prepare them to testify?\n \n\n   \n  After he was caught, we (victim advocates, law enforcement and prosecutors) started reaching out to people and telling them what’s going on. Some people reached out to us when they saw it on the news. We found people across the country … we went to the Midwest and different parts of the country to interview people.\n \n\n   \n  We tried to make everything victim-centered – we connected the survivors with counseling services, sat down with them and went over their testimony and prior statements, talked to them about what court’s like and gave them a tour of the courtroom before trial. We prepared them as best as we could to go through that process.\n \n\n   \n    Your book focuses more on the survivors and law enforcement officials than on the killer himself. What was the reasoning behind that approach?\n \n\n   \n  A lot of times, true crime books focus on the criminal and the crimes. But here, I wanted to focus on the law enforcement officers that never gave up the search for him, and on the victims.  There’s an amazing moment in the case that I’ll never forget and sort of led me to that … in a criminal case, the victims get to read their impact statement. And one of them was Jane Carson, who retired from the military as a colonel. She wrote her own book on being raped by him.\n \n\n   \n  During the impact statement, she says, ‘I’ve brought somebody here with me today that was also a victim, and her name is Bonnie.’ And Bonnie comes up. And Bonnie was actually engaged to DeAngelo about 40 years ago but had broken up with him.\n \n\n   \n  And the Golden State Killer is all about control, and so here was Bonnie, who he couldn’t control because she dumped him. And Bonnie stood there, and they both stared at him. I was six feet away from him. And this guy’s all about control and maintaining control. He’s sitting there, just looking straight ahead, not reacting to anything, trying to maintain control. But when Bonnie was brought into the courtroom, I looked at him, and his breathing had stopped.\n \n\n   \n  Carson also told him, ‘Oh, by the way, DeAngelo, do you remember the roast you had cooking in the oven the day you were arrested? … The only roast you’ll experience is when you roast in hell, because that’s where you’re going.’\n \n\n   \n  It was the victim and Bonnie seizing control back … you could see there was a reaction. It was a very empowering moment in the courtroom.\n \n\n   \n    His crimes were horrifying. Is there a particular survivor whose story has stayed with you?\n \n\n   \n  When I think about the case now, I don’t think about him or the crimes. I think about the survivors. One of them, Phyllis Hennemann, was the very first rape victim in Sacramento. She was diagnosed with cancer, and when it was time for court she couldn’t be there because she was having chemo. But when DeAngelo was sentenced, I looked across the courtroom, and there’s Phyllis sitting there. And she had this twinkle on her eye. For the first time in 40 years, she got justice. About three months later, she died from cancer. I think about her a lot … that we were able to get her that justice.\n \n\n   \n    After four decades, was there a moment in the investigation that marked a turning point?\n \n\n   \n  DNA technology shifted the direction of this case. We took some of the DNA, some of the semen from the Ventura rape and converted into a DNA profile that you use in the genealogy database, and then we uploaded it. We found out he had a distant relative, and so we then took that relative and built a family tree. You know, who was that person’s brothers and sisters, their parents, their uncles and aunties, their grandparents, their great-grandparents. We built this massive family tree with a thousand-plus names on it.\n \n\n   \n  And from that family tree, we investigated and looked at everybody. How many were male? How many of them were white? How many of them were police officers or military? How many lived at these crime scenes? And we were able to narrow it down to three people. And lo and behold, he was one of them. We collected his trash and found a piece of tissue that we tested for DNA that matched the killer from all these other locations.\n \n\n   \n    Having seen the evidence up close, which details have stayed with you?\n \n\n   \n  The brutality of the murder scenes in Southern California … For many of those murders, he bludgeoned the victims to death with a blunt instrument. A gunshot would draw the neighbors’ attention … (so) killing them with a log, a lamp base or a brass sprinkler head allowed him time to take in the crime scene at his leisure before leaving.\n \n\n   \n    Do you believe there are more victims out there?\n \n\n   \n  I do. His last known crime was the 1986 murder of Janelle Cruz in Orange County. People ask me, ‘Why did he stop in 1986’? And my answer is, ‘How do you know he stopped in 1986?’\n \n\n   \n  There’s a three-year period from 1986 to 1989, when he was living in LA, that we’re not sure exactly where he was and what he was doing. And he was already beginning to evolve as a killer. So what’s to say he didn’t continue to kill his victims, but he discarded the bodies somewhere that we never found?\n \n\n   \n    You describe justice in this case as not just a legal victory but a personal, full-circle moment for you. Why?\n \n\n   \n  I escaped Vietnam on a fishing boat and lived in a refugee camp. When I came to the US, I learned how to speak English by watching Bugs Bunny cartoons. Twenty years later, I graduated from law school, and I became a lawyer.\n \n\n   \n  I come from a country that doesn’t have the rule of law … it’s governed, essentially, by a dictatorship. And to come to this country, and give back to victims rights, be part of a system of justice that works, it meant everything in the world.\n \n\n   \n    What’s DeAngelo’s life like in prison today?\n \n\n   \n  He was sentenced to multiple life sentences without the possibility of parole and is in a prison in the Central Valley in California. He’s in a protective unit – this is where you put the child molesters, the rapists, the snitches, people who drop out of gangs because other prisoners want to hurt them. He’s not in the general population. And in that unit, he is constantly looking over his shoulder, worried that somebody’s going to attack him.\n \n\n   \n  So he’s in his own version of hell, where he belongs.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/us/charlotte-ice-raids-residents-mobilizing","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"10:44:00-05:00","title":"Volunteer patrols and the PTA at school entrances: How some Charlotte residents are mobilizing amid the immigration crackdown","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In response to a sweeping federal immigration crackdown known as 'Operation Charlotte’s Web,' Charlotte residents have launched widespread community mobilization efforts, including volunteer patrols, PTA-led school guard programs, and public awareness campaigns.

immigration crackdown \n       \n  By Dalia Faheid, Andy Buck, Dianne Gallagher, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:44 AM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The pews of the Charlotte church were packed as onlookers watched a man restrain a woman while a group in bright vests furiously blew their whistles and filmed the interaction, chanting, “La migra esta aqui.”\n \n\n   \n  Another group loudly sang, “This little light of mine, I’m gonna let it shine.”\n \n\n   \n  Clapping then erupted from the crowd.\n \n\n   \n  The scene was among several role-play scenarios hundreds watched Wednesday evening at Dilworth United Methodist Church as part of a training on how to respond to the expanding federal immigration enforcement operation that has  gripped the Charlotte area  and left residents on high alert.\n \n\n   \n  “Let’s practice our whistling language,” Rev. Joel Simpson, a pastor at First United Methodist Church in Taylorsville, said before a dissonant symphony of whistles filled the church.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to report active operations that are happening in our city, alert people nearby and offer reminders of our rights,” Simpson, who led the training, told the crowd. “We’re going to document and record unlawful practices, and we’re going to deter violence by getting as many people as possible to join quickly as an organized presence.”\n \n\n   \n  The plan is simple: Volunteers sign up for shifts and receive instructions from a “patrol dispatch team” on specific zones in Charlotte they will drive around in and alert people when they see immigration enforcement activity. They’re advised to do it in pairs, keep a safe distance from agents and to never try to physically impede law enforcement.\n \n\n   \n  The initiative is just one of many launched by Charlotte residents to help immigrant neighbors as the Trump administration touts  over 250 arrests  in the area since the aggressive immigration crackdown began over the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  Parents are banding together to guard school entrances or carpool students to class, and business owners across the city are patrolling their neighborhoods and closing their doors to protect their customers.\n \n\n   \n  People throughout Charlotte  have been  using many of the same tactics employed in Chicago – including watching for raids, blowing warning whistles and carrying signs advising people of their rights. Flags from Honduras, Colombia and Mexico were seen adorning cars and hanging from homes and businesses.\n \n\n   \n  Still, the fear throughout the city is palpable: families are keeping their children home from school and taking off from work, worrying they’ll be targeted by federal immigration agents.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Loving your neighbors is holy’\n \n\n   \n  Immigrant worker group Siembra NC organized Wednesday’s event at the church to train volunteers to help immigrants safely get to school and work and guard against constitutional violations during immigration enforcement activities, according to the organization.\n \n\n   \n  Volunteers stood outside the church doors, passing out warning whistles and held signs saying “Loving your neighbors is holy.”\n \n\n   \n  Hundreds of volunteers have attended training sessions held by the group to help immigrants as they travel within the city, document and record “unlawful practices” by agents and warn about enforcement activity, Simpson said.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re coming out on weeknights and they’re saying this is how we need to be spending our time and we want to be on the streets and in our communities, making sure people are cared for,” Simpson told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Over 1,000 people registered for Wednesday’s training and some people had to be turned away, the pastor said.\n \n\n   \n  Simpson said they got “best practices” from other communities that have been stops in the administration’s immigration blitz, including Chicago, Los Angeles and Washington, DC.\n \n\n   \n  “People are telling me as they go through this training like, ‘I’m feeling empowered,’” he said. “‘I feel like I can do something and there’s a way to channel my love and my anger and my fear into something that supports other people.’”\n \n\n   \n  That was the case for Maria Klein, who has used the training as a way to channel her frustration about the crackdown in her city.\n \n\n   \n  She attended the training because she cares about “our children who should be able to go to school safely, for our parents who should be able to go to work for the American dream.” Klein, who teaches English as a Second Language to adults, says many of her students have stopped attending class.\n \n\n   \n  “This was an opportunity to really do something practical and to have an immediate impact,” Klein told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    Parents and teachers help families as school attendance plummets\n \n\n   \n  “What is gonna happen if I go home and my parents aren’t there?”\n \n\n   \n  “What does that mean if my parents get taken away?”\n \n\n   \n  These are the questions teacher Jamie Roldan told CNN she has been getting from students at Charlotte East Language Academy since the immigration crackdown began in the city.\n \n\n   \n  “I tell them that I’m gonna fight if someone comes to my door. I’m fighting – hands, feet, it doesn’t matter. You’re not coming in my classroom and taking any of my kids,” Roldan said. “My classroom is a safe space and it will stay that way.”\n \n\n   \n  Amid “Operation Charlotte’s Web” – the immigration enforcement operation in the city named after the classic 1952 children’s book – more than  30,000 students were absent  from Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools on Monday, about 20% of the district’s enrollment.\n \n\n   \n  “We just understand that they were not in school receiving education, advancing their social skills and we know that that there was an impact to those homes where parents had to modify their work schedules,” Charlotte Mayor Pro Tem Danté Anderson told CNN Wednesday. “They had to have an economic impact out of fear that something would occur at those schools.”\n \n\n   \n  The district  issued a statement Sunday night  that no immigration activity had happened on their campuses and that leaders   hadn’t been informed of impending action. There were no reports of immigration enforcement on their campuses on Monday or Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools teacher David Gillespie says hallways and classrooms were nearly empty on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not sure which of my students I’m going to see again,” Gillespie told CNN affiliate  WCNC . “Whether because their parents were involved in detainments or because their parents have to make that unfortunate safety calculus — is it worth it to send my kids to school and put myself at risk?”\n \n\n   \n  As attendance plummets, some parents in the district are organizing to help families who are afraid to leave their homes.\n \n\n   \n  Some PTA members are standing guard at school entrances during drop-off and pick-up so they can alert staff and families if they see federal immigration agents, WCNC reported. Others are passing out information packets and using PTA funds to help families experiencing food insecurity or transportation issues.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re standing there bearing witness and being part of the community,” PTA member Amy Hawnelson told WCNC. “They do not stick around — and that’s why we’re here.”\n \n\n   \n  Another member, Mike Mastry, said they want to help students feel safe at school.\n \n\n   \n  “Seeing a familiar face that’s friendly and smiling helps bring a sense of normalcy,” Mastry told WCNC. “When kids don’t know what’s going on, they get disoriented and have trouble learning.”\n \n\n   \n  Roldan said parents with legal status are picking up children whose parents may not have legal status to bring them to school.\n \n\n   \n  Gillespie says he’s reaching out to families to help students stay on top of schoolwork.\n \n\n   \n  Extracurriculars have been impacted by the operation too. OurBRIDGE, an organization that helps newly arrived immigrant children and their families, has suspended its afterschool programs after Border Patrol activity at one of its sites, the group  announced  on social media.\n \n\n   \n  High school students in the district  staged a walkout Tuesday morning  to protest immigration enforcement in the city. Several hundred students gathered around the edge of a football field at East Mecklenburg High School, many wearing black and holding flags, photos of the demonstration showed.\n \n\n   \n  “The students’ main objective is to provide protection and cover to their fellow students of immigrant descent,” a news release on the demonstration said.\n \n\n   \n    Business owners work to protect customers\n \n\n   \n  Charlotte business owner Bryan Li enrolled in a training session offered by a local advocacy group and has been out patrolling the city the past few days, looking for federal agents and reporting back to advocacy groups that alert the community.\n \n\n   \n  Li, a US citizen born in Hong Kong, told CNN he couldn’t sit at home and not do something.\n \n\n   \n  “When harm is done, more people rally, learn and prepare so we can help protect our most vulnerable,” Li told CNN. “Charlotte will stand united and protect our immigrant community with everything we have.”\n \n\n   \n  While people like Li patrol the city, many businesses have shuttered their doors, fearing their customers will be a target.\n \n\n   \n  About  half the mom-and-pop businesses  the community development organization  CharlotteEast  works with have closed their doors at some point, despite all of them being owned by US citizens, Executive Director Greg Asciutto said Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  “From strictly an economic standpoint, it’s pretty catastrophic right now,” Asciutto said, comparing current closures to the first week of the coronavirus pandemic in the area.\n \n\n   \n  A Colombian bakery open for 28 years closed its doors Saturday after men in tactical gear   chased and tackled people outside the shop. Community members showed up afterwards to guard the business.\n \n\n   \n  Beth Clements, who stood outside the bakery wearing a yellow vest, had been standing guard there for three days.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m going to walk the streets with my whistle and I want to keep my neighbors protected because they deserve protection and they deserve to live in a world where they’re not scared,” Clements said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/middleeast/israeli-hostage-kupershtein-gaza-captivity-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"10:44:00-05:00","title":"In your head, you count every day: Ex-October 7 hostage describes 2 years in captivity","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Bar Kupershtein, a 23-year-old Israeli security guard, was kidnapped on October 7, 2023, during a Hamas attack at the Nova Festival.

 \n  Bar Kupershtein smiles and laughs as if he hasn’t spent the last two years in “hell,” as he describes it, his demeanor belying the time he spent  in Hamas’ captivity in Gaza .\n \n\n   \n  “I prefer to take things with humor and laughter, to be happy with my family, and to look forward, not back,” the 23-year-old security guard who was kidnapped from  the Nova Festival on October 7, 2023 , told CNN, hours before boarding a flight to meet US President Donald Trump at the White House on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  It’s the same resolve that made him stay behind during the terror attack, aiding the wounded partygoers, until he was ultimately shot and kidnapped by Hamas. Despite the enormous hardship he endured, he says he would do the exact same thing again.\n \n\n   \n  “I was responsible for the safety of all the partygoers”’ he said. “If I ran away and saved myself, knowing that others were there and I could have helped them –– I wouldn’t have been able to live with myself.” Survivors have called him a hero. “I just did my job,” he insists.\n \n\n   \n  That decision cost him 738 days.\n \n\n   \n  “In your head, you count every day, that’s how you keep yourself busy,” he told CNN. In the beginning, he recalls, blindfolded and forbidden from speaking, counting was one of the only activities available. Days became weeks, months, two years.\n \n\n   \n  “There were moments when they tried to execute us, when they starved us, when they abused us, whether with beatings, physically, verbally, depriving us from basic human conditions,” he recounts. “You feel like the most miserable person in the world.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Just endure it’ or ‘It can’t get any worse than this’\n \n\n   \n  Held underground with five other hostages, in what he described as “a small dungeon,” Kupershtein recalls an especially violent period, following statements by far-right  Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir  on Palestinian prisoners. “They came to us, beat us and hit us, and when we asked why, they said it was because of Ben Gvir and because of our government,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  In April 2025, Hamas released  a propaganda video  showing Kupershtein and another hostage, Maxim Herkin, appearing emaciated and distressed, begging to be brought home. “All I was thinking about was that my family would know that I am alive, that’s it,” he said. “I didn’t care what they told me to say, I would say everything – just for my family to see me safe and sound and speaking.”\n \n\n   \n  In that hell, Kupershtein says his anchor was his faith.\n \n\n   \n  “God gave me the strength to be strong. I truly believed and knew that I would get out safe and sound,” he said. “From day one, I had this inner feeling. I kept telling myself not to give up and stay strong – for the family – because one day I will get out and go back to being Bar. I told myself that it can’t get any worse than this – so just endure it.”\n \n\n   \n  His faith grew even stronger during captivity.\n \n\n   \n  “I wasn’t very religious beforehand, only traditional, but in captivity, one really connects to God, you talk to him. He saved me – not once or twice. Every day that I stayed alive was a miracle.”\n \n\n   \n  In captivity, Kupershtein had little access to the outside world and was only occasionally aware of what was happening. Even then, it was often what his captors wanted him to know.\n \n\n   \n  But a radio transmitter brought in to broadcast Quran passages to the hostages gave them an unexpected link to the outside.\n \n\n   \n  Kupershtein managed to locate an Israeli military radio station and get updates from home. “I remember waking up every morning, looking at the radio and waiting to listen to it,” he says. “It really is a miracle. Imagine you’re 30 meters (98 feet) underground and you’re listening to the radio.”\n \n\n   \n    A father’s fight for his son\n \n\n   \n  From that radio, he heard about his family’s efforts to secure his release. Kupershtein’s father, Tal, was a former volunteer paramedic for  United Hatzalah , Israel’s largest volunteer emergency medical service organization. He suffered a severe stroke in a motorcycle accident three years prior to the kidnapping. The accident made Bar, the eldest of five siblings, the family’s breadwinner, managing their falafel stand while also working as a security guard at events. He also followed in his father’s footsteps, volunteering as a paramedic.\n \n\n   \n  During his son’s captivity, Tal – who was in a wheelchair and had been unable to speak for years – engaged in an intense recovery effort with speech therapists and regained his ability to speak so he could advocate for his son’s freedom.\n \n\n   \n  “I saw my father sometimes at demonstrations, they even brought me a picture of him standing at a demonstration,” Kupershtein says. “I also heard my mother organized a birthday for me at Hostages Square.”\n \n\n   \n  He didn’t believe his release was coming until the last minute. “There were so many deals that didn’t go through, so we thought here’s another one that won’t go through, something will mess up,” he said. “Even when I was on my way home, I didn’t believe we were actually getting out.”\n \n\n   \n  Now, he is on his way to the Oval Office, where the US president invited all 20 newly- freed hostages. Kupershtein, who calls Trump “an emissary of God,” plans first and foremost to thank him. “God said we needed to get out of there and he was the emissary,”, he says. “He played a big part in us getting out of there.”\n \n\n   \n  Asked if he believes in peace, Kupershtein is measured. “Personally, yes, but after these two years I was there, I know that the other side is really not interested in peace, so as much as we as a state can want peace – I don’t think it can happen with Hamas.”\n \n\n   \n  He describes himself now as an “upgraded version” of who he was before and says being back in Israel is like a daily dream.\n \n\n   \n  “There is an excitement every day to wake up in the morning here – and not there in the tunnels – and to be alive and breathing,” he said. “I thank God for this every day.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, underneath the smiles and the laughter, he acknowledged the wounds remain.\n \n\n   \n  “Of course, there are moments when I can’t fall asleep at night with hard thoughts and a need to go out for fresh air,” he admits. “Sometimes I find myself in situations where I see everyone around me happy, but I’m just regular, and it’s not true happiness.”\n \n\n   \n  He says he tries “to surround myself with a loving, supportive environment so that I don’t reach those situations and just be happy. It’s part of it, I believe it will heal.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/09/30/europe/tomahawk-missiles-trump-ukraine-180-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"10:43:00-05:00","title":"Trump’s Latest Policy 180 on the War in Ukraine Could Strike Deep Into Russian Territory","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"U.S. President Donald Trump is reportedly considering supplying Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine, marking a dramatic policy reversal from his prior stance that Russia had 'no cards.'

the war in Ukraine could strike deep into Russian territory \n       \n  Analysis by Nick Paton Walsh, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:43 AM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  It’s such a stark change, it is perhaps forgivable the messaging is garbled.\n \n\n   \n  US President Donald Trump is considering supplying  Tomahawk missiles  to Ukraine, according to his Vice President JD Vance.\n \n\n   \n  “We are having conversations this very minute about that issue,” Vance told “Fox News Sunday,” adding Trump will make a “final determination.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, said the same day he believed Ukraine had the authorization to strike deep into Russia. “Use the ability to hit deep,” he said. “There are no such things as sanctuaries.” Kellogg later clarified his remarks as only referring to public statements from Vance and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and not a fresh insight into White House thinking. But Trump’s team are either seriously considering supplying Tomahawks – whose very nature means they are really only for long-range strikes into Russia – or they want everyone to think they are.\n \n\n   \n  Forty-three days ago, Russian President Vladimir Putin was walking on a red carpet into The Beast in Alaska. But now the Kremlin are having to respond to the idea of the US’s most effective long-range missile being supplied to a foe that, only seven months ago, Trump said “had no cards.” Days after Trump’s Truth Social posting that Ukraine could take back all occupied territory, this is another policy 180, but one with long-range teeth.\n \n\n   \n  First made famous in the 1991 Gulf War, the Tomahawk is reserved for the US’s closest allies – including the United Kingdom and Japan. Its four models range up to the latest version, Block IV, which can feed back live information on targets below, permitting a change during flight. The US would not supply the weapons but instead sell them to Europe to pass on to Kyiv. But have no doubt, that will not allay Moscow’s concerns the Trump administration is massively escalating and improving Ukraine’s capabilities here.\n \n\n   \n  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said little about what he has called a “sensitive topic.” He knows Ukraine has already used long-range drones to damage Russia’s oil refineries to the point where gas shortages in the country are an established fact. Clearly, Kyiv is already able to strike deep into parts of Russia where the war was meant to be a distant thing the poor died fighting. They have shown ingenuity can supplant sheer might and technology, with the use of tiny drones hidden in container housing to strike Siberian airfields in Operation Spider Web. Yet Tomahawks would present a new order of challenge to Russia’s air defenses. Government buildings in Moscow and grandiose Ministry of Defense infrastructure could become open targets.\n \n\n   \n  Is the plan ahead for what tacticians call “strategic ambiguity”? To allow Ukraine’s growing long-range missile stock to claim responsibility for Tomahawk strikes, or even vice-versa? Debris from missiles will likely point to the true culprit. It is unlikely US involvement will stay hidden, and Moscow will be forced to try to respond in kind.\n \n\n   \n  But there are two moments in the past that perhaps help predict where this new threat of escalation is headed. The first is the last major weaponry boost for Ukraine from Washington – the Biden administration’s  decision to allow Kyiv to fire ATACMs  deep into Russia. Putin did respond, by firing the new-ish Oreshnik missile into Dnipro, at a mostly deserted warehouse.\n \n\n   \n  The device sounded terrifying – an apparently new, nuclear capable IRBM, fired with multiple conventional warheads, that the Kremlin boasted could rip through European defenses. Ukrainian experts claimed the device was a variation on an older model RS26, and showed me what looked like ageing valves in its circuitry at a storage facility in Kyiv. In short, it did not seem to be a huge technical leap forwards, or a staggering show of force, rather some mild nuclear-adjacent saber-rattling in response to an undeniable US escalation. The sheer paucity of Russian resources, after three and a half years of war, may lead to a similarly ineffective response to any use of Tomahawks.\n \n\n   \n  The second precedent is less in Ukraine’s favor. The last time the Trump administration threatened to escalate in a manner that would have outstripped its predecessor, was to implement secondary sanctions against India and China for buying Russian oil – in response to months of insincere Russian diplomacy. Such a broad imposition of tariffs would have been a fiercer move than any Joe Biden contemplated. Indeed, 50% tariffs are now in place against India. But Trump has demanded Europe quit buying Russian hydrocarbons if he is to go further. He has, thus far, held back.\n \n\n   \n  This may be the fate of the Tomahawk debate. That when it comes to Trump’s “final determination,” he follows his usual predisposition to pause the most destructive measures, and keep alive a relationship that appears enduring to the point of enigma – his friendship with Putin.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/middleeast/israel-strikes-gaza-escalation-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"10:44:00-04:00","title":"Israeli strikes across Gaza kill at least 32 Palestinians, as Hamas warns of ‘dangerous escalation’","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israeli airstrikes in Gaza and southern Lebanon have led to at least 32 Palestinian deaths, including children and women, marking a third major escalation since a ceasefire agreement in October 2025.

Palestinians, as Hamas warns of ‘dangerous escalation’ \n       \n  By Abeer Salman, Tareq Al Hilou, Mohammed Tawfeeq and Ibrahim Dahman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:44 AM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Israeli strikes across  Gaza  killed at least   32 Palestinians  in the latest escalation of violence since the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas took effect.\n \n\n   \n  The Palestinian Ministry of Health said 12 children and eight women were among those killed in the strikes, which continued from Wednesday into Thursday morning, while a further 88 people sustained injuries.\n \n\n   \n  The Israel Defense Forces said it carried out the strikes on Hamas targets after “several terrorists” fired on Israeli soldiers operating in Khan Younis in southern Gaza. “This action constitutes a violation of the ceasefire agreement,” the IDF said, adding that none of its forces had been injured.\n \n\n   \n  Hamas condemned the strikes as “a dangerous escalation” and rejected the IDF’s account, accusing Israel of trying to “justify its ongoing crimes and violations.” It called on the US to exert “immediate, serious pressure” on Israel to “respect the ceasefire and halt the aggression against our people.”\n \n\n   \n  The latest strikes bring the total Palestinian death toll since the ceasefire came into effect to 312.\n \n\n   \n  They come just days after the UN Security Council  endorsed  US President Donald Trump’s plan for how to move beyond the fragile truce to a more sustainable peace and the reconstruction of the devastated enclave.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, in a separate development, Israel also carried out airstrikes on what it claimed were Hezbollah weapons storage sites in southern Lebanon.\n \n\n   \n  The strikes in Gaza were the third major escalation since the  ceasefire agreement  came into force in October, each preceded by an attack on Israeli soldiers.\n \n\n   \n  In the two previous escalations, on  October 19  and  28 , approximately 150 Palestinians and three Israeli soldiers were killed.\n \n\n   \n  However, despite those escalations the ceasefire has largely held.\n \n\n   \n  CNN footage taken Wednesday at Gaza City’s Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital complex shows dozens of people crowding around incoming ambulances carrying victims of the strikes.\n \n\n   \n  The footage shows several people sitting beside the corpses inside the hospital, some peering into the body bags in despair. One of the body bags contains the bodies of three lifeless children still covered in dust.\n \n\n   \n  The deadliest strike Wednesday was in the Zaytun area in the east of Gaza, where 10 people, including a woman and a child, were killed, Gaza Civil Defense said.\n \n\n   \n  Another strike hit an area west of Khan Younis targeting “a group of civilians inside the UNRWA club,” the Civil Defense added.\n \n\n   \n  UNRWA is the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East.\n \n\n   \n  Israel launched its war in Gaza after Hamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people and took more than 250 hostage during an attack on Israel on October 7, 2023. Since then, according to the Gaza health ministry, more than 69,000 Palestinians – most of them women and children – have been killed.\n \n\n   \n  As part of the first phase of the US-brokered ceasefire framework, Hamas agreed to release all the remaining hostages in Gaza, living and dead, while Israel agreed to withdraw from some parts of Gaza and release some Palestinian prisoners. Hamas has since released all of the living hostages and the bodies of all but three of the dead ones.\n \n\n   \n  The strikes in Gaza come a day after an Israeli strike on a Palestinian refugee camp in  Lebanon killed 13 people,  according to Lebanon’s health ministry. The IDF said Tuesday’s strike had targeted “a Hamas training compound” that was being used to “plan and carry out terrorist attacks against the IDF and the State of Israel.”\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, Israel carried out further strikes in southern Lebanon, targeting what it said were “several weapons storage facilities belonging to Hezbollah’s rocket unit.” The strikes caused no casualties but damaged several houses, according to Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency.\n \n\n   \n  Israel has been carrying out strikes in  Lebanon targeting militants from Hezbollah  as well as various Palestinian militant factions for more than two years. These escalated after Iran-backed Hezbollah launched attacks on Israel in support of Hamas following the October 7 attack.

That’s a margin typically reserved for proclamations and post office namings, not for what was  perhaps the biggest defeat  of President Donald Trump’s second term, a fight that GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene declared on Tuesday had “ripped MAGA apart.”\n \n\n   \n  A group of Epstein’s survivors, sitting together in one section of the House gallery, applauded. Democrats applauded. Some Republicans applauded. No one seemed to say much to Rep. Ro Khanna as he stood in the center of the floor, toward the front, chitchatting with colleagues. When Illinois Rep. Joshua Jackson patted Khanna on the back a moment later, it wasn’t clear if he was acknowledging Khanna’s work or just trying to squeeze by to get to someone on the other side.\n \n\n   \n  That morning, Khanna had noticed that Greene and Rep. Thomas Massie, his Republican co-sponsor on  the discharge petition leading to Tuesday’s vote , were trending on X and he wasn’t. He is trying to be fine with that, as playing down the Democratic role to woo Republican support was always part of the plan. He offered a “Schoolhouse Rock”-like optimism about legislating, saying, “It feels like you can make a difference in Congress.”\n \n\n   \n  But Khanna doesn’t hide his belief that Tuesday’s triumph proves he should be taken seriously as a party leader and maybe even for the long-shot 2028 presidential run he is always happy to talk about. He argues the vote vindicates the value of his long relationships with Republicans – he and Massie connected years ago working on  legislation to halt US military support to Saudi Arabia  for its war in Yemen – and his willingness to talk to almost any party.\n \n\n   \n  “I make no secret about wanting to be part of shaping the national future of the Democratic Party of this country. I make no secret about the fact that I believe I have the best economic vision for this nation,” he said in an interview with CNN before the vote, ticking through his emphasis on forgotten communities abandoned by billionaires he says have rigged the system.\n \n\n   \n  “The knock on me from some — I mean, there are many knocks on me — but one of the knocks on me has always been: ‘Okay, Ro, you can write books on this, you can write op-eds on this, but can you really, brass tacks, get things done?’ And it’s easier if you’re a mayor or a governor or a Cabinet member to show you can get things done. And what this is showing is, you know what? On one of the biggest things, which is getting MAGA on board, it’s not just ideas. I’m able to get things done.”\n \n\n   \n  Others are willing to give him credit too.\n \n\n   \n  “It took him on his side and me on my side, and our working relationship before this, to be able to do this,” Massie said after finishing thanking the survivors at their press conference outside the Capitol on Tuesday morning. “Our chance of success was about 4 percent at the beginning, and we’re going to succeed. So I am a little bit surprised. I’m used to fighting battles and not winning.”\n \n\n   \n  “I think Ro Khanna is a brilliant human being. I think he stands for justice. He’s on the right side of history,” said Haley Robson, an Epstein survivor helping organize the trembling “sister survivors” who tend to arrive holding up pictures of themselves when they first met Epstein, speaking to CNN after the vote. “If it wasn’t for Massie, Marjorie Taylor Greene and Ro Khanna, I don’t think any of this would have been possible. They are just incredible people who genuinely care.”\n \n\n   \n    How he strategized\n \n\n   \n  Khanna, a 49-year-old who represents Silicon Valley, has gotten used to often getting a better reception as the token Democrat on right-wing media than he does from some of his colleagues. This time, he’d like a little more credit for being ahead of the curve.\n \n\n   \n  “In the beginning,” he told CNN, “I’m not going to say who, but some of the folks in our own party were like, eyerolls, ‘There goes Ro on one of his issues…’ ‘Why aren’t we talking about the price of eggs?’ ‘Why aren’t we talking about the price of health care?’ ‘What’s up with this?’ And I said, ‘No, there is something legitimate here.’”\n \n\n   \n  That included building a relationship with Greene, whom he said he barely knew before – but had never blasted on Twitter like so many of his colleagues – and now texts with. Or carefully maneuvering how to get Colorado Rep. Lauren Boebert in September to sign the discharge petition that forced the vote. Massie relayed that she’d do it if she didn’t have to wait in line, so Khanna pulled the paper away from a Democratic colleague on the House floor and let her walk over and do it.\n \n\n   \n  To report about Khanna is to inspire exasperation from political journalists and operatives who’ve rued for years how many stories the congressman always manages to put himself into as the hinge point.\n \n\n   \n  But it’s also to hear from a person who speaks to Barack Obama often that the former president keeps an eye on Khanna as an administration alumnus (Khanna was a deputy assistant commerce secretary in the first term, before launching a primary against an incumbent whom Obama endorsed). Without overstating it, the person said, Obama “appreciates that Ro is willing to show up across all varieties of platforms.”\n \n\n   \n  That gives Khanna a phone full of contacts to promote himself and his ideas, from MAGA podcaster Steve Bannon to forever never-Trumper Bill Kristol to  Larry Summers, the former treasury secretary and Harvard president whom Khanna is now disgusted to think he was on the phone with arguing about economic policy just weeks ago. The batch of Epstein estate emails  released last week revealed Summers had been asking Epstein for advice  on how to sleep with a mentee of his until just before Epstein’s final arrest.\n \n\n   \n  “If there was no media attention to this,” Khanna said, “this thing would never have gotten a vote. So the idea of politicians being ambitious to raise issues they care about to the American public is a good thing, if the ambition is for a good public purpose. This idea that we should not be savvy about getting our message out in the media is setting us up for being ineffective.”\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, who voted for and touted the win, didn’t respond when asked what the Democratic leader made of Khanna’s pushing the bill through.\n \n\n   \n  Rep. Don Bacon, the retiring Nebraska Republican who’s become friendly with Khanna through their subcommittee work, argued Republicans always wanted to release the files, despite Speaker Mike Johnson in a floor speech on Tuesday calling the vote a distraction from “urgent legislative work.”\n \n\n   \n  “It could have been anybody” leading the charge, Bacon said. Then he reconsidered.\n \n\n   \n  “He was smart enough to get on it,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    Anger and regrets\n \n\n   \n  At first, Khanna says, he took up the Epstein files cause because it was another way of sticking it to the elite class, the ones he travels the country talking about under his “economic patriotism” umbrella for shipping out their jobs and selling out their communities. But he was changed by what he calls the “emotionally horrific” meetings with survivors who started to come through his office — the guilt of having recruited friends, the trauma of being coerced, the women breaking down about how they’ve blocked memories of their own rapes and wanting the records of what happened so they can at least reclaim their own experiences.\n \n\n   \n  He should have listened sooner, he said Tuesday. He shouldn’t have let it slide when he says he brought up releasing the Epstein files with former Rep. Elijah Cummings, the Democrat and House Oversight chair who died in 2019. He shouldn’t have waited until Trump’s backing off his promise to release them got him going in the spring.\n \n\n   \n  “Had I met the survivors in 2019 or 2020,” Khanna told CNN. “I would have been more vocal in the Biden administration. I think it is a fair point that all of us should have been more vocal earlier.”\n \n\n   \n  Khanna’s father taught him to be stoic, he said, so tears don’t tend to flow, but the anger does. This was insidious, he felt, “a rottenness in our civilization that allowed this to happen — like, how are we allowing these people to get away with this stuff?” he said.\n \n\n   \n  This wasn’t about billionaires rigging the system, Khanna started to say. Men so rich and powerful and interconnected that they had means and the gall for a “rape island” and then to try to intimidate away any consequences represented something more: This, he argues, was about “the Epstein class.”\n \n\n   \n    A ‘proof of concept’\n \n\n   \n  Khanna doesn’t know if he’ll be invited to the bill signing Trump is now promising. He hasn’t talked to the president since January 6, 2021, not that their relationship was ever much more than hellos at first-term bill signings and one chat in the Oval Office about a new term-limits law. He thinks Trump won’t be able to wiggle out of his promise, or of complying, and believes there are too many survivors’ lawyers and former Justice officials who’ve seen the files to know if they get selectively scrubbed.\n \n\n   \n  Khanna is already talking to Greene about joining together to try to ban private equity firms from buying up single-family homes. He wonders if he can get a few Republicans to extend Medicare to people starting at 55, even though he still favors Sen. Bernie Sanders’ Medicare for All. Cutting defense budgets seems to have some crossover appeal. Maybe they can come up with a billionaire’s tax that they’ll say is all about taking on the Epstein class.\n \n\n   \n  “My point is, if your goal is just, ‘How do Democrats win,’ maybe anti-Trump is enough for a moment. If your goal is, ‘How do we build an enduring majority, which is what progressive Democrats like me want to do?’ This is absolutely essential,” Khanna said. “This is a proof of concept that we need to actually figure out how we bring disaffected MAGA voters into our coalition, that we need to focus much more on railing against a system that has screwed Americans and offering a hopeful message about how we help them, more than just meme-ing against Donald Trump.”\n \n\n   \n   CORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct Khanna’s age. He is 49, not 47.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/china/japan-china-taiwan-dispute-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"20:28:00-20:30","title":"China warns there is ‘no market’ for Japanese seafood exports as spat over Taiwan comments escalates","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"China has issued a strong warning that there is 'no market' for Japanese seafood exports, escalating a diplomatic dispute with Japan over Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s comments in parliament stating that a Chinese attack on Taiwan would threaten Japan’s survival.

‘no market’ for Japanese seafood exports as spat over Taiwan comments escalates \n       \n  By Jerome Taylor, Ross Adkin, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:48 AM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   China  has warned there is “no market” for  Japanese seafood exports,  the latest veiled threat from Beijing as its diplomatic spat with Tokyo escalates over recent comments by Japan’s leader on defending Taiwan.\n \n\n   \n  The two neighbors have been engaged in a  rapidly spiraling dispute  after Japanese leader Sanae Takaichi, in response to a question in parliament, said that a Chinese attack on Taiwan would count as “a situation threatening Japan’s survival,” and thus could trigger a military response from Tokyo.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing views the self-governing democracy of Taiwan as its territory and has vowed to take control of the island, by force if necessary. For Beijing, Taiwan’s sovereignty is the most sensitive issue in its relations with other nations – a “red line” not to be crossed.\n \n\n   \n  For more than a week, China and its state media has issued near daily denunciations of Takaichi   as well as threats to economically punish Tokyo unless the comments are retracted.\n \n\n   \n  Seafood emerged as the latest pressure point at a regular press briefing on Wednesday from China’s foreign ministry.\n \n\n   \n  “Due to the erroneous remarks made by Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi on important Taiwan issues, there has been strong public outrage in China,” spokesperson Mao Ning told reporters. “Under the current circumstances, even if Japanese seafood were exported to China, there would be no market for it.”\n \n\n   \n  Mao was responding to reports earlier that day in Japanese media that China had already informed Tokyo that it planned to ban seafood exports from Japan. Both NHK and Kyodo ran the reports, citing sources.\n \n\n   \n  However Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara told reporters Tokyo has yet to receive any confirmation from the Chinese government on the matter.\n \n\n   \n  Mao’s response did not confirm a ban was in place, but it has raised the prospect that one might be on its way as well as further punitive measures.\n \n\n   \n  “Japan should first retract its erroneous remarks and take concrete actions to safeguard the political foundation of China-Japan relations; otherwise, China will have no choice but to take further measures,” Mao said.\n \n\n   \n    Fukhshima era ban\n \n\n   \n  China had only  partly resumed imports  of seafood from Japan earlier this year after banning them in August 2023 in response to Tokyo’s decision to begin releasing treated radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear plant.\n \n\n   \n  Japan’s devastating 2011 earthquake and tsunami caused water within the plant to be contaminated with highly radioactive material. Tokyo had argued that it had treated the water properly, but Beijing had long led regional opposition to the water being returned to the ocean.\n \n\n   \n  In contrast to China threats, Taiwan’s leader Lai Ching-te turned to social media to show his support for Japanese seafood this week, posting a picture on X on Thursday of his sushi lunch.\n \n\n   \n  The threat of a new   seafood ban comes after Beijing last week advised its citizens against travelling to Japan.\n \n\n   \n  Although the move is non-binding, it is hugely symbolic – nearly 7.5 million travelers from China visited Japan between January and September this year, by far the highest count of any country or region, according to official data cited by Japanese public broadcaster NHK.\n \n\n   \n  Chinese airlines including Air China, China Eastern and China Southern later published notices on their websites offering customers refunds or free changes on certain tickets to Japan, Chinese state broadcaster CCTV reported.\n \n\n   \n  Japanese companies are starting to report cancellations.\n \n\n   \n  Tokyo-based tour operator East Japan International Travel Service said it had lost 70% of its bookings for the remainder of the year, because of the ongoing row between Japan and China.\n \n\n   \n  Yu Jinxin, the company’s vice president, told CNN it was “a huge loss for us”, adding Chinese tour groups are a key part of their business.\n \n\n   \n  “We can withstand a short-term impact of one to two months, but if the situation becomes prolonged, the financial strain on our operations will be significant,” Yu added.\n \n\n   \n  Previous Japanese leaders have avoided discussing Taiwan in the context of a military response to avoid ruffling feathers in China – Japan’s biggest trade partner.\n \n\n   \n  Takaichi,  a hawk who has pushed to strengthen Japan’s defense capacity,  visited Taiwan earlier this year – before she became Prime Minister – and called for cooperation on “defense challenges,” which Beijing condemned at the time.\n \n\n   \n  She has previously criticized Beijing’s increasing military presence in East Asia, and during the APEC summit, she met with Taiwan’s representative, again angering China.\n \n\n   \n  She met Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the same summit, at which she said she had asked China to resume imports of Japanese beef and seafood imports.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Mai Takiguchi and Kloe Zheng contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/politics/russia-ukraine-white-house-plan","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"02:53:00.000Z","title":"Trump administration quietly attempting to hammer out new peace plan with Russia","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration is quietly advancing a new peace plan with Russia to end its war with Ukraine, led by special envoy Steve Witkoff and supported by a U.S. Army delegation headed by Army Secretary Dan Driscoll.

CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:53 AM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Trump administration has been quietly hammering out a new peace plan with Russia to end its war with Ukraine, a person familiar with the talks told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The president’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, who has been at the center of the  administration’s talks with Moscow , has been leading the effort, the source said. The negotiations accelerated this week as the administration feels the Kremlin has signaled a renewed openness to a deal, the source added.\n \n\n   \n  Army Secretary Dan Driscoll and a top-level Pentagon delegation arrived this morning in Ukraine “on a fact finding mission to meet with Ukrainian officials and discuss efforts to end the war,” Army Spokesperson Col. Dave Butler said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  The mission, at the direction of the president, was part of the White House effort to resuscitate peace talks, according to a separate source who is a US official.\n \n\n   \n  Driscoll was expected to discuss battlefield conditions and weapons needs with President Volodymyr Zelensky and other senior Ukrainian officials, as well as the nascent peace efforts, the official said.\n \n\n   \n   The Wall Street Journal  first reported on the US delegation traveling to Kyiv.\n \n\n   \n  In a post on Telegram, Ukrainian Defense Minister Denys Shmyhal wrote that he had the honor of meeting with Driscoll, posting a photo of the two men shaking hands.\n \n\n   \n  Shmyhal expressed “gratitude” to the US for its “important support that saves the lives of Ukrainians every day.” He added that he “presented to partners our developments in the field of defense innovations” and “focused on the next steps to implement the historic defense agreements reached by President Zelensky and President Trump.”\n \n\n   \n  Driscoll has not been publicly involved in the last rounds of peace talks, but he is a close ally of Vice President JD Vance, with whom he attended Yale Law School. He has focused on military acquisitions.\n \n\n   \n  Other officials traveling with Driscoll to Kyiv were Army Chief of Staff Gen. Randy George; Gen. Chris Donahue, the top US Army commander in Europe; and Sergeant Major of the Army Michael Weimer.\n \n\n   \n  Russian sources also confirmed to CNN that there are ongoing high-level contacts between US and Russian officials, including Witkoff.\n \n\n   \n  Russian Special Envoy  Kirill Dmitriev went to the US in October  to meet Witkoff and others and had what a Russian source told CNN were “very productive discussions.”\n \n\n   \n  According to an  Axios report , the current draft being hashed out between Washington and Moscow is focused on 28 points, including security guarantees for Ukraine and Europe, as well as future US relations with Russia and Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  The Kremlin on Wednesday downplayed the Axios report. When asked about it, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that there are “no new developments to report so far” regarding an end to the war.\n \n\n   \n  “There were discussions in Anchorage. Beyond what was discussed in Anchorage, there have been no updates yet,” he said, referencing a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Trump in Alaska in August.\n \n\n   \n  Europe and Ukraine’s involvement in the talks so far remains unclear, the source familiar said, as well as whether they would support such a plan.\n \n\n   \n  In her first public remarks since reports of the new deal, European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas on Thursday told reporters that “for any plan to work, it needs Ukrainians and Europeans on board.”\n \n\n   \n  Attending the same meeting in Brussels, Poland’s foreign minister Radoslaw Sikorski said “we command peace efforts, but… it’s, of course, Europe’s security that’s at stake. So we expect to be consulted,” Reuters reported.\n \n\n   \n  Secretary of State Marco Rubio in a social media post Wednesday evening indicated that the Trump administration is in communication with both Kyiv and Moscow to come up with ideas for possible peace plans.\n \n\n   \n  “Ending a complex and deadly war such as the one in Ukraine requires an extensive exchange of serious and realistic ideas,” he said on X, noting that a lasting peace would also require difficult concessions from both sides. “That is why we are and will continue to develop a list of potential ideas for ending this war based on input from both sides of this conflict.”\n \n\n   \n  The White House declined to respond to a request for comment.\n \n\n   \n  The discussions come as the Trump administration has tried repeatedly to find an end to the war, only for talks to fall apart after Putin refused to make substantial commitments to the effort.\n \n\n   \n  “I thought that was going to be my easy one, because I have a good relationship with President Putin, but I’m a little disappointed in President Putin right now,” Trump said during remarks at a US-Saudi investment conference Wednesday. “He knows that.”\n \n\n   \n  After Trump  spoke with Putin by phone last month , he was so convinced there was enough progress made that he announced would soon be traveling to Budapest for an in-person summit with the Russian leader.\n \n\n   \n  But just five days later, the  summit was off  and  new sanctions on Moscow  — the first of Trump’s second administration — were on.\n \n\n   \n  US officials told CNN that in the time between, the president and his administration came to the conclusion that Putin’s stance on ending the war had not significantly shifted from the last time he  met Trump on a US air base in Alaska .\n \n\n   \n  Previous US peace talks had focused on freezing Russian and Ukrainian troops along current battle lines. Europe and Ukraine backed the plan as a jumping off point for fresh negotiations, while the Kremlin rejected the proposal, arguing they were not interested in a ceasefire but a longer-term peace deal.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Haley Britzky contributed to this report. \n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/business/larry-summers-openai-board-epstein","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"20:54:00-05:00","title":"Larry Summers leaves OpenAI board, Harvard instructor role as scrutiny over Epstein emails intensifies","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Larry Summers, a former U.S. Treasury Secretary and Harvard University president, has resigned from his roles on OpenAI’s board and as an instructor at Harvard University following the release of emails by a House committee that reveal years of personal correspondence with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

Jasmine Crockett watched GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene  apologize on national television  for her role in perpetuating divisive rhetoric and immediately instructed her staff to see if the Georgia Republican wanted to work with her on a bill addressing lawmaker safety.\n \n\n   \n  Crockett had reached out to Greene on the issue shortly after Charlie Kirk’s assassination in September, without response. But now, with Greene’s public rebuke of President Donald Trump and her own party, Crockett sees even more potential in teaming up.\n \n\n   \n  “If you can put Marjorie and myself as co-leads on anything, it automatically gets attention, and it also reveals to the American public that we can bridge these gaps if we just decided that we want to,” Crockett told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The pair don’t necessarily have a friendly history. Often seen trading insults during House Oversight Committee meetings, Crockett has  dismissed Greene as racist  and once referred to the congresswoman as a “ bleach blonde, bad built, butch body. ” No, Crockett said, she wouldn’t consider Greene a “Democratic bestie,” but she hopes they can develop a new working relationship.\n \n\n   \n  Crockett’s attempts to find common ground with Greene reflect a broader discussion in the Democratic Party about whether they should embrace Greene or if the congresswoman’s history of offensive,  at times violent , rhetoric and  conspiracy theories  – often  directed  at Democrats – makes the  idea  just too unpalatable.\n \n\n   \n  In conversations with over a dozen Democratic lawmakers and aides, the proverbial scars from Greene’s incendiary past statements cut deep and, as a result, there’s no clear consensus on how to best work with her in the future.\n \n\n   \n  Greene’s office declined to comment for this story, but she called for unity in her recent interview with CNN’s “State of the Union.”\n \n\n   \n  “I think America needs to come together and end all the toxic, dangerous rhetoric and divide. And I’m leading the way with my own example, and I hope that President Trump can do the same,” Greene told CNN’s Dana Bash.\n \n\n   \n    Some Democrats see opportunity\n \n\n   \n  In their pursuit of circumventing House GOP leadership to force a vote on the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files, Democrats found an unlikely ally in Greene.\n \n\n   \n  Even though virtually all Republicans ended up voting for the measure, Greene was one of only four Republicans to buck their party and sign onto the petition that made Tuesday’s vote possible. It culminated in a shared embrace with Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, a key Democratic backer of the effort, at a high-profile press conference on Capitol Hill (once strangers,  the pair now texts ) and laid the groundwork for some Democrats to start to see an opening.\n \n\n   \n  Another area Democrats see as an opportunity to work together: The issue of rising health care costs and affordability.\n \n\n   \n  During the government shutdown, Greene openly vented about how health care prices for her family would double due to the expiring enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies that were central to Democrats’ shutdown argument.\n \n\n   \n  “Not a single Republican in leadership talked to us about this or has given us a plan to help Americans deal with their health insurance premiums DOUBLING!!!” Greene  wrote  on X in October.\n \n\n   \n  Her criticisms reached the upper echelon of the House Democratic caucus.\n \n\n   \n  The second highest Democrat in the House, Minority Whip Rep. Katherine Clark, said she was open to working with Greene on lowering the cost of health care and cost of living.\n \n\n   \n  “Our hand is always extended in bipartisanship, and we will work with anyone that is going to prioritize the economic needs of families at home and reduce their costs,” Clark said.\n \n\n   \n  Greene’s criticism of Israel in the war with Hamas has also brought her closer to some unexpected allies.\n \n\n   \n  Minnesota Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar said that despite the pair’s charged history (Greene tried to censure Omar  last year ), she approached Greene on the House floor even prior to Greene’s  apparent political breakup  with Trump to thank her for speaking out on Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  “In regards to her stances and addressing the genocide, I have actually personally gone to thank her for that. I think it is important when somebody is doing a principled thing that we thank them for what they are doing,” Omar said of her conversation with Greene a few months ago.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Rep. Pramila Jayapal has even gone through the trouble of tracking down Greene’s cell phone number to thank her for being outspoken against Trump and the Republican Party and wants to suggest teaming up on the progressive priority of “Medicare for All.” It wasn’t something she ever thought she’d do.\n \n\n   \n  “But I also have worked with a lot of people that I disagree with on a lot of things,” Jayapal told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    Distrust remains\n \n\n   \n  Not all Democrats are quick to trust when it comes to the Georgia Republican, and some questioned the influence she has within her party to draw other Republicans to the table.\n \n\n   \n  Members of the progressive group known as “the Squad” who were often the subject of Greene’s most vile attacks said they needed to see evidence that Greene’s arc was real and not just a publicity stunt.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said she needs to see Greene’s words followed up by action and that it’s on Greene to reach out to make amends.\n \n\n   \n  “I personally believe that you never close the door to a person who wants to have changes in their life and in their heart, but they have to be genuine and they have to be authentic,” the New York congresswoman said. “It is incumbent upon her to repair the harm that she has done to people. It is not on the people she has harmed.”\n \n\n   \n  As a candidate in 2020, Greene  posted  on her candidate Facebook page an image of herself holding a gun alongside images of Ocasio-Cortez, Omar and Rep. Rashida Tlaib and encouraged going on the “offense against these socialists.” Facebook took down the photo at the time.\n \n\n   \n  Rep. Ayanna Pressley remembers that photo, but says she would be willing to work with Greene if the Republican show true change.\n \n\n   \n  “I am a Christian woman of deep faith, so I certainly believe in the capacity of people to evolve, to atone, and to redeem themselves. And if she is on a path to do that, that is extraordinary. And I need to see action that supports what she’s saying,” the Massachusetts Democrat said.\n \n\n   \n  “I never want to cause any harm or anything bad for anyone,” Greene told Bash on Sunday, saying she’d previously addressed her hateful comments.\n \n\n   \n  In  2021 , Greene also apologized for her offensive comments comparing Capitol Hill mask-wearing rules to the Holocaust after visiting the US Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Rep. Becca Balint who put forward a resolution censuring Greene in  2023 , arguing she’s “fanned the flames of racism, antisemitism, LGBTQ hate speech, Islamophobia, anti-Asian hate, xenophobia, and other forms of hatred,” said Greene will need to be proactive if she is serious about making a change.\n \n\n   \n  “We all know politics always makes for strange bedfellows. In this instance, though, it has been truly remarkable and shocking to see her change of heart regarding nasty rhetoric. The only way for this to be anything other than just platitudes is for her to truly make amends to all the colleagues she’s hurt and put in danger,” Balint said.\n \n\n   \n  If Greene were serious about showing her evolution many Democrats argued a great place for her to start would be supporting a congressional memorial to honor law enforcement caught in the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar, who formerly served on the January 6 select committee, said Greene having dismissed the violence that day and refused to accept Joe Biden as the rightful winner of the 2020 election make it hard for him to conceive of working directly with her.\n \n\n   \n  “Her positions on January 6th and supporting the ‘Big Lie,’ you know, would continue to be an issue. It’s not someone I choose to cosponsor legislation with,” Aguilar said. “But I appreciate that people evolve on certain issues and if she wants to work with us on health care issues, then I welcome that.”\n \n\n   \n    Relationships after Trump\n \n\n   \n  Part of the calculus for Democrats is that they want to show the capacity to forgive Republicans who are starting to grapple with what the future of their party looks like in a world where Trump will no longer be the ballot.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland went as far as to say the Democratic Party has a big enough tent that Greene could one day be a part of.\n \n\n   \n  “Obviously, Marjorie Taylor Greene would have a lot of political transformation to go through before she could come to the Democratic Party, but I do want to make the serious point that we have to be open to a lot of people who are refugees from the political corruption and authoritarianism of the Republican Party,” Raskin told CNN. “I hear from Republicans every day who say, ‘I can’t take it anymore.’”\n \n\n   \n  A senior House Democratic aide, pressed on the idea of Greene one day becoming a Democrat, quipped that “converts are the most devout.”\n \n\n   \n  But even the Democrats who see the capacity for forgiveness acknowledge that it’s a long road ahead.\n \n\n   \n  “She’s got to do her own work. She’s on her own life journey,” Ocasio-Cortez said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/09/09/style/hong-kong-bamboo-scaffolding-hnk-intl-dst","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"10:43:00-05:00","title":"Building a modern metropolis using a centuries-old technique","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In Hong Kong, hundreds of construction workers annually honor Lo Pan, a legendary carpenter from the Zhou dynasty, at Ching Lin Terrace in Kennedy Town, reflecting a deep cultural connection to traditional construction practices.

10:43 AM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Every year, in the middle of summer, hundreds of Hong Kong construction workers and engineers walk up some 200 steps to Ching Lin Terrace in the seaside neighborhood of Kennedy Town.\n \n\n   \n  There, in one of the city’s temples ,  they gather and pay their respects to Lo Pan, a legendary Chinese carpenter from the Zhou dynasty and patron saint of builders and contractors.\n \n\n   \n  Even in the sweltering heat, workers cram into the tiny temple’s smoke-filled foyer with incense and candlesticks in hand. Bowing several times, they chant slogans in honor of the construction deity’s birthday and pray for a stable year of work.\n \n\n   \n  “I always tell people that Lo Pan is like our Michelangelo. He is a designer, an architect and an engineer,” said Lawrence Ng, president of the Hong Kong Construction Sub-Contractors Association, which represents the city’s waterproofing, metalwork and scaffolding professionals, among others.\n \n\n   \n  “We must pay respects to the workers who came before us, and Lo Pan is our ‘sifu’ (master).”\n \n\n   \n  Worshipping Lo Pan has taken on a particular significance in today’s precarious economy, Ng said.\n \n\n   \n  Since the Covid-19 pandemic, the city has seen  a decline  in large scale construction projects, leaving many laborers  without steady, long-term  employment. Among them are the city’s  “spidermen”  — thousands of construction workers trained in the ancient technique of bamboo scaffolding.\n \n\n   \n    Part of the city’s visual language\n \n\n   \n  On a slope behind Lo Pan temple is a towering residential building covered in a familiar sight to those who’ve walked Hong Kong’s streets: bamboo poles arranged in a distinct grid-like formation.\n \n\n   \n  The crisscrossed structures, in which each pole is fastened with nylon ties, are ubiquitous across the city’s dense, vertical urban landscape. These scaffolds are erected on skyscrapers, hundreds of feet high, and encased in fabric safety nets forming colorful cocoons of green, blue and purple.\n \n\n   \n  Smaller bamboo contraptions often poke out of windows, or cover air conditioning units and balconies.\n \n\n   \n  Bamboo scaffolding is not only used in the construction of new buildings, but the renovation of thousands of high-rises and historic tenements (“tong lau”) every year.\n \n\n   \n  Popular in Hong Kong for over a century, the technique’s origins in Chinese construction date back to at least the Han dynasty, around 2,000 years ago. The method was also widely used in mainland China until government regulations started calling for steel and aluminum scaffolds, in keeping with international norms, in the 1990s.\n \n\n   \n  Bamboo, however, remained the go-to material in Hong Kong, and has been used to build some of the city’s tallest skyscrapers, like Norman Foster’s HSBC headquarters and parts of the 88-floor International Finance Centre.\n \n\n   \n  Aside from helping develop Hong Kong’s modern structures, bamboo has also played an integral role in building temporary Cantonese opera  theaters .\n \n\n   \n  These traditional theaters, made entirely out of the plant, are built on special occasions like the birthdays of local deities or the Hungry Ghost Festival.\n \n\n   \n  Scaffolding has, in turn, become part of the city’s visual language. Being lightweight, customizable and relatively affordable, bamboo stands in stark contrast to its mainstream counterpart, metal.\n \n\n   \n  “Steel is relatively stiff and strong, but it’s less flexible than bamboo,” said Goman Ho, a structural engineer at British engineering firm Arup, who has more than three decades of experience overseeing the development of tall buildings in the city, including the 283-meter (928-foot) tall Cheung Kong Center.\n \n\n   \n  “Bamboo on the other hand, has its own craftsmanship,” he added. “You can build a lot of beautiful scaffolding in ways you’d never think of.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘It’s culture we need to maintain’\n \n\n   \n  Whether in traditional or modern construction, handling the long poles requires specific skills and intuition, which can take months or years to achieve.\n \n\n   \n  “Sometimes people spend one, two, three or even four years learning bamboo scaffolding and may not become masters,” said Ho Ping-Tak (no relation), Chairman of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Bamboo Scaffolding Workers Union.\n \n\n   \n  “But with metal, the technical requirements are lower. If you have the strength, you can generally meet the requirements in a much shorter time.”\n \n\n   \n  The largest member of the grass family, bamboo is combustible, susceptible to deterioration and weaker in rain, raising legitimate questions about its durability, Arup’s Ho said.\n \n\n   \n  “We need to find ways to overcome it,” he said of these challenges, suggesting that poles could be coated with epoxy or plastic solution to prevent erosion.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s culture we need to maintain,” Ho added.\n \n\n   \n  But keeping the tradition alive is challenging. The industry comprises an aging workforce –– many, like 78-year-old Leung Siu Wai, among the dozens of senior bamboo scaffold workers paying respects to Lo Pan, are close to retirement. New talent is also lacking, said Ng.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s hard to get young people to enter,” he added. “Young people in Hong Kong don’t want to do physically demanding work, or work that gives them an identity they feel uncomfortable with.”\n \n\n   \n  Discussions on safeguarding the practice resurfaced earlier this year when the Hong Kong government’s Development Bureau  announced  that 50% of new public building projects erected from March onwards would need to use metal scaffolding to “better protect workers” and align with modern construction standards in “advanced cities.”\n \n\n   \n  The notice sparked concern among some Hong Kong residents, even though the policy will only impact “one or two new building projects” this year, according to the statement.\n \n\n   \n  The bureau later confirmed to CNN that only one public project would be affected in 2025. Nonetheless, some residents have taken to social media to lament what they believed to be the beginning of the end of bamboo scaffolding.\n \n\n   \n  “This is your sign to film bamboo scaffolding while you still can,” wrote a Hong Kong videographer in an Instagram  post  that garnered over 20,000 likes. “Truly one of Hong Kong’s quiet wonders. And soon, it’ll just be part of the past.”\n \n\n   \n  The storied building technique has also been celebrated on the global stage, presented as part of the Hong Kong pavilion at this year’s Venice Biennale –– the world’s largest architecture exhibition.\n \n\n   \n  In May, a sprawling bamboo scaffold was built in the courtyard of Venice’s Campo della Tana, as part of a showcase exploring the diverse and often juxtaposing aspects of public space in Hong Kong, with a focus on threatened heritage.\n \n\n   \n  Its curators said their proposal for the pavilion was finalized in January, two months before the government announced its move to adopt more metal scaffolding in construction.\n \n\n   \n  “We were a bit shocked, to say the least, because we had planned for this without knowing (the government’s announcement) was coming,” said Ying Zhou, an architect and one of the curators.\n \n\n   \n  “So immediately, we were like, ‘Oh what does our thing now say?’ It takes on a whole different kind of importance, especially when we bring it to a place like Venice.”\n \n\n   \n  Eleven bamboo “sifus,” or masters, traveled to Venice to build the structure. Watching them in action, Zhou’s Italian counterparts were, she said, impressed with the way the material was assembled so quickly and precisely –– without much calculation.\n \n\n   \n  “These pre-modern technologies are never recognized in a standardized world, because you have steel, you have concrete, you have numbers that are calculable,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “And here we have something that even the Italians are like, ‘Oh, we need your structural engineer to certify (it).’”\n \n\n   \n    Safety concerns\n \n\n   \n  Thirty-six-year-old Over Chan, a bamboo scaffold worker who builds structures for external repair work, claims that recent industry-wide discussions about fatal accidents on construction sites have prompted more government intervention. (There were  24 deaths related to bamboo scaffolding  from January 2018 to August 2025, according to Hong Kong’s Labour Department).\n \n\n   \n  “When I was starting out as a worker, we didn’t even have to wear shirts, but now, we’re required to wear our uniform, have good manners, and so on –– this ultimately allows us to rise above the competition.”\n \n\n   \n  “Bamboo is not unsafe,” Ho, the chairman of the workers’ union, said, emphasizing the importance of workers fastening themselves to the wooden structures.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s fine to use metal scaffolding –– we’re not saying that metal scaffolding is a competing technique, but if (the government) makes an announcement without much explanation…it gives the public the wrong impression that bamboo is unsafe, which has huge implications.”\n \n\n   \n  Hong Kong’s Development Bureau told CNN that adopting metal scaffolding in construction is just one of many ways to improve site safety.\n \n\n   \n  “Provided relevant legislative requirements on bamboo scaffolds and metal scaffolds are fulfilled, both types of scaffolds are safe,” the bureau said in an email, adding that the government has “no intention to phase out the adoption of bamboo scaffolds.”\n \n\n   \n  Many large-scale construction projects in Hong Kong already incorporate a hybrid of bamboo and steel scaffolding, the union leader Ho said, with metal bars fixed to the ground supporting wooden structures higher up.\n \n\n   \n  He estimates that, currently, 80% of scaffolds are created using bamboo, while 20% use metal or a hybrid of materials.\n \n\n   \n  Chan, who remains eager and optimistic about the trade, said he has started taking courses on metal scaffolding to stand out in the workforce, despite his belief that bamboo isn’t going anywhere.\n \n\n   \n  “Over the past few years, there’s been this feeling in Hong Kong about needing to preserve what’s left of the city’s identity,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/politics/trump-epstein-bill-larry-summers-congress-analysis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"12:00:00-05:00","title":"Washington on tenterhooks for next steps in Epstein saga","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the wake of a bipartisan congressional effort to compel transparency, the Justice Department is now under intense pressure to release all investigative files on Jeffrey Epstein within 30 days.

\nUpdated: \n        12:00 AM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  What now?\n \n\n   \n  The drama, emotion and shock of Congress’s sudden demand for transparency on the  Jeffrey Epstein drama  has ceded to uncertainty and suspicion that President Donald Trump will try to wriggle off the political hook.\n \n\n   \n  The  victims of Epstein , an accused sex trafficker, have tragically seen justice postponed before. They’d been quick to warn after an unprecedented Republican revolt against Trump on Tuesday that it was just one more step in their long quest for vindication. Their wisdom was obvious once the euphoria of their triumph began to clear.\n \n\n   \n  Washington waited all day Wednesday to find out that  Trump had signed   the bill  passed with a 427-1 majority in the House and waved through on unanimous consent by the Senate, which had no desire to be drawn into the president’s self-inflicted political crisis. The measure requires the Justice Department to release  all investigative files , documents and other materials about Epstein, with some exceptions,  within 30 days  of it becoming law. It’s hardly surprising that Trump didn’t rush to sign it, since, despite his late embrace of the legislation, it repudiated his weekslong bid to keep the evidence secret.\n \n\n   \n  Trump was in a box. Any presidential veto was likely to be overturned, judging by the congressional majorities for the bill. But now his Justice Department — in theory at least — is bound to implement it. Any foot-dragging or obstruction would certainly worsen already disastrous public disapproval of his handling of the issue and would only fuel the question that got him into his current mess: What is he trying to hide?\n \n\n   \n    The political battle to come\n \n\n   \n  Epstein survivors and Trump critics are turning to the next stage of the political battle over the documents, but there is almost no clarity over if and when evidence will come out — and how much.\n \n\n   \n  Lawmakers who endorsed the bill seemed unclear what would happen if Trump just ignored it. And Trump’s Attorney General Pam Bondi put on a flustered public performance that fostered little confidence that she would obey Congress or that the administration has a coherent political plan.\n \n\n   \n  There were also new indications of the depth of the bipartisan morass over Epstein and the likelihood that the release of Justice Department files could cause deep embarrassment for many prominent business and political leaders, entertainment stars and even royalty who associated with him.\n \n\n   \n  Larry Summers, a former Treasury secretary and top White House official in Democratic administrations  resigned from the board of OpenAI  after the release of emails revealed his friendly correspondence with Epstein. Summers also will not finish out the semester in his instructor role at Harvard University, a school spokesperson  confirmed Wednesday .\n \n\n   \n  And  Stacey Plaskett , a Democrat who represents the US Virgin Islands in Congress as a non-voting delegate, struggled for a convincing explanation of why she texted with Epstein during a congressional hearing in 2019.\n \n\n   \n  No one can say where this extraordinary scandal with far-reaching consequences will go next. But one thing is clear — it is deeply damaging Trump, both in wider public opinion and because of a never-before-seen split that it has opened in the MAGA movement.\n \n\n   \n  A newly released Marquette University poll — conducted November 5-12, before many of the saga’s latest developments — found that 74% of adults disapproved of Trump’s handling of the Epstein affair. And only 43% of Republicans approved. Marquette’s question asking Americans to choose their top issue didn’t include Epstein on the list. But it found that Americans cared deeply about the economy and the cost of living, on which they gave Trump overwhelmingly negative report cards.\n \n\n   \n    DOJ is yet to show its cards\n \n\n   \n  Such is the reputation of Trump’s Department of Justice — a fully coopted branch of his political machine — that few observers in Washington expect Bondi to follow the letter of the law just established by Congress.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer warned that his party would be ready to hold Trump to account. This shows that Democrats believe that Trump’s exposure to the Epstein drama will outweigh any embarrassment that disclosures could bring to other prominent Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  “There must be no funny business from Donald Trump,” Schumer said. “This bill is a command for the president to be fully transparent, to come fully clean, and to provide full honesty to the American people, even if he doesn’t want to.”\n \n\n   \n  Schumer referred to the possibility that the DOJ could seek an end run around the bill. It could potentially cite investigations into prominent Democrats and Epstein that Trump ordered last week to argue against the release of evidence. Another possibility is that evidence could be released but redacted in such a way as to make it almost meaningless on the premise that officials were protecting victims, witnesses or people who committed no criminal wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  Some Democrats fear the DOJ will scrub any references to the president himself in the files. There has been no evidence of criminal wrongdoing by Trump in relation to Epstein. But emails released by Congress showed  multiple mentions of him  by Epstein and his jailed associate Ghislaine Maxwell.\n \n\n   \n  Connecticut Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal told CNN’s John Berman on Wednesday that he had “no trust, no confidence whatsoever … that this Justice Department will be evenhanded or fair in the disclosure of these files.” He added, “It will be on us in Congress, and hopefully a bipartisan effort, to scrutinize and oversee this process.”\n \n\n   \n  The Republican rebellion against Trump on the Epstein files — an issue that obsesses parts of the Republican base — is one thing. But it’s unclear whether GOP lawmakers would risk the kind of vigorous oversight to which they’ve never subjected Trump to force his compliance with their law. Pressure from Epstein victims could be important in this regard.\n \n\n   \n  Several senators expressed hopes Wednesday that the administration would show good faith. Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley said he’d “be really surprised” if the DOJ refused to release all the required information “given the huge bipartisan” support for the measure. Missouri’s other senator, Eric Schmitt, said that “all the credible information that can be released should be released.” And Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois told CNN’s Manu Raju he hoped Trump wouldn’t “defy the act of Congress.”\n \n\n   \n  At the Justice Department, Bondi was asked why she had agreed to Trump’s  demand to investigate Democrats over Epstein  — which critics say was an archly political move — after arguing earlier this year that the evidence suggested no new probes were necessary.\n \n\n   \n  “Information. Information. There’s information that, new information, additional information,” Bondi said, while offering no clarity on the situation. And she repeatedly told reporters, “We will follow the law, we will continue to follow the law, while protecting victims and also providing maximum transparency.”\n \n\n   \n  This only underscored the great unknowns about what will happen next. Given the extraordinary movement in the saga so far, it seems impossible to believe that the files won’t come out, somehow, eventually. If the administration stalls or obstructs, it’s possible DOJ whistleblowers will emerge.\n \n\n   \n  Republican lawmakers keen to get to Trump’s right on the issue ahead of midterm elections might discover a political motive to join colleagues like  Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene  in pushing for transparency. GOP Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky has warned he’d be ready to read aspects of the evidence surrounding Epstein into the record of the House. And a delay could help Democrats weaponize the issue ahead of midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  The survivors will be waiting.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m hoping that they’re going to do the right thing and release everything,” Sharlene Rochard, a victim of Epstein’s abuse, told CNN’s Audie Cornish. “We just want proof that this happened to us. … And we want to help other girls (so) that — that this doesn’t happen again.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/politics/what-we-know-epstein-files","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"13:05:00-05:00","title":"Trump Signs Bill Directing DOJ to Release Epstein Case Files: What We Know About the Records","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump signed a bill directing the Department of Justice to release all records from the federal investigation into Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.

Here’s what we know about them \n       \n  By Haven Orecchio-Egresitz, Kara Scannell, Evan Perez, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:05 AM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump said on social media Wednesday he has  signed the bill  that directs the Justice Department to publicly release all records amassed by federal prosecutors during the sex trafficking investigation and prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein and his accomplice  Ghislaine Maxwell .\n \n\n   \n  The question of what is actually in those pages — and whether the public will ever see all of those documents — has become a headache for Trump and his administration.\n \n\n   \n  On November 12, the House Oversight Committee released  20,000 more pages  of records it received from Epstein’s estate, including emails in which Epstein insulted Trump and appeared to coordinate his response with Maxwell to a lawsuit brought by accuser Virginia Giuffre.\n \n\n   \n  At this point, though — six years after Epstein died in his New York prison cell — the public has gotten its hands on many records related to the disgraced financier and his alleged child sex trafficking ring.\n \n\n   \n  Some documents have come from the criminal trial and case file of Maxwell, Epstein’s onetime girlfriend. Others   came from Epstein’s estate, which provided the records to the House Oversight Committee in response to a subpoena.\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear what new information, if any, is stuffed in the boxes of evidence within the Justice Department.\n \n\n   \n  Some of it, such as records that detail the physical and sexual abuse of women and girls, may never be released.\n \n\n   \n  The Epstein files are made of over 300 gigabytes of data, paper, video, photographs, and audio that live within the FBI’s main electronic case management system, “Sentinel.” These records would include investigative reports and records from the FBI Miami field division’s original Epstein investigation. The bulk of the records would come from the second investigation carried out by the FBI’s New York Office, including memorandums about the investigation and potential targets, locations to be searched, records to be subpoenaed, and hundreds of pages of “302s,” which are the forms that FBI agents use to memorialize what witnesses, victims and suspects said in interviews with investigators.\n \n\n   \n  The case has continued to fascinate the public, years after Epstein’s death, due to his ties to powerful people. Politicians, including Trump, and celebrities have been publicly linked to Epstein for years — sometimes by appearing in flight logs or at events — and all have denied any wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  Epstein’s death by suicide before trial launched conspiracy theories and deprived many of his accusers a public airing of his conduct. Maxwell was convicted of sex trafficking minors following a four-week trial in 2021.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, after the most recent release of estate records announced he was asking Attorney General Pam Bondi  to investigate Epstein’s ties  to many other high-profile Democrats, including former President Bill Clinton, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman — as well as the bank JPMorgan Chase.\n \n\n   \n  Bondi later announced on X that  Jay Clayton , the US attorney in Manhattan, will lead the federal investigation.\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear whether opening a new criminal investigation would prevent the release of the highly anticipated Justice Department records.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we do and don’t know about the Epstein records:\n \n\n   \n    Grand jury\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department had asked federal judges in New York to unseal grand jury transcripts from Epstein and Maxwell’s criminal cases. Former federal prosecutors say the transcripts likely contain a miniscule amount of evidence from the investigations.\n \n\n   \n  Federal prosecutors in New York generally call law enforcement agents to testify before the grand jury to present just enough evidence they need to support an indictment. Other witnesses, including accusers, are rarely called in to testify before federal grand juries in New York.\n \n\n   \n  The judges overseeing the two cases in New York asked DOJ for more legal argument for why they should unseal grand jury material, which is rarely done. In August, two federal judges in New York  declined Justice Department requests  to unseal grand jury information in Epstein and Maxwell’s cases.\n \n\n   \n  A federal judge in Florida also denied DOJ’s request to unseal grand jury transcripts from its 2005 and 2007 investigations into Epstein, stating the department didn’t meet the legal hurdle to do so under the rules governing the circuit.\n \n\n   \n    Search warrants\n \n\n   \n  Federal prosecutors and the FBI obtained a trove of information during the searches of Epstein’s homes in Florida, New York and Little Saint James, Epstein’s private Caribbean island. That information is under the control of DOJ and is not blocked from public release by secrecy rules.\n \n\n   \n  FBI officials recovered thousands of nude and seminude photographs of young females, including at least of one minor, in a search of his Manhattan mansion in the days following his arrest. Binders of CDs containing the photos were seized. Agents used a saw to open a safe that had more than $70,000 in cash, 48 loose diamond stones, one as large as 2.38 carats, and a large diamond ring.\n \n\n   \n  They also collected documents from the New York home, including notes, messages with names and contact information for certain victims, and phone records.\n \n\n   \n  A search of Epstein’s private island was conducted days after he was found dead in a jail cell about one month after his arrest. By then the investigation had shifted its focus to any co-conspirators of Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  In February, the Justice Department provided an  index  of evidence it has. The index includes over two dozen computers, numerous hard drives, at least two cell phones, and four iPads. The index says there are boat trip logs potentially of who traveled to his private island — that information has not been made public.\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department does not release child pornography so those records would not be expected to be made public under any circumstance.\n \n\n   \n    Florida DOJ case file\n \n\n   \n  Federal prosecutors in New York obtained the investigative record from the earlier investigations into Epstein conducted by their counterparts in Florida in 2007 and 2009. Any of those records that were not covered by grand jury secrecy rules could be released.\n \n\n   \n    Civil lawsuits\n \n\n   \n  Much of the public record relating to Epstein has derived from civil lawsuits brought by accusers, some filed under their own names and others using Jane Doe pseudonyms. Judges have  ordered  the release of thousands of pages of documents, including depositions taken under oath.\n \n\n   \n  Among the famous names referenced in those  documents  are Trump, Clinton, Britain’s Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, French modeling scout Jean-Luc Brunel, American investor Glenn Dubin, and Leslie Wexner, the CEO of L Brands. Not all of them were accused of wrongdoing, and all of them have denied any wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  Two financial institutions, Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan Chase — where Epstein held bank accounts — also reached settlements with survivors and others.\n \n\n   \n  Records from a lawsuit brought by the US Virgin Islands, where Epstein owned Little Saint James, against JPMorgan Chase revealed details about Epstein’s  financial transactions  with Wall Street titans and his practice of withdrawing large amounts of cash. JPMorgan filed numerous suspicious activity reports with the Treasury Department flagging those transactions.\n \n\n   \n    Maxwell trial\n \n\n   \n  Maxwell’s four-week criminal trial was a public airing of her close relationship to Epstein and her role recruiting, grooming and at times participating in the sexual abuse of minors with Epstein. Four women testified about being sexually assaulted when they were minors.\n \n\n   \n  Epstein’s former pilot  testified  and identified people he saw on Epstein’s plane, including Trump, former Sens. John Glenn and George Mitchell,   Andrew, actor Kevin Spacey, and violinist Itzhak Perlman. The pilot said he never saw any wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  Gawker first published a copy in 2015 of Epstein’s so-called black book with names and phone numbers of his contacts. The Justice Department released a redacted version of it earlier this year as well as copies of the flight logs that were made public during Maxwell’s criminal trial.\n \n\n   \n  The release was criticized by some of Trump’s supporters because the information was already public — and did nothing to answer lingering questions.\n \n\n   \n    The estate\n \n\n   \n  In November, the House Oversight Committee released about 20,000 pages of documents it received from Epstein’s estate through a subpoena — materials the Department of Justice said it didn’t previously have access to.\n \n\n   \n  The documents included emails sent by Epstein. In one dated April 2, 2011, Epstein emailed Maxwell: “i want you to realize that that dog that hasn’t barked is trump.. REDACTED spent hours at my house with him ,, he has never once been mentioned. police chief. etc. im 75 % there.” GOP members of the House Oversight Committee  identified  the person as Giuffre. In one January 2019 email, Epstein wrote to author Michael Wolff: “trump said he asked me to resign, never a member ever. . of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop.” The emails also showed an apparent effort between Epstein and Maxwell to coordinate how they would respond to a lawsuit from Giuffre.\n \n\n   \n  The recent release   was the second time that the House Oversight Committee released documents from Epstein’s estate.\n \n\n   \n  In September, the committee put out a tranche of records, including a reported collection of birthday letters gifted to Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  The panel has been investigating the case and  had subpoenaed  the estate for documents as part of its probe.\n \n\n   \n  In a  social media exchange  last week, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche claimed that law enforcement did not have access to the estate documents at the time of his interview with Maxwell this summer.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details.

Nancy Mace’s complaint against Florida Rep. Cory Mills to the committee, staving off another vote on the matter later this week. Mills had moved to refer it to the panel.\n \n\n   \n  The House Ethics committee revealed separately on Wednesday it voted to  establish  an investigative subcommittee to probe the various allegations that Mills is facing.\n \n\n   \n  Mace announced earlier in the day that she would seek to censure the Florida congressman and remove him from the House Armed Services and House Foreign Affairs committees, pointing to several controversies surrounding him. Though ultimately unsuccessful, seven Republicans – Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene, Anna Paulina Luna, Lauren Boebert, Harriet Hageman, Tim Burchett, Kat Cammack and Joe Wilson – joined with Mace to move it forward.\n \n\n   \n  Once considered rare in the House chamber, censure has been  used more frequently  in recent years and amounts to a significant rebuke of a member of Congress.\n \n\n   \n  The congresswoman’s attempt to reprimand Mills comes after House Democrats on Tuesday night  abandoned a separate censure measure  against the Florida Republican after a GOP effort to censure Democratic Del. Stacey Plaskett failed.\n \n\n   \n  Mills said in  a statement  Wednesday that there was no deal between lawmakers leading Democrats to pull the Tuesday resolution and that he and his team were surprised by the move.\n \n\n   \n  “Let me be perfectly clear, there was no backroom deal, no negotiation, and no quid pro quo of any kind that would’ve forced the Democrats to stand down on that vote against me.

The resolution also  mentions a judge’s order  that Mills is not to have any contact with that ex-girlfriend. Mills has denied any wrongdoing in both matters.\n \n\n   \n  Mace’s resolution also points to the  Office of Congressional Ethics’ findings  that Mills may have entered into or held contracts with federal agencies while serving as a member of Congress, which is in violation of House rules. It also cites the ethics office’s finding that Mills may have omitted required information in his financial disclosure statements and accepted excessive contributions to his campaign.\n \n\n   \n  “These allegations are far too serious to ignore,” Mace said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  “A member of Congress accused of assaulting women, profiting off federal contracts from his seat, and inflating or falsifying his service record has no business anywhere near national-security committees.

Further details to follow!”\n \n\n   \n  Dora Pekec, a spokesperson for the mayor-elect, confirmed the meeting in a statement, saying, “As is customary for an incoming mayoral administration, the Mayor-elect plans to meet with the President in Washington to discuss public safety, economic security and the affordability agenda that over one million New Yorkers voted for just two weeks ago.”\n \n\n   \n  Shortly before Trump announced the meeting, Mamdani confirmed his camp had reached out to arrange a meeting with the president in an interview with MS NOW.\n \n\n   \n  “We did reach out to the White House – and my team reached out because of a commitment that I made to New Yorkers, that I would be willing to meet with anyone and everyone, so long as it was to the benefit 8.5 million people who call the city home and their struggle to afford the most expensive city United States of America,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  A meeting between Trump and Mamdani would cap off months of acrimony between the two New Yorkers, who have traded barbs on the stump and in the press since Mamdani’s victory in the Democratic primary in June.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has used the Democratic Socialist Mamdani as a foil, seeking to link his politics to Democrats across the country and deriding him as “my little communist” in remarks from the Oval Office. He also threatened ahead of the election to take federal funding from New York City if Mamdani won.\n \n\n   \n  For his part, Mamdani directly addressed the president in his victory speech  moments after clinching the mayor’s race this month , joking, “Donald Trump, since I know you’re watching, I have four words for you: Turn the volume up.”\n \n\n   \n  Returning to the White House from his West Palm Beach home Sunday, Trump teased a meeting with Mamdani, telling reporters at Joint Base Andrews, “The mayor of New York, I will say, would like to meet with us, and we’ll work something out. But he, he would like to come to Washington and meet. And we’ll work something out. We want to see everything work out well for New York.”\n \n\n   \n  In the final stretches of the mayoral race, Trump had struck a far more antagonistic tone,  throwing his weight behind former Democratic governor and independent candidate Andrew Cuomo  in the hopes of stalling Mamdani’s momentum.\n \n\n   \n  “If Communist Candidate Zohran Mamdani wins the Election for Mayor of New York City, it is highly unlikely that I will be contributing Federal Funds, other than the very minimum as required, to my beloved first home, because of the fact that, as a Communist, this once great City has ZERO chance of success, or even survival!” Trump wrote just two days before Election Day.\n \n\n   \n  Previewing a potential meeting with Trump Wednesday, Mamdani told MS Now, “I want to just speak plainly to the president about what it means to actually stand up for New Yorkers and the way in which New Yorkers are struggling to afford this city, and frankly, cost of living is something that I heard time and time again from New Yorkers about why they voted for Donald Trump.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/entertainment/jonathan-joss-murder-texas-man-indicted","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"20:29:00-05:00","title":"Texas Man Indicted on Murder Charge in Shooting of 'King of the Hill' Voice Actor Jonathan Joss","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A grand jury in Texas has indicted Sigfredo Ceja Alvarez on murder charges for the shooting of Jonathan Joss, a voice actor best known for his role as John Redcorn on 'King of the Hill' and Chief Ken Hotate on 'Parks and Recreation'.

But San Antonio Police Chief William McManus later walked back that statement, saying it had been “premature” and that whether Joss’ sexual orientation played a role in the shooting was “part of the investigation.”\n \n\n   \n  The district attorney’s office said in a statement Wednesday that Ceja Alvarez “is charged with murder, which is the most serious charge applicable to this crime under Texas law.

\n   \n  As cases of potentially deadly botulism in babies who drank ByHeart infant formula continue to grow, state officials say they are still finding the  recalled product  on some store shelves.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile the company reported late Wednesday that laboratory tests confirmed that some samples of formula were contaminated with the type of bacteria that has sickened more than 30 babies in the outbreak.\n \n\n   \n  Tests by an independent food safety laboratory found Clostridium botulinum, a bacterium that produces toxins that can lead to potentially life threatening illness in babies younger than 1, the company said on its website. ByHeart officials said they notified the U.S. Food and Drug Administration of the findings but did not specify how many samples were tested or how many were positive.\n \n\n   \n  “We are working to investigate the facts, conduct ongoing testing to identify the source, and ensure this does not happen to families again,” ByHeart said on its website.\n \n\n   \n  The FDA did not immediately respond to questions about the findings.\n \n\n   \n  The lab results come as investigators in at least three states found ByHeart formula still for sale even after the New York-based company recalled all products nationwide, officials told The Associated Press.\n \n\n   \n  At least 31 babies in 15 states who drank ByHeart formula have been hospitalized and treated for infantile botulism since August,  federal health officials said Wednesday.  They range in age from about 2 weeks to about 6 months, with the most recent case reported on Nov. 13.\n \n\n   \n  No deaths have been reported.\n \n\n   \n  In Oregon, nine of more than 150 stores checked still had the formula on shelves this week, a state agriculture official said. In Minnesota, investigators conducted 119 checks between Nov. 13 and Nov. 17 and removed recalled products from sale at four sites, an agriculture department official said. An Arizona health official also said they found the product available.\n \n\n   \n  Businesses and consumers should remain alert, Minnesota officials said in a statement. “No affected product should be sold or consumed,” they wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration conducted inspections at ByHeart manufacturing plants in Allerton, Iowa, and Portland, Oregon. No results from the inspections have been reported.\n \n\n   \n  California officials previously confirmed the germ that can lead to illness in an open can of ByHeart formula fed to a baby who fell ill.\n \n\n   \n   Infant botulism,  which can cause paralysis and death, is caused by a type of bacteria that forms spores that germinate in a baby’s gut and produce a toxin.\n \n\n   \n  Symptoms can take up to 30 days to develop and include constipation, poor feeding, a weak cry, drooping eyelids or a flat facial expression. Babies can develop weakness in their limbs and head and may feel “floppy.” They can have trouble swallowing or breathing.\n \n\n   \n  ByHeart had been manufacturing about 200,000 cans of formula per month. It was sold online or at retail stores such as Target and Walmart. A Walmart spokesperson said the company swiftly issued a restriction that prevented sale of the formula, removed the product from stores and notified consumers who had bought it. Customers can visit any store for a refund of the formula, which sold for about $42 per can.\n \n\n   \n  Federal and state health officials are concerned that some parents and caregivers may still have ByHeart products in their homes. They are advising consumers to stop using the product — including formula in cans and any singe-serve sticks. They also suggest marking it “DO NOT USE” and keeping it for at least a month in case a baby develops symptoms. In that case, the formula would need to be tested.\n \n\n   \n  The California health department operates the Infant Botulism Treatment and Prevention Program, which tracks cases and distributes treatment for the disease. Officials there have launched a public hotline at 833-398-2022, which is staffed with health officials from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. Pacific Standard Time.\n \n\n   \n  The new hotline was created after calls from hundreds of parents and caregivers flooded a different, longstanding hotline for doctors to discuss suspected infant botulism cases, officials said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/politics/ryan-wedding-justice-charges","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"20:34:00-05:00","title":"Federal officials unveil more charges against former Olympic snowboarder accused of running international drug ring","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Federal officials have announced new charges against Ryan James Wedding, a former Canadian Olympic snowboarder, accusing him of running an international drug trafficking ring that transported cocaine from Colombia through Mexico into the U.S. and Canada.

Will he actually release them all? \n       \n  Analysis by Aaron Blake, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:56 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Both chambers of Congress passed legislation this week  forcing the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files , after President Donald Trump  capitulated  and blessed the bill. Trump said Wednesday night he had signed it.\n \n\n   \n  Now the question has quickly become: Will the Trump administration  actually release everything  the Justice Department has? Plenty of supporters of the legislation, including Republicans, have been quick to caution that this isn’t the end of the matter — that the White House might still have ways to get around that.\n \n\n   \n  “The real test will be: Will the Department of Justice release the files?” Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia said Tuesday. “Or will it all remain tied up in investigations?”\n \n\n   \n  GOP Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky — the co-sponsor of the effort in the House to force a vote on the issue — has warned of a “last-ditch effort” by the administration to block the release of the files.\n \n\n   \n  These lawmakers have good reason to worry, based on the administration’s actions and comments. Attorney General Pam Bondi on Wednesday declined to provide assurances beyond saying the administration would “follow the law.”\n \n\n   \n  But it’s also difficult to see how the administration could not follow through with releasing the files — at least without risking yet another major political fiasco.\n \n\n   \n    The administration’s suspicious moves\n \n\n   \n  First, some background. There is a clear path for the administration to try and hold some documents back.\n \n\n   \n  It goes like this:\n \n\n   \n  That’s a very convenient progression of events if your goal is to try and withhold documents.\n \n\n   \n  Suddenly an investigation that was completely exhausted and needed to be closed has some supposedly juicy new leads that are worth pursuing. And this happens right at the time when Trump needs just such a pretext to keep avoiding full disclosure.\n \n\n   \n  There are certainly other reasons for Trump to want those investigations – including making it look like it’s  other  people (ones often associated with Democrats) who have Epstein problems, and not him. (Neither Trump nor the people he asked to be investigated have been accused by law enforcement of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.)\n \n\n   \n    The administration has played games on this before\n \n\n   \n  There are other reasons to be suspicious about how the administration might handle this.\n \n\n   \n  For one, it’s  already been  shown to be playing games  on Epstein disclosures.\n \n\n   \n  When the situation first blew up in its face in July, the administration’s first big effort to quell the backlash was to push for judges to release grand jury materials. But as plenty of experts quickly noted, that was unlikely to actually shed much light for a host of reasons.\n \n\n   \n  Sure enough, it did not shed much light. But not only that; two judges suggested the administration was proactively creating a “diversion.” One said the move appeared “ aimed not at full disclosure but at the illusion of such .”\n \n\n   \n  Both noted the government had much more extensive information at its fingertips that it could release whenever it wanted to.\n \n\n   \n  Given this, it wouldn’t seem ridiculous to ask whether the administration might play games with whatever discretion it has — say, by releasing information that’s politically advantageous but withholding other information using the available justifications.\n \n\n   \n    Why Trump and Co. have said they didn’t want full disclosure\n \n\n   \n  And then there are the many things Trump and top officials have said warning about the dangers of full disclosure.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has repeatedly cited the need to protect “innocent” people – not just victims, but also people whose names turn up in the documents who did nothing wrong. Just corresponding with Epstein, for example, would not be a crime.\n \n\n   \n  “You got a lot of people that could be mentioned in those files that don’t deserve to be,” Trump said in August, “because (Epstein) knew everybody in Palm Beach.”\n \n\n   \n  The FBI’s July memo that announced it wouldn’t be releasing any new documents cited a desire “to protect victims” and “not expose any additional third-parties to allegations of illegal wrongdoing.”\n \n\n   \n  FBI Director Kash Patel in September testimony to Congress and elsewhere has suggested that part of the reason the administration has resisted full disclosure was to guard against releasing pornography. He also suggested that releasing more information could violate court orders.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not going to break the law to satisfy your curiosity,” Patel told a House Democrat.\n \n\n   \n  And House Speaker Mike Johnson on Tuesday argued that the Epstein bill could hurt people whose “names may be in these files, and they had nothing to do with this.” The Louisiana Republican also made an impassioned case that the bill did not adequately prevent the release of child sexual abuse material, despite a clause intended to do that.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson ultimately voted for the bill, saying he hoped the Senate would amend it. But Senate Majority Leader John Thune apparently didn’t share his concerns, allowing the bill to pass by unanimous consent without amendment.\n \n\n   \n  Given all of this — and given Trump’s clear reluctance for months to grant such disclosure, right  up until the moment the battle appeared lost  — you could see how the administration might want to at least preserve its options.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said Sunday that Congress “can have whatever they are legally entitled to,” but the phrase “legally entitled to” certainly looms large, for the reasons mentioned above.\n \n\n   \n    But not releasing would be a huge risk\n \n\n   \n  Even if the administration is reserving its options or intends to withhold significant documents, it’s hard to see how doing that could pass muster politically.\n \n\n   \n  For one, the legislation requires the withholding of documents related to active investigations to be “narrowly tailored and temporary.” Trump has more than three years remaining in his presidency; it’s difficult to see the administration withholding significant information for that long citing active investigations.\n \n\n   \n  For another, anything that’s redacted or withheld must include a written justification, and the administration must notify Congress about these categories of documents within 15 days. The legislation also requires the administration to give Congress an unredacted “list of all government officials and politically exposed persons” included in the materials.\n \n\n   \n  In other words, it could be pretty easy to piece together if the administration is hiding extensive amounts of information. What’s more, attempting to do that could risk an even bigger backlash than the administration has already seen, from even its own base.\n \n\n   \n  That doesn’t mean the administration wouldn’t  attempt  to withhold documents. Its handling of this matter  has been baffling  throughout.\n \n\n   \n  But if it did, that would be among the most desperate and politically risky things the administration has done — and at a time when it can’t really keep taking such hits.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/politics/arctic-frost-provision-senators-house-vote","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"19:02:00-05:00","title":"House Moves to Repeal Controversial 'Arctic Frost' Provision That Allows GOP Senators to Seek $500,000 Payouts","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. House of Representatives has unanimously passed a motion to repeal a controversial provision in a government funding bill that allows senators to sue the Justice Department for up to $500,000 in damages if their phone records are seized without prior notice.

Wednesday unanimously moved to repeal a controversial provision in the government funding law that allows senators to sue the Justice Department for up to $500,000 when their phone records are seized without their knowledge.\n \n\n   \n  The provision, included in the legislation that ended the historic shutdown, requires senators be notified when federal investigators access their phone records, with some exceptions. If they’re not notified, the lawmakers can sue the federal government for up to $500,000 in damages for each violation.\n \n\n   \n  House members publicly wary of the measure voted 426-0 to nullify the provision. But its future remains in doubt in the Senate, where Majority Leader John Thune had added it to the bill at the request of several members of his conference.\n \n\n   \n   Tucked into one of the appropriations bills , the language comes after Senate Republicans released FBI records related to an investigation called “Arctic Frost,” which pertained to the fake elector scheme from 2020 where Donald Trump allies pressured GOP electors to register Electoral College votes for Trump from states that former President Joe Biden won.\n \n\n   \n  It’s caused bipartisan furor on Capitol Hill and spotlighted a rare divide between the top Republican leaders. House Speaker Mike Johnson said he was blindsided by the measure, while Thune has resolutely stood behind it.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re striking the provision as fast as we can, and we expect the Senate to move it,” Republican Rep. Chip Roy of Texas told CNN Tuesday. “We believe there’s a fairly sizable growing majority over there that believes that they should strike it.”\n \n\n   \n  Some of the senators whose phone records were seized as part of Arctic Frost have tried to distance themselves from the legislation and  say they won’t seek  monetary damages.\n \n\n   \n  Missouri GOP Sen. Josh Hawley called it a “bad idea.”\n \n\n   \n  “I’m all for accountability. I mean, I had my phone tapped, so I’m all for accountability, don’t get me wrong, but I just, I think taking taxpayer money is not the way to do it. The way to do it is tough oversight,” he told reporters earlier Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for another member, Sen. Dan Sullivan, told CNN last week he does not plan on suing and is supportive of the House effort to repeal the provision.\n \n\n   \n  But at least one targeted senator is looking to reap gains.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Lindsey Graham on Wednesday said he plans on suing DOJ in his case for “far more” than $500,000, and advocated for expanding the measure to include private citizens.\n \n\n   \n  “You want to make sure that people who are going to issue subpoenas in the future against private citizens to get their phone records without a court order, I mean, without a warrant, have to think twice, and if the government doesn’t pay, you’re going to get more of this,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Mike Rounds, who was not one of the senators swept in Arctic Frost, explained that the measure was meant to “send a message to the administration that this can’t happen” in the wake of the news of then-special counsel Jack Smith’s subpoenas, though he predicted that many GOP senators would be “open for a reconsideration” depending on how the House approaches the issue.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Steve Daines, a Thune ally, said he doesn’t think House’s measure could pass the Senate, arguing that Smith’s move to obtain phone records of nine GOP lawmakers with grand jury subpoenas in his January 6 investigation was a “massive overreach.”\n \n\n   \n  “My name is not on the list, so I don’t benefit from this. This seems to be a strong pushback.

required federal agents to give warnings before deploying tear gas or other riot control weapons; and stipulated that almost all agents must wear clear identification and body cameras.\n \n\n   \n  The judge also ordered the government to turn over extensive use-of-force records and other internal records.\n \n\n   \n  But the appeals panel criticized the scope of Ellis’ order, saying it is so detailed it “resembled federal regulation.” They wrote that the order is so sweeping, it applies to almost any law enforcement personnel within the executive branch.\n \n\n   \n  “The district court’s order enjoins an expansive range of defendants, including the President of the United States, the entire Departments of Homeland Security and Justice, and anyone acting in concert with them,” the panel wrote in its decision.\n \n\n   \n  The order comes one day before Ellis is set to issue her written opinion in the case that has required a high-level Border Patrol agent, Greg Bovino, to  appear before her  in a downtown Chicago federal courtroom.\n \n\n   \n  However, the pause of Ellis’ order is only temporary as it considers the Trump administration’s larger appeal.\n \n\n   \n  “Do not overread today’s order,” the judges wrote, noting that they have a ream of facts to consider. “Those findings may support entry of a more tailored and appropriate preliminary injunction that directly addresses the First and Fourth Amendment claims raised by these plaintiffs.”\n \n\n   \n  At times, Ellis has chided ICE officials and federal attorneys in open court, saying their statements often “lack credibility.”\n \n\n   \n  The judge expressed particular skepticism over a confrontation between federal agents and protesters in which DHS said use of force was justified because Bovino was hit in the head with a rock thrown by a demonstrator. Video did not support the claim and “ defendant Bovino admitted that he lied ,” the judge said.\n \n\n   \n  In its written decision, the appeals panel appeared to question whether the plaintiffs suing the Trump administration still have a strong enough claim, as the federal presence in Chicago has tapered off while federal agents  flood into Charlotte, North Carolina, and prepare to enter New Orleans .\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration is battling on multiple legal fronts as it attempts to carry out what it hopes will be a history-making national immigration crackdown. As federal agents have rounded up thousands of migrants across  Tennessee, California, Oregon, Illinois and other states, it has been met with a wall of lawsuits from protesters, detainees and state and local governments who object to its escalating tactics.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/sport/football-nfl-kris-boyd-jets-shooting","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"20:26:00.000Z","title":"Jets Cornerback Kris Boyd Starts Breathing on His Own After Midtown Shooting","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Kris Boyd, a 29-year-old cornerback with the New York Jets, was shot in the abdomen in midtown Manhattan on November 16, 2025, just after 2 a.m., near Madison Square Garden and Times Square.

I’m coming along, starting to breathe on my own now.

He added that Boyd was “upbeat” in their recent conversation.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s what eases my mind, is that he’s in good spirits,” Glenn said. “His wife and his kid, they’re in good spirits and he will walk away from this just fine.”\n \n\n   \n  Glenn was unsure when Boyd might be released from the hospital, where he has been listed in critical but stable condition.\n \n\n   \n  “Don’t know just yet,” the coach said. “But I will say this, just talking to him, he felt really upbeat. And again, that’s what gives me comfort, that he feels like that and he’s talking that way.”\n \n\n   \n  New York police released surveillance images Monday of a man sought in the shooting of Boyd. A motive for the shooting remains under investigation and authorities said it’s not clear if Boyd was targeted by the shooter. No other injuries were reported.\n \n\n   \n  The shooting happened just after 2 a.m. Sunday about halfway between Madison Square Garden and Times Square. Boyd, 29, was taken to Bellevue Hospital after being shot in the abdomen, police said. The shooter fled the scene.\n \n\n   \n  Glenn said Boyd has been on his mind “a ton” since he heard about the shooting. The coach said Boyd and his wife recently welcomed a baby.\n \n\n   \n  “The first thing I thought about, he just had a kid,” Glenn said. “And I’m thinking about his wife, I’m thinking about his kid and I want to make sure that he’s OK. And that’s the only thing that really went through my mind. …\n \n\n   \n  “There’s a process to this, which I won’t get into, but I’m happy at the fact that he’s going to come out of this thing really, really well.”\n \n\n   \n  Boyd hasn’t played this season, his first with the Jets, after going on the season-ending injured reserve list on Aug. 18 with a shoulder injury that required surgery to repair.\n \n\n   \n  He signed with New York as a free agent in March and was expected to be a key part of a revamped special teams unit under Glenn and special teams coordinator Chris Banjo. But Boyd was injured during a training camp practice Aug. 2 and carted from the field.\n \n\n   \n  Boyd has remained around the team throughout the season while recovering from the shoulder injury.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s been a part of what we’re doing,” Glenn said. “I mean, he comes to the games all the time. He’s fully engaged. To be one of the top special teams players in this league, he’s done a really good job of helping the other guys we have.”\n \n\n   \n  Boyd, a Texas native, played his first four seasons with Minnesota after being a seventh-round pick by the Vikings out of the University of Texas in 2019. He signed with the Arizona Cardinals in 2023 and then joined Houston’s practice squad later that season. Boyd signed a one-year contract worth $1.6 million with the Jets in March.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/health/new-jersey-organ-transplant-investigation","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00-05:00","title":"New Jersey Organ Procurement Organization Under Congressional Investigation After 'Alarming' Whistleblower Claims","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The US House Ways and Means Committee is investigating the New Jersey Organ and Tissue Sharing Network (NJTO) over serious allegations of unethical and possibly illegal behavior, including procuring organs from individuals who did not consent to donation, continuing organ recovery on a patient who reanimated, falsifying records, and giving organs out of order on transplant lists.

One of the incidents it highlights involves an unnamed patient at the Virtua Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Camden, New Jersey. The patient was pronounced dead and the network started the process to recover their organs, the letter says, but soon after the recovery process began, the person “reanimated.”\n \n\n   \n  The procurement team called the network’s chief executive officer to find out what to do. Witnesses told the committee that the CEO instructed the NJTO staff on site to “proceed with recovery,” according to the letter. “However, hospital staff intervened, and recovery did not move forward.”\n \n\n   \n  Neither the hospital nor the procurement organization responded to CNN’s requests for comment.\n \n\n   \n  The committee described the case as “shocking” and “alarming” and said several whistleblowers told investigators that documents with regard to details about the case were deleted or manipulated.\n \n\n   \n  The committee’s letter also alleges that the New Jersey Sharing Network misused documents to tell patients’ families it had authority to remove organs, even if the patient was not currently listed as an organ donor on their driver’s license or, in some cases, had withdrawn their permission to donate; may have procured and thrown out hundreds of organs just to meet federal metrics; and gave organs to people out of sequence on the transplant list.\n \n\n   \n  “This is unacceptable,” the letter says. “The organs procured by every [organ procurement organization] across the country belong to the individuals on the waitlist who are ranked and matched using medical criteria. They do not belong to the OPOs, and it is not NJTO’s role to pick winners and losers on the transplant waiting list.”\n \n\n   \n  The letter also says the organization has made misleading statements to Congress throughout the investigation.\n \n\n   \n  “These allegations raise questions about whether NJTO should keep its tax-exempt status and highlights the need for potential legislative reforms,” the letter says.\n \n\n   \n  The House Ways and Means Committee has asked the New Jersey organization to send additional documents including any complaints it has received, documents from the head of the organization and staff communications, as well as any more unredacted documents related to the patient in the Camden case.\n \n\n   \n  The letter is the latest development in the committee’s focus on the nation’s organ procurement groups.\n \n\n   \n  In July,  the committee sent a letter  to the Indiana Donor Network with regard to its use of private jets for non-mission charter flights. It also demanded documents from the Miami-area Life Alliance Organ Recovery Agency, and  after its investigation , the US Department of Health and Human Services moved to decertify the organization – essentially shutting the operation down – in September.\n \n\n   \n  The investigation found unsafe practices, staff shortages and paperwork errors,  according to HHS . Agency Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said at the time that the move was meant as a “clear warning” to other donor organizations.\n \n\n   \n  In September, the committee sent a letter to the Network for Hope, a Kentucky-based organ procurement organization, that demanded documents related to practices it considered unsafe.\n \n\n   \n   In one case  four years ago in Richmond, Kentucky, a man says he woke up on the operating table while a recovery team was shaving his chest to take his organs.\n \n\n   \n  Witnesses say the hospital staffers were pressured by people within the organization to continue with the procedure, but a local surgeon refused to continue the operation when she saw that the man wasn’t dead. The Kentucky Attorney General’s Office has also been investigating the case.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/us/prairieland-detention-center-texas-guilty-pleas","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"19:00:00-05:00","title":"Five accused of supporting antifa plead guilty to terrorism-related offense after Texas shooting","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Five individuals — Nathan Baumann, Joy Gibson, Seth Sikes, Lynette Sharp, and John Thomas — pleaded guilty in federal court in Fort Worth to providing material support to terrorists, following a July 4, 2025, shooting at the Prairieland Detention Center in Dallas, Texas.

\n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  Federal prosecutors on Wednesday charged a man with committing a terrorist attack for allegedly  setting a woman on fire  on a Chicago train.\n \n\n   \n  Lawrence Reed was sitting at the back of a car on a Blue Line L train on Monday night when he approached a woman as she sat with her back to him, according to a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives arrest affidavit. Reed removed the cap from a plastic bottle, then doused the woman with what was believed to be gasoline, the affidavit said.\n \n\n   \n  The 26-year-old woman then ran to the back of the train car. Reed ignited the bottle, approached the woman and set her on fire, according to the affidavit. Surveillance video showed Reed at a gas station about 30 minutes before the attack, filling a small container with gasoline, the affidavit says.\n \n\n   \n  The federal charge against Reed, 50, of Chicago, carries a maximum penalty of life in prison.\n \n\n   \n  Federal court records do not show whether Reed has an attorney representing him in the federal case. Chicago outlets reported that Reed was disruptive during his first appearance in a federal court on Wednesday afternoon, including yelling over the judge that he wanted to represent himself and claiming that he was a Chinese citizen.\n \n\n   \n  Reed shouted, “I plead guilty!” repeatedly as the judge tried to advise him of his rights, according to local news reports.\n \n\n   \n  After the attack, the train the woman was on pulled into a stop downtown. Reed walked away and the woman stumbled out and fell on the ground, police said. She was taken to a hospital in critical condition with severe burns to her head and body, authorities said. Officials have not released her name.\n \n\n   \n  Chicago police said that when they arrested him Tuesday morning he made incriminating statements about the attack. He was wearing the same clothes as the man who attacked the woman on the train, according to the affidavit.\n \n\n   \n  Reed carried out the attack “with the intent to cause death and serious bodily injury to one or more persons” on the train, the ATF investigator wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Chicago police did not answer questions Wednesday by The Associated Press on whether it had or would refer charges against Reed to state prosecutors, instead referring all questions to federal authorities.\n \n\n   \n  Monday’s attack drew comparisons to an August stabbing on a commuter train in Charlotte, North Carolina, that left another young woman dead. Federal authorities have charged a man with fatally stabbing 23-year-old  Iryna Zarutska , a Ukrainian refugee, in an apparent random attack.\n \n\n   \n   Chicago  and other Democratic-led cities have been the focus of intense criticism from President Donald Trump and his administration, who have characterized them as crime-ridden despite a drop in violent crime after  a pandemic-era spike .\n \n\n   \n  That criticism continued after Monday’s attack in Chicago, with U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy highlighting it in a social media post.\n \n\n   \n  “This horrific attack is EXACTLY why we need communities to take safety seriously. Blue cities cannot allow another Iryna Zarutska to happen,” Duffy wrote on X.\n \n\n   \n  The Chicago Transit Authority said it was working closely with police in the investigation and that it has a multipronged approach to security, including the use of surveillance cameras.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/politics/comey-vindictive-prosecution-hearing-lindsey-halligan-grand-jury-takeaways","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"18:10:00.000Z","title":"What to know about Lindsey Halligan’s big grand jury revelation at James Comey’s vindictive-prosecution hearing","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During a hearing on the prosecution of former FBI Director James Comey, US Attorney Lindsey Halligan admitted that only the grand jury foreperson and one other juror saw the final indictment, not the full grand jury.

What to know about Lindsey Halligan’s big grand jury revelation at James Comey’s vindictive-prosecution hearing \n       \n  By Hannah Rabinowitz, Holmes Lybrand, Katelyn  Polantz, Casey Gannon, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:10 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The hearing Wednesday morning in the case against former FBI Director James Comey ended with a revelation by prosecutors and a conundrum: if a full grand jury never reviewed the final set of charges handed up against Comey, are they void?\n \n\n   \n  The question arose after a shocking back and forth where prosecutors conceded that instead of presenting a new indictment to the grand jury after it declined to approve one of three counts, interim US Attorney Lindsey Halligan simply brought an altered version, omitting the rejected count, to the magistrate’s courtroom for the grand jury’s foreperson to sign.\n \n\n   \n  Her admission sent shockwaves through the courtroom on Wednesday, where attorneys were gathered to argue a separate legal issue of whether Comey was charged only because of President Donald Trump’s animus toward him.\n \n\n   \n  What will happen to the criminal case was not immediately clear. Judge Michael Nachmanoff, despite appearing exasperated and taking several seconds of silence to take in what the prosecutors admitted, did not give away whether he viewed the issue as a procedural or fatal error.\n \n\n   \n  Nachmanoff did not make any rulings from the bench, saying that the issues before him were too  “weighty”  to immediately decide.\n \n\n   \n  But the judge ask the Justice Department to address Wednesday their legal interpretation of what happened with the grand jury, and the revelation is likely to play into another ongoing fight in the case where defense attorneys have asserted that federal investigators and top prosecutor Halligan mishandled the case.\n \n\n   \n  In a brief filed Wednesday evening, the Justice Department defended Halligan’s grand jury presentation and said the case should not be dismissed. The final indictment was reviewed by the grand jury foreperson and another representative — and then explained on the record in open court that it was reflective of the grand jury vote, the Justice Department wrote.\n \n\n   \n  The former FBI director has pleaded not guilty to lying during congressional testimony.\n \n\n   \n    The stunning admission\n \n\n   \n   Nachmanoff called on Halligan  — Trump’s handpicked US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia who secured the indictment against Comey by herself — to explain exactly what grand jurors did, or did not, see.\n \n\n   \n  Halligan appeared frustrated as she confirmed that only the foreperson and one other juror – not the entire grand jury – saw the final indictment. In the brief exchange, she tried to answer the judge before he finished asking his question and concluded the exchange with a terse “OK.”\n \n\n   \n  The back and forth lasted about one minute.\n \n\n   \n  Nachmanoff also trained his attention on a different prosecutor on the case, Tyler Lemons, and asked him to explicitly confirm that the final document was never presented to the grand jury.\n \n\n   \n  “I wasn’t there, but that is my understanding,” Lemons said.\n \n\n   \n  After the hearing concluded, people connected with the prosecutors’ office told CNN that they weren’t sure  how problematic Halligan’s admission will be  for the case. Some may consider it a clerical error that could be fixed, while others see a possibility it could be the fatal flaw in the case, as Comey’s team initially argued on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors have six months to “cure” an indictment that was dismissed over legal issues, according to the  Justice Department manual , even if the statute of limitations has expired – as is the case for Comey’s charges.\n \n\n   \n  Comey’s attorney Michael Dreeben said that, given the testimony of the prosecutor, “no indictment was returned.”\n \n\n   \n  And even if it is a legal problem, a grand jury document flub may pale in comparison to other issues that have arisen in the case and are still playing out in court, including regarding what Halligan told the grand jurors about Comey’s rights, the evidence and the law.\n \n\n   \n    Grand jury transcripts\n \n\n   \n  The issue over the indictment could also aid in defense attorneys’ efforts to gain access to the grand jury transcripts, an issue that is currently before a magistrate judge in the same courthouse.\n \n\n   \n  That judge initially allowed Comey’s team to have access to the grand jury material, finding in his own review that “the record points to a disturbing pattern of profound investigative missteps.”\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors quickly asked the magistrate judge to pause the order so that they could file an appeal, which the magistrate judge allowed.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Ms. Halligan was not a puppet’\n \n\n   \n  The hearing focused primarily on defense attorneys’ efforts to have the case dismissed because, they argue, it was brought at the direction of Trump and born from his animosity toward Comey.\n \n\n   \n  “The president of the United States has caused the executive branch to prosecute a perceived enemy,” Dreeben began his arguments.\n \n\n   \n  Dreeben, citing a  social media post  from Trump addressed to the attorney general and calling for the prosecution of Comey and other political enemies, argued that the president has gone after the former director to “punish Mr. Comey for speaking out against him.”\n \n\n   \n  Lemons pushed back, arguing that Comey was making “inferential leaps” in arguing that the case is selective and vindictive.\n \n\n   \n  The prosecutor said that there is “no proof” that Halligan took Trump’s social media post “as a charge.”\n \n\n   \n  “Ms. Halligan was not a puppet,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Still, the judge questioned “what independent examination could she have made” in the few days between her appointment and the charges being brought against Comey.\n \n\n   \n    DOJ refuses to say if a memo declining to prosecute Comey exists\n \n\n   \n  Nachmanoff also pressed Lemons on whether previous prosecutors who worked on the case before Halligan’s appointment had submitted a memo recommending that Comey not be prosecuted.\n \n\n   \n  Lemons told the judge that someone in Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche’s office told him he couldn’t disclose  “privileged” information  without their permission, which included the existence of any memo.\n \n\n   \n  “At this point, my position would be, whether there was a declination memo, is privileged,” Lemons said, adding that “I don’t know in the world of documents there is a declination memo.”\n \n\n   \n  Nachmanoff challenged the assertion, pushing Lemons to eventually say that “someone in the Deputy Attorney General’s office” had instructed him not to say anything.\n \n\n   \n  Asked why, Lemons demurred, conceding briefly that he has “reviewed” draft memorandums – both declination and prosecution memos – and other internal communications, but declined to give additional details.\n \n\n   \n  “I hope you understand that I am trying to answer your questions,” Lemons said.\n \n\n   \n    Justice Department defends Halligan’s work\n \n\n   \n  Federal prosecutors in their Wednesday brief defended Lindsey Halligan’s handling of the grand jury proceedings against Comey.\n \n\n   \n  At the end of Wednesday’s hearing, Nachmanoff instructed the parties to review a case in Washington, DC, from the late 1960s that dealt with similar grand jury issues.\n \n\n   \n  But in that case, prosecutors argued in their brief, “the grand jury never saw any version of the eventual indictment.”\n \n\n   \n  “In this case, the grand jury was provided the proposed Indictment, deliberated, and determined that probable cause existed to believe that the defendant had committed the crimes charged in two counts,” prosecutors said.\n \n\n   \n  The grand jury did not hand up an indictment on a third charge prosecutors attempted to bring against Comey.\n \n\n   \n  After their vote, according to prosecutors, only the foreperson and one other grand juror remained when a final version of the indictment – that omitted the third charge that was rejected – was signed by the foreperson.\n \n\n   \n  “Only the numbering of the counts (i.e., proposed Count Two became Count One, and proposed Count Three became Count Two) and the paragraphs differ,” prosecutors said in their brief.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors argue the case doesn’t need to be dismissed “given that the grand jury was presented with the two counts on which it voted to return an indictment and in fact voted upon those counts.”\n \n\n   \n  “Grand Jury foreperson, as the representative of the Grand Jury, endorsed the revised two count Indictment by signing it and explaining on the record in open Court that the Indictment reflected the vote of the Grand Jury,” prosecutors continued.\n \n\n   \n  A magistrate judge earlier this week made the rare decision to order prosecutors to give Comey’s team all grand jury materials, including transcripts and recordings of the secret process.\n \n\n   \n  That judge, William Fitzpatrick, said his review of those transcripts and recordings suggested that the grand jury could have been shown privileged evidence or given false instructions by the attorney who presented the case, Lindsey Halligan.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors strongly pushed back against that, too, arguing Fitzpatrick had quoted portions of Halligan’s presentation and not her statements in full.\n \n\n   \n  “The magistrate judge’s recommendation is grounded in misreadings of the transcript, incorrect legal conclusions, and factual assumptions that the record directly disproves,” prosecutors wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “The U.S. Attorney did not misstate the law, the grand jury was not misled, and the transcript shows a routine, regular presentation of the indictment,” they said.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article

Two federal   agents emerged and asked the landscapers for their papers. Hamilton joined the men on the lawn and started recording. Shortly after, the agents retreated.\n \n\n   \n  The abruptness of the incident took Hamilton by surprise,  mirroring the shock local officials and residents  felt as Charlotte became the latest city caught up this year in a string of targeted immigration actions.\n \n\n   \n  What began in Charlotte quickly spread to other cities in the state as the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration crackdown continues to expand nationally.  Gregory Bovino , the top Border Patrol official charged with enforcement operations, is expected to head to New Orleans in coming weeks.\n \n\n   \n  Here is where things stand:\n \n\n   \n    Next city to be targeted may already be in enforcement crackdown’s sights\n \n\n   \n  While the spotlight has been focused on North Carolina’s most populated city, immigration enforcement action has started to spread to other areas of the state and is expected to reach New Orleans within weeks.\n \n\n   \n  Bovino – who for many has become the face of the crackdown – is expected to arrive in New Orleans, where he once served as chief patrol agent, the first week of December, according to two sources familiar with the planning.\n \n\n   \n  The Department of Homeland Security is expected to deploy 250 agents in Louisiana – roughly in line with the number of agents  sent to other cities to assist Bovino, the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump has previously floated New Orleans as a destination for his federal crackdown, saying in an Oval Office meeting this year his administration was “making a determination.”\n \n\n   \n  As immigration enforcement is expected to spread further throughout the South, Customs and Border Protection agents  were seen Tuesday in North Carolina’s Wake and Durham counties , Raleigh Mayor Janet Cowell said during a City Council meeting. The counties are home to Raleigh and Durham, two of the state’s other major cities and part of the Research Triangle, with Chapel Hill.\n \n\n   \n  “We are just encouraging everyone, if you feel unsafe or you see something that you think is illegal, to please call the Raleigh Police Department or your local jurisdiction and to stay safe,” Cowell said.\n \n\n   \n  Residents of Cary, North Carolina, west of Raleigh, have  also reported seeing federal agents  at hospitals, restaurants and construction sites, Mayor Harold Weinbrecht told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Protesters  gathered at Moore Square in downtown Raleigh  on Tuesday night, holding American flags and signs printed with slogans like, “No fear no hate, no ICE in our state” and “Respect due process,” aerial footage from CNN affiliate WRAL shows.\n \n\n   \n    DHS arrests more than 250 people in Charlotte\n \n\n   \n  Over 250 people have been arrested in immigration raids in Charlotte since the weekend, DHS said in an update Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Among those arrested are “numerous criminal illegal aliens with extensive immigration and criminal histories, including domestic violence, assault, breaking and entering, larceny, and driving while intoxicated,” a Wednesday DHS statement said.   \n \n\n   \n  DHS Secretary Kristi Noem  said Tuesday  the Charlotte operation was based on previous investigative work, specifically citing “a high number of child abuse, trafficking, neglect type of instances that we had identified over our work there.”\n \n\n   \n  Two men were  federally charged in Charlotte  Tuesday for allegedly using their vehicles in separate incidents to assault federal officers who were conducting immigration enforcement, according to Russ Ferguson, the US Attorney for the Western District of North Carolina. The charges don’t stem from protests in the area, the US attorney said.\n \n\n   \n  A woman was also charged Wednesday after she allegedly assaulted a federal agent outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Charlotte, the US attorney’s office  said in a news release . The 44-year-old woman is accused of “grabbing the officer’s shoulders and attempting to jump on the officer’s back” while the officer was trying to arrest another person Sunday, the release said.\n \n\n   \n    Attorneys are turning to creative measures to find their clients\n \n\n   \n  The uptick in immigration detentions in Charlotte and the absence of information from the federal government has prompted some immigration attorneys to get creative in how they track clients being held in ICE custody.\n \n\n   \n  One of those attorneys is Gigi Gardner, a North Carolina immigration attorney, who said her client was detained on Tuesday after attending a routine ICE check-in.\n \n\n   \n     Her client – who she didn’t name, citing safety and client confidentiality concerns – has been in the US for roughly 40 years and has checked in with ICE annually, Gardner said.\n \n\n   \n     After failed attempts to get into the ICE office late last week due to a high volume of people, Gardner’s client checked in Tuesday, when he was detained, she said. Gardner and her client’s wife tracked his whereabouts by using the location of his AirPods, she said.\n \n\n   \n  They tracked his movements to  Folkston, Georgia, where there’s an ICE detention center . The AirPod’s battery appeared to die and it wasn’t until Wednesday morning that the man called his wife to say he had been transferred again – this time, to Jacksonville, Florida, Gardner said.\n \n\n   \n  “Nothing has changed. He has an attorney. And he was unable to contact me. They haven’t sent me any paperwork. They haven’t told me where he is. And they still haven’t told me where he is,” she said, referring to ICE.\n \n\n   \n    Charlotte community takes some tips from Chicago\n \n\n   \n  While the targeted immigration raids were unexpected to many of those in the Charlotte community, they were ready to meet the moment.\n \n\n   \n  People throughout Charlotte  were seen Monday  using many of the tactics employed in Chicago – including watching for raids, blowing warning whistles and carrying signs advising people of their rights.\n \n\n   \n  The support from residents across the city is palpable. Flags from Honduras, Colombia and Mexico are seen adorning cars and hanging from homes and buisinesses, a stark difference from what could be seen as recently as a week ago.\n \n\n   \n  Their vigilance comes as many businesses across the city have closed their doors, fearing their customers will be a target. About  half the mom-and-pop businesses  the community development organization  CharlotteEast  works with have closed their doors at some point, despite all of them being owned by US citizens, Executive Director Greg Asciutto said Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  “From strictly an economic standpoint, it’s pretty catastrophic right now,” Asciutto said, comparing current closures to the first week of the coronavirus pandemic in the area.\n \n\n   \n  A Colombian bakery open for 28 years closed its doors Saturday after men in tactical gear   chased and tackled people outside the shop. A program for immigrant and refugee children  was also suspended until further notice  Monday after Border Patrol was active at their site.\n \n\n   \n  A local laundromat is taking a different approach, with  the owner locking their doors  while customers are inside in an attempt to keep them safe.\n \n\n   \n  In Raleigh, more than 600 volunteers signed up in the overnight hours to help others travel within the city when the community became aware that federal agents intended to come to the area Tuesday, Siembra NC, a statewide immigrant worker organizing group, said.\n \n\n   \n  “By early morning, trained volunteers were dispatched throughout Raleigh as safety patrols ready to assist neighbors in getting to school and work safely,” a release from the organization said.\n \n\n   \n    About 20% of students absent from Charlotte-area schools Monday\n \n\n   \n  More than  30,000 students were absent  from Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools on Monday, about 20% of the district’s enrollment. CNN has reached out to the district to see how attendance was affected Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  The district  issued a statement Sunday night  saying no immigration activity had happened on their campuses and noting leaders hadn’t been informed of impending action. There were no reports of immigration enforcement on their campuses on Monday or Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  “CMS follows all federal and state laws protecting students’ right to a public education. The U.S. Supreme Court guarantees that all children, regardless of immigration status, have the right to attend public school,” CMS Assistant Communications Officer Tom Miner said in a statement to school district families.\n \n\n   \n  High school students in the district  staged a walkout Tuesday morning  to protest immigration enforcement in the city. Several hundred students gathered around the edge of a football field at East Mecklenburg High School, many wearing black and holding flags, an aerial Getty photo of the demonstration showed.\n \n\n   \n    North Carolina governor and local leaders denounce the raids\n \n\n   \n  Many Democratic leaders across North Carolina have denounced the raids.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve reached out to the White House,”  North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein said Tuesday.  “We haven’t gotten any word. We’re not hearing directly from Customs and Border Patrol, so we don’t know for sure where they’re going, how long they’ll be here, where else they’re going.”\n \n\n   \n  Stein went on to criticize the tactics used by federal agents, saying they are “not promoting safety in our communities.”\n \n\n   \n  In the county where Charlotte is located,   the Mecklenburg Board of County Commissioners unanimously passed a resolution Tuesday to affirm constitutional protections and express support for the immigrant community.\n \n\n   \n  “This is not an issue of policy. This is an issue of morality,” Chair Mark Jerrell said. “It’s immoral to profile, to tear families apart. It’s not right to have people living in fear … This board declared tonight that we don’t condone it. We won’t stand for it.”\n \n\n   \n  While the governor and local leaders vocally oppose the federal action, North Carolina’s Republican Party  praised the immigration enforcement  operation, saying “the need is real.”\n \n\n   \n  Though some people are overwhelmed with the intensity of the moment, Councilmember LaWana Mayfield  said during a City Council committee meeting Monday  that this moment is “an opportunity to show up for each other.”\n \n\n   \n  “Get to know your neighbors, get their phone numbers, go to their back door, bring them over to your house so the children can feel safe, let the kids play together, because they don’t need to be going through all of this,” Mayfield said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/politics/melania-trump-usha-vance-north-carolina","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"17:46:00-05:00","title":"Melania Trump teams up with Usha Vance, visiting troops in North Carolina","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Melania Trump and Usha Vance made their first joint public appearance without their husbands, visiting military families at Camp Lejeune and Marine Corps Air Station New River in North Carolina.

2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Melania Trump joined second lady Usha Vance on Wednesday for a pre-Thanksgiving visit with North Carolina military families, offering the latest signal that the first lady is more actively engaging with her role after a quiet start to her second term.\n \n\n   \n  The pair met with service members and their families at Camp Lejeune and Marine Corps Air Station New River in a trip marking their first public joint appearance without their husbands 10 months into the Trump-Vance administration.\n \n\n   \n  The visit offered a rare opportunity to see their relationship on display – and highlighted the key issues that each woman has chosen to prioritize.\n \n\n   \n  The first lady shined a light on children’s well-being and the responsible use of technologies like artificial intelligence during a classroom visit with Lejeune High School students who are participating in the presidential AI challenge. In a presentation to their guests, students detailed how they use the technology for class projects – and the rules governing that usage.\n \n\n   \n  Children’s literacy was front and center for the second lady as Trump and Vance played games and did arts and craft projects with younger children at nearby DeLalio Elementary School. Trump donned a headband with an index card as she played a reading game with the children.\n \n\n   \n  Vance offered praise to her counterpart during remarks to service members at the conclusion of their trip.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m honored to introduce our first lady, who shares my deep gratitude for your sacrifices to secure our country’s safety and its well-being,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, Vance added, is “committed to bettering our nation by ensuring that every child feels loved, supported, and prepared for the future.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear how much the two women have substantively engaged with each other behind the scenes, though the Vances hosted the Trumps at the Naval Observatory for dinner last month, spending about an hour and a half at the vice presidential residence. The first lady’s office declined to respond to CNN’s inquiries about their relationship.\n \n\n   \n  But in a sign of warm relations, Usha Vance joined Melania Trump in her cabin on the flight to North Carolina, according to a source familiar with the matter. That invitation was not extended for one of her predecessors, former second lady Karen Pence, who sat instead with her staff when traveling with the first lady during the first Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n  Trump and Vance appeared friendly in their engagements throughout the day, sharing a handshake on stage in the hangar and telling reporters they had a “very nice visit” upon their departure.\n \n\n   \n  Vance, a  former high-powered lawyer , is navigating the delicate dynamic of being a top figurehead in a new administration alongside the first lady, who has taken  her own approach  to the spousal role.\n \n\n   \n  The second lady has joined her husband, who appears to have higher political ambitions, on key trips across the country and abroad, all while transitioning three small children to a life under the microscope and becoming a public figure with a quiet platform of children’s literacy and early childhood development.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, meanwhile, took a more hands-off approach to her role, spending most of her time in the first months of the president’s second term away from the White House in New York or Palm Beach, Florida, often disappearing for weeks between public appearances.\n \n\n   \n  She has a much smaller staff compared with her first term. Though she was an active steward of White House preservation during her husband’s first term, she has left many of those decision to the president this time around,  culminating dramatically  last month with the demolition of  the East Wing , which has served as headquarters for presidential spouses since the Carter administration.\n \n\n   \n  But recently, the first lady has returned to public view with a series of engagements on a range of topics.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has held events advocating for children’s well-being and artificial intelligence safety, launching a  global coalition  on the issue called “Fostering the Future Together.” She joined the president as he signed an executive order last week on a (unrelated) “Fostering the Future” initiative for children in foster care. And she back-channeled with Russian President Vladimir Putin on releasing allegedly abducted Ukrainian children with  mixed results .\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, Trump honored the Marine Corps’ 250th anniversary as she looked ahead to new challenges facing the US military.\n \n\n   \n  “Technology is changing the art of war. Predictably, AI will alter war more profoundly than any technology since nuclear weapons,” she said during her remarks in the hangar.\n \n\n   \n  She continued, “Artificial intelligence will take center stage in the theater of war – it already plays a meaningful role on the battlefield. But of course, it is the Marine who will always play the most critical role in realizing mission success.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear why the first lady is choosing to reemerge now, and her office declined to respond to questions on whether this might portend a more active role. Trump recently indicated that the multimillion-dollar deal she signed with Amazon for an  eponymous documentary  highlighting her return to the White House had taken up much of her attention this year.\n \n\n   \n  “The silver screen and I have been in deep conversation lately. You may have heard the news — I produced a new film with Amazon MGM named ‘Melania,’” Trump said earlier this month in remarks accepting Fox Nation’s “Patriot of the Year” award.\n \n\n   \n  The “Melania” documentary, which will be released in January, is being directed by Brett Ratner and marks the filmmaker’s first major project since 2017, when he was  accused of sexual misconduct  by numerous women. Ratner has denied the allegations.\n \n\n   \n   This headline and story have been updated with additional reporting from Trump and Vance’s visit.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/us/anna-kepner-carnival-cruise-death","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"16:51:00Z","title":"Speculation Intensifies in the Death of a Florida High Schooler on a Cruise","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The mysterious death of 18-year-old Anna Kepner, a high school cheerleader from Titusville, Florida, during a Carnival cruise on the Carnival Horizon has sparked international attention and intense speculation.

While Trump has repeatedly criticized Fed Chair Jerome Powell, Treasury Secretary Bessent has acted as a key voice of reason, urging the president not to remove Powell, whom financial markets value for stability.

If you don’t get it fixed fast, I’m going to fire your ass,” the president said, smirking, during a speech at a US-Saudi investment forum at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC.\n \n\n   \n  However, it won’t be easy for Trump to bend the Fed to his will: The Fed makes its decisions on interest rates independently, based solely on economic data, meaning that firing Bessent would simply not lead to lower rates. Several Fed officials have also said in recent public comments that they remain concerned about inflation, leaning against further rate cuts.\n \n\n   \n  The president has been a frequent critic of the central bank and its chair,  Jerome Powell , throughout his second term as the Federal Reserve declined to cut interest rates this year until September. But he acknowledged on Wednesday that Bessent has been privately urging him not to fire Powell, whom Trump has repeatedly said he wants out of the job.\n \n\n   \n  Trump appeared to suggest that Bessent has been the “voice of reason,” while Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick “is a little bit more for firing” Powell.\n \n\n   \n  “Please don’t fire him. He’s got three months to go,’” the president said, appearing to repeat what Bessent has told him of Powell.\n \n\n   \n  “I want to get him out,” Trump said, reenacting their conversation.\n \n\n   \n  “I think Howard is a little bit more for firing him. I think Howard would say get him the hell out of there,” the president said\n \n\n   \n    Bessent as a “voice of reason”\n \n\n   \n  Trump frequently threatened to fire Powell during the spring, but the president eventually backed off from those threats after his closest advisers warned of the chaos in financial markets that could ensue if he were to do so,  CNN previously reported .\n \n\n   \n  Wednesday is the first time Trump has appeared to suggest that Bessent, who has become well-respected on Wall Street, was one of the voices urging him to keep Powell in his role until the end of his term.\n \n\n   \n  “Markets have really appreciated having Bessent around,” James Ragan, director of wealth management research at DA Davidson, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s been very much the voice of reason in the Trump administration, so I don’t like to hear him challenging Bessent,” he added.\n \n\n   \n    The Fed’s decision making and Trump’s demands\n \n\n   \n  Fed officials say their decisions on rates are guided solely by what economic figures show, and they strive to achieve their dual mandate of full employment and stable prices. That’s precisely why Trump’s frequent demands for lower rates have largely fallen on deaf ears — and may continue to do so.\n \n\n   \n  The Fed’s rate-setting committee, led by Powell as chair, began to lower interest rates in September for the first time in nine months, and delivered another quarter-point rate cut at its latest meeting last month. October’s rate cuts bring the benchmark lending rate to  its lowest in three years. \n \n\n   \n  The Fed has been lowering rates to prevent unemployment from surging, though officials are divided over whether they should continue to lower rates with  inflation still above their 2% target  and Trump’s tariffs still threatening to push inflation higher.\n \n\n   \n  Minutes from the Fed’s October meeting underscored the heated debate among the policymakers of the world’s most powerful central bank, with several stating that they prefer to stand pat in December: “Many participants suggested that, under their economic outlooks, it would likely be appropriate to keep the target range unchanged for the rest of the year,” the minutes said.\n \n\n   \n  Investors currently see a roughly 68% chance of the Fed holding rates steady next month, according to futures, compared to a 32% chance of another cut.\n \n\n   \n  New data on the labor market’s health in September, which was delayed due to the government shutdown, is due on Thursday. Signs that the labor market is falling off a cliff would prompt the Fed to continue to lowering borrowing costs heading into next year, though officials are keeping a close eye on inflation.\n \n\n   \n  How the Fed makes its decisions is no secret, but that hasn’t stopped Trump from repeatedly demanding aggressive rate cuts and lambasting Powell, whose term ends in May.\n \n\n   \n  Trump could name Powell’s successor as early as December, and there are  five people on his short list , according to Bessent, who has led the search. But even if Trump names a loyalist who would call for aggressive rate cuts, that still wouldn’t do the trick because the Fed chair only gets one vote and they cannot unilaterally veto what the majority of the Fed’s 12-person rate-setting committee decides.\n \n\n   \n  The new Fed chair, whoever it may be, would have to persuade their colleagues to go along with any plans to lower rates aggressively, and at the moment, only one Fed official said he believes that is the right approach: Fed Governor Stephen Miran, who is taking an unpaid leave from his job as a top White House economist to temporarily serve on the Fed’s board.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/politics/dissent-texas-redistricting-case-judge-jerry-smith-all-about-eve","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"17:13:00-05:00","title":"I dissent,' judge says 16 times in 100-page broadside against colleagues in Texas redistricting case","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a highly controversial 100-page dissent, Judge Jerry Smith of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals condemned the majority decision — authored by Trump-appointed Judge Jeffrey Brown and Obama-appointed Judge David Guaderrama — to block Texas’s new congressional redistricting map.

colleagues in Texas redistricting case \n       \n  By Devan Cole, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:13 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A federal judge on Wednesday  issued an extraordinary broadside  against his two colleagues over their decision to publish their opinion in a major redistricting case in Texas before he had a chance to finish writing his dissent, saying they had lost “any pretense of judicial restraint, good faith, or trust.”\n \n\n   \n  The statement issued by Judge Jerry Smith, who sits on the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals, accuses the two other judges of unfairly rushing to get their ruling out on Tuesday even after he told them he had not wrapped up his part of the case.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, the Ronald Reagan-appointed judge issued a 100-page dissent that says the majority ruling is “replete with legal and factual error, and accompanied by naked procedural abuse.”\n \n\n   \n  The three-judge panel ruled 2-1 to block Texas from using its  newly drawn congressional map  in next year’s midterms, ruling that the map is likely an unconstitutional racial gerrymander.\n \n\n   \n  US District Judge Jeffrey Brown, who was appointed by Trump in 2019, wrote in the majority decision that the challengers were “likely to prove at trial that Texas racially gerrymandered the 2025 Map.” ( The majority opinion was 160 pages .)\n \n\n   \n  But Smith vigorously disagreed throughout his dissent. He said the “’obvious reason’” behind the decision to redraw the state’s congressional maps “’of course, is partisan gain,’” and that Brown was wrong to conclude that state lawmakers are “more bigoted than political.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s all politics, on both sides of the partisan aisle. George and Alex Soros have their hands all over this,” Smith wrote, referring to the billionaire father and son who have supported liberal causes.\n \n\n   \n  The judge also repeatedly invoked California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, who successfully pushed lawmakers and voters in the Golden State to redraw its maps to counteract the Texas effort.\n \n\n   \n  “Gavin Newsom took a victory lap in Houston to celebrate the Democrat redistricting win with Proposition 50,” he wrote. “That tells you all that you need to know – this is about partisan politics, plain and simple.”\n \n\n   \n  Smith also argues that Brown wrongly described the standard the court needed to use when deciding whether to block the map quickly, writing, in part, that his colleague understated how strong the challengers’ arguments against the redrawn districts needed to be.\n \n\n   \n  “With his creative formulation of the preliminary-injunction standard, Judge Brown is intentionally misleading at best and disingenuously false,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Sprinkled throughout the stinging opinion issued by Smith are more insults but also lighter, zippier lines, including references to the 1950 movie “All About Eve.”\n \n\n   \n  “’Fasten your seatbelts. It’s going to be a bumpy night!’” Smith’s dissent began.\n \n\n   \n  He closed with: “Darkness descends on the Rule of Law. A bumpy night, indeed.”\n \n\n   \n  Texas has appealed the ruling. But should it stand, it will be a major setback for Trump and Republicans, who had made Texas the  centerpiece of a national campaign  to redraw maps ahead of the midterms.\n \n\n   \n    ‘The outrage speaks for itself’\n \n\n   \n  \n \n\n   \n  In his four-page statement accompanying the 100-page dissent, Smith describes in detail the timeline that precipitated the release of the majority decision, penned by Brown and joined by District Judge David Guaderrama, an appointee of former President Barack Obama.\n \n\n   \n  Smith says that Brown told him last week that the majority intended to issue their ruling in coming days because they believed they could not wait any longer due to an election law principle that says courts should avoid making last-minute changes to how elections are run before the contests get underway.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, Smith said, Brown wrote him a note in the morning that said: “I’m sorry that we can’t wait on your dissent. Purcell compels us to get the ruling out as soon as we possibly can. It turns out that’s today.” The majority opinion was issued shortly thereafter.\n \n\n   \n  “This outrage speaks for itself,” Smith wrote in his statement. “Any pretense of judicial restraint, good faith, or trust by these two judges is gone. If these judges were so sure of their result, they would not have been so unfairly eager to issue the opinion sans my dissent, or they could have waited for the dissent in order to join issue with it. What indeed are they afraid of?”\n \n\n   \n  The majority’s decision to release the ruling Tuesday without the dissenting opinion attached, Smith said, diminished “the impact of the dissent and the public’s access to it.”\n \n\n   \n  “In the interest of justice, one can hope it is only a Pyrrhic victory,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  “Judges in the majority don’t get to tell a dissenting judge or judges that they can’t participate,” Smith wrote. “If the two judges on this panel get away with what they have done, it sets a horrendous precedent that ‘might makes right’ and the end justifies the means.”\n \n\n   \n  The judge’s statement skewering Brown ended on an ominous note.\n \n\n   \n  “When I was … newer on the bench, a friend asked me, ‘Now that you’ve been a judge for a few years, do you have any particular advice?’” Smith wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “I replied, ‘Always sit with your back to the wall.’”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Ethan Cohen contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/tech/nvidia-earnings-ai-bubble-fears","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"17:00:00-05:00","title":"Nvidia beats earnings expectations, even as bubble concerns mount","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Nvidia reported strong financial results in the October quarter, with 62% year-over-year revenue growth to $57 billion and a 65% profit increase to $31.9 billion, exceeding Wall Street expectations.

\nUpdated: \n        5:25 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Nvidia posted strong revenue and profits that exceeded Wall Street’s expectations Wednesday. The closely watched result could prompt a sigh of relief across the stock market following growing concerns about an artificial intelligence bubble.\n \n\n   \n  Nvidia’s sales grew 62% year-over-year to $57 billion in the October quarter, ahead of the $54.9 billion Wall Street had projected, signaling that demand for AI chips remains strong even as more questions emerge about whether returns from the technology will keep up with the pace of infrastructure investments. It posted profits of $31.9 billion, up 65% from the year-ago quarter and also slightly above expectations.\n \n\n   \n  “Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement, a message that echoes his earlier arguments that fears of an AI bubble are overblown.\n \n\n   \n  The company also posted stronger-than-expected sales guidance of around $65 billion for the fourth quarter, another indicator that the AI spending spree isn’t slowing anytime soon.\n \n\n   \n  Nvidia’s stock ( NVDA ) jumped 3.4% in after-hours trading immediately following the report.\n \n\n   \n  Nvidia has become both the backbone and an emblem of the AI boom, with much of the industry’s technology running on its chips. The  world’s most valuable public company  has also been central to this year’s stock market rally — it accounts for roughly 8% of the S&P 500 and its deals with other tech firms have helped fuel their stocks, too — meaning that nearly all investors and 401k holders  stand to be impacted  by Wednesday’s results.\n \n\n   \n  Fears of an AI bubble ahead of Nvidia’s report had caused volatility across the stock market as investors adopted a risk-off attitude and dumped assets like bitcoin and AI stocks.\n \n\n   \n  Shares of other tech stocks — including Meta, Microsoft, Amazon and Google — were in the green in after-hours trading following the Nvidia report, underscoring the chipmaker’s impact on the wider market.\n \n\n   \n  “This answers a lot of questions about the state of the AI revolution, and the verdict is simple: it is nowhere near its peak, neither from the market-demand nor the production–supply-chain sides for the foreseeable future,” Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com, said in emailed commentary following the report.\n \n\n   \n  At the heart of the bubble concerns are the circular funding deals that Nvidia and other chipmakers have formed with AI companies, such as a  $100 billion investment  in OpenAI in exchange for chip purchases that was announced in September. OpenAI Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar further raised eyebrows earlier this month when  she suggested  that the government should backstop the debt tech companies are taking on to build AI infrastructure — a statement the company later tried to walk back.\n \n\n   \n  But the fears haven’t stopped Nvidia from making more such deals. Anthropic on Monday  committed  to buying $30 billion in computing capacity from Microsoft Azure, running on Nvidia chips, in exchange for an investment in the AI lab from both tech giants.\n \n\n   \n  Huang has repeatedly batted down bubble concerns. At the company’s GTC AI conference last month, he told CNN that people’s willingness to pay for AI tools indicates that the technology is “profitable,” even if most tech firms are now reinvesting the money they’re earning into new infrastructure.\n \n\n   \n  The fact that Nvidia’s business continues to hum isn’t surprising given that tech giants such as Meta, Microsoft, Amazon and Google  all indicated  in their most recent earnings reports that they plan to continue hiking their AI infrastructure spending. Huang also  laid out  at GTC the company’s plans to get its technology into even more areas of life — from cell phone towers to self- driving cars.\n \n\n   \n  Nvidia Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress sought to reinforce that AI is generating returns in the company’s earnings call by taking the unusual tack of ticking through highlights from the chipmaker’s partner’s recent financial reports. At Meta, for example, AI recommendation systems are leading to “more time spent on apps such as Facebook and Threads;” Anthropic recently noted it expects to earn $7 billion in annual revenue this year; and Salesforce’s engineering team is 30% more efficient now that it’s using AI for coding, she said, ﻿among a long list of corporate customers she rattled off.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/americas/brazilian-amazon-gangs-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"17:51:00Z","title":"Gangs Expand to Nearly Half the Towns in the Brazilian Amazon, Report Finds","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Organized crime in the Brazilian Amazon has surged, with gangs now active in nearly 45% of the region’s municipalities—up from 260 to 344 since 2023.

presence in the Brazilian Amazon last year and are now operating in nearly half of the region’s municipalities, according to a report published Wednesday by a prominent nonprofit organization.\n \n\n   \n  The growth of these crime groups in the region, where  UN climate talks  are currently taking place, is driving violence and threatens the preservation of the world’s largest tropical rainforest, according to the Brazilian Forum on Public Safety.\n \n\n   \n  Organized crime groups are now active in 344 municipalities out of 772, or some 45%, the nonprofit said. That’s a jump of 32% from last year’s report when they were present in 260, and more than double from two years ago.\n \n\n   \n  The Red Command drug trafficking gang has more than doubled its presence since 2023. The notorious crime group was the target of Rio’s  most lethal  police operation ever on October 28, when 121 people died.\n \n\n   \n  The raid in Rio sparked a nationwide discussion on organized crime in Brazil, and on Tuesday evening the country’s lower house approved a bill that proposes an increase in the severity of sentences for gang membership.\n \n\n   \n  “These crime groups are seeking to diversify and maximize their illegal activities,” David Marques, one of the report’s authors, told The Associated Press. “In addition to drug-trafficking, there’s been an increase of extortion and environmental crimes,” such as illegal logging and mining, he said.\n \n\n   \n  With more criminal gangs come territorial disputes, weapons and violence, Marques said. There were 8,047 slayings in the region in 2024, a rate of 27.3 killings per 100,000 inhabitants, 31% higher than the national average, the group said.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to Red Command and its main rival, First Capital Command, there are some 17 other criminal gangs operation in the region, also including Venezuela’s  Tren de Aragua , a target of  military attack s by U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration.\n \n\n   \n  The Rio-based Red Command has dominated river routes in coordination with Peruvian and Colombian cartels. Drugs flow to strategic ports such as Manaus, Santarem, Barcarena, Macapa and Belem – where Brazil is hosting COP30.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the Sao Paulo-based First Capital Command has focused on using clandestine airstrips in remote areas that are tied to illegal mining, the group said.\n \n\n   \n  The group’s director, Renato Sérgio de Lima, said in a statement that combating organized crime in the Amazon will require a focus on alternate ways of developing the region besides “predatory exploitation of resources.”\n \n\n   \n  The bill approved by the lower house on Tuesday would boost sentences for certain crimes when the defendant also is a member of a gang, for example increasing the 6-to-20-year recommended sentence for intentional homicide to 20-to-40 years. It also would allow authorities to seize assets even before a case’s final judgement and oblige gang leaders to carry out their time behind bars in maximum-security federal prisons.\n \n\n   \n  President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has lamented on X that the legislation has been weakened because of proposed budget cuts to the federal police. The bill is now headed for the Senate, where it is likely to be modified, though some compromise version is likely to pass the congress eventually because crime has become a top concern of voters.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/tech/saudi-arabia-us-chips-ai-race","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"17:00:00-05:00","title":"Why the world’s richest man and the CEO of the most valuable company met with Saudi officials","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During a high-profile US-Saudi investment forum in Washington, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman announced a sweeping strategy to position Saudi Arabia as a global leader in artificial intelligence.

2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The United States shared images on Wednesday of joint military exercises in  Trinidad and Tobago , as its armed forces amass in the region, building pressure on  Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro .\n \n\n   \n  The deployment is receiving logistical and diplomatic support from multiple Latin American countries, ranging from limited assistance to open cooperation with to US forces.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s more on who’s backing the US operation in the Caribbean, which Washington says is meant to combat drug trafficking in the region:\n \n\n   \n    Trinidad and Tobago\n \n\n   \n  Trinidad and Tobago, which is only 11 kilometers (7 miles) from Venezuela at its closest point, has declared its full support for the US operation.\n \n\n   \n  “I, along with most of the country, am happy that the US naval deployment is having success in their mission,” Trinidadian Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar said in early September, after the US launched its first attack on an  alleged drug vessel  in the Caribbean. “I have no sympathy for traffickers; the US military should kill them all violently,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  After the US began the deployment in August, Persad-Bissessar also warned that if Venezuela attacks Guyana, a country with which it has a  territorial dispute , she would grant the US government access for defense operations. The declaration showed her willingness to abandon a yearslong policy of neutrality and a pragmatic relationship with Venezuela based on economic interests.\n \n\n   \n  In late October, the US Navy destroyer USS Gravely carried out military drills in Trinidad and Tobago for several days, a move that the Venezuelan government called “a hostile provocation.” Maduro responded by announcing the suspension of bilateral gas agreements with the country, claiming its prime minister was threatening to turn Trinidad and Tobago into “the aircraft carrier of the US empire against Venezuela.”\n \n\n   \n    Guyana\n \n\n   \n  Guyana backed the US military deployment in the Caribbean shortly after it started in August, saying it would support a “collaborative and integrated approach to tackle transnational organized crime.”\n \n\n   \n  It added that transnational organized crime was a “threat to peace and security in the region” and involved networks like “the Cartel de los Soles of Venezuela.”\n \n\n   \n  Washington claims Cartel de los Soles is led by Maduro and is responsible for trafficking drugs to the US and Europe. Caracas has dismissed the accusation as a “fabrication.” But experts and former US government officials  say the group is not a  formally organized cartel, and it’s a stretch to suggest Maduro leads it, though there is government involvement in the drug trade.\n \n\n   \n  The head of US Southern Command Admiral Alvin Holsey visited Guyana this month to promote regional security and met with senior commanders to discuss a long-standing defense alliance between both countries, the US Embassy said.\n \n\n   \n    El Salvador\n \n\n   \n  In early November, an AC-130J military aircraft operated by the US Air Force was spotted in El Salvador’s Comalapa Cooperative Security Base, according to photos and satellite imagery obtained by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The gunship can carry Hellfire missiles but is primarily armed with large-caliber cannons. The AC-130J seen in El Salvador had two cannons – including a 105mm howitzer – visible its left side.\n \n\n   \n  Until recently, the Salvadoran base had been used almost exclusively for unarmed aircraft, according to the US Southern Command. Its location near the coast provides a strategic position for the US campaign in the Pacific, as the reach of bases in the Caribbean is limited.\n \n\n   \n  “Operating from Comalapa offers more options and allows for monitoring and defending a much wider swath of the Pacific Ocean, through which much of the cocaine trafficked to the United States passes,” Ryan Berg, director of the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told CNN earlier in  November. \n \n\n   \n  Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele has not commented specifically on the US military deployment, but he has a close relationship with US President Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n    Panama\n \n\n   \n  US military personnel are conducting training exercises in Panama, although the government of President José Raúl Mulino is trying to downplay the matter.\n \n\n   \n  The president denied last week that his country is participating in any “hostile act against Venezuela” and asserted that the military maneuvers are part of bilateral cooperation agreements with Washington.\n \n\n   \n  Panama, which has not had armed forces since 1990, has hosted military exercises since the  US invasion of the country in 1989 . In April, Panama signed a memorandum of cooperation enabling a greater US military presence and authorizing the use of air and naval bases for joint exercises. Mulino again denied that the activities are related to the White House’s pressure on Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n    Dominican Republic\n \n\n   \n  President Luis Abinader said Monday that the Dominican Republic and the US Drug Enforcement Administration would launch “much more extensive and in-depth” actions in the fight against drug trafficking.\n \n\n   \n  That same day, Dominican authorities said they boarded a speedboat with 806 packages of suspected cocaine off the coast of Pedernales. The National Drug Control Directorate said the intervention was in support of Operation Southern Spear, the name the Pentagon uses for the military deployment in the region.\n \n\n   \n  The collaboration had already begun on Saturday, when authorities seized another shipment of nearly 500 packages of cocaine on a speedboat.\n \n\n   \n    Puerto Rico and other bases\n \n\n   \n  Puerto Rico, a self-governing US territory in the Caribbean, also plays a key role in the deployment, as it contains the most US military bases in the Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n   Satellite imagery and photographs  taken in the area show that Roosevelt Roads Naval Station, which had been closed since 2004, is now operational again, and that US Marines supporting the Southern Command missions participated in amphibious landing drills in the archipelago in late September.\n \n\n   \n  The United States has two other bases in and around the Caribbean, but in both cases, the countries where they’re located have spoken out against the deployment.\n \n\n   \n  In southeastern Cuba, the Guantanamo Naval Base has been used for logistical, surveillance, and other operations since 1903, but the Cuban government, an ally of Venezuela, has repeatedly rejected the US military presence as well as its recent deployment.\n \n\n   \n  Washington also has an air base in Honduras staffed by more than 500 US military personnel and 500 Honduran and American civilians, according to its website. In January, before Trump took office, Honduran President Xiomara Castro threatened to reconsider the use of the base if the US carried out mass deportations. In August, she called some of Washington’s accusations against Maduro “unfounded” and later spoke out against the US military deployment in the Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n    Political support\n \n\n   \n  Countries in South America have shown political support for Washington’s pressure campaign on Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  In August, Ecuador designated Cartel de los Soles as an “organized crime terrorist group.” The decree was signed by President Daniel Noboa, an ally of Washington, whose attempts to lift a ban on foreign military bases was rejected in a recent referendum.\n \n\n   \n  Paraguay and Argentina, other White House allies, have also designated Cartel de los Soles as a terrorist organization.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5615190","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"17:23:00-05:00","title":"White House Condemns Democratic Lawmakers' Video but Backs Off Trump's Posts","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a significant political development on November 20, 2025, President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social calling for the execution of members of Congress after a video by Democratic lawmakers — including Reps.

said Thursday President Trump does not actually want to see members of Congress executed despite his social media post earlier in the day, calling a video by some members \"seditious behavior, punishable by DEATH!\" Trump made a pair of posts on his site, Truth Social, in response to a video posted by Reps. Jason Crow, D-Colo., Chris DeLuzio, D-Pa, Maggie Goodlander, D-N.H., and Chrissy Houlahan, D-Pa., and Sens. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., and Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., where the lawmakers address members of the military and intelligence communities and said, \"You can refuse illegal orders,\" repeating the phrase several times before saying, \"You must refuse illegal orders.\" The lawmakers, all of whom come from military backgrounds, said, \"This administration is pitting our uniformed military and intelligence community professionals against American citizens.\"  The video, posted to Facebook , also says \"right now the threats of our Constitution aren't just coming from abroad but right here at home.\" Asked during the daily White House briefing if he wanted execute members of Congress, Leavitt said: \"No.\" \"The sanctity of our military rests on the chain of command, and if that chain of command is broken, it can lead to people getting killed. It can lead to chaos, and that's what these members of Congress who swore an oath to abide by the Constitution are essentially encouraging,\" Leavitt said. The president also reposted a series of comments from users on Truth Social, including posts that said the Democrats should be hanged, the actions were an insurrection and they should all be indicted because of the video. In the video Democrats didn't call out any specific actions that military or intelligence officials have been told to carry out, but they said that the Trump administration is \"pitting our uniformed military and intelligence community professionals against American citizens.\" They added that military and intelligence personnel swore an oath to protect and defend the Constitution. \"Right now the threats to our Constitution aren't just coming from abroad, but right here at home,\" they said. \"No one has to carry out orders that violate the law or our Constitution.\" They ended the video by telling those in the military and intelligence officials, \"Don't give up the ship,\" referring to the famous last words of James Lawrence, a Navy Captain during the war of 1812, to keep fighting and not surrender. Members of the military do swear an oath to the Constitution and are trained that \"following orders\" is not a defense for illegal acts. The lawmakers issued a joint statement to Trump's response, saying in part, \"We are veterans and national security professionals who love this country and swore an oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. That oath lasts a lifetime, and we intend to keep it. No threat, intimidation, or call for violence will deter us from that sacred obligation.\" \"Every American must unite and condemn the President's calls for our murder and political violence. This is a time for moral clarity,\" they said. House Democratic leadership — House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, of New York, whip Katherine Clark of Massachusetts and Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar of California — called for Trump to remove the posts and for Republicans to condemn them. \"We unequivocally condemn Donald Trump's disgusting and dangerous death threats against Members of Congress and call on House Republicans to forcefully do the same,\" they wrote. \"We have been in contact with the House Sergeant at Arms and the United States Capitol Police to ensure the safety of these Members and their families,\" the statement adds. \"Donald Trump must immediately delete these unhinged social media posts and recant his violent rhetoric before he gets someone killed.\" Trump hasn't deleted the social media posts.  \n      \n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/health/fluoride-drinking-water-cognition-positive-link","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"15:54:00-05:00","title":"Fluoride in drinking water does not negatively affect cognitive ability — and may actually provide benefit, study finds","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A new longitudinal study led by Dr. Rob Warren of the University of Minnesota, published in *Science Advances*, finds that exposure to recommended levels of fluoride in drinking water is associated with better cognitive performance in youth and no cognitive decline in later life.

Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The longstanding public health practice of adding fluoride to community drinking water is facing heavy scrutiny in the United States over questions about whether the  benefits outweigh the potential risks . But new research challenges recent claims about the risks of fluoride in drinking water — and instead suggests that it may have additional positive effects.\n \n\n   \n  The heightened federal debate was spurred by a  recent government study  from the National Toxicology Program that concluded that high levels of fluoride exposure are linked to lower IQ in children, but that study evaluated fluoride exposures that were at least twice the federally recommended limits with notably “ insufficient data ” to determine the effects of lower levels.\n \n\n   \n  The new study looked at more typical, recommended levels of fluoride in drinking water and instead found “robust evidence” that young people exposed to fluoride at these lower levels actually performed better on ​cognitive tests than their peers who did not have fluoride in their drinking water.\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Rob Warren, lead author of the  study published in the journal Science Advances  on Wednesday, said he was “shocked” by the findings from the National Toxicology Program study and motivated to provide research that was more relevant to public policy decisions.\n \n\n   \n  “I wouldn’t have done this work had it not been an empirical question that I didn’t think we had an answer to, of great immediate policy interest,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  US Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has called fluoride “an industrial waste” and cited “IQ loss” in  pledges  to roll back federal recommendations that fluoride be added to municipal drinking water.  Utah  and  Florida  have become the first two states to ban the practice.\n \n\n   \n  “Imagine testing some new drug for heart disease and the recommended dosage is 100 milligrams, and then your study compares people who get a million milligrams to people who get half a million milligrams. Well, that doesn’t tell you anything about the effect of getting 100 milligrams versus getting nothing,” Warren said. “That’s kind of the world we’re in with fluoride research. It’s important to know that if you get a toxic dose, really bad things happen to your body, but that’s not relevant for the public policy discussion.”\n \n\n   \n  Warren, a sociology professor at the University of Minnesota, leads a program that started in the US Department of Education and has followed a cohort of tens of thousands of people for more than four decades since their high school years in the 1980s.\n \n\n   \n  For the new study, he and other researchers used this data to overlay performance on mathematics, reading and vocabulary tests for a nationally representative sample of nearly 27,000 people with their exposure to fluoride in community drinking water based on historical data from HHS and the US Geological Survey.\n \n\n   \n  The analysis assumed that individuals lived near their high school for their whole childhood and grouped them based on whether they would have been consistently exposed to recommended fluoride levels through community water fluoridation or natural occurrence of the mineral, consistently lacking exposure to fluoride, or partly exposed if their community changed their local fluoridation policy at some point during their childhood.\n \n\n   \n  Students who were exposed to fluoride for part of their childhood had higher test scores in high school than those who had no exposure to fluoride, and the difference was even greater for those who were exposed to fluoride for their whole childhood, the study found. Follow-up tests continued through 2021, when most participants had reached 60 years of age, and suggested that fluoride exposure also did not contribute to cognitive decline as participants aged.\n \n\n   \n  Cognitive tests are not direct measures of IQ. There is a strong correlation, Warren says, but cognitive tests measure a mix of how well someone’s brain works along with the opportunities they’ve had to learn the material. He’s working on additional research that will directly assess the link between fluoride and IQ, with more precise measurements data about where the individuals lived during childhood, too.\n \n\n   \n  Other  research  from this year estimated that removing fluoride from public water in the US would lead to 25.4 million excess decayed teeth in children and adolescents within five years, along with $9.8 billion in health care costs. The new study did not measure individual dental health, but experts say that pain from tooth decay can cause children to have trouble focusing in school or miss it completely — which could be a factor affecting cognitive test scores.\n \n\n   \n  Fluoride is a mineral that can be found naturally in some foods and groundwater. It can help prevent tooth decay by strengthening the protective outer layer of enamel that can be worn away by acids formed by bacteria, plaque and sugars in the mouth. The practice of adding fluoride to public water systems started in the United States in 1945 to help improve oral health in a cost-effective and equitable way.\n \n\n   \n  The American Dental Association and many experts have continued to support the practice of community water fluoridation, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has not changed its recommendations. The agency cannot mandate that communities add fluoride to their water, but it considers 0.7 milligrams of fluoride per liter of water to be the “optimal level.”\n \n\n   \n  But the US Food and Drug Administration recently  took action  to restrict the use of prescription fluoride supplements. “There are better ways to protect children’s teeth than taking unapproved ingestible fluoride, which is now recognized to alter the gut microbiome,” FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary said in a news release about the action.\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Bruce Lanphear, an epidemiologist and professor at Simon Fraser University in Canada, said it’s important to capture a more complete set of all sources of fluoride exposures, such as toothpaste and pesticides.\n \n\n   \n  “Population strategies – like fluoridation, like vaccination, like taking lead out of gasoline – they can be extraordinarily powerful. If you’ve got a safe and effective intervention, you can have a big impact on the health of populations,” he said. “But when you have a population strategy like fluoridation, the evidence about its safety and about its effectiveness has to be extraordinarily strong.”\n \n\n   \n  But in a  formal response  to the new research that was also published in Science Advances on Wednesday, Dr. David Savitz, an epidemiologist with the Brown University School of Public Health, argues that the greater burden lies on proving the risk before ending a public health practice that has been successful for decades.\n \n\n   \n  “Until clear evidence exists that water fluoridation lacks public health benefit or compelling evidence of harm at the level of fluoride exposure in fluoridated water, neither of which has occurred, it seems foolhardy to interfere with a long-established and well-recognized public health success,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “With due credit to the folk wisdom of Bert Lance, director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Jimmy Carter, ‘If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.’ Warren and colleagues move the needle a bit further into the ‘ain’t broke’ range.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5615399","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"17:12:00-05:00","title":"Judge orders an end to Trump's troop deployment in D.C., calling it 'unlawful'","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal judge, U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb, has ordered an end to President Donald Trump’s month-long National Guard deployment in Washington, D.C., declaring it 'unlawful' and asserting that it undermined the city’s sovereign powers and threatened public safety.

\n\n         A federal judge on Thursday ordered an end to the monthslong National Guard deployment in Washington, D.C. to tackle crime, declaring that the use of troops was \"unlawful.\" It's the  latest legal resistance  against President Trump's troop deployments in American cities as a means to suppress protests, combat crime or safeguard federal buildings and personnel, including ICE agents. It comes just days after a Tennessee state judge issued a temporary block on the mobilization of Guard forces in Memphis, which was activated by the Tennessee governor at Trump's behest. Over the weekend, the Defense Department ordered  hundreds of troops to leave Chicago and Portland, Ore.  as federal courts kept those deployments at a stalemate. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden, sided with District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb who had argued that the president undermined the city's autonomy, threatened public safety by stirring tensions between local residents and law enforcement and hurt the city's economy. \"The Court finds that the District's exercise of sovereign powers within its jurisdiction is irreparably harmed by Defendants' actions in deploying the Guards,\" she wrote. Cobb put a pause on her order until Dec. 11 to allow the Trump administration time to appeal. In a statement, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson asserted that Trump was well within his authority to send the Guard to D.C. \"This lawsuit is nothing more than another attempt — at the detriment of DC residents — to undermine the President's highly successful operations to stop violent crime in DC,\" Jackson added. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Trump sent hundreds of troops to D.C. without the mayor's consent in early August after declaring a \"crime emergency\" in the city. That claim has been repeatedly refuted by local Democratic leaders. Since then, Guard personnel have been largely tasked with patrols and beautification efforts like clearing trash, spreading mulch and pruning trees. As of Wednesday, the deployment in the nation's capital includes over 2,100 Guard forces from D.C. and several states, including Louisiana, Mississippi, Ohio, South Carolina, West Virginia, Georgia and Alabama, according to the U.S. Army. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/us/latino-population-us-tradition-identity-cec","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"16:00:00Z","title":"Latino Identity in the U.S.: Tradition, Growth, and Resilience Amid Policy Tensions","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article examines the evolving identity, culture, and economic influence of the Latino population in the United States, which now exceeds 68 million and is the largest racial minority group.

US Latino population grows and cultural traditions remain \n       \n  By Karen Esquivel and graphics by Jhasua Razo, CNN en Español\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:07 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In a country where some 68 million Latin Americans — nearly 20% of the population — are redefining their place in public life, Latino identity in the United States is at a turning point. Growth no longer depends primarily on immigration, but rather on a native-born generation that is transforming priorities and expectations.\n \n\n   \n  But this shift is occurring amid a harsher immigration policy. There have been  more than 500,000 deportations  and over  1.6 million voluntary self-deportations  since January 2025. That reality is impacting the economies of entire neighborhoods, increasing community tensions, and reshaping the political landscape.\n \n\n   \n  Between the growing presence of an increasingly younger population that still celebrates its origins and traditions and the pressure of historically aggressive measures, the question of what it means to be Latino in the US today is taking on new layers of complexity. Who are they, where do they come from, and how do they live?\n \n\n   \n  Many Hispanics feel more connected to the United States but remain tied to their country of origin’s traditions: food, language ,  and festivities are some of the customs they preserve, according to responses to a CNN survey answered by more than 120 readers, all Latino residents in the U . S.\n \n\n   \n  Sara Sánchez says she still enjoys Salvadoran food such as pupusas and in December celebrates Christmas Eve on December 24 and Christmas the following day with traditional dishes and music from her homeland.\n \n\n   \n  Arepas, for example, are still the preferred food of many Colombians and Venezuelans throughout the United States. Mexicans eat pozole, tacos, or beans on any given day, and Nicaraguans enjoy gallo pinto, a traditional dish that contains rice, beans, chili ,  and onion.\n \n\n   \n  Mexico’s Independence Day or Día de Muertos are celebrated by people who trace their origins to Mexico; some Colombians maintain religious celebrations such as Día de las Velitas or Colombia’s traditional Christmas festivities with their respective traditional dishes. Venezuelan music, especially Gaitas in December, is present in homes and gatherings.\n \n\n   \n    Diversity of origin\n \n\n   \n  The growing Latino community in the United States reached a record of over 68 million in 2024, according to  Census Bureau figures . This means its population is larger than that of countries such as Spain, Canada ,  and any other in Latin America except Brazil (over 211 million) and Mexico (130 million).\n \n\n   \n  Historically, the Mexican population has been the largest Hispanic group in the United States. In 2024, they totaled 38.9 million (11.5%), a significant increase compared to the 35.9 million counted in 2020,  according to Census data .\n \n\n   \n  Second are Puerto Ricans, with 6.1 million (1.8%); followed by Cubans with 2.9 million (0.9%), Salvadorans with 2.7 million, and Dominicans with 2.5 million as of last year.\n \n\n   \n  Puerto Rico is an unincorporated territory of the United States. For this reason, Puerto Ricans have been U . S .  citizens by birth since 1917, but they  do not have the same rights  as other citizens of the country: They cannot vote in presidential elections and do not have representation in Congress. They are considered part of the Latino community because the U . S .  government  defines this group  as the population that speaks Spanish or descends from Latin Americans or Spaniards.\n \n\n   \n  People with roots in Central and South America have registered a significant increase, with two populations — Colombia and Honduras — that for the first time since 2010 surpassed the one million mark, while the Venezuelan population reported the fastest growth of Hispanic groups, with an increase of 181% from 2010 to 2020, according to the Census.\n \n\n   \n  The Mexican population is the largest Hispanic group in 40 states, but has settled mainly in California, a state that recorded more than 12.2 million Mexicans as of 2020, according to the Census, followed by Texas (9 million) and Arizona (1.8 million). Their presence and reach in the country have been such that in the 1960s the Chicano movement was born with the objective of empowering the U . S .  population of Mexican descent and was focused in the southwestern United States.\n \n\n   \n  Chicano murals, for example, stand out in neighborhoods in California, Texas ,  and Arizona as a window into the labor struggle, social justice, Mexican Independence, migration, historical figures, pre-Hispanic symbols, and daily life. In Sacramento, California, there is one of the oldest Chicano murals in the country called “The Rise of the Chicano Social Struggle in a Bicultural Society.” These works, created by local artists, are a symbol of resistance and pride for the Latino community.\n \n\n   \n    The South of the U.S. is home to the largest number of Latinos\n \n\n   \n  Geographically, California, Texas, and Florida are the  states with the largest Latino populations , but this group has expanded beyond traditional enclaves, settling in areas of the Midwest and the South where the Latino population was historically scarce.\n \n\n   \n  These three states are clear examples of the settlement and expansion of the Latino community. As of 2024, California’s total population was more than 39.4 million people, of which more than 16 million were Latinos (40%) and more than 10 million were immigrants (27%),  according to data  from the Public Policy Institute of California.\n \n\n   \n  In Texas, a state with more than  31.2 million inhabitants , there are 12.6 million Hispanics (40%), surpassing the White population (39.8%), according to Census data. This means that the Latino community is the largest demographic group in the country’s second largest state.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Florida is home to 6.7 million Hispanics (28.7%) among its more than 23.3 million residents. The Latino community is also the second-largest ethnic group in the so-called Sunshine State.\n \n\n   \n    Enduring customs\n \n\n   \n  Rodríguez lives in a Latino community in San Francisco, California, a state where Hispanics of Mexican origin make up more than 12% of the population, which  —  she says  —  reminds her a lot of Mexico. “Here, there are many street vendors on the streets and they sell all kinds of food, especially on weekends, you find everything: There are pupusas, tamales, tacos, anything. It’s not something you see in other places in the United States, but it reminds me a lot of Mexico,” she explains.\n \n\n   \n  Gastronomy is one of the areas where Latinos of Mexican origin have made a strong presence. According to  data from Pew Research Center , one in 10 restaurants in the United States serves Mexican food and 85% of counties nationwide have at least one Mexican restaurant.\n \n\n   \n  Clemente López replied that he feels more connected to the United States, but he prefers the food of Honduras, his country of origin, as well as the music and soccer.\n \n\n   \n  Paola Acosta, originally from Colombia and a resident of Florida, came to the U . S .  15 years ago in search of the so-called American dream. For her, the connection to her country of origin is greater and is reflected in her traditional diet: arepas, sancocho ,  and rice are on her table every day.\n \n\n   \n  And for Marabeth Márquez, the religious traditions of Venezuela are still present in her life in the United States with celebrations such as Christmas Eve on December 24, observing Lent and fasting during Holy Week, in addition to not having adopted holidays like Halloween.\n \n\n   \n  One in every five inhabitants in the United States is Latino (20%), making this group the largest racial minority in the country. Although immigration has historically been a determining factor in this increase, now the births of people of Latino origin have taken first place: just between 2022 and 2023, there were 722,000 births recorded, compared to 437,000 migrants who arrived in the country,  according to official figures. \n \n\n   \n  Gina López is a clear example: She was born in New York but feels more identified with the traditions of Colombia, her parents’ country of origin. She now lives in Florida.\n \n\n   \n    Soccer, a sport that connects roots\n \n\n   \n  Regardless of their flag of origin, Latinos in the United States prefer soccer over other sports because it is an extension of their national identity that connects them to their roots. This sport, favored in Latin America, has expanded and gained popularity in the country.\n \n\n   \n  While in 1997, soccer was tied for last place on the list of favorite sports along with figure skating, by 2023, it had climbed to fourth place, just behind American football, baseball, and basketball,  according to a Gallup poll.  Hispanic television viewers in the U . S .  represented the vast majority of soccer’s audience in 2017, with 68% of viewers that year, according to another  study from Nielsen. \n \n\n   \n  Talking about this sport among the Hispanic population has another important nuance: Latinos who prefer soccer tend to support teams outside the United States. According to a  2024 report  from the marketing and media company For Soccer, 32% of Hispanics consider the U . S .  men’s national soccer team their favorite, while 21% prefer the women’s team. However, among Mexican Americans — the largest Hispanic group in the United States — only 40% have one of these U . S .  teams as their favorite, which means that most of them prefer other teams, from Mexico or other countries.\n \n\n   \n  Soccer has become a cultural meeting point and a common language for many Colombians, Mexicans, Ecuadorians, Salvadorans ,  and Venezuelans, mainly in states such as Florida, California and Texas, according to Latinos who responded to CNN’s questionnaire. An example of this is that the states hosting the most Major League Soccer teams — the US professional soccer league — are California, Texas and Florida, which are also the states with the largest Latino populations.\n \n\n   \n  Paola Acosta, a Florida resident, noted that not only is soccer her favorite sport, but she is also a fan of the Colombian national team, her country of origin. And John Jauregui, who was born in California and traces his origin to Mexico, prefers soccer over other sports.\n \n\n   \n  That said, American football and baseball have also become integral parts of the lives of many Latinos in the United States. According to the NFL, by early 2025 there were  39 million  Latino fans in the U . S . , and according to  Nielsen data , the percentage of Hispanic viewers of the Super Bowl increased from 10% in 2016 to 14% in 2024. Meanwhile, the percentage for the World Series went from 10% in 2016 to 15% in 2023.\n \n\n   \n    Spanish language, important in identity\n \n\n   \n  Latinos still maintain Spanish as a way to communicate at home and with close family and friends, in addition to considering it an important part of their identity and traditions. In fact, the United States is already the  second country with the most Spanish speakers  in the world, according to the report “Spanish: A Living Language 2024,” with just over 57.4 million Spanish speakers, second only to Mexico.\n \n\n   \n  But as the Hispanic population is increasingly made up of individuals born in the U . S . , the proportion of Latinos who speak English fluently is growing. In 2022, 72% of Latinos age 5 or older spoke the language fluently, compared to 59% in 2000,  according to the Pew Research Center. \n \n\n   \n  Additionally, the proportion of Latinos who speak Spanish at home decreased from 78% in 2000 to 68% in 2022, a figure driven mainly by those born in the United States.\n \n\n   \n    Latinos, a driving force in the economy\n \n\n   \n  Hispanics are a key part and engine in the economic development of the United States and will become even more relevant as the rest of the population ages in the coming decades, according to an  analysis by the Latino Donor Collaborative and Arizona State University. \n \n\n   \n  The Latino Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the United States increased from $2.1 trillion in 2015 to $4 trillion in 2023, according to the report, which is equivalent to being the fifth largest economy in the world, behind only the U . S . , China, Germany ,  and Japan, and above the United Kingdom, France ,  and Italy.\n \n\n   \n  “The magic and secret power, the superpower of the Latino community is the ability to be so diverse, to come from different countries in Latin America and from Spain, but at the same time have certain characteristics that also unite us, such as the great entrepreneurial spirit and the way our community continues to contribute to all aspects of life and American society,” said Frankie Miranda, of Hispanic Federation.\n \n\n   \n  Latinos in the United States are much more than a statistic: They are a force that transforms the country, drives its economy, and renews its culture. They are increasingly American, but their identity is strengthened by traditions and pride, and they are key to the future of the nation, a future that is also expressed in Spanish.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5584087","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"20:27:00-05:00","title":"Frida Kahlo Painting Breaks Auction Records at Sotheby's in New York","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Frida Kahlo's 1940 painting *El sueño (La cama)* sold for $54.7 million at a Sotheby's auction in New York on November 20, 2025, becoming the most expensive artwork by a woman ever auctioned and breaking her own previous record.

The 1940 painting, called  El sueño (La cama) ,   sold for $54.7 million, the most expensive artwork by a woman ever auctioned.  It also broke the previous auction record for Kahlo's work. \" El sueño  stands among Frida Kahlo's greatest masterworks — a rare and striking example of her most surrealist impulses,\" said Anna Di Stasi, Sotheby's head of Latin American art, in a statement. \"Kahlo fuses dream imagery and symbolic precision with unmatched emotional intensity, creating a work that is at once deeply personal and universally resonant.\" The sale of  El Sueño (La cama)  outstripped the 2014 record set by Kahlo's friend and contemporary Georgia O'Keeffe, when O'Keeffe's 1932 work  Jimson Weed/White Flower No. 1  sold at auction for $44.4 million. The last time Frida Kahlo broke an auction record was in 2021, when her 1949 work  Diego y yo  sold for $34.9 million; then the highest price for a Latin American artwork. Still, the final sale price is shy of the  $60 million Sotheby's had estimated for the high end of the sale. Bidding slowed dramatically at around $40 million and for a few tense seconds, it seemed uncertain whether the painting would break the record for women artists. Di Stasi handled the winning bid for a buyer on the phone whose identity is not yet known.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       At a moment when art sales have dramatically softened,  museums face massive financial restructuring  and a number of leading galleries have shuttered, the buzz around this painting is significant but not surprising. Surrealist women artists are currently  in vogue among collectors , and Kahlo is among a small handful of superstar artists with a seemingly bulletproof brand — think Andy Warhol, Jean-Michel Basquiat and Gustav Klimt. A Klimt painting auctioned by Sotheby's on Tuesday sold for $236.4 million, making it the second-most expensive painting ever auctioned. Kahlo's mystique erupts in part from her psychologically complex self-portraits that focus on her disabilities, her politics, her heritage and her deep connection to the world shimmering around her. \"Her paintings tell stories — intimate, engaging, terrifying and tragic ones,\" wrote art historian Sharyn R. Udall in her 2003 article,  \"Frida Kahlo's Mexican Body: History, Identity and Artistic Aspiration,\"  published in  Woman's Art Journal.  \"When Kahlo looked into death's dark mirror, she saw herself. In the act of painting and in the resulting canvases, she documented her own attempts to survive pain, to make sense of it, to act out through images layered with irony, fantasy and allegory. Her work is searingly candid, overlaid with the unreality of an endless nightmare.\" And her work seems to only grow in power. Just within the past year, more than a dozen museums around the world exhibited shows dedicated to Kahlo. An  immersive experience  that brought audiences inside some of them has been traveling internationally. The Museum of Fine Arts in Houston will soon open a vast retrospective called  Frida: The Making of an Icon.  It's scheduled to transfer to the Tate Modern in London next June. And a new Frida Kahlo museum that explores the artist's early life opened in Kahlo's neighborhood in Mexico City in September. It's the third museum that centers Kahlo's life and art in the city. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-98669","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"19:35:00-05:00","title":"Fire Prompts Evacuations at U.N.

Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick of Florida has been indicted on charges accusing her of stealing $5 million in federal disaster funds and using some of the money to aid her 2021 campaign, the Justice Department said Wednesday. The Democrat is accused of stealing Federal Emergency Management Agency overpayments that her family health care company had received through a federally funded COVID-19 vaccination staffing contract, federal prosecutors said. A portion of the money was then funneled to support her campaign through candidate contributions, prosecutors allege. \"Using disaster relief funds for self-enrichment is a particularly selfish, cynical crime,\" Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement. \"No one is above the law, least of all powerful people who rob taxpayers for personal gain.

The Florida Division of Emergency Management said it made a series of overpayments to Trinity Healthcare Services after hiring it in 2021 to register people for COVID-19 vaccinations. The agency says it discovered the problem after a single $5 million overpayment drew attention. Cherfilus-McCormick was the CEO of Trinity at the time. The Office of Congressional Ethics said in a January report that Cherfilus-McCormick's income in 2021 was more than $6 million higher than in 2020, driven by nearly $5.75 million in consulting and profit-sharing fees received from Trinity Healthcare Services. In July, the House Ethics Committee unanimously voted to reauthorize an investigative subcommittee to examine allegations involving Cherfilus-McCormick. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/1234569831","dateOfPublication":"2024-02-28","timeOfPublication":"14:20:00-05:00","title":"A collection of featured Tiny Desk Concerts","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article highlights a collection of featured Tiny Desk Concerts from NPR, published on Wednesday, February 28, 2024, at 2:20 PM EST.

Munich, until now an inland surfing hotspot, has lost its biggest wave \n         By Rob Schmitz \n        \n           Thursday, November 20, 2025 • 10:19 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         MUNICH — \"It was gnarly. Dangerous. Only the most experienced could surf it,\" says Jakob Netzer of what local surfers have come to call the \"E1,\" an ever-churning wave along a mountain stream that flows through central Munich — a swell that non-surfers and tourists know as the  Eisbachwelle  or \"ice stream wave.\"   \"And it's very sad the wave is not working,\" says Netzer, staring at where the wave once regularly appeared, just below a bridge that marks the entrance to the city's English Garden.  In early November, as city engineers finished dredging the bottom of the Eisbach  —  a two-kilometer-long (1.2-mile) canal that is a side arm of the Isar River — they opened the floodgates to find the  Eisbachwelle , typically a 1.5-meter (4.9 feet) high summit of icy river water, had transformed into a small, nondescript whitewater bump along a raging waterway. \"It's usually three sections,\" says Netzer, who has surfed the  Eisbachwelle  for years. The wave stretches across all three. \"On the far side, you jump in and there are these bumps, and then in the middle, you have a nice, smoother place where you can surf, but it's not easy, because you have to anticipate the sections and know where to make the turns.\" Netzer recalls the first time he surfed the wave, at the age of 17. \"I was working in a bar and one of my bar colleagues took me to go on the Wave in the middle of the night after our shift ended,\" he remembers. \"I actually didn't think much about it, I just did it.\" It was the beginning of a surfing addiction, says Netzer. He's regularly surfed both E1 and its less challenging sibling E2, further downstream, ever since — come rain, shine, or snow, when he dons his full-body wetsuit. Fellow surfer Alexander Neumann of the Munich River Surfers' Association says over the years, the city's engineers have routinely dredged the Eisbach   canal — but they did so with greater scrutiny this year due to the  drowning death  of a surfer on the  Eisbachwelle  last April. \"They wanted to find if there are any danger zones where people could get stuck,\" he explains. \"So they took a bit too much out, which used to still lay on the ground of the wave, and the wave is not forming properly now.\" In response to questions about how the city of Munich is addressing the disappearance of the  Eisbachwelle , spokesperson Susanne Mühlbauer issued a statement to NPR: \"For Munich, the Eisbach wave is a symbol of urban sports and leisure culture, as well as a globally unique and popular tourist attraction that complements and rounds off the city's range of sights in an outstanding way — and that's why Munich Tourism hopes the Eisbach wave will return quickly.\" Down the street from where the  Eisbachwelle  used to exist, at the Technical University of Munich, hydrology professor Markus Disse opens up a textbook to a chapter on hydraulic jumps, a hydrological phenomenon that occurs along a fast-moving waterway like the Eisbach, which creates a surfable wave. Disse says a wave like the  Eisbachwelle  requires a certain water speed combined with a \"bump\" of sediment on the bottom of the stream.  Disse says he thinks the city likely removed that underwater bump. \"They did their job too good,\" he says, smiling. How to resurrect the  Eisbachwelle ? \"I would play around with the discharge,\" says Disse. \"Perhaps they should try lowering the discharge, wait half an hour, then you see the effect, and you could do a series of experiments.\" Disse says if that doesn't work, then Munich authorities should attempt to dump gravel into the canal to re-create the \"bump\" of sediment that likely created the wave in the first place. Back on the banks of the Eisbach Canal, Neumann watches an engineering team from Hamburg — hired by the city of Munich to study why the wave disappeared and in charge of bringing it back — fasten GPS and sonar equipment to a boogie board before they let it go into the river to test water flow and graph the underwater structure of the riverbed. He says he trusts that the city has the surfers' best interests in mind. Surfing along this stretch of the canal — which was owned until 2010 by the state of Bavaria — used to be illegal until the city stepped in and initiated a land swap with Bavaria in order to legalize surfing along the  Eisbachwelle.  The city's tourism board includes the site in its marketing, and Neumann says the  Eisbachwelle  has become an integral part of the city. Still, surfers have become impatient with the pace of the work to resurrect the wave. A week after it disappeared, Neumann says, a group of surfers submerged a wooden ramp where the wave once stood, and for a day, the wave came back. However, authorities deemed the ramp an illegal structure and removed it. The city continues to work on a solution.

A couple weeks ago, the wave vanished after a city dredging project. Now the community is uniting to get it back. NPR's Rob Schmitz has this report. And a warning, there is surfer lingo in his story that might be, like, a total buzzkill. ROB SCHMITZ, BYLINE: At first, they were like, dude? And then they were like, dude. Munich surfers had lost their ride. JAKOB NETZER: It's very sad that the wave is not working. SCHMITZ: Standing by what used to be his wave, surfer Jakob Netzer (ph) is bummed. NETZER: People really are missing it because surfing is a lifestyle. SCHMITZ: Munich's wave, the Eisbachwelle, is a natural river swell, a 5-foot-high summit of water along a raging stream that bisects the city's largest park. Netzer calls the wave gnarly, dangerous. And before it disappeared, only the most experienced surfers dared to take it on. NETZER: The first time I was surfing the wave was when I was 17. I was working in a bar, and one of my bar colleagues (laughter) took me to go on the wave in the middle of the night after our shift. SCHMITZ: And why did you think that was a good idea, to come out here to the most dangerous river surfing spot and try and do it in the middle of the night? NETZER: Actually, I didn't think much about it. I don't know. We just did it. (SOUNDBITE OF DICK DALE AND HIS DEL-TONES' \"MISIRLOU\") SCHMITZ: Netzer wiped out and nearly drowned. But his throw-all-caution-to-the-wind approach is the foundation of surfing. But a river wave may not always be there for you. And on November 2, the raucous and brash surfing culture of Munich went 60 to zero, or from a Dick Dale surfing scorcher to a somber sonata from Germany's favorite composer overnight. (SOUNDBITE OF LUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN'S \"PIANO SONATA NO. 14\") SCHMITZ: Last month, city engineers lowered the river and dredged it of any potential danger spots and sediment, says fellow surfer Alexander Neumann. When the engineers reopened the floodgates, the wave was gone. In its place, a foamy, unsurfably lame stretch of white water. Neumann says surfer social media groups lit up in horror. Surf is down, dudes. ALEXANDER NEUMANN: They took a bit too much out which used to lay on the ground of the wave. And the wave is not forming properly now. That's our problem. (SOUNDBITE OF LUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN'S \"PIANO SONATA NO. 14\") SCHMITZ: Neumann, of the Munich River Surfers Association, stands at the riverside staring blankly at where the wave used to be. NEUMANN: It's a white water wash now because, as you can see, the water that's coming out from the two channels, it's not finding any resistance after because it's going down. And then you have the backwater that's coming. So that's why it's breaking in itself. (SOUNDBITE OF LUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN'S \"PIANO SONATA NO. 14\") SCHMITZ: Just upstream, a team of engineers and a hydrologist hired from Hamburg tinker with GPS and sonar equipment they're attaching to a boogie board. The city, it appears, is addressing an engineering mishap by throwing more engineers at it - a German solution to a German problem. MARKUS DISSE: They did their job too good (laughter). SCHMITZ: Hydrologist Markus Disse teaches down the street at the Technical University of Munich. He suggests the city instead experiment with the flow of the water while replacing some of the sediment to resurrect the wave. He opens a hydrology book to a page on fluid mechanics to explain what's called the Froude number. DISSE: I can give you the formula if you like. (SOUNDBITE OF LUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN'S \"PIANO SONATA NO. 14\") SCHMITZ: Dude, no. DISSE: So velocity divided by square root of gravity constant times the water height. SCHMITZ: And if, he says, the city adds sediment and increases the velocity of the water, then the Froude number increases and the height of the wave should, too. (SOUNDBITE OF WATER FLOWING) SCHMITZ: All this hydrological engineering talk made Munich surfers impatient, though. A week after the wave vanished, they MacGyvered an underwater ramp and secretly installed it where the wave used to be, and voila, the wave came back. (SOUNDBITE OF DICK DALE AND HIS DEL-TONES' \"MISIRLOU\") SCHMITZ: Yes, it was illegal, and yes, the city was not happy about the stunt, and it was removed. But for a day or two, surfers were again riding the Eisbachwelle, where the surf was back up, dude. Rob Schmitz, NPR News, Munich.

You can sign up here. The Chinese Exclusion Act is widely considered to be the first significant crackdown on immigration in American history. It's a riveting tale that parallels today and may provide insights into the economic consequences of immigration restrictions and mass deportations. This is Part 2 of that story, which explores the economic and political factors that led to the Act and examines what happened to the American economy after it was passed ( Part 1 can be read here ). Please note: this story includes racist quotes from the 19th century. On May 10, 1869, the eyes of America focused on a makeshift ceremony in the middle of nowhere. Two railroad companies had spent six years on one of the most ambitious infrastructure projects of the 19th century: the construction of the first transcontinental railroad. One company had built from the east. The other from the west. This was the day they finally met up and linked their tracks together. The meeting point was a place called Promontory Summit in the desolate desert of northwest Utah. A thousand people — politicians, journalists, railroad executives and workers — traveled there for the monumental occasion. As we covered in  Part 1 of this story , this historic moment would not have been possible without the sacrifices of Chinese immigrants. They had played a crucial role in constructing the western part of the railroad — the most difficult and dangerous section to build. As many as 1,200 Chinese immigrants died constructing it. However, on this day of celebration, railroad executives decided to exclude their Chinese workers from the official ceremony and photographs. Ouch. But Chinese Americans had reason to be hopeful in the wake of the transcontinental railroad's completion. Since they began arriving in America a couple decades before, they had been the target of discriminatory laws and violence. But now national news reports praised them as skilled and productive workers making invaluable contributions to America's economy. \"The Chinaman is a born railroad builder, and as such he is destined to be most useful to California, and, indeed, to the whole Pacific slope,\" read one nationally circulated news report.  The Daily Alta California , then the most popular newspaper in the state, declared that Chinese workers \"do a better, neater, and cleaner job, and do it faster and cheaper than white laborers from the East.\" Political winds also seemed to be blowing in favor of Chinese Americans. In 1868, the United States signed the Burlingame Treaty, which strengthened diplomatic and trade relations with China and encouraged \"free migration and emigration\" between the two countries. In the decade to come, the Chinese population in America would swell by about 50 percent. Even more, this was the post-Civil War Reconstruction era, when Radical Republicans were amending the U.S. Constitution and fighting for the civil rights of freed slaves. Many hoped that new constitutional amendments and civil rights laws would apply to other excluded groups — including Chinese immigrants. Back then, the only immigrants who were allowed to become American citizens and obtain equal rights were \"free white persons.\" In 1870, U.S. Senator Charles Sumner (R-Massachusetts), one of America's leading voices for abolition and civil rights, fought to open up a pathway for Chinese and other non-white immigrants to become citizens. But Western politicians, including in Sumner's own more racially progressive Republican party, saw this proposal as politically radioactive. In making his case against Sumner's bill to open a pathway to citizenship for Chinese immigrants, Senator William Morris Stewart (R-Nevada) warned that the West Coast would be \"overpowered by the mob element that seeks to exterminate the Chinese\" if it passed, and that \"they will be slaughtered before any one of them can be naturalized under your bill.\" The effort to expand citizenship and civil rights to Chinese immigrants failed to pass Congress. But the \"mob element\" — as Senator Stewart called it — would nonetheless make life miserable for Chinese Americans. In an omen of the horrors to come, just one year later, a white mob in Los Angeles lynched 17 Chinese men and boys in a raid on Chinatown. It was one of the largest — if not the largest — mass lynching in American history. It became known as \"the Chinese Massacre of 1871.\" All of this was before \"The Panic of 1873,\" a financial crisis that would plunge America's economy into a long and miserable depression. In the depths of despair, white working-class Americans on the West Coast would rally around a new populist slogan: \"The Chinese must go!\"  The Long Depression And The Rise of Racist Populism The completion of the transcontinental railroad may have, ironically, contributed to the coming populist backlash. For one, excitement over the transcontinental and other railroads led to a speculative bubble. Investors  overestimated  the money-making potential of railroads, and once the transcontinental railroad was up and running, reality began to set in about how much money railroads and related investments would actually make. When the bubble burst in 1873, it took the whole economy with it. The transcontinental railroad also integrated what had been effectively two separate American economies into one. Like  the adoption of container ships  during the globalization era of the 20th and 21st centuries, the transcontinental railroad increased competition in the economy by making it easier and cheaper to distribute and sell products to faraway places. This bigger, more competitive market was great for consumers, economic efficiency, and the nation's long-term economic growth. But, with the railroad now serving as a new pipeline for products, West Coast industries were suddenly forced to compete with the more efficient and mechanized industries of the East Coast. Nancy Qian, an economist at Northwestern University, says this made the economic downturn that followed the Panic of 1873 much worse in the West. Even more, during and after completion of the railroad, Chinese immigrants became a more sought after workforce, which effectively put a target on their backs. Increasing numbers of white workers began to resent them. They saw them as a culturally alien workforce, willing and able to do all sorts of jobs for less pay. And it wasn't just railroads. Chinese immigrants now worked in all sorts of West Coast industries, including manufacturing, agriculture, woodcutting, and mining. \"While the Chinese constituted less than 10 percent of the population of California in 1870, they accounted for approximately 25 percent of the workforce,\" writes Beth Lew-Williams in her book  The Chinese Must Go: Violence, Exclusion, and the Making of the Alien in America. As the economy cratered after the Panic of 1873, a scarcity of jobs led to a zero-sum mindset amongst white workers. Demagogues began to blame the labor competition posed by increasing numbers of Chinese immigrants for the miseries of white joblessness and meager pay. They painted Chinese immigrants as the servile tools of monopolistic corporations, which were becoming increasingly powerful in the rapidly industrializing United States. The mighty railroad companies — which now owned valuable land across the United States thanks to federal legislation that funded the transcontinental railroad — were a prominent example. Populists began to rail against big corporations for employing the cheap labor of Chinese immigrants instead of the labor of white people — many of whom, by the way, were also recent immigrants themselves. In late 1877, an Irish immigrant in San Francisco named Denis Kearney founded The Workingmen's Party of California. Kearney articulated a populist politics that combined pro-labor and anti-corporate rhetoric with virulent anti-Chinese racism. In one famous demonstration, in October 1877, Kearney led a mob to Nob Hill, a fancy part of San Francisco where the West Coast railroad barons had built mansions. Kearney gave a fiery speech to 2,000 people in front of the home of Charles Crocker, an executive at Central Pacific Railroad who had been instrumental in recruiting Chinese workers to build the transcontinental railroad. \"The Central Pacific Railroad men are thieves, and will soon feel the power of the workingmen,\"  Kearney said . \"When I have thoroughly organized my party, we will march through the city and compel the thieves to give up their plunder. I will lead you to the City Hall, clean out the police force, hang the Prosecuting Attorney, burn every book that has a particle of law in it, and then enact new laws for the workingmen. I will give the Central Pacific just three months to discharge their Chinamen.\" In another speech, in front of a crowd in Boston, Kearney said, \"The capitalist thief and land pirate of California, instead of employing the poor white man of that beautiful and golden State, send across Asia, the oldest despotism on earth, and there contracting with a band of leprous Chinese pirates, brought them to California, and now uses them as a knife to cut the throats of honest laboring men in that State.\" In rabble-rousing speech after speech, it was Kearney who popularized the slogan, \"The Chinese must go!\" Kearney and the Workingmen's Party would fail to achieve lasting political power, but their ideas proved to be popular on the West Coast. By the late 1870s, the writing was on the wall for both national political parties: if they wanted to win elections in West Coast states, they would need to clamp down on Chinese immigration. The Rise of Chinese Exclusion Back in those days, Washington — which didn't have much experience actually trying to regulate immigration — viewed immigration policy as something you cordially worked out with the origin countries of immigrants. American political elites also hoped to remain friendly with China, which they viewed as economically and geopolitically important. And so, in 1880, the administration of President Rutherford B. Hayes delicately worked with China to amend the Burlingame Treaty, which had encouraged the free flow of immigration between the two countries. This new treaty,  the Angell Treaty , allowed the United States to \"regulate, limit, or suspend\" the flow of Chinese laborers to the country. Congress could now act. In 1882, after a presidential election, they did just that. Congress passed a forceful bill halting immigration of Chinese workers for twenty years and requiring Chinese immigrants already in the United States to register with the government and obtain \"passports\" so they could prove their legal status (similar to a \" green card \" today). However, President Chester A. Arthur — who had only recently been elevated to the presidency after James Garfield was assassinated — objected to the law and decided to veto it. He believed it was too harsh. In  his veto message , Arthur said the law would damage diplomatic and trade relations with China, which he and many others believed were vital to American interests. He objected to provisions requiring Chinese Americans to register with the government and obtain documents to prove their legal status, calling it \"undemocratic and hostile to the spirit of our institutions.\" Even more, Arthur said, America \"profited\" from the work of Chinese immigrants — a belief held by many of the West Coast's business elites. \"They were largely instrumental in constructing the railways which connect the Atlantic with the Pacific,\" President Arthur said. \"The States of the Pacific Slope are full of evidences of their industry. Enterprises profitable alike to the capitalist and to the laborer of Caucasian origin would have lain dormant but for them.\" Arthur contended that the Chinese immigrants could continue to help develop and enrich America and, basically, do jobs that white people didn't want to do. Arthur's veto, however, proved to be a political disaster. Many Americans erupted with anger. The Knights of Labor, a growing national labor union, organized thousands of workers to protest it. Across California, townspeople burned and hanged President Arthur's effigy. Members of Arthur's own Republican party worried his veto meant that they would fail to win elections on the West Coast for the foreseeable future. Facing a national outcry, Congress went back to the drawing board a few weeks later. And they passed a watered-down version of the bill, which President Arthur signed into law on May 6, 1882. This 1882 law is now popularly known as \"the Chinese Exclusion Act.\" It banned both skilled and unskilled Chinese laborers from immigrating to the US for ten years. Symbolically and politically, this bill was a big deal: it was the first significant crackdown on immigration in American history, a message that the federal government opposed Chinese immigration, and a reaffirmation that Chinese immigrants already in America could never become citizens. However, the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was just one in a series of federal laws against Chinese immigrants — and, as Beth Lew-Williams makes clear in  The Chinese Must Go , this 1882 law was actually quite ineffective. Basically, President Arthur and Congress threw a bone to the insurgent anti-Chinese movement, but they provided few resources for federal enforcement against Chinese immigration and introduced a bunch of loopholes that allowed Chinese immigrants to continue coming in. In the years after the Act's passage, West Coast newspapers and populist agitators grew angry that Chinese immigrants were still entering the country and demanded that the government do more. This was the beginning of what you might call the national fight against \"illegal immigration\" — because before this virtually all immigration to the United States was legal. But the growing discontent with the first iteration of the Chinese Exclusion Act wasn't just about its lack of enforcement and loopholes. For many white Americans, simply preventing the flow of new Chinese immigrants wasn't enough. They wanted expulsions and deportations of the Chinese people who already lived here — even though the vast majority of them were here legally. And soon white vigilantes would take matters into their own hands. Vigilante Expulsion By 1885, anti-Chinese forces in the West had become emboldened by the federal government's actions declaring that Chinese immigration was, in fact, a problem that needed to be solved. But they were also frustrated that Chinese workers seemed to keep coming into the country. Even more, they were angry about the continued presence of Chinese people in their communities and workplaces. The first purges of Chinese Americans in towns across the West began spontaneously in response to inciting incidents. But what began as a movement characterized by sporadic outbursts of violence would soon morph into a premeditated political strategy of ethnic cleansing. In Eureka, California, on February 6, 1885, two Chinese men got into a dispute and began firing guns at each other. One of them accidentally shot a white city councilman crossing the street. Shortly after, a mob of white residents stormed into the city's Chinatown chanting \"Hang all the Chinamen!\" and \"Burn Chinatown!\" City leaders, including the mayor, sheriff, and a Christian minister, intervened to prevent arson and murders, but white gangs looted Chinatown. And, within about 48 hours, local vigilantes rounded up Chinese residents — hundreds of people — forced them onto steamships bound for San Francisco and told them to never return again. It became known as \"the Eureka method\" of expulsion and was soon copied by neighboring cities. Later that year, in Rock Springs, Wyoming,  a fight broke out  between some Chinese and white miners that quickly exploded into horrific violence. Both groups were employed by the Union Pacific Coal Company (the same Union Pacific that built half of the transcontinental railroad). White miners, themselves immigrants, had grown to resent Chinese miners.  On numerous occasions , Union Pacific had brought in Chinese workers after white workers went on strike for better wages, leading the white miners to view their Chinese counterparts as low-wage scabs. (Union Pacific, however, had also brought in Scandinavian immigrants in a similar way, but that didn't seem to elicit the same level of rage.) This particular fight was over whether Chinese or white workers would get to work in a particularly lucrative mine. It got very ugly very fast. After the dispute, a white mob descended on Chinatown, murdered 28 Chinese miners and wounded 15 others, drove the whole Chinese community out, and set their homes and stores ablaze. The incident was dubbed \"The Rock Springs Massacre.\" In Tacoma, Washington, a couple months later, residents took a more methodical, premeditated approach. \"The violence of Tacoma differed from incidents at Eureka and Rock Springs,\" writes Lew-Williams. \"The Tacoma expulsion was not a spontaneous act by a mob angered by a triggering incident. Rather, it was cold and deliberate collective action that was publicly announced well in advance.\" Nonetheless, while it may have been more orderly and less sudden, it resembled \"the Eureka method.\" White vigilantes — including Mayor Jacob Weisbach and other local political leaders — forcibly expelled all of Tacoma's Chinese residents, this time putting them on a train instead of boats. They then demolished Tacoma's Chinatown. Truckee, California, took a different approach to Chinese expulsion. Truckee sits in the basin underneath the Sierra Nevada peaks where Chinese rail workers had painstakingly built tunnels to allow passage for the transcontinental railroad ( see Part 1 of this story ). It boomed in population during and after the railroad's construction, and many Chinese rail workers made it their home. By 1870, around a third of Truckee's population was of Chinese descent. It had one of the biggest Chinatowns in the United States. White residents of Truckee had long made life difficult for its Chinese residents. In 1876, for instance, white militants — part of a secretive group called \"The Caucasian League\" — murdered a Chinese woodcutter and wounded others and then, despite a trial, were found innocent (these types of acquittals for racist thugs and vigilantes were common in the West back then). Over the years, Truckee's Chinatown was burned in a series of mysterious — but actually not so mysterious — fires. In fact, after one such fire, the town forced their Chinese residents to build a new Chinatown across the Truckee River. This new Chinatown had no bridge, so they had to cross the river by ferry. But this wasn't enough for the white residents of Truckee. They wanted Chinese people gone from the area completely. In the winter of 1885-86, a local lawyer and newspaper owner named Charles McGlashan was inspired by the cascade of purges across the West Coast. However, by then, there seemed to be some growing political and legal blowback for these extralegal expulsions. The town of Eureka, for example, was being sued by their former Chinese denizens for reparations. National politicians condemned violence in places like Rock Springs. It was within this context that McGlashan pioneered what became known as \"The Truckee Method,\" a relatively non-violent — but still violent — boycott and harassment campaign against Chinese businesses and white businesses that employed Chinese people. The aim was to starve the Chinese out by eliminating their local economic opportunities and making their lives miserable. The campaign proved successful in ridding the town of Chinese residents and was copied by numerous other towns up and down California. McGlashan became a leader in an anti-Chinese boycott movement across the state. Over the course of 1885 and 1886, more than 160 communities across the West Coast would expel their Chinese inhabitants. And they made it abundantly clear to national politicians: many Western voters were not satisfied with the 1882 law. In 1888, President Grover Cleveland — hoping to carry Western states in his upcoming reelection battle — signed into law another Chinese Exclusion Act that had more teeth than the first one. This one prohibited all Chinese laborers from coming into the country — whether or not they had resided in the United States previously. It was a policy that was easier to enforce and administer. It was also quickly implemented, leaving thousands of Chinese immigrants who had traveled abroad stranded and unable to return. It was also a policy that angered China and marked the beginning of an age in which the United States set restrictive immigration policy unilaterally. After President Cleveland signed this legislation into law, many white westerners took to the streets to celebrate. This was only two years after the unveiling of the Statue of Liberty, which proclaimed that America was a refuge for \"your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.\" Four years later, with the Geary Act, Washington renewed Chinese exclusion for another ten years, expanded the power of the federal government to enforce anti-Chinese immigration laws, and implemented the registration and \"passport\" system that President Arthur had called \"undemocratic and hostile to the spirit of our institutions.\" The Chinese Exclusion Acts — and the mob violence, pogroms, boycotts, and other forms of expulsion — had their intended effect. In 1890, the US Census Bureau recorded 107,488 Chinese people living in the United States. In 1900, that number dropped to 89,863. And by 1910, it was 71,531. The restrictions on Chinese immigration would not begin to be lifted until World War II.  The Economic Effects of Chinese Exclusion Historians have found that the economies of towns suffered after they kicked out their Chinese residents. Eureka, California faced all sorts of economic problems. \"For most white residents, the financial loss was immediate,\" writes Jean Pfaelzer in her book  Driven Out: The Forgotten War Against Chinese Americans . Businesses lost workers. \"Some went into debt to pay higher salaries to new white employees.\" Landlords lost tenants. Stores lost customers. Chinese entrepreneurs had run the laundries in the town, and now people were stuck with dirty clothes. Chinese vegetable growers had provided the town with its produce and their disappearance meant no more fresh veggies. \"White residents tried their hands at growing their own vegetables but complained about their poor results, the lack of variety of food, and the rotting produce that was shipped north from San Francisco,\" writes Pfaelzer. It was similar in Truckee. \"The Chinese were renters, shoppers, and low-paid laborers, and white agents made money from their legal, real estate, and commercial transactions,\" writes Pfaelzer. Charles McGlashan, the leader of the anti-Chinese boycott, sought to replace Chinese laundromats with an \"expensive steam laundry,\" but it was \"simply too large and expensive for the needs of the small railroad town, and the Truckee Laundry Association was sued by its major investors.\" Truckee businesses desperately recruited white workers with advertisements, but \"cheap white labor did not emerge, and mountain inns and hotels faced a summer season without food, while lumber camps could not staff their cookhouses.\" Across California, near the start of the spring of 1886, \"large-scale farmers, food processors, and cannery owners realized that they would not be able to carry on their businesses without the Chinese,\" writes Pfaelzer. Of course, all of these are just anecdotes about local effects. And, until recently, we've had no rigorous economic study of the effects of Chinese exclusion on the American economy. But in a new study, economists Nancy Qian, Joe Long, Carlo Medici, and Marco Tabellini provide just that. The title of their working paper is \"The Impact of the Chinese Exclusion Act on the economic development of the Western United States,\" but Nancy Qian, an economist at Northwestern University, says their study's estimated effects really include all the anti-Chinese laws, discrimination, and purges that affected Chinese Americans after 1882. \"If vigilante violence and discrimination had been milder, then the anti-Chinese legislations would have probably had a smaller negative effect on the US economy,\" Qian says. Namely, these laws would have reduced the inflow of Chinese immigrants, but they would not have caused as many Chinese Americans to flee communities, workplaces, and, more broadly, the United States. In this way, Qian and her colleagues' study may provide some insight into the effects not only of the restricted inflow of immigration — the official intent of the Chinese Exclusion Act — but also of mass deportations since many Chinese were forced out of communities and ultimately left the country. Chinese immigrants had been vital to many West Coast industries. \"By 1882, the Chinese had spread out across a lot of different sectors, and they were taking the skills that they had learned, mining, building the railroad, and also the ones they brought from China — they were applying it to lots of different things,\" Qian says. This, she says, made the economy better for just about everyone. \"The sad punchline\" of their study, Qian says, \"is that very few people benefited from the Chinese Exclusion Act\" and later laws and community actions. Western businesses suffered, and cities and towns across the West that saw their Chinese populations decline or disappear became less economically vibrant. For example, Qian and her colleagues find there was a slowdown in Western manufacturing, a sector in which many Chinese immigrants had worked. The crackdown against Chinese immigrants, Qian says, hurt most of the white population in the West. And, further, it made West Coast towns and cities that had large Chinese populations in 1882 less of a magnet for white workers from the East because economic opportunities in these places shriveled. The economists find that Chinese exclusion, in its many 1882 and post-1882 incarnations, slowed down the economic growth and development of the West. But Qian and her colleagues find there was at least one clear group of workers who benefited from Chinese exclusion: local white miners. It's interesting because the first wave of Chinese immigrants who came here, after 1849, came to America with the hope of finding gold. And the first discriminatory laws they faced were at the local level and aimed to discourage Chinese immigrants from mining. It also provides more context for the resentment and rage of white miners that exploded in the Rock Springs massacre. Mining is maybe more zero sum than other parts of the economy. There's a fixed level of stuff in the ground and one person's gain in finding valuable minerals is another person's loss. But Qian's study suggests most of the economy didn't work this way. It was not zero sum. Chinese workers actually improved the economic lives of most white workers and businessmen. As a concrete example, she points to Chinese woodcutters. \"So the Chinese workers — who were chopping down trees and making them into planks for the railroad — were now chopping down trees and making them into planks for the construction of houses and bars and hotels in western towns,\" Qian says. \"This is a very valuable skill. Now, all of a sudden, they leave. That doesn't just affect the lumber mill. But you have to think about all the people who are relying on using the wood. So now the doctor's office, the barmen, the hotel men, the railroad, everyone now has to pay more for wood. I mean, this is just a very important material for the whole economy.\" So, if there's a lesson from Qian's study, it's that, yes, maybe immigration restrictions and expulsions or deportations can actually help some native workers. But, really, the cost is tremendous — not just for the immigrants themselves but also for almost everyone else.  The Recent Movement To Honor Chinese Victims The story of what happened to Chinese immigrants is horrific. And in recent years, towns on the West Coast that purged their Chinese populations have begun to memorialize this dark period of history and honor the Chinese people who were kicked out of their towns. For example, the city of Tacoma worked with the Chinese Reconciliation Project Foundation, a nonprofit, to create a park, which is called  Tacoma Chinese Reconciliation Park . Since 2021, an organization called  the Eureka Chinatown Project  has done various projects around Eureka to \"honor the history and culture of the first Chinese people in Humboldt County, California\" (the county Eureka is in). Earlier this year, Truckee  unveiled a plaque  to commemorate the two Chinatowns that once existed in the town. Many Americans remain ignorant of this history, and the organizers behind these projects want to educate them about it — with the hope history won't repeat itself. When researching this history, we read a number of illuminating books. We thank the historians for their work.

There's certainly evidence to back this up; both ostensibly never sleep seeing as they churn out multiple projects every year, and love giving A-list actresses of a certain age big, bold showcases in work that's rarely, if ever, worthy of their talents. They're also the primary culprits to blame for Kim Kardashian's mortifying but mercifully rare forays into \"acting.\" The omnipresent influencer is currently starring in Murphy's much-talked about new show  All's Fair  (their second collaboration after  American Horror Story: Delicate )   and it's clear her skills have  hardly improved  in the years since Tyler Perry's  Temptation: Confessions of a Marriage Counselor  in 2013. If you've heard about  All's Fair  but haven't witnessed the lavishly gauche spectacle for yourself, I'm here to tell you: It's as terrible as everyone says it is. The show is about an all-female law firm that specializes in helping wealthy women procure the best divorce settlements from their dirtbag one-percenter husbands — think a far less high-stakes and much goofier spin on  Scandal 's   Olivia Pope & Associates. Kardashian — who has famously long been studying to become a lawyer but  has yet to pass the bar  — plays one of the high-powered partners at the law firm, and woodenly leads a cast of actual actresses that includes Naomi Watts, Glenn Close, Niecy Nash-Betts and Sarah Paulson, none of whom can overcome the bland script. In nonsensical and over-the-top execution,  All's Fair  is just as hard to watch as anything Perry's ever put his stamp on. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Zoom out a bit, though, and the similarities between the two are less pronounced. There's a winking campiness in much of Murphy's work that doesn't surface within the earnestly bad, Christian-soaked oeuvre of Perry. The former's also demonstrated a discernible talent for balancing high and low art in messy but effective ways, going all the way back to the cheeky high school dramedy  Popular  to the tabloid anthologies  American Crime Story  and  Feud  and the subversive melodrama   Pose  (the brainchild of Afro-Latino co-creator and showrunner Steven Canals). In this manner, I'd align Murphy more closely with the far less prolific Lee Daniels, their tastes always steeped in explicitly queer sensibilities, with frequencies running the gamut from uber-schlock to populist kitsch to soapy melodrama, or some other amalgamation of the bunch. Season 1 of Daniels'  Empire , which gave Taraji P. Henson a role for the ages as fierce matriarch Cookie Lyon, is a provocative blast — Douglas Sirk-ian gloss by way of the Chitlin' Circuit. Unfortunately, as Daniels and Murphy's more recent output insists, intending to produce camp or something like it doesn't always yield \"so bad it's good\" — or even merely interesting — results. There's a direct line to be drawn from Glenn Close's bonkers turn as a Jesus-loving, recovering addict grandma in Daniels' supernatural monstrosity  The Deliverance  (I'm still recovering from  her  deliverance of a  certain crass line that went viral ) to her wading into the high-end muck of  All's Fair ; I have to wonder if her willingness to do the former inspired her casting in the latter. Whether it did or not, both projects function as expressions of tedium deceivingly gussied up to look like a fun time; their provocations come off so purposefully silly as to seem embarrassingly strained.  All's Fair 's fumbling attempt to position itself as a rah-rah sisterhood story only exaggerates how unpleasant the viewing experience is, especially in these times. It's much more difficult to look past a subpar script and meme-forward performances   when the overall vibe is stale and hallow: these characters, sashaying in luxury fits across decadent mansions and corporate spaces and spouting vapid girlboss-era platitudes, speak of themselves as though they're the posterchildren for modern feminism, just because they help socialite clients in bad marriages stay wealthy post-divorce. (To this, I quote Kourtney, Kardashian's IRL sister: \" There's people that are dying .\") A scenery-ingesting Paulson, meanwhile, is the show's evil Ethel Merman, playing all the way past the back of the house, through the lobby, and out into the parking lot as the proudly anti-feminist rival attorney, sneering such colorful prose as \"Beef curtains. Black Mae West,\" when nastily addressing Kardashian and Nash-Betts' characters. She's committed to the bit, because she's a professional and one of our greats, but even she can't save this dreck. At least you could argue,  as I have before , that something like Murphy's supremely ridiculous series  Hollywood  — which imagined, among other things, an alternate universe wherein a pre-fame Rock Hudson was able to come out as gay alongside a Black partner and suffer no real consequences to his career — showed a bit of transgression.  All's Fair  is so mind-bogglingly stupid it could make even the most ardent defender of Murphy's particular brand of prestige-y trash throw their hands up in agony. Is it hate-watchable nevertheless? I guess this is where  All's Fair  shares another thing in common with the works of Tyler Perry:  no one  should hate themselves this much.

That requires taking care of herself, too \n         By Juana Summers, Alejandra Marquez Janse, Sarah Handel \n        \n           Thursday, November 20, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         At age 43, Dawnita Brown made a life-changing pivot. She took leave from her secure government job, winnowed down her possessions, resolved her financial responsibilities, and in 2016, signed up for the Peace Corps. Volunteering in Eswatini was \"amazing,\" she says — so much so that she planned to extend her time abroad in a paid position with the Peace Corps after her service ended. She didn't know she was about to make another pivot. In 2018, her mom, Joan Cain, had a stroke in her brain stem. Brown rushed home to Baltimore, preparing herself to say goodbye. Instead, her mom recovered, but with a challenging prognosis. \"So, I became her proxy,\" Brown says, and she stayed by Cain's side through rehabilitation and nursing facilities. Eventually, concerns about the quality of her mother's care led Brown to step away from her job, take her mom home and care for her herself, full time. A huge number of today's 65-year-olds — more than  two-thirds  — will likely need some kind of long-term care as they age, whether it's in-home care, assisted living or a nursing home. Those services can  easily  cost more each year  than what the  average American  makes. And health insurers — both government and private — may not provide the necessary coverage. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       That leaves many people to rely on unpaid family caregivers whose care  AARP valued at $600 billion  in 2021. That's more than half a trillion dollars worth of work done by people like Dawnita Brown. As a household, Brown makes caregiving financially feasible through a patchwork of coverage, including Medicare, supplemental insurance and her mom's pension. And she's debt free thanks to the work she put in readying herself for the Peace Corps. \"I haven't had a steady income in almost 10 years,\" says Brown. \"I haven't paid into retirement. But I don't want for anything.\" 'It's a gift' Brown's   home is warm and inviting, much like herself. The brick row house is tastefully appointed with meaningful family artifacts and photographs, meticulously clean without feeling sterile. On the day we visited, Brown had just returned from taking her dad, Bill Lee Brown, to physical therapy. She cares for him, too. Although Bill and Joan are not a couple, he moved into the home in 2024 after complications from his multiple myeloma diagnosis made it hard for him to live alone. So, while her mom's upstairs, her dad is downstairs. Between them, doing countless flights of stairs a day, Dawnita Brown is holding it all together. Meting out prescriptions, preparing meals, scheduling appointments and calling for help when it's more than one person can handle. Caregiving is a role she didn't expect, but one she has leaned all the way into. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In 2021, Brown founded a community for fellow caregivers called the  Binti Circle . The name comes from the word for daughter in Swahili. \"I started Binti because it was the community I needed and did not have,\" she says. They meet monthly, have outings and events, all with the goal of making a difference in the lives of caregivers, reducing stress and providing safety in community. That way, Brown says, \"you have more skills and tools that you need for this gift of caregiving, because it's a gift to be able to care for your parent, even though it's hard.\" She says it was especially important to her to focus on Black daughters in caregiving roles. \"The daughter holds it together,\" says Brown, even in difficult situations. \"Looking at the fragility of your parent, processing the grief of losing the parent that you knew … that your mom doesn't know you.\" She adds, \"and you know what's even more challenging are those daughters that are caring for parents that did not parent them.\" In the Binti Circle, she has gathered \"a community of daughters that understand and can empathize, with no judgment.\" One of Binti's — and Brown's — core values is the importance of respite for caregivers. \"You know, most people think about self-care as nails and hair and massages,\" she says. Brown does those things, but taking care of herself also  includes regular doctor's appointments and therapy, and simpler things, too. \"It's breathing, just sometimes laying in my bed and breathing. And my devotionals, I always set the tone before I get out of bed.\" And as positive and motivated as Brown is, she does feel down sometimes. \"Yesterday I was feeling kind of yucky,\" she says. \"And so I got up and I found a … 'boost your mood' yoga workout.\" She has also built herself her own little getaway at home — an outdoor deck space furnished with thrifted and upcycled finds, succulents and a fire pit. She calls it her oasis. \"You are responsible for people,\" says Brown, so, \"if you're no good, they're no good. And so, that's why I work very hard to take care of myself.\" \n         \n         Transcript \n         AILSA CHANG, HOST:   This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Ailsa Chang in Washington. JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:   And I'm Juana Summers in Baltimore, where, at a brick row house, we're greeted by this woman with infectious energy and a huge, bright smile. Hello. DAWNITA BROWN: Oh, hi. SUMMERS: Hey. How are you doing? D BROWN: Good. And you? SUMMERS: I'm well. Thank you for having us in your home. D BROWN: Of course. SUMMERS: Dawnita Brown welcomes us with hugs, and one of the first things we notice about her is her black hooded sweatshirt. It says family caregivers do the most and love the best. Her house is really warm and inviting, and you can hear a TV faintly playing. D BROWN: I want to make sure that I have pieces of her and my grandmother, if you will. Some of this furniture is my grandmother's. So these are from her home, and my mom actually did that painting there. SUMMERS: Oh, wow. D BROWN: You can see her name, Joan. SUMMERS: The painting is of a pair of praying hands framed by a beam of light. Brown then leads us into the kitchen. D BROWN: So I'm just getting in with my dad. He had physical therapy. And so, typically, check on my mom, make sure she's OK, and then get him something to eat. She's eating. Her girlfriend just left, so she was here to watch her. We - it takes a village while we, you know, went to take my dad. So next is getting him something to eat. SUMMERS: She reaches into the refrigerator, and she pulls out a container filled with French toast and sausage. It's a meal made by a friend. Are you able to get a lot of help from folks in your community or friends or family? D BROWN: So my aunt picked up the medication today, the prescriptions. And then my mother's friend - she came over today to sit with my mom while I took him to therapy. But on a day-to-day, it's just me. SUMMERS: The elder care system here in the U.S. is daunting. Whether it's in-home care, assisted living or a nursing home, a huge number of today's 65-year-olds - more than two-thirds - will likely need some kind of long-term care as they age. Those services can easily cost more each year than the average American makes, and health insurers, both government and private, may not provide the coverage you need. That leaves many people to rely on unpaid family caregivers. According to AARP, in 2021, they accounted for about $600 billion in unpaid labor annually. That is more than half a trillion dollars' worth of work, done by people like Dawnita Brown, every year for free. To the extent that there is a typical day for Dawnita Brown, this is what it looks like, caring for two aging parents in the same home, their rooms separated by flights of stairs. (SOUNDBITE OF FOOTSTEPS ON STAIRS) D BROWN: OK. SUMMERS: Upstairs, there's her mother, Joan, who had a brainstem stroke in 2018. Downstairs, there's Dawnita's father, Bill, who moved in last year. And now, navigating between those floors and navigating the needs of her two parents, Dawnita is the glue that holds everything together. Before she became a full-time caregiver, Brown was on leave from her job at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, serving in the Peace Corps in Eswatini. When she learned that her mother had a stroke, she rushed back to the U.S. D BROWN: I thought I was just coming home to say my goodbyes to her. SUMMERS: Her mother survived that stroke, though, with a challenging prognosis. D BROWN: From a cognitive standpoint, she couldn't really process anything for herself, so I became her proxy. SUMMERS: Dawnita Brown's mother initially did stints at a rehab facility, and she was transferred to a nursing home. But ultimately, Brown was not satisfied with her mother's care, so she decided to bring her home and take on caring for her herself, full-time. And last year, Brown's father returned from LA to Baltimore too. He was unable to care for himself independently after a cancer diagnosis. Part of how she's able to navigate life as a full-time family caregiver for both of them is that she'd already downsized and cut her personal debt. D BROWN: I haven't had a steady income in almost 10 years. I haven't paid into retirement, but I don't want for anything. SUMMERS: Can you just walk us through how you make the finances of being able to care for both of your parents work? How does the math make sense? D BROWN: My mother is on Medicare. They're both on Medicare and have supplemental insurances. My mom's pension helps with her supplies, her monthly supplies. She has great insurance as a retired federal employee. She's kind of grandfathered into an amazing plan where she doesn't have any copays or coinsurance. Her prescriptions are covered with that, and that's taken out of her pension. My dad - like, I'm blessed because both of my parents were fiscally responsible, if you will. So I would say I'm in a unique position. SUMMERS: Dawnita Brown is intentional about everything, methodical about how she plans care for her parents but also about how she cares for herself. As we talk, she repeatedly brings up the idea of respite. D BROWN: It's breathing, just sometimes just staying in bed and breathing, and my devotionals. I always set the tone before I get out of bed. Yesterday, I was feeling kind of yucky. You know, you get those moments. And so I got up and I found a yoga - boost your mood yoga workout that I did. You know what I mean? So I try to do those things, as well as I stay up on my annual checkups and physicals and therapy. There's been an uptick. You know, most people think about self-care as nails and hair and massages. I do those, too. You know, I'm going to get my nails done Friday (laughter) and going to the dermatologist. Like, I make sure that the basics - you know, like I said, my well checks are done, as well as doing things that I know that make me feel good. SUMMERS: Brown also has built a community of fellow caregivers. It's called the Binti Circle. The name comes from the word for daughter in Swahili. The group first met in February 2021, just nine people. And every month since, they've kept meeting, their numbers growing. D BROWN: I started Binti because it was the community that I needed and did not have. And we meet monthly. We have quarterly outings, respite with rhythms and letting go with laughter. So, you know, we build in comedy shows and music, live music outings. We try to make sure that there is impact, that it's making a difference, that stress levels are reduced, that you feel safe in community. You have more skills and tools that you need for this gift of caregiving. Because it's a gift, like, to be able to care for your parent, even though it's hard. SUMMERS: And I know that the Binti Circle focuses specifically on Black daughter caregivers. Why was that focus so important to you? D BROWN: It was important because it's the Black daughter - and this is just what I knew, not even when I started to do research. This is just what I knew is, like, the daughter holds it together. And so, as a Black woman, with the health disparities and just how we are just disproportionately affected by so much, I felt like it was important for us to have that space. And caring for a parent is different. Like I say, looking at the fragility of your parent, processing the grief of losing the parent that you knew, processing that you won't be able to have the conversations with your mom that you did before - right? - processing that your mom doesn't know you. You know what I mean? So that's why I felt like we need this community, too, 'cause, to be honest, you know, sometimes when we have things, it's not easy, right? And you want to share how you really feel and be - we're a safe space. We know - I say it, like, girl - like what my mother sometimes say - I say girl, if you did not treat me good, you would be dead by now, 'cause she drives me crazy. And so we're able to share those stories and laugh about them because it's real. It's really - and you know what's even more challenging are those daughters that are caring for parents that did not parent them. SUMMERS: Ooh. D BROWN: So having a community of daughters that understand and can empathize with you with no judgment, that's important, right? SUMMERS: She walks us up this narrow staircase that leads to her mother's bedroom, and she and Bill are hanging out there. And a game show, \"The 1% Club,\" is playing on the TV. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE 1% CLUB\") UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: What did you put? SUMMERS: She tells us that another goal for her as a caregiver and a daughter is to continue creating memories, to try to celebrate her parents now while they're still here. Hanging on the bedroom door is the outfit for her mother's casino-themed 75th birthday party. Her mother's reclining, resting in bed, and her father sits in an armchair near the foot of the bed with a fleece Baltimore Ravens blanket draped over the top. Good afternoon. How are you doing today? (SOUNDBITE OF ITEMS RUSTLING) BILL BROWN: Doing fine. And how are you ladies doing? SUMMERS: We're well. Thank you. D BROWN: Ma. Ma. Ma. SUMMERS: Oh. It's OK. D BROWN: Wake up. You don't want to wake up? SUMMERS: We chat for a little bit, and then head back down the stairs, slipping on our shoes before we head out. And as we do, Dawnita Brown is already looking ahead. She's holding an orange pill bottle in her hand. It's time now to fill the pill boxes to make sure that both of her parents have the care that they need. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SUMMERS: November is National Family Caregivers Month, and we have more of our reporting coming for you next week. Jennifer Levin (ph) unexpectedly became a caregiver for her father when she was just 32. JENNIFER LEVIN: I had never even stepped into a nursing home before. SUMMERS: Like Dawnita Brown, she found herself in need of a community that understood her situation. Specifically for Levin, that meant the challenges of being a caregiver as a millennial. LEVIN: You are thinking about, well, how am I going to date when I'm also responsible for somebody at home? How can I explain to somebody what I do and that there's always a priority that's going to usurp our plans? How can I have children? Can I afford it if I'm caregiving? Do I have the time? SUMMERS: Jennifer Levin joins us with her best advice for millennial caregivers coming up next week.

Spread throughout the  roughly 23,000 documents  released by the House Oversight Committee last week, emails and texts show Epstein courted prominent politicos from both sides of the aisle, impressed academics and used his connections to push back on negative stories about his alleged crimes. Epstein's career as a wealthy financier who gave money to universities and other causes put him in many elite circles. Those circles did not entirely close to him after  he pleaded guilty  to state charges of solicitation of prostitution and of solicitation of prostitution with a minor under the age of 18 in 2008. Reading through the text messages and emails released, the people who consulted with Epstein rarely acknowledged the severity of the crimes that required him to register as a sex offender, though simply corresponding with Epstein does not implicate individuals in his criminal activities, convicted or accused. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       There's an  apparent letter of recommendation  for Epstein from linguist Noam Chomsky, calling him a \"highly valued friend,\" that recalled how Epstein connected him with former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak — another frequent Epstein correspondent. \"Jeffrey constantly raises searching questions and puts forth provocative ideas, which have repeatedly led me to rethink crucial issues,\" the letter reads. There's advice Epstein gave to Steve Bannon, Trump's former strategist, about ways to build a far-right political movement overseas. \"If you are going to play here, you'll have to spend time, [E]urope by remote doesn't work,\" Epstein wrote in 2018. \"Lots and lots of face time and hand holding. Europe can be a wife not a mistress.\" Former Harvard University president and onetime Treasury Secretary Larry Summers is documented numerous times having intimate personal chats with Epstein, including asking for romantic advice and joking about women's intelligence. \"I yipped about inclusion,\"  wrote Summers in 2017 . \"I observed that half the IQ [in the] world was possessed by women without mentioning they are more than 51 percent of population....\" Summers resigned as Harvard's president in 2006 after arguing that women may be innately less capable in math and science. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In the week since the latest Epstein emails release, he has resigned from the board of OpenAI and  abruptly left his teaching role  at Harvard, as the university  announced a probe  of \"information concerning individuals at Harvard included in the newly released Jeffrey Epstein documents to evaluate what actions may be warranted.\" Summers isn't the only high-profile Democrat who found themself in varying degrees of Epstein's orbit. Kathryn Ruemmler, former White House counsel in the Obama administration and current chief legal officer for Goldman Sachs, messaged with Epstein before and during Trump's first term. \"Trump is living proof of the adage that it is better to be lucky than smart,\" she wrote in August 2015. \"I regret ever knowing Jeffrey Epstein,\" Ruemmler told  The Wall Street Journal  in 2023. More than a thousand mentions of Trump Trump promised to release the Epstein files on the campaign trail but largely stonewalled the effort this year since he returned to office, frequently calling the push for more transparency around the Epstein case a \"hoax\" perpetrated by Democrats. In a Wednesday Truth Social post announcing the signing of the Epstein Files Transparency Act, Trump said Democrats were using the issue to distract from what he says are victories for his administration. \"Perhaps the truth about these Democrats, and their associations with Jeffrey Epstein, will soon be revealed, because I HAVE JUST SIGNED THE BILL TO RELEASE THE EPSTEIN FILES!\" he  posted . The president has the authority to release the files without congressional action. Trump is a frequent subject of emails and text messages in the latest file tranche — well over a thousand different mentions — though mainly the subject of Epstein's near-obsession with his presidency, as the latter positioned himself as a Trump whisperer of sorts to his powerful associates. This week, after an abrupt reversal that led to the near-unanimous approval of the  Epstein Files Transparency Act , the president has now called for Democrats mentioned in Epstein's communications to be investigated by the Justice Department. \"I will be asking A.G. Pam Bondi, and the Department of Justice, together with our great patriots at the FBI, to investigate Jeffrey Epstein's involvement and relationship with Bill Clinton, Larry Summers, Reid Hoffman, J.P. Morgan, Chase, and many other people and institutions, to determine what was going on with them, and him,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. Other Republicans are going on the offensive too — highlighting revelations that Epstein was texting Democratic Del. Stacey Plaskett of the U.S. Virgin Islands during a  House Oversight Committee hearing  with Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen in 2019. Comparing the newly released messages with the video of the hearing, minutes after Epstein suggested Plaskett ask Cohen things about the Trump Organization, Plaskett posed similar questions. An effort to censure Plaskett in the House failed Tuesday. In a floor speech, Plaskett defended her actions as receiving information from a constituent and said it was \"not public knowledge at that time that he was under federal investigation.\" Amid the partisan finger-pointing around the Epstein files, some of Epstein's accusers are imploring the president not to make things partisan and focus on the other powerful people that they say haven't faced scrutiny — regardless of political party. What's next for the government's Epstein files? Within 30 days of Trump signing the Epstein Files Transparency Act, the attorney general is supposed to make \"all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials\" available in a searchable and downloadable format. That includes information that relates to Epstein, his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell and \"individuals named or referenced in connection with Epstein's criminal activities.\" There's also a focus on information regarding plea deals and decisions not to charge Epstein for other alleged crimes, as well as documents pertaining to his 2019 death by suicide in federal custody. Over the summer, the  FBI put out a memo  that said their files include \"a significant amount of material, including more than 300 gigabytes of data and physical evidence.\" Some of that includes photos and videos of Epstein's accusers, including minors, and disturbing material that will not be made public. The bill from Congress also says anything \"that would jeopardize an active federal investigation or ongoing prosecution\" can be withheld or redacted, too. With Trump's ordering of the investigation into Democrats and financial institutions mentioned in the Epstein correspondence, it is unclear how much of the Justice Department's files will be released, to what extent they will be redacted and when they ultimately will be made public. \n         \n         Transcript \n         LEILA FADEL, HOST:   Now that President Trump has signed the bill that directs the Department of Justice to release files relating to Jeffrey Epstein, there's renewed focus on the documents that already have been released and what they say about the president. A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:   In thousands of pages that are now public, other powerful people were revealed to keep close ties to Epstein even after he became a registered sex offender. FADEL: NPR's Stephen Fowler has been sifting through everything that's already out there and is with me now. Good morning. STEPHEN FOWLER, BYLINE: Good morning. FADEL: So what do these files tell us about the people who associated with Jeffrey Epstein before he died? FOWLER: The long and the short of it here, Leila, is that there are a ton of rich and powerful people that sought counsel from Epstein. Academics, lawyers, politicians, you name it. Reading through these emails, for much of these conversations, you'd never know he was already accused of sex-related crimes with underage girls. There's an apparent letter of recommendation for Epstein from linguist Noam Chomsky that calls him a, quote, \"highly valued friend,\" that recalled how Epstein connected him with former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who also emailed with Epstein frequently. There's advice Epstein gave to Steve Bannon, Trump's former strategist, about ways to build a far-right political movement in Europe. Former Harvard president and one-time U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers is stepping away from his public responsibilities after being documented in these files asking Epstein for romantic advice. The list goes on and on. FADEL: Now, President Trump still calls the demands to release the Epstein files a, quote, \"hoax.\" So if it's a hoax, why is he using it to attack Democrats? FOWLER: It is worth remembering that Trump is mentioned quite frequently in these documents. Epstein appeared obsessed with Trump and his presidency and trying to tell powerful people that he was this sort of Trump whisperer because of their onetime friendship. But plenty of high-profile Democrats have been in varying degrees of Epstein's orbit. And Trump is directing the Justice Department to investigate links between Democrats like former President Bill Clinton, Summers and megadonor Reid Hoffman. Other Republicans are going on the offensive, too, highlighting revelations that Epstein was texting Democratic member of Congress Stacey Plaskett of the Virgin Islands during a 2019 committee hearing with Trump's former attorney, Michael Cohen. Text messages show that Epstein teed up Plaskett to ask Cohen things about the Trump Organization. And you can see on the video of the hearing that those questions come a few minutes later. But some of Epstein's accusers are imploring the president not to make things partisan and focus on the other powerful people they say haven't faced scrutiny, regardless of political affiliation. FADEL: Now, after the near unanimous approval in Congress of a measure that would direct the Justice Department to release files related to Epstein, what else could we learn that's different from these estate files? FOWLER: Within 30 days of Trump signing the Epstein Files Transparency Act, the attorney general is supposed to make, quote, \"all unclassified records, documents, communications and investigative materials\" available in a searchable and downloadable format. That relates to things like Epstein, his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell, travel records, individuals named or referenced in connection with Epstein's criminal activities, information about plea deals and decisions not to charge Epstein and his death by suicide. Over the summer, the FBI put out a memo that said those files include a significant amount of material, including more than 300 gigabytes of data and physical evidence. Some of that includes photos and videos of Epstein's victims, including minors, that will not be made public. The bill from Congress also says anything jeopardizing a federal investigation can be withheld, too. And Trump did just announce a new federal investigation. So, Leila, it's not clear what files will be released and when. FADEL: That's NPR's Stephen Fowler. Thank you, Stephen. FOWLER: Thank you. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5615040","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"17:10:00-05:00","title":"The CDC revives debunked 'link' between childhood vaccines and autism","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reversed its long-held position by updating its website to state that a link between childhood vaccines and autism cannot be ruled out, a change that contradicts over 40 years of high-quality scientific research showing no such connection.

The CDC's website now says a link between vaccines and autism  cannot be ruled out . That's a reversal from the CDC's longstanding stance that there is no link. The change comes even though a connection between vaccines and autism has long been debunked by a large body of high-quality research. But Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has  long promoted the discredited claim . The CDC's change is alarming public health experts. They are already worried about a drop in childhood vaccination, which has led to a resurgence of dangerous childhood diseases like measles and whooping cough. \"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website has been changed to promote false information suggesting vaccines cause autism,\" said Dr. Susan J. Kressly, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, in a statement. \"Since 1998, independent researchers across seven countries have conducted more than 40 high-quality studies involving over 5.6 million people. The conclusion is clear and unambiguous: There's no link between vaccines and autism.\" She went on to say, \"Anyone repeating this harmful myth is misinformed or intentionally trying to mislead parents. We call on the CDC to stop wasting government resources to amplify false claims that sow doubt in one of the best tools we have to keep children healthy and thriving: routine immunizations.\" In a statement to NPR, Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Andrew Nixon repeated one of the changes to the website: \"The claim 'vaccines do not cause autism' is not an evidence-based claim because studies have not ruled out the possibility that infant vaccines cause autism.\" He said the department \"has launched a comprehensive assessment of the causes of autism, including investigations on plausible biologic mechanisms and potential causal links.\" \"The new statement shows a lack of understanding of the term 'evidence,'\" the  Autism Science Foundation  said in a statement the organization provided to NPR, adding, \"No environmental factor has been better studied as a potential cause of autism than vaccines.\" It's a statement that's confusing by design, said  Dr. Paul Offitt , a pediatrician and director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. \"These are the usual anti-vaccine tropes, misrepresentation of studies, false equivalence,\" he says. \"They might as well say chicken nuggets might cause autism because you can't prove that either.\" The changes on the website \"blindsided\" career scientists at CDC, says Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, a former top CDC official who resigned from the agency in August. \"The scientists did not participate in its creation,\" he says. \"And the data are unvetted.\" Two current CDC staffers, who contacted NPR Thursday, say the updates are a glaring red flag that indicate the vaccine information on the agency website is no longer credible, and is instead \"anti-science.\" They requested anonymity out of concern they could lose their jobs for speaking to the press. The moves are the latest in a series of steps Kennedy has taken on the safety and effectiveness of vaccines that run counter to mainstream medical and scientific organizations like the pediatrics academy, the Infectious Disease Society of American and the American College of Physicians. Vaccine proponents say the moves are recklessly undermining public confidence in vaccines and fueling vaccine hesitancy, putting the nation's children at risk. The U.S. appears to be poised to  lose its status as having eliminated measles . Kennedy sacked all the members of the CDC's influential Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, earlier this year and replaced the members with his own slate. In one of its first actions, the new advisory committee called for the removal of the preservative thimerosal used in a small fraction of flu vaccines, even though safety concerns about it have also been debunked. Under Kennedy, federal health agencies have also made it harder for people to get vaccinated against COVID-19, and canceled grants funding new vaccines that rely on mRNA technology at the heart of the most used COVID vaccines. The Trump administration has also claimed there is a link between acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, and autism, and promoted the use of leucovorin, a prescription form of vitamin B9, to treat autism  even though the evidence supporting that is scant . An ACIP working group is now studying more major changes in childhood vaccinations, including removing compounds that  include aluminum used to increase vaccine effectiveness . These adjuvants have been used safely for nearly a century. The committee is also exploring  separating a single shot now given to protect against measles, mumps and rubella in a single shot  into individual shots. Public health experts say both moves are scientifically unsound and would essentially upend the nation's childhood vaccination regimen, leaving children vulnerable to diseases that had long been brought under control. The committee is also  considering recommending delaying vaccinating children against hepatitis B . For years, all babies have been vaccinated against hepatitis at birth. Hepatitis B can cause liver failure and liver cancer. The CDC acknowledges in a footnote on its main webpage on autism and vaccines that it still carries a header reading \"Vaccines do not cause autism*\" and says it hasn't \"been removed due to an agreement with the chair of the U.S. Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee that it would remain on the CDC website.\" NPR emailed Louisiana Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy's office for comment but didn't receive an immediate response. Cassidy chairs the Senate HELP Committee, which vetted Kennedy's nomination to lead HHS and voted along party lines to support it. Cassidy  posted on X Thursday afternoon : \"I'm a doctor who has seen people die from vaccine-preventable diseases. What parents need to hear right now is vaccines for measles, polio, hepatitis B and other childhood diseases are safe and effective and will not cause autism. Any statement to the contrary is wrong, irresponsible, and actively makes Americans sicker.\" \n         \n         Transcript \n         JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:   There has been a major change in the U.S. government's policy on vaccines and autism. For years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been very clear. Vaccines do not cause autism. But now its website suggests that they might. Scientists within the CDC reject the change, and they say they were not involved in making it. Activists who question the safety of vaccines are thrilled. NPR's Pien Huang is here to tell us more. Hi. PIEN HUANG, BYLINE: Hey, Juana. SUMMERS: Hey there. So just start by telling us what changes are you seeing on the CDC's website today? HUANG: So a web page that previously said vaccines do not cause autism has been amended. It now essentially says vaccines might cause autism and science hasn't proven that they don't. And it also describes the state of the evidence as lacking and says that the federal government will be investing more money to study this. Now, to be clear, there is no new evidence linking vaccines with autism. Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, a former top official at CDC, says the research has been very clear for years. DEMETRE DASKALAKIS: Every scientist in the world who is not a conspiracy theorist, who has not been discredited, who has not had their medical license taken away, every scientist knows that vaccines do not cause autism. HUANG: The Autism Science Foundation, which funds autism research, says that the science on autism points to other factors like genetics, family history, exposure to a lot of air pollution or certain fever-inducing illnesses during pregnancy - again, not vaccines. SUMMERS: OK. So then why is this showing up on the CDC's website now? HUANG: So Daskalakis and others point to leadership. The current health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is someone who has long been critical of vaccines. He's written books claiming that their dangers have been covered up by the government, and he used to lead an influential activist group, Children's Health Defense, that's advanced these causes. Today, that group's CEO, Mary Holland, celebrated the changes. Here she is talking in a video on the group's website. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MARY HOLLAND: Here we are seeing the CDC, the most prestigious medical public health organization in the world, saying out loud, we lied for 30 years. That's remarkable. It's really remarkable. HUANG: Holland said that her group has been working for years to promote their view that vaccines are the main cause of the autism epidemic, and many members of her group have children with autism, and they feel that their concerns have been ignored. Now, Holland has said that these changes would not have happened without Kennedy, who, as health secretary, has been putting former colleagues in positions of power throughout the federal government's vaccine program. And at the same time, Kennedy has been barring the CDC's career scientists from speaking directly with the public. Some told me that they are now worried they work for an anti-science organization, and they said this is a major escalation of what Kennedy has been doing for months. SUMMERS: Say more about that. What are they specifically referring to? HUANG: Yeah. So as health secretary, Kennedy has been sowing doubts about vaccine safety. Earlier this year, during a big measles outbreak in Texas which killed two children, Kennedy went on Fox News and said that the measles vaccines kills people every year, gives them the same symptoms you get from measles. That is not true. He's also been making changes to how vaccine policy gets made. So he stacked a CDC vaccine advisory committee with people known for their unorthodox views, who have been raising unsupported conspiracy theories at public meetings, and they've already made some changes to policies for flu and COVID vaccines. That same advisory committee is meeting in two weeks, where they're expected to make more changes to the vaccine schedule. So that's something we'll be watching closely. SUMMERS: NPR's Pien Huang, thank you. HUANG: You're welcome. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5614949","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"12:13:00.000-05:00","title":"These families' health care costs will balloon if Congress doesn't act on the ACA","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. government shutdown has ended, but a critical issue remains: Congress has failed to extend enhanced tax credits that support Affordable Care Act (ACA) health insurance plans.

Congress failed to extend enhanced tax credits that have helped millions of Americans on Affordable Care Act plans cover their plan costs since 2021. Senate Republicans have promised a vote on the enhanced subsidies before the end of the year. But open enrollment for these plans is already underway and consumers are facing sky-high prices and little certainty about whether they'll get relief. And making matters worse, insurers have raised prices on these plans because they predict that without the tax credits, healthier people may not sign up in 2026, leaving them a  sicker, costlier pool of customers . Premiums on the marketplaces are rising by an average of 26% next year,  according to health policy organization KFF . That's the largest rate increase since 2018. There's less than a month to go before the Dec. 15 deadline to sign up for a plan that begins Jan. 1. If Congress doesn't act before then, some people may have to choose between paying far more than they're comfortable with or forgoing insurance altogether. Here are their stories: She \"can't swing\" an extra $1,000 a month Amy Jackson, Butler, Mo. Amy Jackson, 56, works in medical billing at an independent urgent care center. She buys coverage on the ACA marketplace because her employer is too small to have health benefits. She says her current premiums are affordable for her at $275 a month but will go to $1,250 in 2026 without the tax credit. Going without insurance is really not an option for her. In October, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. So she's rushing to get in as much treatment as she can before the year ends, but she'll still need coverage for follow-up appointments next year. Since she works in the medical field, she says she knows the insurance industry is part of the problem here. But she says people like her need help now, and lawmakers need to understand that. \"For them, a thousand bucks is probably nothing. It's probably what they blow on dinner. But for me, that's half of my wage,\" she says. \"I just can't swing that.\" \"A very daunting amount of money\" for a retiree Robert Bixon, Boynton Beach, Fla. A 61-year-old retiree, Robert Bixon, faces 2026 premiums of $4,500 a month to cover himself, his wife, and one of his sons. That's $54,000 a year, plus potentially spending up to $15,000 for their out-of-pocket maximum. Bixon says he knew he'd have to pay for health care out of pocket after retiring from his career as a small business owner. \"But,\" he says, \"in my wildest dreams, I never thought a number close to $70,000 a year would be the cost that I'd be facing.\" \"It's a very daunting amount of money,\" he says. What scares Bixon even more is that prices could keep going up: \"Twelve months from now, we could be having the same conversation and I could be looking at another 20% or 30% increase.\" \"I wonder if I'm going to be able to live out my days and enjoy my retirement and not run out of money,\" he says. Still, Bixon isn't willing to risk living without insurance before becoming eligible for Medicare at 65. He has spent his entire adult life saving and investing for retirement and says he \"can't risk getting wiped out by long-term hospitalization.\" \"I just don't understand how the leadership in this country can find that acceptable for working-class Americans — people who started businesses, helped employ other people, paid taxes — now [are] looking at these kinds of health care costs,\" he says. Fears losing access to treatment for his bipolar disorder Ezra McKay, Memphis, Tenn. Ezra McKay, 26, works part-time as a bookseller. He was kicked off his mother's plan, and his employer won't give him enough hours to get on the employer plan. So he buys his own insurance on the ACA marketplace. He has bipolar disorder and the insurance, which covers his doctors' visits and prescriptions, has been a game changer for his health. Having that covered, he says \"has been such a relief. It's just made me feel important and valid, like I deserve to exist or something like that.\" But without the subsidy, his premium for next year will go from $15 per month to $550, which is nearly half his monthly income. Without insurance to cover his medication, McKay says, \"I would be in an extremely bad situation of having difficulty maintaining my job, maintaining my house, maybe even having a life-threatening situation, if I were to have a mental health crisis.\" He says he is considering moving to California or Washington state, where state programs offer more secure coverage. \"Where along the lines did I not do the right thing?\" Catriona Johnson, Chapel Hill, N.C. Before the ACA, 44-year-old Catriona Johnson had to live without health insurance for several years because she had a pre-existing condition. She was born with a congenital abnormality that required multiple surgeries in her abdomen and still requires her to use a catheter every day. She says that the preventative care she got access to through ACA has increased her quality of health enough for her to earn her Master of Social Work degree. Currently, she pays $442 a month for her premium with the tax credit, but that is set to go up to $666 next year. Her deductible will jump by $1,000. Insurance is critical for her as she requires ongoing medical care. \"I have no idea what I am going to do if I cannot afford care. Just go day by day, keep trying,\" she says. Johnson says she's always tried to do things right. Despite her serious health problems, she went to college and grad school and has a job. Still, she lives paycheck to paycheck as a contract social worker in private practice, with most of her credit card bills being medical-related — medical supplies, medications, doctors' appointments.  She wonders, \"Where along the lines did I not do the right thing?\" She worries that the rise in costs for her health insurance will affect her credit, which already happened in her 20s because of medical debt. \"Everything I can't pay — on to the credit card, to worry about another day.\" To cover an extra $1,300 a month, he'll stop contributing to retirement Chris O'Donnell, Richmond, Va.  After he got laid off from his job this summer, Chris O'Donnell, 58, started a freelance business. He gets his health insurance through Virginia's ACA marketplace.  He and his wife currently pay $837 a month for their plan. Without subsidies, the 2026 cost will be $2155 — that's $1,300 more per month. O'Donnell says he plans to redirect the money he would have saved for retirement to cover the added premium costs. \"This is not the time to be zeroing out my retirement contributions, but what choice do I have?\" His wife has diabetes and is a cancer survivor, so \"not having insurance is just completely out of the question,\" he says. \"Even if I wanted to go without health insurance, just the supplies for her insulin pump would cost $25,000 a year anyway, so I wouldn't actually be saving anything.\" He and his wife are seriously considering retirement in a country where health care costs are more stable. \"If this is the new normal and then you figure, health insurance is going to go up 20% every year, then I don't know that long-term staying in this country is going to be sustainable for us,\" he says. With the cost more than doubling, she might forgo health insurance Celeste Jameson, North Port, Fla. For paralegal Celeste Jameson, 41, her monthly insurance premiums will more than double next year, from $266 to $593. \"I can't afford $593 a month. I just can't, on top of all of my other living expenses,\" Jameson  told WUSF. As a young adult, she suffered from severe abdominal and pelvic pain that went undiagnosed until just over 10 years ago, when she was finally able to get reliable health insurance through the ACA marketplace. \"I was in and out of hospitals with severe pain, ovarian contusions and everything, with no insurance,\" she said. The bills piled up. She got into medical debt. In 2014, after being rushed to the emergency room in \"probably the worst pain I'd ever had,\" a doctor diagnosed her with endometriosis, a condition where tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows in other parts of the body. Once she felt better, she was able to take on regular work as a paralegal. She credits her health insurance with finally helping her get the diagnosis that led to her improved health. She has not yet renewed her insurance for next year. \"It scares me to know or to even imagine that I could be back where I was before 2014,\" she said. \"I'd rather eat nothing but PB&Js than give up my health insurance.\" Kelly Badeau, Tucson, Ariz. Kelly Badeau is facing monthly insurance costs of nearly nine times what she is paying now. She currently pays $94 per month for a silver ACA plan after the tax credits, and her 2026 plan will cost an estimated $900. Before becoming self-employed 10years ago, she had \"bare bones\" insurance with a high deductible through an employer. Her current ACA silver plan \"is the best insurance I've ever had,\" she says. It has allowed her to take a proactive approach to her health, including annual primary care visits, screenings like mammograms and a colonoscopy, and seeing an audiologist. \"With the ACA, I'm healthier both mentally and physically,\" she says. She says she doesn't want to drop her current plan. \"I'd rather eat nothing but PB&Js than give up my health insurance,\" she says. She sold her home last year and says she'll have to use some of that money to pay for health care. \"I will dip into my savings to make my payments next year,\" she says. \"I don't want this administration to think they can tank the ACA by making us suffer.\" But Badeau worries that she might have to start cutting corners in her health if she has too many medical expenses and can't afford the co-pays. Her husband may need treatment for prostate cancer soon, and she's on hormone therapy for menopause and blood pressure drugs. \"I'm just trying to keep my head above water until I can get Medicare, but that's still many years from now,\" she says. She worries she'll become disabled without health care Genna Boatright, Siren, Wis. Genna Boatright, 40, has an aggressive case of rheumatoid arthritis and relies on medication to control it. She is currently only paying $12 a month for her insurance premium because the enhanced subsidy covers most of her cost. But she says without the tax credit, her new premium costs will be $700, based on the numbers she's seeing in the marketplace. \"And that I absolutely cannot afford,\" she says. She says her income changed this year, and when she went onto the marketplace to shop for plans, she was pushed to apply for Medicaid. But she was denied Medicaid coverage. So she's continuing to see what is possible and waiting to see if anything changes with the prices. \"The flood of overwhelm has been real,\" she says. She worries about how she will get coverage she can afford and is \"trying to make it through the days.\" \"I do worry that without insurance and specialty care and the medication that I'm on, how quickly I will become disabled,\" she says. \"And that's an absolutely terrifying prospect.\" As a self-employed therapist, her ACA plan is her only option for insurance Kristine Weidner, Branford, Conn. Self-employed as a psychotherapist, Kristine Weidner, 62, says the cost of the plan she buys on the ACA marketplace will nearly triple in 2026. Her current high-deductible plan costs $589 a month, not including dental, and a comparable plan for 2026 will cost $1691 a month. She's really worried about the cost and about meeting the deductible. \"If I include dental, it will cost more than my housing,\" she says. And she has \"no other option\" for health care. Going without insurance, she says, isn't a wise choice at her age. She's also worried the rising costs may impact volume in her business as some clients may forgo insurance and not be able to afford her services.  \"I may need to consider closing my business and returning to the public sector and employer-based insurance.\" NPR's Margaux Bauerlein and Selena Simmons-Duffin and WUSF's Kerry Sheridan contributed reporting. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5615060","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"14:08:00-05:00","title":"Recalled baby formula linked to a botulism outbreak may still be in some stores","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A botulism outbreak linked to ByHeart Whole Nutrition infant formula has sickened 31 babies across 15 U.S. states, with no deaths but all requiring hospitalization.

outbreak may still be in some stores \n         By Rachel Treisman \n        \n           Thursday, November 20, 2025 • 2:08 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Infant formula linked to a botulism outbreak that has sickened dozens of babies across 15 states may still be on store shelves even after being recalled, federal health officials say. As of Wednesday, the  Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said , 31 cases of suspected or confirmed infant botulism have been reported in babies who consumed ByHeart Whole Nutrition formula and got sick between August and mid-November. No deaths have been reported. But all 31 babies were hospitalized with the illness, which can cause a potentially  life-threatening form of gradual paralysis  in infants less than a year old. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"Epidemiologic and laboratory data show that ByHeart Whole Nutrition infant formula might be contaminated with Clostridium botulinum, which is causing infant illness in multiple regions of the country,\" the FDA said. ByHeart Whole Nutrition recalled two batches of its infant formula earlier this month before  expanding the recall  to all of its products — which include cans and single-serve packets — last week. They are sold at major retailers — including Target, Publix, Walmart and Whole Foods — and online nationwide, with some products shipped to customers outside the U.S. ByHeart, which describes itself as a \"next-generation baby nutrition company,\" first hit the market in 2022. The FDA says its products make up \"approximately 1%\" of all infant formula sold in the U.S., so it does not have concerns about a  potential shortage . In an  apology note  to parents, ByHeart says it is cooperating with the FDA and \"investigating every facet of our process\" to identify the cause of the outbreak. In the meantime, the company — along with the FDA — is urging adults to stop using the formula and monitor their babies for symptoms of botulism. The FDA is also asking stores to stop selling the product. But in its Wednesday update, the agency said it had \"received reports that recalled formula is still being found on store shelves in multiple states.\" NPR has reached out to the FDA for more information but did not hear back by publication time. The FDA says it is working with state partners and retailers \"to ensure an effective recall\" as its investigation into the outbreak continues. What we know about the outbreak As of Wednesday, the  FDA said  the 31 cases had been reported in 15 states: Arizona, California, Idaho, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas and Washington. The outbreak has grown since the FDA first announced its investigation on Nov. 8. At that point, it said that out of an estimated 83 cases of infant botulism reported nationwide since August, 13 of the infants had consumed ByHeart formula at some point. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       That raised red flags, because botulism is uncommon in dairy products and \"there is no historical precedent of infant formula causing infant botulism,\" the FDA said. In response, ByHeart promptly recalled two batches of its products. The next day,  it announced  that the California Department of Public Health had tested a sample from one of those batches, and the result came back positive for Clostridium botulinum, the bacteria that causes infant botulism. That sample came from an opened can, which ByHeart originally said did not prove that its product was to blame (as the bacteria can occur naturally in places like soil and dust). But in an  FAQ on its website , it now says further testing by a third-party group identified the bacteria in some samples of unopened formula, too. ByHeart says  the FDA informed it in a \"late-night call\" on Nov. 10 that it had found two more cases of infant botulism in babies that had consumed its formula. The next day, ByHeart, citing \"too many unanswered questions,\" recalled all of its products and released information for parents about  how to switch  to a different formula brand. What to know about infant botulism  Botulism is a rare but serious illness caused by Clostridium botulinum. When a baby swallows the spores, \"they grow in the gut and make toxin,\" according to the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  (CDC). Symptoms can appear three to 30 days after consuming the bacteria, and generally start with constipation, poor feeding, difficulty swallowing and loss of head control. \"If untreated, infants with infant botulism experience a progressive, flaccid paralysis that can lead to breathing difficulties and require weeks of hospitalization,\" the CDC says. Treatment for infant botulism involves an antitoxin known as BabyBIG, which is administered through an IV. The CDC says parents should stay vigilant for several weeks after their baby last consumed ByHeart formula. They are advised to wash contaminated surfaces and label any leftover powder \"DO NOT USE\" and store it safely for a month, in case their infant develops symptoms and the state health department wants to test it. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The CDC says parents should seek immediate medical care if they see any concerning symptoms, and also directs them to an infant  botulism outbreak hotline  from the California Department of Public Health set up specifically to respond to this outbreak. What the company is doing  ByHeart says it is conducting its own \"extensive testing\" and giving the FDA \"complete and unrestricted access to all of our facilities and products for their investigation.\" The company has released  more resources  for customers in the days since the recall, like a 24/7 support hotline and refunds for purchases since October. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       It has  also pledged  to implement stronger safeguards and testing in the future, saying that Clostridium botulinum was \"not among the pathogens routinely tested for across the industry\" — until now. In the meantime, several affected family members have taken legal action. The parents of two four-month-olds who were hospitalized with infant botulism — in Arizona and Kentucky — filed  separate  federal  lawsuits  last week. They accused ByHeart of negligence and are seeking compensation for medical bills and emotional distress after both their daughters required hospitalization. A separate  class-action suit  filed in New York alleges deceptive marketing. ByHeart told NPR over email that it cannot comment on litigation, but reiterated its commitment to supporting families and the FDA's investigation. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/immigration-border-patrol-surveillance-drivers-ice-trump-9f5d05469ce8c629d6fecf32d32098cd","dateOfPublication":"2023-07-10","timeOfPublication":"20:30:00Z","title":"Understanding Cultural Contexts in Shaping Societal Values through Education and Intercultural Communication","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the significance of cultural context in analyzing social dynamics and emphasizes the pivotal role of education in shaping societal values.

The predictive intelligence program has resulted in people being stopped, searched and in some cases arrested. A network of cameras scans and records vehicle license plate information, and an algorithm flags vehicles deemed suspicious based on where they came from, where they were going and which route they took. Federal agents in turn may then flag local law enforcement. Suddenly, drivers find themselves pulled over — often for reasons cited such as speeding, failure to signal, the wrong window tint or even a dangling air freshener blocking the view. They are then aggressively questioned and searched, with no inkling that the roads they drove put them on law enforcement’s radar. Once limited to policing the nation’s boundaries, the Border Patrol has built a surveillance system stretching into the country’s interior that can monitor ordinary Americans’ daily actions and connections for anomalies instead of simply targeting wanted suspects. Started about a decade ago to fight illegal border-related activities and the trafficking of both drugs and people, it has expanded over the past five years. More coverage Migrants thought they were in court for a routine hearing. Instead, it was a deportation trap Multicultural New Orleans awaits arrival of ‘Swamp Sweep’ immigration crackdown Judge tosses DOJ lawsuit challenging a New York law barring immigration agents from state courts The Border Patrol has recently grown even more powerful through collaborations with other agencies, drawing information from license plate readers nationwide run by the Drug Enforcement Administration , private companies and, increasingly, local law enforcement programs funded through federal grants. Texas law enforcement agencies have asked Border Patrol to use facial recognition to identify drivers, documents show. Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel. Follow on This active role beyond the borders is part of the quiet transformation of its parent agency, U.S. Customs and Border Protection , into something more akin to a domestic intelligence operation. Under the Trump administration’s heightened immigration enforcement efforts, CBP is now poised to get more than $2.7 billion to build out border surveillance systems such as the license plate reader program by layering in artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies. The result is a mass surveillance network with a particularly American focus: cars. This investigation, the first to reveal details of how the program works on America’s roads, is based on interviews with eight former government officials with direct knowledge of the program who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak to the media, as well as dozens of federal, state and local officials, attorneys and privacy experts. The AP also reviewed thousands of pages of court and government documents, state grant and law enforcement data, and arrest reports. The Border Patrol has for years hidden details of its license plate reader program, trying to keep any mention of the program out of court documents and police reports, former officials say, even going so far as to propose dropping charges rather than risk revealing any details about the placement and use of their covert license plate readers. Readers are often disguised along highways in traffic safety equipment like drums and barrels. The Border Patrol has defined its own criteria for which drivers’ behavior should be deemed suspicious or tied to drug or human trafficking, stopping people for anything from driving on backcountry roads, being in a rental car or making short trips to the border region. The agency’s network of cameras now extends along the southern border in Texas, Arizona and California, and also monitors drivers traveling near the U.S.-Canada border. And it reaches far into the interior, impacting residents of big metropolitan areas and people driving to and from large cities such as Chicago and Detroit, as well as from Los Angeles, San Antonio, and Houston to and from the Mexican border region. In one example, AP found the agency has placed at least four cameras in the greater Phoenix area over the years, one of which was more than 120 miles (193 kilometers) from the Mexican frontier, beyond the agency’s usual jurisdiction of 100 miles (161 kilometers) from a land or sea border. The AP also identified several camera locations in metropolitan Detroit, as well as one placed near the Michigan-Indiana border to capture traffic headed towards Chicago or Gary, Indiana, or other nearby destinations.

While the U.S. Border Patrol primarily operates within 100 miles of the border, it is legally allowed “to operate anywhere in the United States,” the agency added. While collecting license plates from cars on public roads has generally been upheld by courts, some legal scholars see the growth of large digital surveillance networks such as Border Patrol’s as raising constitutional questions. Courts have started to recognize that “large-scale surveillance technology that’s capturing everyone and everywhere at every time” might be unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment, which protects people from unreasonable searches, said Andrew Ferguson, a law professor at George Washington University. Today, predictive surveillance is embedded into America’s roadways. Mass surveillance techniques are also used in a range of other countries, from authoritarian governments such as China to, increasingly, democracies in the U.K. and Europe in the name of national security and public safety. “They are collecting mass amounts of information about who people are, where they go, what they do, and who they know … engaging in dragnet surveillance of Americans on the streets, on the highways, in their cities, in their communities,” Nicole Ozer, the executive director of the Center for Constitutional Democracy at UC Law San Francisco, said in response to the AP’s findings. “These surveillance systems do not make communities safer.” ‘We did everything right and had nothing to hide’ A license plate reader stands along the side of a road, Wednesday, Oct. 15, 2025, in Stockdale, Texas.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More In February, Lorenzo Gutierrez Lugo, a driver for a small trucking company that specializes in transporting furniture, clothing and other belongings to families in Mexico, was driving south to the border city of Brownsville, Texas, carrying packages from immigrant communities in South Carolina’s low country. Gutierrez Lugo was pulled over by a local police officer in Kingsville, a small Texas city near Corpus Christi that lies about 100 miles from the Mexican border. The officer, Richard Beltran, cited the truck’s speed of 50 mph (80 kph) in a 45 mph (72 kph) zone as the reason for the stop. But speeding was a pretext: Border Patrol had requested the stop and said the black Dodge pickup with a white trailer could contain contraband, according to police and court records. U.S. Route 77 passes through Kingsville, a route that state and federal authorities scrutinize for trafficking of drugs, money and people. Gutierrez Lugo, who through a lawyer declined to comment, was interrogated about the route he drove, based on license plate reader data, per the police report and court records. He consented to a search of his car by Beltran and Border Patrol agents, who eventually arrived to assist. Image recognition analysis overlaid on drivers and vehicles on Texas roads. (AP video Marshall Ritzel) They unearthed no contraband. But Beltran arrested Gutierrez Lugo on suspicion of money laundering and engaging in organized criminal activity because he was carrying thousands of dollars in cash — money his supervisor said came directly from customers in local Latino communities, who are accustomed to paying in cash. No criminal charges were ultimately brought against Gutierrez Lugo and an effort by prosecutors to seize the cash, vehicle and trailer as contraband was eventually dropped. Luis Barrios owns the trucking company, Paquetería El Guero, that employed the driver. He told AP he hires people with work authorization in the United States and was taken aback by the treatment of his employee and his trailer. “We did everything right and had nothing to hide, and that was ultimately what they found,” said Barrios, who estimates he spent $20,000 in legal fees to clear his driver’s name and get the trailer out of impound. Border Patrol agents and local police have many names for these kinds of stops: “whisper,” “intel” or “wall” stops. Those stops are meant to conceal — or wall off — that the true reason for the stop is a tip from federal agents sitting miles away, watching data feeds showing who’s traveling on America’s roads and predicting who is “suspicious,” according to documents and people interviewed by the AP. In 2022, a man from Houston had his car searched from top to bottom by Texas sheriff’s deputies outside San Antonio after they got a similar tipoff from Border Patrol agents about the driver, Alek Schott.

They knew he stayed overnight in a hotel about 80 miles (129 kilometers) from the U.S.-Mexico border. They knew that in the morning Schott met a female colleague there before they drove together to a business meeting. At Border Patrol’s request, Schott was pulled over by Bexar County sheriff’s deputies. The deputies held Schott by the side of the road for more than an hour, searched his car and found nothing. “The beautiful thing about the Texas Traffic Code is there’s thousands of things you can stop a vehicle for,” said Joel Babb, the sheriff’s deputy who stopped Schott’s car, in a deposition in a lawsuit Schott filed alleging violations of his constitutional rights.

Babb deleted the WhatsApp chat off his phone but Schott’s lawyers were able to recover some of the text messages. Through a public records act request, the AP also obtained more than 70 pages of the Northwest Highway group chats from June and July of this year from a Texas county that had at least one sheriff’s deputy active in the chat. The AP was able to associate numerous phone numbers in both sets of documents with Border Patrol agents and Texas law enforcement officials. The chat logs show Border Patrol agents and Texas sheriffs deputies trading tips about vehicles’ travel patterns — based on suspicions about little more than someone taking a quick trip to the border region and back. The chats show how thoroughly Texas highways are surveilled by this federal-local partnership and how much detailed information is informally shared. In one exchange a law enforcement official included a photo of someone’s driver’s license and told the group the person, who they identified using an abbreviation for someone in the country illegally, was headed westbound. “Need BP?,” responded a group member whose number was labeled “bp Intel.” “Yes sir,” the official answered, and a Border Patrol agent was en route. Border Patrol agents and local law enforcement shared information about U.S. citizens’ social media profiles and home addresses with each other after stopping them on the road. Chats show Border Patrol was also able to determine whether vehicles were rentals and whether drivers worked for rideshare services.

He added: “I just know that they have a lot of toys over there on the federal side.” After finding nothing in Schott’s car, Babb said “nine times out of 10, this is what happens,” a phrase Schott’s lawyers claimed in court filings shows the sheriff’s department finds nothing suspicious in most of its searches. Babb did not respond to multiple requests for comment from AP. The Bexar County sheriff’s office declined to comment due to pending litigation and referred all questions about the Schott case to the county’s district attorney. The district attorney did not respond to a request for comment. The case is pending in federal court in Texas. Schott said in an interview with the AP: “I didn’t know it was illegal to drive in Texas.” ‘Patterns of life’ and license plates A license plate reader used by U.S. Border Patrol is hidden in a sand crash barrel along the state Highway 80, Thursday, Oct. 23, 2025, in Douglas, Ariz.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More Today, the deserts, forests and mountains of the nation’s land borders are dotted with checkpoints and increasingly, surveillance towers, Predator drones, thermal cameras and license plate readers, both covert and overt. Border Patrol’s parent agency got authorization to run a domestic license plate reader program in 2017, according to a Department of Homeland Security policy document. At the time, the agency said that it might use hidden license plate readers ”for a set period of time while CBP is conducting an investigation of an area of interest or smuggling route. Once the investigation is complete, or the illicit activity has stopped in that area, the covert cameras are removed,” the document states. But that’s not how the program has operated in practice, according to interviews, police reports and court documents. License plate readers have become a major — and in some places permanent — fixture of the border region. In a budget request to Congress in fiscal year 2024, CBP said that its Conveyance Monitoring and Predictive Recognition System, or CMPRS, “collects license plate images and matches the processed images against established hot lists to assist … in identifying travel patterns indicative of illegal border related activities.” Several new developer jobs have been posted seeking applicants to help modernize its license plate surveillance system in recent months. Numerous Border Patrol sectors now have special intelligence units that can analyze license plate reader data, and tie commercial license plate readers to its national network, according to documents and interviews.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More Border Patrol worked with other law enforcement agencies in Southern California about a decade ago to develop pattern recognition, said a former CBP official who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. Over time, the agency learned to develop what it calls “patterns of life” of vehicle movements by sifting through the license plate data and determining “abnormal” routes, evaluating if drivers were purposely avoiding official checkpoints. Some cameras can take photos of a vehicle’s plates as well as its driver’s face, the official said. Another former Border Patrol official compared it to a more technologically sophisticated version of what agents used to do in the field — develop hunches based on experience about which vehicles or routes smugglers might use, find a legal basis for the stop like speeding and pull drivers over for questioning. The cameras take pictures of vehicle license plates. Then, the photos are “read” by the system, which automatically detects and distills the images into numbers and letters, tied to a geographic location, former CBP officials said. The AP could not determine how precisely the system’s algorithm defines a quick turnaround or an odd route. Over time, the agency has amassed databases replete with images of license plates, and the system’s algorithm can flag an unusual “pattern of life” for human inspection.

In documents obtained by the AP, a Border Patrol official boasted about being able to see that a vehicle that had traveled to “Dallas, Little Rock, Arkansas and Atlanta” before ending up south of San Antonio. Documents show that Border Patrol or CBP has in the past had access to data from at least three private sector vendors: Rekor, Vigilant Solutions and Flock Safety. Through Flock alone, Border Patrol for a time had access to at least 1,600 license plate readers across 22 states, and some counties have reported looking up license plates on behalf of CBP even in states like California and Illinois that ban sharing data with federal immigration authorities, according to an AP analysis of police disclosures. A Flock spokesperson told AP the company “for now” had paused its pilot programs with CBP and a separate DHS agency, Homeland Security Investigations, and declined to discuss the type or volume of data shared with either federal agency, other than to say agencies could search for vehicles wanted in conjunction with a crime. No agencies currently list Border Patrol as receiving Flock data. Vigilant and Rekor did not respond to requests for comment. Also from AP’s investigation into the use of surveillance technology: U.S. tech firms to a large degree designed and built China’s surveillance state , playing a far greater role in enabling rights abuses than known before. Across five Republican and Democratic administrations, the U.S. government has repeatedly allowed and even actively helped American firms to sell technology to Chinese police . Where Border Patrol places its cameras is a closely guarded secret. However, through public records requests, the AP obtained dozens of permits the agency filed with Arizona and Michigan for permission to place cameras on state-owned land. The permits show the agency frequently disguises its cameras by concealing them in traffic equipment like the yellow and orange barrels that dot American roadways, or by labeling them as jobsite equipment. An AP photographer in October visited the locations identified in more than two dozen permit applications in Arizona, finding that most of the Border Patrol’s hidden equipment remains in place today. Spokespeople for the Arizona and Michigan departments of transportation said they approve permits based on whether they follow state and federal rules and are not privy to details on how license plate readers are used. Texas, California, and other border states did not provide documents in response to the AP’s public records requests. CBP’s attorneys and personnel instructed local cities and counties in both Arizona and Texas to withhold records from the AP that might have revealed details about the program’s operations, even though they were requested under state open records laws, according to emails and legal briefs filed with state governments. For example, CBP claimed records requested by the AP in Texas “would permit private citizens to anticipate weaknesses in a police department, avoid detection, jeopardize officer safety, and generally undermine police efforts.” Michigan redacted the exact locations of Border Patrol equipment, but the AP was able to determine general locations from the name of the county. One page of the group chats obtained by the AP shows that a participant enabled WhatsApp’s disappearing messages feature to ensure communications were deleted automatically.

CBP has quietly amassed access to far more information from ports of entry, airports and intelligence centers than other local, state and federal law enforcement agencies. And like a domestic spy agency, CBP has mostly hidden its role in the dissemination of intelligence on purely domestic travel through its use of whisper stops. Border Patrol has also extended the reach of its license plate surveillance program by paying for local law enforcement to run plate readers on their behalf.

Stonegarden grant funds also pay for local law enforcement overtime, which deputizes local officers to work on Border Patrol enforcement priorities. Under President Donald Trump, the Republican-led Congress this year allocated $450 million for Stonegarden to be handed out over the next four fiscal years. In the previous four fiscal years, the program gave out $342 million. In Cochise County, Arizona, Sheriff Mark Dannels said Stonegarden grants, which have been used to buy plate readers and pay for overtime, have let his deputies merge their mission with Border Patrol’s to prioritize border security. “If we’re sharing our authorities, we can put some consequences behind, or deterrence behind, ‘Don’t come here,’” he said. In 2021, the Ward County, Texas, sheriff sought grant funding from DHS to buy a “covert, mobile, License Plate Reader” to pipe data to Border Patrol’s Big Bend Sector Intelligence Unit. The sheriff’s department did not respond to a request for comment. Other documents AP obtained show that Border Patrol connects locally owned and operated license plate readers bought through Stonegarden grants to its computer systems, vastly increasing the federal agency’s surveillance network.

One former Border Patrol agent who worked on the license plate reader pattern detection program in California said the program had an 85% success rate of discovering contraband once he learned to identify patterns that looked suspicious. But another former official in a different Border Patrol sector said he was unaware of successful interdictions based solely on license plate patterns. In Trump’s second term, Border Patrol has extended its reach and power as border crossings have slowed to historic lows and freed up agents for operations in the heartland. Border Patrol Sector Chief Gregory Bovino , for example, was tapped to direct hundreds of agents from multiple DHS agencies in the administration’s immigration sweeps across Los Angeles, more than 150 miles (241 kilometers) from his office in El Centro, California. Bovino later was elevated to lead the aggressive immigration crackdown in Chicago. Numerous Border Patrol officials have also been tapped to replace ICE leadership.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More The result has been more encounters between the agency and the general public than ever before. “We took Alek’s case because it was a clear-cut example of an unconstitutional traffic stop,” said Christie Hebert, who works at the nonprofit public interest law firm Institute for Justice and represents Schott. ”What we found was something much larger — a system of mass surveillance that threatens people’s freedom of movement.” AP found numerous other examples similar to what Schott and the delivery driver experienced in reviewing court records in border communities and along known smuggling routes in Texas and California. Several police reports and court records the AP examined cite “suspicious” travel patterns or vague tipoffs from the Border Patrol or other unnamed law enforcement agencies. In another federal court document filed in California, a Border Patrol agent acknowledged “conducting targeted analysis on vehicles exhibiting suspicious travel patterns” as the reason he singled out a Nissan Altima traveling near San Diego. In cases reviewed by the AP, local law enforcement sometimes tried to conceal the role the Border Patrol plays in passing along intelligence. Babb, the deputy who stopped Schott, testified he typically uses the phrase “subsequent to prior knowledge” when describing whisper stops in his police reports to acknowledge that the tip came from another law enforcement agency without revealing too much in written documents he writes memorializing motorist encounters. Once they pull over a vehicle deemed suspicious, officers often aggressively question drivers about their travels, their belongings, their jobs, how they know the passengers in the car, and much more, police records and bodyworn camera footage obtained by the AP show. One Texas officer demanded details from a man about where he met his current sexual partner. Often drivers, such as the one working for the South Carolina moving company, were arrested on suspicion of money laundering merely for carrying a few thousand dollars worth of cash, with no apparent connection to illegal activity. Prosecutors filed lawsuits to try to seize money or vehicles on the suspicion they were linked to trafficking.

Our national nightmare — the year-long wait between Jon M. Chu's   Wicked: Part I   and  Wicked: For Good  — has finally come to an end.  When we last left  Chu's splashy, long-awaited adaptation of the Broadway musical juggernaut, green emo outcast Elphaba, soon to be known as the Wicked Witch of the West (Cynthia Erivo), had been radicalized by the discovery that the revered Wizard of Oz (Jeff Goldblum) is a magicless fraud and oppressor of animals; she thus committed to  defying gravity  and becoming a broomstick-riding outlaw. Her polar-opposite enemy-turned-bestie Glinda (Ariana Grande) declined to take up the cause but wished Elphaba well. Songs were belted, hearts were broken, blonde hair was tossed, and since then, the real world we're all existing in only grew more chaotic and distressingly parallel to that of the one depicted in Oz. Wicked: For Good  is based on the show's second act, and ever since it was announced that the two hour and 45-minute production (including intermission) would be sprawled across two separate films totaling an approximate five-hour runtime, people like me have wondered,  What's the (non-capitalistic) point of that?  Having now seen  For Good , I can attest there isn't a point, or at least not a wholly convincing one. This installment is far from a total misfire — thank goodness Erivo and Grande are such captivating performers perfectly-suited to these roles — but the over-padding and stuffing meant to justify this bifurcated packaging soon becomes readily apparent. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       First, however, it starts off with a bang: The exciting opening sequence touches down upon the vast open landscape outside the metropolis of Oz, as the Wizard's human lackeys are forcing animals to do the brutal labor of building his precious yellow brick road; suddenly, Elphaba appears out of the sky like a superhero and wields her mighty powers to disrupt the abuse and send a message. The Wizard's press secretary Madame Morrible (Michelle Yeoh, tasked again with trying to sing, to limited results) has pulled out all the stops to spread hateful propaganda about Elphaba to the people of Oz, and the people are buying it wholesale. A willfully ignorant Glinda is now the bubbly spokesperson for the Wizard's regime, keeping the lie about his wizarding credentials alive. And the formerly apathetic Fiyero ( Sexiest Man Alive  Jonathan Bailey) is now a reluctant guardsman arranged to marry Glinda, even though his heart and political sympathies remain with Elphaba. A lot happens over the next two-plus hours, including the story coinciding with the arrival of that girl from Kansas (glimpsed a few times here, but as far as I can remember, not heard), and it's entertaining enough. The highest notes carry over from  Part 1 , as Erivo and Grande are electric every time they share screentime — their big comical fight, which takes place immediately after a devastating cyclone of events, elicited rapturous engagement from the audience at my screening. And their duet \"For Good\" remains the Act II apex, a stirring meeting of the minds and declaration of friendship, even if lyricist Stephen Schwartz's prose leans toward clunk. (Two decades later, I'm still scratching my head at \" Like a seed dropped by a skybird  /  In a distant wood .\" Huh???) If  For Good  doesn't soar quite as consistently as  Part 1 , this is at least partially by design. A song from the original show like the Wizard's vaudevillian ditty \"Wonderful\" — a more sinister retread of Glinda's far superior ode to the benefits of self-mythologizing, \"Popular\" — can't come close to matching Act I's abundance of bangers. (And unfortunately, the two new songs added here, Elphaba's \"No Place Like Home\" and Glinda's \"The Girl in the Bubble,\" add little beyond runtime.) Act II is also where the show's politics become indecipherable, or — to put it less generously — noncommittal. The story aims to challenge perceptions of what makes someone \"good\" or \"bad,\" but unlike its source material, Gregory Maguire's revisionist novel  Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West , the new movie sands down those provocations to make certain characters more sympathetic than they are. But within the landscape of movie musicals, especially more recent examples, both  Wicked  movies serve as a triumph and tribute to creative fortitude. We've all laughed (and cringed) a lot about Erivo and Grande's peculiar antics throughout this never-ending publicity cycle, but there's something heartwarming about their deep commitment to the spirit of the material.

You can listen to  all three episodes here  or wherever you listen to podcasts. About a year ago, my dad bet me $10,000 that he could foretell the future. It all started when he texted me a picture of a list. Writing in barely legible cursive, he had scribbled 10 politically apocalyptic predictions. My dad was foreshadowing verdicts of treason for Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi, Joe Biden and the Clintons, who would go down for murder as well. Biden would ultimately be removed from office, and so would the governor of New York and the mayor of New York City. It went on. Donald Trump, who was seeking reelection, would have all charges leveled against him at the time dropped, all while being reinstated as president without the need for November's election. He also thought that the U.S. would come under nationwide martial law. For all his catastrophizing, I wouldn't describe my father as a paranoid person — I tend to think of him as an optimist. He's very friendly, the kind of father who cracks a lot of dad jokes with strangers. But like so many Americans, Dad had gotten swept up in conspiracy theories. Chemtrails, Biden body doubles, the idea that a shadowy cabal he calls \"the globalists\" is secretly running the world — these are just a few secret plots my father believes in. The list, however, was something new. My father was now predicting the biggest shake-up in the country's history, and he was absolutely certain that it would happen within a year. At the bottom of the page was a challenge: $1,000 for each of the 10 predictions that were supposed to happen sometime in 2024. My father is not a betting man; nor is he rich. This was easily more money than either of us had ever wagered. Shortly after seeing the list, I called him to discuss the terms. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"When all these things happen,\" he told me, \"you will realize I'm not as big a crackpot as you think I am. These are not conspiracy theories — these are reality.\" The bet seemed over-the-top, but I was intrigued by the opportunity it presented. My dad and I have never been particularly close. Unless we are discussing our favorite college football team, the Ohio State Buckeyes, we disagree on just about everything. Our family dinners had been dissolving into heated arguments for some time. Instead of quarreling until the end of time, we were actually going to settle the single biggest source of tension between us: our diametrically opposed senses of reality. Either he was right or I was. Jan. 1, 2025, would be our deadline. I accepted. A year seemed like the right amount of time to bring him back from the rabbit hole, before his beliefs tore our family apart. A house divided  When I was growing up in the Bay Area, Dad was often the lone Christian conservative, not just within our family but in our broader social circle as well. My mother is a fairly liberal Jewish woman; my sister, Kira, and I tend to be on the same page as she. For years, my dad's views were easy to overlook. He usually kept pretty quiet, but I always knew that he was skeptical of vaccines and that he hated the Clintons. Dad grew up in a deeply Christian household, but at some point in his younger years he rebelled. And when my parents met in the 1980s, neither of them was interested in religion. Sometime after I was born, that began to change. As the years passed, his faith deepened. Back in 2019, my dad, who has never been particularly tech savvy, got an iPad. Kira and I had left home by then. I had gone on to work in media in New York City, and whenever I went back home to visit, I could see that Dad was becoming increasingly interested in  self-proclaimed Christian prophets . I've seen some of the videos he watches on a regular basis. They're full of dark premonitions that echo the predictions in our bet. Once the COVID-19 pandemic hit, he started bristling at mask-wearing, and he refused to get vaccinated. Eventually, he came to believe the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Trump, whom he didn't even vote for in 2016. Two years ago, my sister came out to our dad. My mom and I had known for years, but Kira was always afraid to tell him, because she thought he'd disapprove. It didn't go well. He said he'd always love her, that she'd forever be welcomed in the house, but he thought that being gay was a choice, one he doesn't agree with. \"He told me that I was wrong about myself,\" Kira said when I called her to talk about the state of our family. \"And I don't understand how he could know that.\" These past two years have not been easy for the family, especially for Kira. It's unclear how we can move forward when my sister doesn't feel supported. And then there's all the conspiracy stuff, which has been increasingly hard on my mom. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"I have been very clear that I'm not sure how much more I can take,\" she told me last year, when she and I started having candid conversations about life with Dad. She's 69, on the cusp of retiring, and my dad's behavior was pushing her to reconsider their 40-year marriage. \"This is not the life I had planned for myself.\" Over the summer, Dad began stockpiling survivalist supplies. Their house suddenly filled up with multiple generators, flats of water and cans of food they'd never eaten before. He even moved some money from their joint account to buy precious metal without telling her. When Dad initially proposed the bet, Mom was a little irritated that she wasn't consulted first. After all, the money I'd win for each prediction that proved wrong would come from their shared finances. But now she was warming up to the idea of having a deadline. \"I want a date. And then when that date happens, the precious metals get returned to cash, the flats of water go back to Costco. You do something else with the two generators. And you move on.\" This experiment was starting to feel like more than just a friendly wager. I was starting to worry that by accepting it, I had put the entire family on a collision course. Independent research After receiving my dad's list with 10 predictions, I began thinking about an argument he and I had several years ago. It must have been about politics. I was visiting my parents, and we'd gone out to eat at one of our favorite restaurants. Even though I can't recall the specifics, I've never forgotten how it ended. \"You don't really know me,\" my father told me, getting the last word. I'm 38, and my father has been part of my life since I was born. Despite this shared history, I remember thinking that maybe he was right. Now, as our yearlong bet was playing out, I realized I had a lot to learn about the person I was trying to change. I started with his friends. In my efforts to learn more about my father, I reached out to people he had known for decades. They mostly wondered where Dad was getting his information. Even friends who share in some of Dad's conspiracies thought he was going too far. \"He's watching too many of  The X-Files ,\" one of them told me. Dad's friends clearly thought he was going the wrong way. He seemed to be on his own with his beliefs. I had seen this sort of thing play out before in the family — I was struck by the parallels with the story of his own father. My grandfather was a chiropractor. Like Dad, he was also opposed to vaccines. He believed in what he called the body's natural immunities — so much so that my father was held out of school in the 1960s due to a new vaccine mandate at the time. \"He was stubborn, very opinionated, hardheaded at times,\" my dad said when I asked him to describe what my granddad was like. \"He was very embittered against the medical society, because they literally ran him out of business.\" Back in 1969, the Ohio State Medical Board filed charges against my grandfather for practicing without a license. He even spent a couple of days in jail.   My dad says he was never able to fully recover after his business dissolved. My first memories of my granddad are of a tall, thin man. One day, when he came to visit us, his body had completely changed. He had gained over a hundred pounds in a short amount of time and was going through mental health issues that the family never fully understood. It's hard to know, because he wouldn't see a doctor, but he started falling asleep at odd times. He'd be in the middle of a conversation or at dinner, and he'd start snoring. Minutes later, he'd wake up and carry on. This also happened while he was driving. My granddad got into a number of car accidents; he totaled several cars and nearly killed my grandmother, but he refused to admit that anything was wrong. My father tried to talk to him several times. When that didn't work, he tried something else. \"I wrote him a long letter. And I said, 'Dad, I love you. I'm not trying to say anything damaging about you, but your whole family is concerned. Can't you recognize that we would all like to see you live to a ripe old age?'\" When I was 10 years old, my parents called my sister and me into the kitchen. Their grave faces told me all I needed to know. My grandfather was dead. Earlier that day, his vehicle had veered off the road and crashed. Our best guess is that he fell asleep behind the wheel. When I think about my grandfather, I think about the way his death may have been caused by stubbornness, a refusal to listen to those around him. I was starting to see a direct correlation with Dad's stubbornness, his deep distrust in institutions and the attitude that no matter what, he knows best. As we reached the fall, I reached out to experts. I had to know why he seemed willing to give up so much, including his own family, for his beliefs. So I called up researchers who study conspiracy theories and the people who believe them, and I documented my journey in a  series I did for NPR's  Embedded . One piece of advice I kept getting was to try to see things from his perspective. Among our family and friends in the Bay Area, my dad has always been an outsider. We'd been rejecting his beliefs for years, but as time went on, they'd become more extreme. I was starting to realize that, from his vantage point, we were the intolerant ones, the ones who don't understand. When I asked my dad whether he feels like the odd man out, he answered somberly, \"It's painful at times. It's very sad for me.\" So what happens when your family and your friends don't respect your beliefs? Perhaps you reach for a higher purpose — something existential. This came up in a conversation with Charlie Safford, a researcher who designs therapeutic techniques for people who believe in far-right conspiracy theories. He believes that conspiracy theories are fundamentally emotional coping mechanisms. \"Even if your father doesn't put the pieces together, there is some awakening of his own mortality that might be contributing to all of this,\" he told me. \"One of the ways that you come to terms is to look back and say, 'Did my life have meaning?'\" Safford asked me how old my grandfather was when he died. I wasn't sure, so I asked my father. He told me that he was 68, the same age my father was when he challenged me to the bet. I had never considered this angle before, but Dad has. \"Yep, I've thought about that a million times. Now I'm the age he was when he died.\" I sat back down with my father after digging deep into our family history. Winter was approaching, and the bet wouldn't come due for another two months, but I had to know what he thought about his own views. Was he aware of how radical they'd gotten? \"It's not that they've gotten more extreme,\" he told me. \"I've become more in tune with who I really am.\" I reminded him of that argument we had in the restaurant years ago, when he insisted I hardly knew him. I asked him whether he felt like I knew him a little better. \"Oh, absolutely,\" he replied. \"These conversations, talking about my dad and all the rest. … Yeah, you know me.\" I felt the same way. Our Jan. 1 deadline was fast approaching. Now that we were closer, I allowed myself to hope for the best. Maybe I would be able to change his mind after all. Time to settle up When the day finally arrived, Dad and I sat down across from each other, at the same table where we shared countless family dinners growing up. He pulled out his handwritten list; I had my laptop open to a document full of questions and fact checks. I ran through all 10 items on the list, ready to push back against any hint that his predictions had somehow come true. There was no need for it. Dad kept saying that, yes, he had hoped that they would take place before the end of 2024, but he knew that none had come to pass. \"I'm very happy that it didn't happen,\" he told me as we reached the final prediction, the one about martial law being imposed all over the country. \"In terms of convincing you, I struck out big time.\" I wish I could say that Dad changed his mind and the family was finally able to heal. For a brief instant, that seemed to be the ending that was playing out between us. It didn't last. \"However,\" Dad pushed on, \"I guarantee that all 10 of these have legs. You will see by the end of 2025.\" The bet was over, but we still needed to assess the damage. Because at that point, our family had already hit an all-time low. Days before, as I was getting ready to fly home for the holidays, I arranged a call with my mom and sister. I wanted to see whether they had any requests for my father, like seeing a therapist or attending a church with more inclusive views on sexuality. Given our newfound closeness, I had the feeling that Dad would be open to hearing me out. Minutes before our call, my sister sent a text. \"I feel the conversation and the interview would cause me more harm and pain at this point,\" she wrote. \"Please continue today without me.\" Kira was out. She wasn't interested in teaching Dad how to accept her without conditions. Turns out, my mom had reached the same conclusion. She called me later that same day to let me know about her decision. \"I don't see a path where this marriage can continue. I don't see a path for me,\" she said. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       At that point, their 40-year marriage was hanging by a thread. Back in November, my father echoed false claims about Jan. 6 rioters being paid actors. My mom asked him to move out of their room on the day after Trump's victory in the presidential election. They were now agreeing to take the next step. Their marriage was officially ending. By the time I sat down to settle the bet, it was down to just Dad and me. I knew it was finally time to press him. \"I just see an unwillingness for you to be wrong,\" I told him.  \"I'm going to admit I was wrong about the timeline on all 10 things,\" he assured me.  \"See how you prefaced it?\" I said. \"You're just saying that you're wrong about the timeline.\"  \"Why am I going to abandon the truth?\" he insisted. \"I can't abandon the truth.\"  As I watched him double down, I kept thinking of all the unvetted information he'd continue to take in, the survivalist gear and precious metals he'd buy, the people he'd surround himself with in the absence of our family. As the conversation wound down, I finally let go of any notion that I could convince him of anything he didn't already believe. I don't know what comes next. Things fell apart so quickly, but also slowly; as the years passed, cracks started opening up, eventually turning into a chasm. In the end, we didn't make it. When I asked my dad where he thought we would be as a family when the next Christmas rolled around, the confidence in his ability to predict the future came crashing down. \"I have no idea,\" he told me, releasing a heavy sigh. \"I can't even think that far ahead.\" In many ways, I'm the one who got off the easiest. I'm still in good standing with everyone, which makes me feel a mixture of relief and guilt, maybe a splash of gratitude. And for those of you wondering, yes, I took the money. Absolutely. But on New Year's Day, when my dad officially lost the bet, I took him to the Rose Bowl, to see our beloved Ohio State football team in the national championship game. After the year we just had, it felt good to treat Dad with his own money. The Buckeyes won, and as we cheered their victory, I felt a deep sense of connection. The day was a reminder of how good things could be between us and, at the same time, of everything we couldn't be anymore. As I watched the clock run down, I knew the game would be over soon, and so would be that brief moment in which we got to share the same reality.

looming 'demographic cliff': Fewer college students and ultimately fewer graduates \n         By Jon Marcus \n        \n           Wednesday, January 8, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n        \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Pickup trucks with trailers and cars with yawning trunks pulled up onto untended lawns in front of buildings from which people lugged books, furniture, mattresses, trophy cases and artwork. Anything else of value had already been sold by a company that specializes in auctioning off the leftover assets of failed businesses. At least one of the buildings was soon to be demolished altogether, its red-brick walls dumped into its 1921 foundation. This was the unceremonious end of Iowa Wesleyan University, a 181-year-old institution that closed in 2023 after financial losses due in part to discounts it gave out as it struggled to attract a shrinking pool of students. When a college closes, \"all the things that are mementos of the best four years of a lot of people's lives are sold to the highest bidders,\" says Doug Moore, founding partner of a firm that has helped handle the logistics of shutting down four colleges in the last few years, including Iowa Wesleyan. The outlook, Moore and other experts say, is that there will likely be many more such scenes in the years ahead. That's because the current class of high school seniors scheduled to graduate this spring will be the last before an expected long decline begins in the number of 18-year-olds — the traditional age of students when they enter college. A \"demographic cliff\" with big implications for the economy This \"demographic cliff\" has been predicted ever since Americans started having fewer babies at the advent of the Great Recession around the end of 2007 — a falling birth rate that  has not recovered since , except for a slight blip after the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Demographers say it will finally arrive nationwide in the fall of this year. That's when recruiting offices will begin to confront the long-anticipated drop-off in the number of applicants from among the next class of high school seniors. But the downturn isn't just a problem for universities and colleges. It's a looming crisis for the economy, with fewer graduates eventually coming through the pipeline to fill jobs that require college educations, even as international rivals increase the proportions of their populations with degrees. \"The impact of this is economic decline,\" Jeff Strohl, director of the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce, says bluntly. As fresh data emerges, the outlook is getting only worse. An analysis by the higher education consulting firm Ruffalo Noel Levitz, using the latest available census figures, now projects  another drop  in the number of 18-year-olds beginning in 2033, after a brief uptick. By 2039, this estimate shows, there will likely be 650,000, or 15%, fewer of them per year than there are now. These findings sync up with another new report, released in December by the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education (WICHE), which says that the number of 18-year-olds nationwide who graduate from high school each year — and are therefore candidates for college —  will erode by 13% , or nearly half a million, by 2041. \"A few hundred thousand per year might not sound like a lot,\" Strohl says. \"But multiply that by a decade, and it has a big impact.\" Fewer students means fewer colleges This comes after colleges and universities already collectively experienced a 15% decline in enrollment between 2010 and 2021, the most recent year for which figures are available, according to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). That includes a drop-off of more than 350,000 during the first year of the pandemic alone, and it means there are already  2.7 million  fewer students than there were at the start of the last decade. In the first half of last year, more than one college a week announced that it would close. Still more new research, from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, projects that the pace of college closings  could now accelerate . The news is not all bad. For students, it means a buyer's market. Colleges and universities, on average, are  admitting a larger proportion of their applicants  than they did 20 years ago, new research by the think tank the American Enterprise Institute finds. And tuition, when adjusted for inflation,  is declining , according to College Board. (Housing and dining charges  continue to increase .) Ripple effects through the economy The likely closing of more colleges is by itself a threat to the economy. Nearly 4 million people work in higher education, the NCES reports. Though the most imperiled colleges tend to be small, every one that closes translates to, on average, a  loss of 265 jobs and $67 million a year in economic impact , according to the economic software and analysis company Implan. While the falloff in the number of 18-year-olds has been largely discussed in terms of its effects on colleges and students, the implications are much broader, however. \"In an economy that depends on skilled labor, we're falling short,\" says Catharine Bond Hill, an economist, a former president of Vassar College and the managing director of the higher education consulting firm Ithaka S+R. She points out that, based on NCES data, the United States has fallen to ninth among developed nations in the  proportion of its 25-to-64-year-old population with any postsecondary degree . \"We should be aiming for No. 1, and we're not,\" she says. The diminishing supply of young people will contribute to \"a massive labor shortage,\" with an  estimated 6 million fewer workers  in 2032 than jobs needing to be filled, according to the labor market analytics firm Lightcast. Not all of those jobs will call for a college education. But many will. Forty-three percent of them will  require at least a bachelor's degree  by 2031, according to the Georgetown center. That means more jobs will demand some kind of postsecondary credentials than Americans are now projected to earn. Still-unpublished research underway at Georgetown forecasts major shortages in teaching, health care and other fields, as well as some level of skills shortfalls in 151 occupations, Strohl says. \"If we don't keep our edge in innovation and college-level education,\" he says, \"we'll have a decline in the economy and ultimately a decline in the living standard.\" A scarcity of labor is already complicating efforts to  expand the U.S. semiconductor industry , for instance, the consulting firm McKinsey & Company warns. It's a major reason that production at a new $40 billion semiconductor processing facility in Arizona has  been delayed , according to its parent company. A worker shortage of the magnitude projected for the coming one hasn't happened since the years immediately after World War II, when the number of young men was reduced by death and disability, Strohl and others say. And this worker shortage coincides with a wave of retirements among experienced and well-educated baby boomers. A host of complex demographic factors \"It's kind of a remarkable moment in our history,\" says Luke Jankovic, an executive vice president and general manager at Lightcast. \"We have a lot of people moving from economic producers to economic consumers, and there just aren't enough people coming up behind them to replace them.\" The falling number of 18-year-olds is compounded by other issues, including a sharp drop in the proportion of Americans in the labor market — particularly baby boomers who retired early and men derailed by substance abuse or incarceration. The proportion of men 20 and older in the workforce has declined from around 76% at the start of the Great Recession to  around 70% today , the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports. The decline in high school graduates through 2041 is projected to be most severe in the Northeast, Midwest and West, where fertility rates have been generally lower than in other regions, and to which fewer families have moved. In all,  38 states will see declines , WICHE estimates, some of them much steeper than the national average: 32% in Illinois, 29% in California, 27% in New York, 20% in Michigan, 17% in Pennsylvania. In places where the number of high school graduates remains stable or increases, meanwhile, it will be largely because of one group: Hispanic students. The proportion of high school graduates who are Hispanic, nationwide, is expected to rise from 26% to 36% by 2041. But Hispanic college-going is below the national average and  has been going down , U.S. Department of Education statistics show. All of these things present \"a combination of factors that we haven't seen before,\" says Emily Wadhwani, a senior director at credit-rating agency Fitch who works on higher education. Concerns about the value of a college education Falling enrollment, meanwhile, has been made worse by a decline in perception of the value of a college or university degree.  One in four Americans  now says having a bachelor's degree is extremely or very important to get a good job, the Pew Research Center finds. Among high school graduates, the proportion going straight to college has fallen, from a  peak of 70% in 2016 to 62% in 2022 , the most recent year for which the figure is available. The only thing that will restore stability in the higher education sector, says Wadhwani, \"is a renewed sentiment that it's worth it.\" Demarée Michelau, the president of WICHE, calls these trends, \"the most perplexing set of issues to face higher education planners and administrators in a generation.\" There are other customers for colleges, of course, including international students, students who are older than 18 and graduate students. But these other sources may not be enough to make up for the coming declines, experts say. Now that Donald Trump is about to start a second presidential term, 58% of European students say they are  less interested in coming to the United States , according to a survey conducted in October and November by the international student recruiter Keystone Education Group. And despite colleges' attempts to recruit students over 25, their numbers have  fallen by half  since the Great Recession, the Philadelphia Fed calculates. Many older students say they are discouraged by the cost or have families and jobs, which colleges don't always accommodate, or they started college but dropped out and  have little inclination to go back . On the campus of Iowa Wesleyan, the old gym was stripped of its wood flooring and whatever else had value and was then ripped down. The cornerstone fell into the pile of rubble. It bore the date of the college's founding: 1842. \"In so many of these towns, their identity is inextricably linked to the college that's been there forever,\" says Doug Moore, the man who oversaw the liquidation. \"It's a huge source of local pride. It's also a big source of good-paying jobs that are not replaceable.\" The process of shutting it down, he adds, \"is brutal and painful.\" And yet he knows that in the coming years, more colleges and universities will likely go under the auctioneer's gavel and the wrecking ball: \"You have a staggering number of variables\" facing colleges and universities. \"It's supply and demand. You've got to evolve and adjust, or die.\" This story was produced by  The Hechinger Report , a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-jeffrey-epstein-justice-department-4872c23a3ed03bf3d4c526581d3aed59","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"01:26:41+00:00","title":"Trump Signs Legislation Requiring Release of Jeffrey Epstein Files","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump signed legislation that mandates the Justice Department to release all files and communications related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein within 30 days, reversing his earlier resistance under pressure from congressional action and internal party dynamics.

Trump could have chosen to release many of the files on his own months ago. “Democrats have used the ‘Epstein’ issue, which affects them far more than the Republican Party, in order to try and distract from our AMAZING Victories,” Trump said in a social media post as he announced he had signed the bill. Now, the bill requires the Justice Department to release all files and communications related to Epstein, as well as any information about the investigation into his death in a federal prison in 2019, within 30 days. It allows for redactions about Epstein’s victims for ongoing federal investigations, but DOJ cannot withhold information due to “embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity.” It was a remarkable turn of events for what was once a farfetched effort to force the disclosure of case files from an odd congressional coalition of Democrats, one GOP antagonist of the president, and a handful of erstwhile Trump loyalists. As recently as last week, the Trump administration even summoned one Republican proponent of releasing the files, Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado, to the Situation Room to discuss the matter, although she did not change her mind. Related Stories Trump steps up attacks on ABC and Jimmy Kimmel, says network should ‘get the bum off the air’ 2 MIN READ What to know about the Justice Department’s Jeffrey Epstein files 5 MIN READ Trump says Democrats’ message to military is ‘seditious behavior’ punishable by death 5 MIN READ But over the weekend, Trump did a sharp U-turn on the files once it became clear that congressional action was inevitable. He insisted the Epstein matter had become a distraction to the GOP agenda and indicated he wanted to move on. “I just don’t want Republicans to take their eyes off all of the Victories that we’ve had,” Trump said in a social media post Tuesday afternoon, explaining the rationale for his abrupt about-face. The House passed the legislation on a 427-1 vote, with Rep. Clay Higgins, R-La., being the sole dissenter . He argued that the bill’s language could lead to the release of information on innocent people mentioned in the federal investigation. The Senate later approved it unanimously, skipping a formal vote. It’s long been established that Trump had been friends with Epstein, the disgraced financier who was close to the world’s elite. But the president has consistently said he did not know of Epstein’s crimes and had cut ties with him long ago. Before Trump returned to the White House for a second term, some of his closest political allies helped fuel conspiracy theories about the government’s handling of the Epstein case, asserting a cover-up of potentially incriminating information in those files."},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-98562","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"13:22:00-05:00","title":"Rosalía and sombr crack the top 10 on the charts for the first time","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"This week, Rosalía and sombr achieve historic milestones by debuting in the Billboard Hot 100’s top 10 for the first time in 2025, with Rosalía’s album *Lux* peaking at No. 4.

Stephen Thompson \n        \n           Thursday, November 20, 2025 • 1:22 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Taylor Swift  has the top album and song in the country yet again, as  The Life of a Showgirl  and \"The Fate of Ophelia\" hold down the No. 1 spots for a sixth consecutive week. But even as  sombr  and  Rosalía  hit new career highs, there's a major churn taking place just below the top 10, as  Mariah Carey ,  Wham!  and their cheerful ilk gear up for yet another jingling assault on the charts. TOP STORY Last week, the  Billboard  charts  absorbed the full force of spooky season , as a weekend of Halloween parties produced a Hot 100 full of scary-ish songs and a return to the top 10 for  Michael Jackson 's \"Thriller.\" At the same time, a  different  holiday began its annual attack on the chart, as two Christmas classics — Mariah Carey's \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" and Wham!'s \"Last Christmas\" — made an auspiciously early return. A week later, \"Thriller\" and their ilk have been sent back to molder in their crypts once more, while Christmas streamers who couldn't wait for Thanksgiving (you know who you are) have gone ham — and not in the seasonally appropriate, honey-glazed way — on the Hot 100. We should consider it a small win that none of them crash the top 10, but with \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" at No. 11 and \"Last Christmas\" at No. 13, we're merely delaying the inevitable here. \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" came  this close  to thwarting a major career milestone: As \"Back to Friends\" ticks up a spot to No. 10, sombr has become just the 10th artist to hit the Hot 100's top 10 for the first time in 2025. Another would-be first-timer came close this week, as country star Cody Johnson debuts on this week's chart at No. 12 with his cover of \"Travelin' Soldier.\" The track, written by  Bruce Robison  and popularized by the act known at the time as  The Dixie Chicks , has become a signature song for Johnson;  his 2022 performance of \"Travelin' Soldier\"  has accumulated 59 million views on YouTube, and now it's got a studio version to match. But if he's going to hit the top 10 for the first time in his career — this is his eighth time hitting the Hot 100 — he's probably gonna have to wait until January. TOP ALBUMS The Hot 100 isn't the only major  Billboard  chart to welcome a first-timer to its top 10: Spanish polymath Rosalía, whose 2022 album  Motomami  peaked at No. 33, blows away that career high as  Lux  debuts at No. 4. For an album that expands her sound well beyond chart-friendly genres — she recorded it with the London Symphony Orchestra —  Lux  wasn't necessarily an easy sell as a pop hit. Future weeks will tell the full story, of course, as an initial sales burst gives way to word of mouth and what will likely be a tsunami of placements on \"Best Albums of 2025\" lists. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The other top 10 debut is also a first-timer, but with an asterisk: Yeonjun, a member of the K-pop boy band  Tomorrow X Together , lands at No. 10 with his first solo effort,  No Labels: Part 01 . Tomorrow X Together is a frequent visitor to the top 10, but Yeonjun now has a hit of his own. There's one other serious chart breakthrough worth noting this week: After months of teasing and leaked tracks — and after entering the  Billboard  200 albums chart at No. 173 last week —  Paramore 's  Hayley Williams  makes a huge jump with her new solo record,  Ego Death at a Bachelorette Party . Buoyed by an official release and the addition of two new tracks, the album zips all the way to No. 12. TOP SONGS \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" and \"Last Christmas\" are just two of the nine holiday songs in this week's top 50, and the order in which they appear is instructive. Because, while it might seem as if the exact same holiday songs appear on each year's charts in roughly the exact same order, it's possible to plot out incremental shifts in audience preferences, year over year. For example, there was a moment when  Brenda Lee 's \"Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree\" seemed to be overtaking \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" — roughly around the time the still-living Lee released a video in 2023 for her 1958 hit. But in the time since, \"Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree\" has ceded its chart dominance to Mariah Carey  and  Wham!. This week, Lee re-enters the Hot 100 at No. 19, so that pecking order looks to persist in 2025. Bobby Helms' 1957 staple \"Jingle Bell Rock\" follows at No. 20, re-entering alongside its sibling in the microgenre of \"holiday songs that evoke rock and roll without actually rocking.\" Next up are the two most recently minted holiday standards, both of which have climbed steadily in recent years:  Ariana Grande 's 2014 hit \"Santa Tell Me\" at No. 30 and, from 2013,  Kelly Clarkson 's \"Underneath the Tree\" at No. 41. Their strength, relative to other holiday hits, appears to be growing. Then, rounding out this week's holiday selections — remember that old, previously charting songs can only re-enter the Hot 100 if they're in the top 50 — are two gelatinous slabs of moldy fruitcake ( Andy Williams ' \"It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year\" at No. 47 and  Michael Bublé 's \"It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas\" at No. 48) and one gleaming gem ( Nat \"King\" Cole 's \"The Christmas Song\" at No. 50). Bublé's strength and momentum, year over year, is especially notable and alarming: The Canadian singer has yet to hit the Hot 100's top 10 in his career, but he looks extremely well-positioned to do so this time around. (He's also got this week's highest-charting holiday album:  Christmas , at No. 25.) And, because the charts are kind of inherently a zero-sum game, there's a whiff of bad news for the Ives Hive. Burl Ives has been a staple of the top 5 — as recently as December 2024 — with his 1964 recording of \"A Holly Jolly Christmas.\" But, at least so far, it's absent from this year's initial chart flurries. The Ives Dive can only be blamed on one Scroogey scourge: Michael freaking Bublé, whose own take on the song debuted at No. 37 at the very beginning of this year. If Bublé becomes the new literal standard-bearer where \"A Holly Jolly Christmas\" is concerned, then that's bad news for 1) the estate of Burl Ives; and 2) everyone with taste. Justice for Burl! \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5612793","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"17:43:00-05:00","title":"Trump's National Guard deployments face mounting legal pushback","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Trump has faced mounting legal challenges in his efforts to deploy National Guard troops to U.S. cities such as Portland, Oregon, Washington, D.C., Chicago, and Memphis.

National Guard deployments face mounting legal pushback \n         By Juliana Kim \n        \n           Updated Thursday, November 20, 2025 • 5:43 PM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         Again and again, President Trump's efforts to send National Guard troops to U.S. cities have been met with resistance in the courts. In his second term, Trump has continued to push the boundaries of military involvement in domestic matters, whether it comes to addressing public safety, quelling protests or safeguarding federal buildings and personnel, including ICE agents. In response, local and state Democratic leaders have forcefully pushed back and made strides in the courts, where judges have deemed the use of military force as unnecessary or unlawful. Some judges have also expressed wariness around having the military get involved in civilian affairs. \"This principle has been foundational to the safeguarding of our fundamental liberties under the Constitution,\" U.S. District Court Judge Karin Immergut wrote in her ruling freezing Trump's deployment to Portland, Ore. earlier this month. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The latest court to push back was in Washington, D.C. where a federal judge ruled on Thursday that Trump's use of the Guard in the nation's capital  was unlawful . Days earlier, a judge in Tennessee temporarily blocked the state's deployment in Memphis, where troops had been ordered by the governor at the behest of Trump. As the legal challenges mount, the Defense Department over the weekend ordered hundreds of troops in Chicago and Portland to return to their home states after federal courts stalled deployments,  NPR previously reported . Elizabeth Goitein, senior director of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, said the Trump administration has now been rebuffed by federal district or state judges in all five cities where Guard troops have been deployed.  \"Although the cases are still working their way through the appeals process, it is increasingly clear that Trump's actions are not just unprecedented but also unlawful,\" she said. \"Using the military against Americans absent the gravest of emergencies goes against centuries of tradition and legal principles.\" Some legal and military experts view the recent events as minor setbacks for the Trump administration. But others see the court decisions as proof of checks and balances at work, at least to some degree. \"There's a pretty common theme that deploying the military into U.S. cities is not something that can be done lawlessly,\" said David Janovsky, a senior policy analyst at the Project on Government Oversight, a watchdog group. \"It is a good sign that the courts are standing up and saying that.\" Breaking down the Memphis ruling  In Tennessee, a group of Democratic lawmakers and officials filed a lawsuit against Republican Gov. Bill Lee and others, challenging the deployment of the state's National Guard. The plaintiffs argued that Memphis did not face a \"rebellion or invasion,\" which was the criteria for sending the Guard under the state's constitution. Unlike the governors of Illinois, Oregon and California, who have opposed Trump's deployment of Guard forces, the governor of Tennessee approved and directed the deployment in Memphis.  Still, on Monday, Davidson County Chancellor Patricia Head Moskal sided with the plaintiffs. In her opinion, she wrote, \"The power committed to the Governor as commander-in-chief of the Army and Militia is not unfettered.\" Benjamin R. Farley, an attorney with the National Immigration Law Center, which   was part of a coalition that provided legal representation to the plaintiffs,   said Moskal's ruling showed that the Tennessee governor does not have blanket authority to deploy troops.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"It's one more victory in a line of victories for the law against executive overreach, whether that's the president or as is the case here, the governor of Tennessee,\" he said. White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told NPR that the administration disagreed with the ruling. \"This state court judge fundamentally misunderstood the law and is attempting to act as a policy-maker, not a judge,\" she said in an email. Now, it's important to note that the pause on the deployment has not taken effect, as the chancellor gave the state a few days to appeal. In a statement, Lee spokesperson Elizabeth Lane Johnson said the state will appeal and the Guard will continue to operate in the city. \"Memphians know their city is facing a violent crime emergency that the state must address, and we're confident higher courts will ultimately recognize this as well,\" she said. Janovsky from the Project on Government Oversight said allowing the Guard operations to continue is one way the courts tend to fall short. \"That sort of misreads the stakes of the situation,\" he said. \"If it is presumptively illegal to have troops on the streets, it seems completely backwards to let the troops stay on the street until there's a final determination.\" As federal courts block troop deployments, will SCOTUS have final say? A Defense Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, told NPR that the holidays may have influenced the decision to  withdraw out-of-state troops from Illinois and Oregon  in the coming days. But retired Maj. Gen. William Enyart, who led the Illinois National Guard from 2007 to 2012, believes the federal courts, which have repeatedly blocked the deployments in Chicago and Portland from moving forward, also played a role. \"This shows the relative strength of the system and of the founding fathers in designing that system, where we had a separation of powers as well as a balancing of powers,\" he added. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The Trump administration is challenging the rulings that block the use of troops and in the case over the deployment in Chicago, the administration has asked the Supreme Court to weigh in. Some legal experts say it could have a ripple effect — to a degree — depending on how broadly the justices rule. \"The more broadly they construe their opinion, the more broad of an effect we're going to see,\" said Chris Mirasola, a national security law professor at the University of Houston Law Center. Even as debates over the mobilizations play out in various courts, Trump has  suggested sending troops  to about half a dozen other cities, and warned of invoking the Insurrection Act to pave the way. Mirasola said there are limits to how much the courts can restrict the president's use of the military, and ultimately the public serves as a stronger check on power. \"It's always going to be public sentiment that I think is especially consequential,\" he said. \n         \n         Transcript \n         JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:   A federal judge today ordered an end to the months-long National Guard deployment in the nation's capital, declaring it unlawful. The order comes just days after a Tennessee state judge issued a temporary block on the use of troops in Memphis. These are the latest in a series of legal setbacks for President Trump's Guard deployments in American cities, all before the Supreme Court weighs in. NPR's Juliana Kim reports. JULIANA KIM, BYLINE: David Janovsky has been following the court cases related to the National Guard deployments in American cities, and he says he's been noticing a trend. DAVID JANOVSKY: I think there's a pretty common theme that, you know, deploying the military into U.S. cities is not something that can be done lawlessly. KIM: Janovsky is a senior policy analyst at the watchdog group Project on Government Oversight. He says more judges are determining that Trump's use of the military on the homefront is either unlawful or unnecessary. JANOVSKY: But it is, I think, a good sign that the courts are standing up and saying that. KIM: In his second term, Trump has sent troops to nearly half a dozen cities - Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., Portland, Oregon, Chicago and Memphis. He says the military is needed to address crime, quell protests or protect federal buildings and personnel, including ICE agents. Critics have called it executive overreach and a departure from American norms. In Tennessee, the court battle is unique because it was against the Republican governor who had activated the Guard at Trump's behest, and therefore, the suit was handled in state court. While the judge issued a block on the deployment, it hasn't taken effect while the state has time to appeal, which it says will do. Janovsky says this is one way courts tend to fall short. JANOVSKY: If it is presumptively illegal to have troops on the streets, it seems completely backwards to let the troops stay on the street until there's a final determination. KIM: The Trump administration is challenging the rulings that block the use of the Guard in Portland and Chicago, and the case over Chicago has reached the Supreme Court. A response can come any day now. What the justices decide could impact the fate of other deployments, according to Chris Mirasola, a national security law professor at the University of Houston Law Center. CHRIS MIRASOLA: The more broadly they construe their opinion, the more broad of an effect we're going to see. KIM: Amid all the legal challenges, Trump has suggested sending troops to about half a dozen other cities. MIRASOLA: I'm not optimistic that litigation is going to be the most effective way of curtailing these uses of the military. KIM: Mirasola says there's only so much the courts can do to restrict the president's use of troops. And ultimately, it's the public that serves as a greater check on power.

warning to downland their digital histories and delete their accounts from Facebook, Instagram and Threads before a world-first social media ban on accounts of children younger than 16 takes effect. The Australian government announced two weeks ago that the three Meta platforms plus Snapchat, TikTok, X and YouTube must take reasonable steps to exclude Australian account holders younger than 16, beginning Dec. 10. California-based Meta on Thursday became the first of the targeted tech companies to outline how it will comply with the law. Meta contacted thousands of young account holders via SMS and email to warn that suspected children will start to be denied access to the platforms from Dec. 4. “We will start notifying impacted teens today to give them the opportunity to save their contacts and memories,” Meta said in a statement. Meta said young users could also use the notice period to update their contact information “so we can get in touch and help them regain access once they turn 16.” Related Stories Bubble fears ease but investors still waiting for AI to live up to its promise 4 MIN READ US filings for jobless benefits remained in historically healthy range during government shutdown 2 MIN READ Spanish court orders Meta to pay nearly half a billion euros in damages to media outlets 2 MIN READ Meta has estimated there are 350,000 Australians aged 13-to-15 on Instagram and 150,000 in that age bracket on Facebook. Australia’s population is 28 million. Account holders 16-years-old and older who were mistakenly given notice that they would be excluded can contact Yoti Age Verification and verify their age by providing government-issued identity documents or a “video selfie,” Meta said. Terry Flew, co-director of Sydney University’s Center for AI, Trust and Governance, said such facial-recognition technology had a failure rate of at least 5%. “In the absence of a government-mandated ID system, we’re always looking at second-best solutions around these things,” Flew told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. The government has warned platforms that demanding that all account holders prove they are older than 15 would be an unreasonable response to the new age restrictions. The government maintains the platforms already had sufficient data about many account holders to ascertain they were not young children. Failure to take reasonable steps to exclude young children could earn platforms fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($32 million). Meta’s vice president and global head of safety, Antigone Davis, said she would prefer that app stores including Apple App Store and Google Play collect the age information when a user signs up and verifies they are at least 16 year old for app operators such as Facebook and Instagram. “We believe a better approach is required: a standard, more accurate, and privacy-preserving system, such as OS/app store-level age verification,” Davis said in a statement. “This combined with our investments in ongoing efforts to assure age … offers a more comprehensive protection for young people online,” she added. Dany Elachi, founder of the parents’ group Heaps Up Alliance that lobbied for the social media age restriction , said parents should start helping their children plan on how they will spend the hours currently absorbed by social media. He was critical of the government’s only announcing on the complete list of platforms that will become age-restricted on Nov. 5. “There are aspects of the legislation that we’re not entirely supportive of, but the principle that children under the age of 16 are better off in the real world, that’s something we advocated for and are in favor of,” Elachi said. “When everybody misses out, nobody misses out. That’s the theory. Certainly we expect that it would play out that way. We hope parents are going to be very positive about this and try to help their children see all the potential possibilities that are now open to them,” he added."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/prakazrel-pras-michel-rapper-fugees-sentencing-626135406baa3b045f1ac4fc5ec3ad42","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"22:40:33Z","title":"Pras Michel Sentenced to 14 Years in Prison for Illegally Funneling Foreign Funds to Obama Campaign","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Prakazrel 'Pras' Michel, a Grammy-winning rapper and founding member of the Fugees, was sentenced to 14 years in prison for illegally funneling over $120 million in foreign contributions from Malaysian billionaire Jho Low to former President Barack Obama’s 2012 reelection campaign.

2025-11-20T22:40:33+00:00\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Grammy-winning rapper Prakazrel “Pras” Michel of the Fugees was sentenced on Thursday to 14 years in prison for a case in which he was convicted of illegally funneling millions of dollars in foreign contributions to former President Barack Obama’s 2012 reelection campaign. Michel, 52, declined to address the court before U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly sentenced him. In April 2023, a federal jury convicted Michel of 10 counts , including conspiracy and acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign government. The trial in Washington, D.C., included testimony from actor Leonardo DiCaprio and former Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Justice Department prosecutors said federal sentencing guidelines recommended a life sentence for Michel, whom they said “betrayed his country for money” and “lied unapologetically and unrelentingly to carry out his schemes.” “His sentence should reflect the breadth and depth of his crimes, his indifference to the risks to his country, and the magnitude of his greed,” they wrote . Defense attorney Peter Zeidenberg said his client’s 14-year sentence is “completely disproportionate to the offense.” Michel will appeal his conviction and sentence, according to his lawyer. Zeidenberg had recommended a three-year prison sentence. A life sentence would be an “absurdly high” punishment for Michel given that it is typically reserved for deadly terrorists and drug cartel leaders, Michel’s attorneys said in a court filing. “The Government’s position is one that would cause Inspector Javert to recoil and, if anything, simply illustrates just how easily the Guidelines can be manipulated to produce absurd results, and how poorly equipped they are, at least on this occasion, to determine a fair and just sentence,” they wrote . Michel, a Brooklyn native whose parents immigrated to the U.S. from Haiti, was a founding member of the Fugees along with childhood friends Lauryn Hill and Wyclef Jean. Their hip-hop band won two Grammy Awards and sold tens of millions of albums. Michel obtained over $120 million from Malaysian billionaire Low Taek Jho — also known as Jho Low — and steered some of that money through straw donors to Obama’s campaign. Michel also tried to end a Justice Department investigation of Low, tampered with two witnesses and perjured himself at trial, prosecutors said. Low, who has lived in China, was one of the primary financiers of “The Wolf of Wall Street,” a movie starring DiCaprio. Low is a fugitive but has maintained his innocence. “Low’s motivation for giving Mr. Michel money to donate was not so that he could achieve some policy objective. Instead, Low simply wanted to obtain a photograph with himself and then-President Obama,” Michel’s attorneys wrote. In August 2024, the judge rejected Michel’s request for a new trial based in part on his defense attorney’s use of a generative AI program during his closing of the trial’s arguments. The judges said that and other trial errors didn’t amount to a serious miscarriage of justice."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/trump-military-traitors-sedition-illegal-orders-c5fc3c5bd2fbc6b1204550e4203c24b2","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"17:38:08+00:00","title":"Trump Accuses Democratic Lawmakers of Sedition Over Military Video Call to Defy 'Illegal Orders'","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A video released by six Democratic lawmakers — including Sen.

veterans of the armed services and intelligence community — called on U.S. military members to uphold the Constitution and defy “illegal orders.” The 90-second video was first posted early Tuesday from Sen. Elissa Slotkin’s X account. In it, the six lawmakers — Slotkin, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, and Reps. Jason Crow, Chris Deluzio, Maggie Goodlander and Chrissy Houlahan — speak directly to U.S. service members, whom Slotkin acknowledges are “under enormous stress and pressure right now.” “The American people need you to stand up for our laws and our Constitution,” Slotkin wrote in the X post. Along with the Michigan senator, the other lawmakers appearing in the video are seen as possible future aspirants for higher office, who now, thanks to the video’s wide exposure, have elevated their own political profiles. Trump on Thursday reposted messages from others about the video, amplifying it with his own words. It marked another flashpoint in the political rhetoric that at times has been thematic in his administrations, as well as among some in his MAGA base. Some Democrats accused him of acting like a king and trying to distract from the soon-to-be-released files about disgraced financier and sexual abuser Jeffrey Epstein. What Democrats said in the video With pieces of dialogue spliced together from different members, the lawmakers introduce themselves and their background. They go on to say the Trump administration “is pitting our uniformed military against American citizens.” They call for service members to “refuse illegal orders” and “stand up for our laws.” The lawmakers conclude the video by encouraging service members, “Don’t give up the ship,” a War of 1812-era phrase attributed to a U.S. Navy captain’s dying command to his crew. Although the lawmakers didn’t mention specific circumstances in the video, its release comes as the Trump administration continues attempts at deployment of National Guard troops into U.S. cities for various roles, although some have been pulled back, and others held up in court. Are U.S. troops allowed to disobey orders? Troops, especially uniformed commanders, have a specific obligation to reject an order that’s unlawful, if they make that determination. However, while commanders have military lawyers on their staffs to consult with in helping make such a determination, rank-and-file troops who are tasked with carrying out those orders are rarely in a similar position. Broad legal precedence holds that just following orders, colloquially known as the “Nuremberg defense” as it was used unsuccessfully by senior Nazi officials to justify their actions under Adolf Hitler, doesn’t absolve troops. However, the U.S. military legal code, known as the Uniform Code of Military Justice or UCMJ, will punish troops for failing to follow an order should it turn out to be lawful. Troops can be criminally charged with Article 90 of the UCMJ, willfully disobeying a superior commissioned officer, and Article 92, failure to obey an order.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More How Trump and others responded On Thursday, Trump reposted to social media an article about the video, adding his own commentary that it was “really bad, and Dangerous to our Country.” “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR FROM TRAITORS!!!” Trump went on. “LOCK THEM UP???” He called for the lawmakers’ arrest and trial, adding in a separate post that it was “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH.” Trump also reposted more than a dozen comments from other accounts criticizing Democrats, including one that stated: “HANG THEM GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD !!” Asked during a White House briefing on Thursday about the intent of Trump’s messages, press secretary Karoline Leavitt instead honed in on the Democrats’ message, which she posited “perhaps is punishable by law.” Leavitt went on to say that any incitement to “defy the chain of command, not to follow lawful orders” is “a very dangerous thing for sitting members of Congress to do, and they should be held accountable, and that’s what the president wants to see.” The White House insisted Thursday that President Donald Trump was not calling for Democratic lawmakers to be executed for a video urging troops to defy “illegal orders,” despite his post calling their comments “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH.” Democrats were swift to react to Trump’s words, with Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer warning in a floor speech that the president was “lighting a match in a country soaked with political gasoline.” Speaker Mike Johnson said he did not believe Trump was calling for violence in the social media posts, saying Trump was merely “defining a crime,” and calling the Democrats’ video “wildly inappropriate.” “Think of the threat that is to our national security and what it means for our institution,” Johnson added. Trump’s allies balked at the video. On Wednesday on Fox News, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller called the messaging “insurrection — plainly, directly, without question” and said it represented “a general call for rebellion from the CIA and the armed services of the United States, by Democrat lawmakers.” On X, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth commented on the video Tuesday as “Stage 4 TDS,” referring to “Trump Derangement Syndrome” — a term used by Trump to describe voters so angry and opposed to him that they are incapable of seeing any good in what he does. The Steady State, which describes itself as “a network of 300+ national and homeland security experts standing for strong and principled policy, rule of law, and democracy,” wrote in a Substack post on Thursday that the lawmakers’ call was “only a restatement of what every officer and enlisted servicemember already knows: illegal orders can and should be refused. This is not a political opinion. It is doctrine.” Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell challenged the theory that illegal orders were being issued. “Our military follows orders, and our civilians give legal orders,” Parnell told The Associated Press on Thursday. “We love the Constitution. These politicians are out of their minds.” ___ Associated Press writers Kevin Freking, Stephen Groves and Konstantin Toropin contributed to this report. ___ Meg Kinnard can be reached at http://x.com/MegKinnardAP"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/ten-commandments-texas-schools-f16713552035212c4c5430e988dfcf82","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"12:13:12+00:00","title":"Texas School Districts Face Legal and Moral Conflict Over Ten Commandments Display Law","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Texas implemented a state law in September 2025 requiring public schools to display the Ten Commandments in classrooms, sparking intense debate over religious expression and constitutional rights.

it became clear to Texas high school theater teacher Gigi Cervantes that she couldn’t ignore a new state law requiring the Ten Commandments to be posted in her Fort Worth classroom, she felt she had no choice. She resigned from the job she loved. In the small city of Whitesboro, eighth grade U.S. history teacher Dustin Parsons welcomed the new poster on his classroom wall, saying the display helps him demonstrate the influence of Christianity on the country’s founding principles. Across Texas, there are no shortage of strong opinions among teachers, parents and students as the state undertakes the nation’s largest attempt to hang the Ten Commandments in public schools. In the rush to navigate the Republican-led mandate that took effect in September, the rollout has forced some administrators, teachers and school boards to confront hard choices. “I just was not going to be a part of forcing or imposing religious doctrine onto my students,” Cervantes said.

Courts have also ruled against similar laws in Arkansas and Louisiana , and the issue is expected to reach the U.S. Supreme Court.

Some districts didn’t wait: In suburban Dallas, school officials in Frisco spent about $1,800 to print nearly 5,000 posters, even though the law only requires schools to hang the Ten Commandments if the displays are donated. Some schools have no posters to hang. “I’m not evangelizing,” Parsons said. “I’m doing it more from a history source perspective in how they were building the Constitution.” School districts face a dilemma The law says schools must put donated posters “in a conspicuous place” and requires the writing to be a size and typeface that is visible from anywhere in a classroom to a person with “average vision.” The displays must also be 16 inches wide and 20 inches tall (40 centimeters wide and 50 centimeters tall). South of Austin, the Hays Consolidated Independent School District posted copies of the U.S. Constitution’s Bill of Rights — which includes the First Amendment — alongside the state-required Ten Commandments. “Districts are in between a rock and a hard place,” said Elizabeth Beeton, a member of the Galveston Independent School District’s school board. Judges blocked the posters in some schools, including some of Texas’ largest, after parents brought lawsuits. In Galveston, the school board voted not to post the commandments until the law’s constitutionality is decided in the courts, but then found themselves the target of a state lawsuit . This week, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced lawsuits against two more districts he said were violating the law, though one, the Leander Independent School District said they are displaying donated posters.

In suburban Dallas, Lorne Liechty rallied his family to raise money for Ten Commandments posters to donate to the Rockwall Independent School District. Liechty, an attorney and Rockwall County commissioner, sees the commandments as fundamental to his Christian faith, the country’s legal system and the functioning of society. “These are just really good guides for human behavior,” Liechty said. “For the life of me, I don’t know why people would object to any of these principles.” Adriana Bonilla would like to see the posters in her son’s kindergarten near San Antonio. “It assists with moral foundations and it teaches respect and responsibility,” Bonilla said.

She said teachers also ask for guidance on how to handle students’ questions. “Generally speaking, the answer is going to be that the teacher should send them back to their family,” Leahy said. While the Austin high school where Rachel Preston teaches has been barred by a court order from displaying the Ten Commandments, she said she and her colleagues are anxious all the same. “We’re worried specifically about students who don’t identify as Christian feeling unease at the very least at the presence of this in our classrooms, and struggling as well with how do we contextualize this?” Preston said.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More Students debate the posters When the Ten Commandments were posted last month throughout 16-year-old Madison Creed’s high school in the small East Texas city of Carthage, she said it briefly became the “buzz of the school” as students debated whether the religious doctrine belonged there. “Everybody had their opinion about it,” Creed said. “I know talking to a lot of my peers and my classmates that a lot of us don’t agree with it but there is the other portion of the school that does.” Word also came that the high school band director had resigned over the law. Johnnie Cotton wrote on Facebook that he believed “very strongly that politics and religion have no place in the public schools.” Creed, who plays in the band, said she understood and agreed with Cotton’s stance, and admired that he stood up for his beliefs, even though his resignation two weeks before a big competition was badly timed. Creed’s mother, Tiffany Meadows, said the posting of the commandments didn’t bother her because she and her children are Christians, but that she was worried about students of other religions. “These are public schools, these aren’t Christian schools,” Meadows said. Cervantes, who said she believed complying with the law breached her students’ First Amendment rights, ended her career at the Fort Worth Academy of Fine Arts this fall by leading her students through a production of Molière’s comedy “The Imaginary Invalid.” Her students presented her with a signed cast photograph and many said they respected her point of view. “I kind of feel like we are living through a time where people who are in positions to be standing up for things are not standing up, not speaking out and there’s a climate of fear,” Cervantes said. “And I don’t want to be any part of that.”"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5613412","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"11:46:00-11:50","title":"A Man on the Inside goes to college, and Ted Danson aces the test","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The second season of the Netflix sitcom 'A Man on the Inside', created by Michael Schur and inspired by a Chilean documentary called 'The Mole Agent', returns with a new college setting where Ted Danson plays Charles, a man who goes undercover as a professor of engineering to solve thefts and vandalism linked to a controversial wealthy donor, Brad Vinick.

Actor Ted Danson and TV writer-producer Michael Schur, who teamed up for the successful afterlife comedy \"The Good Place,\" have gotten together again for another sitcom - Netflix's \"A Man On The Inside.\" The series is back with Season 2. And our TV critic David Bianculli says the show is one of the most entertaining and relatively unappreciated series currently on TV. Here's his review. DAVID BIANCULLI, BYLINE: Michael Schur's inspiration for \"A Man On The Inside\" was a really unusual one. It's based on a documentary from Chile called \"The Mole Agent,\" which told the story of an octogenarian hired by a private eye firm to solve a case of theft in an elder care facility by going undercover as a new resident. Schur cast Ted Danson, the pivotal player in his wildly surprising \"The Good Place\" sitcom, in the central role and surrounded him with endearing and talented co-stars and supporting players. The first season of \"A Man On The Inside\" was very funny, and its central mystery was a good one. But most of all, the series was about family and friendship and explorations of such issues as trust, usefulness and mortality. Like \"The Good Place,\" it was a very philosophical comedy. And now, for Season 2, \"A Man On The Inside\" returns with an even stronger story. With the way Michael Schur flipped the entire premise of \"The Good Place\" for Season 2 of that show, you know he's capable of some unexpected plot twists, and he serves up several of them here. This time, the setting is a small college, where a wealthy and abrasive major benefactor has rubbed lots of people the wrong way. The school administrators come to the detective agency run by Julie - played, as last season, by Lilah Richcreek Estrada - to investigate acts of theft and vandalism targeting the controversial donor. And she, in turn, dispatches Charles, played by Ted Danson, to go undercover by assuming a role he once held in his own past - professor of engineering. This allows for a whole new cast of supporting characters, and this season of \"A Man On The Inside\" delivers magnificently. One faculty member, a music teacher, is played by Danson's real-life wife, actress Mary Steenburgen, who charms Charles instantly. Me, too. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"A MAN ON THE INSIDE\") TED DANSON: (As Charles) You look so familiar. Could we have met before somehow? MARY STEENBURGEN: (As Mona Margadoff) Possible, but most people our age recognize me from Lavender Highway. (Singing) Now it's goodbye, baby. Well, it's goodbye, baby. Well, it's not like me to stay too long. DANSON: (As Charles) I remember that song. Was that you? STEENBURGEN: (As Mona Margadoff) That was me. That was my band. I was 18 years old. We played at Woodstock. DANSON: (As Charles) Wow. You know, we had weirdly similar lives because when I was 18, I was on the local news for growing a really large squash. So I guess we both understand fame. BIANCULLI: Another \"Man On The Inside\" newcomer is David Strathairn. I've loved his work ever since he played a bookstore owner on \"The Days And Nights Of Molly Dodd\" in the '80s. You may remember him from such movies as \"The Firm,\" \"Lincoln\" or \"Good Night, And Good Luck.\" In \"A Man On The Inside,\" he gives Danson someone really feisty to play against. It's not Sam and Diane from \"Cheers,\" but I cheer every scene they play together. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"A MAN ON THE INSIDE\") DANSON: (As Charles) So what's your specialty within the department? DAVID STRATHAIRN: (As Dr. Benjamin Cole) I teach romantic poetry and the 19th century novel. DANSON: (As Charles) Just one novel? Sounds easy. STRATHAIRN: (As Dr. Benjamin Cole) Droll. If you'll excuse me, I have to get ready. DANSON: (As Charles) I assume you're going to the cocktail party later for Brad Vinick? STRATHAIRN: (As Dr. Benjamin Cole) I am, out of professional necessity. DANSON: (As Charles) You don't approve of Vinick? STRATHAIRN: (As Dr. Benjamin Cole) Do I approve of Vinick? Did Antigonus (ph) approve of Atizyes (ph)? DANSON: (As Charles) Boy, I don't know. STRATHAIRN: (As Dr. Benjamin Cole) Oh, I apologize. I forgot what you teach. I'll ask it in a way you can understand. Did Garfield approve of not having lasagna? DANSON: (As Charles) Come on now. Engineering is an advanced science. STRATHAIRN: (As Dr. Benjamin Cole) Oh, yes. That bridge is big. What if we built one that's bigger? BIANCULLI: Yet another new cast member and terrific foil for the other actors is Gary Cole, who plays the wealthy donor Brad Vinick. Like Steenburgen and Danson, Cole also broke out as an actor in the 1980s in the murder mystery miniseries \"Fatal Vision.\" He's bounced ever since between comedy and drama, including memorable stints playing the same character, Kurt, on \"The Good Wife\" and \"The Good Fight.\" In \"A Man On The Inside,\" his character enjoys repelling just about everyone, including investigator Julie. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"A MAN ON THE INSIDE\") LILAH RICHCREEK ESTRADA: (As Julie Kovalenko) Mr. Vinick, Julie Kovalenko, the PI in charge of the investigation. GARY COLE: (As Brad Vinick) I'll tell you what I told the State Department. I was in Belarus for a wedding, and I didn't use my own passport so I could surprise them. Wait, wait. Which investigation? RICHCREEK ESTRADA: (As Julie Kovalenko) Wheeler College? The portrait? COLE: (As Brad Vinick) Oh, oh, right, yeah. Yeah, listen, I'm pissed off. I'm giving Wheeler a lot of money, and this is the thanks I get? RICHCREEK ESTRADA: (As Julie Kovalenko) I have a lot of promising leads, and I assure you we will find the person responsible. COLE: (As Brad Vinick) You seem competent. Pretty hot too. I like that. How old are you? RICHCREEK ESTRADA: (As Julie Kovalenko) Oh, you're definitely not supposed to ask me that. COLE: (As Brad Vinick) Say you're over 30. BIANCULLI: Michael Schur, whose other comedy credits include \"Parks And Recreation,\" and his writing staff clearly have a blast making this show.

Despite being a polarizing figure known for his role in advocating the Iraq War and surveillance policies, Cheney was praised for his restraint, professionalism, and unwavering commitment to national service. Former President George W. Bush eulogized Cheney as a man of integrity and calm leadership, while Joe Biden acknowledged his values and family loyalty, reflecting a shift in political tone. The event highlighted bipartisan unity, with key figures such as Mike Pence, Kamala Harris, and others attending. In contrast, Donald Trump was notably absent and silent, underscoring the deep political divide between his administration and Cheney’s legacy. The absence of a presidential proclamation and public comments from Trump further emphasized the political rift, while figures like JD Vance offered cautious, respectful recognition of Cheney’s service. The funeral also reflected personal and political narratives, including Liz Cheney’s reflection on her father’s values and the legacy of political feuds, especially around the 2020 election and the Capitol riot. Cheney’s death at 84 from heart-related complications marked a significant moment in American political history, uniting leaders across party lines in mourning a consequential yet controversial figure.","keyTakeAways":["Former President George W.

Trump, who has been publicly silent about Cheney’s death Nov. 3 , was not invited to the memorial service. Two ex-presidents came: Republican George W. Bush, who eulogized the man who served him as vice president, and Democrat Joe Biden, who once called Cheney “the most dangerous vice president we’ve had probably in American history” but now honors his commitment to his family and to his values.

She spoke of her father’s conviction that when confronted with a choice between defending the country and a political party, the country must come first. “Bonds of party must always yield to the single bond we share as Americans,” she said. Liz Cheney is a former high-ranking House member whose Republican political career was shredded by a MAGA movement angered by her investigation of the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol. Thursday, she chose not to speak directly of Trump. She spoke of seeing clouds in the shape of angels just before her father died. A Who’s Who of Washington, minus you know who Moments before the service began, figures of recent but now receded power mingled: Bush and Biden and their wives sitting in a row together, former Vice Presidents Kamala Harris and Mike Pence chatting side by side in their pew with Al Gore and Dan Quayle together behind them. Biden greeted Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell, the former longtime Senate leader, and his wife, former labor and transportation secretary Elaine Chao. Behind them sat Democratic Rep. Nancy Pelosi, who spent time talking with another former House speaker, Republican John Boehner. All gathered among the soaring interior columns of the grand cathedral known as “a spiritual home for the nation.” Former Presidents front row from left, George W.

Yet he kept winning elections as a Wyoming congressman for years after that. Cheney, he said, was always the “calmest person in the room.” Cheney had lived with heart disease for decades and, after the Bush administration, with a heart transplant. He died at age 84 from complications of pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease, his family said. When former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney’s funeral is held at the Washington National Cathedral in the nation’s capital, he will join a bipartisan but exclusive list of figures memorialized there. Trump’s vice president, JD Vance, on stage at another event in the morning, was asked about Cheney and said: “Obviously there’s some political disagreements there but he was a guy who served his country. We certainly wish his family all the best in this moment of grieving.” Vance was also not invited to the funeral, according to a person familiar with the details who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The White House lowered its flags to half-staff after Cheney’s death, as it said the law calls for, but Trump did not issue the presidential proclamation that often accompanies the death of notable figures, nor has he commented publicly on his passing. The deeply conservative Cheney’s influence in the Bush administration was legendary and, to his critics, tragic. He advocated for the U.S. invasion of Iraq on the basis of what proved to be faulty intelligence and consistently defended the extraordinary tools of surveillance, detention and inquisition employed in response to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Bush credited him with helping to keep the country safe and stable in a perilous time. Bad blood between the Cheneys and Trump After the 2020 election won by Biden, Liz Cheney served as vice chair of the Democratic-led special House committee that investigated the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. She accused Trump of summoning the violent mob and plunging the nation into “a moment of maximum danger.” Lynne Cheney, seated front right, and daughter Liz Cheney, seated front left, look on during the funeral for former Vice President Dick Cheney at the Washington National Cathedral on Thursday, Nov. 20, 2025 in Washington.

In a campaign TV ad made for his daughter, Dick Cheney branded Trump a “coward” who “tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him.” Last year, it did not sit well with Trump when Cheney said he would vote for the Democrat, Harris, in the presidential election. Trump told Arab and Muslim voters that Dick Cheney’s support for Harris should give them pause, because he “killed more Arabs than any human being on Earth. He pushed Bush, and they went into the Middle East.” A joint services body bearer team carries the flag-draped casket of former Vice President Dick Cheney out of the Washington National Cathedral, Thursday, Nov. 20, 2025, in Washington.

summit , where the absence of the United States has underscored the need for greater cooperation to tackle the climate crisis.\n\nLula and United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres met with key figures at the  climate summit  in Belem, Brazil, on Wednesday, seeking a deal that would bridge contentious issues.\n\n“We need to show society that we want this without imposing anything on anyone, without setting deadlines for each country to decide what it can do within its own time, within its own possibilities,”  Lula  told reporters, saying countries must find a shared “roadmap” on climate action.\n\nBut the Brazilian leader, who has positioned himself as a chief advocate of both climate action and greater collaboration between non-Western countries, has struggled to bridge divides on issues such as fossil fuel use and climate finance.\n\nScientists have warned that a failure to quickly transition away from the use of fossil fuels could bring disastrous changes to the planet’s ecosystem and result in dangerous increases in extreme weather across the globe with poor countries  more vulnerable  to severe impacts.\n\n“A road map is not a workshop or a ministerial meeting. A road map is a real workplan that needs to show us the way from where we are to where we need to be, and how to get there,” a letter from seven prominent scientists, including some who are advising the COP30 presidency, stated.\n\nWhile the US decision not to attend the climate summit has loomed large, other influential countries have also been hesitant to commit to ambitious goals.\n\nSome countries, such as  India , have criticised the lack of action by rich countries, which are responsible for a large majority of cumulative emissions and have been the subject of calls by poor countries to lower barriers to advancements in renewable technology.\n\n“Climate change is no longer a distant manifestation but is real and imminent,” Indian Environmental Minister Bhupender Yadav said in remarks to the conference on Monday. Yadav has suggested that India could submit a climate plan in December rather than the self-imposed deadline of the end of the conference."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/federal-immigration-crackdown-new-orleans-55119a4cf4e6da418e38287cb20c0ef4","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"05:04:58+00:00","title":"New Orleans Faces Federal Immigration Crackdown Amid Local Resistance","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"New Orleans, known for its cultural diversity and immigrant communities, is set to become a focal point for Operation 'Swamp Sweep', a month-long federal immigration crackdown led by Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino.

debauchery and Creole cuisine attract tourists from around the globe, is about to become the next staging ground for the Trump administration’s mass deportation agenda. Operation “Swamp Sweep,” an expansive, monthslong immigration crackdown, is expected to launch in southeast Louisiana Dec. 1, but Democrat-run New Orleans is anticipating the arrival of as many as 250 federal troops as soon as Friday, all with the backing of the state’s Republican governor. Gov. Jeff Landry has sought to align New Orleans with federal immigration enforcement efforts through legislation and legal challenges, and the Border Patrol deployment is just the latest drive to ramp up that pressure. And with the New Orleans Police Department being released from a federal reform pact Wednesday, its officers have lost a legal mechanism that has long-shielded them from having to participate in immigration enforcement. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security operation will be led by Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino, who has already overseen aggressive campaigns in Los Angeles, Chicago and Charlotte, North Carolina. Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel. Follow on A gung-ho Republican governor Landry, who has close ties to the nation’s top immigration officials, has made immigration enforcement a priority. Louisiana does not share a border with another country, yet it has become one of the nation’s largest detention hubs for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, with a capacity upward of 6,000 detainees. In September, the Bayou State opened the “Louisiana Lockup” inside a notorious state prison to hold immigrants whom federal officials consider dangerous. The governor has also highlighted crimes in which the suspect’s immigration status is in question, such as the killing of a French Quarter tour guide by a group that included a Honduran man who entered the country illegally. New Orleans’ deep-rooted immigrant communities New Orleans’ Democratic leaders frequently butt heads with Landry and other state officials who accuse the city of lax law enforcement and have pushed for collaboration with the Trump administration’s sweeping immigration crackdown. Mayor-elect Helena Moreno , a Mexican-American immigrant, told The Associated Press there is “a lot of fear” in her city and that she is working to ensure those who could be targeted by federal agents know their rights. “I’m very concerned about due process being violated, I’m very concerned about racial profiling,” Moreno said. New Orleans is known for its rich blend of French, Spanish, African and Native American cultures. It is home to more than 10,000 ethnic Vietnamese who arrived after the Vietnam War. A city monument recognizes the thousands of Latino workers who helped rebuild New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina . South Louisiana’s distinctive Cajun heritage emerged from French-speaking colonists exiled there in the 18th century. In September, Landry requested a National Guard deployment to New Orleans, citing rising violent crime, even though city police say crime is down and its elected leaders say federal troops are unnecessary. Landry told Newsmax on Wednesday that the “Swamp Sweep” operation is focused on “taking dangerous criminals off the street.” A Landry spokesperson declined to comment to the AP on Border Patrol operations. Rachel Taber, an organizer with the New Orleans-based advocacy group Union Migrante, said the influx of federal agents would have far-reaching negative impacts. “The same people pushing for this attack on immigrants benefit from immigrant labor and the exploitation of immigrants,” Taber said. “Who do they think is going to clean the hotels from Mardi Gras or clean up after their fancy Mardi Gras parade?” Conflict over the city’s immigration policies In August, Attorney General Pam Bondi sent a letter to New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell saying the city “engages in sanctuary policies and practices that thwart federal immigration enforcement.” The city has been barred from receiving certain federal law enforcement grants, according to Jim Craft, executive director of the Louisiana Commission on Law Enforcement, which distributes federal funds. Cantrell did not respond to a request for comment. Under Landry, the GOP-dominated Louisiana Legislature has targeted New Orleans’ immigration policies, including by passing a law threatening jail time for law enforcement officials who delay or ignore federal enforcement efforts. Another measure directs state agencies to verify, track and report anyone illegally in the U.S. who is receiving state services, and one more bans city policies that prohibit cooperation with federal immigration agencies. “Their enforcement of laws is indiscriminate at best, corrupt at worst,” said Republican state Sen. Jay Morris, who was behind the law punishing obstruction of immigration enforcement. “Apparently we have to have a law to tell people not to break the law.” Federal oversight of local law enforcement The Orleans Parish Sheriff’s office and the New Orleans Police Department have been subject to longstanding federal oversight that barred them from engaging in immigration enforcement. The police oversight ended Wednesday, leaving officers in an uncertain legal position if they receive conflicting directives from city and state leaders, according to the city’s Independent Police Monitor Stella Cziment. Moreno, set to take office as mayor on Jan. 12, said the city’s police will follow state law, but that department policy viewed immigration enforcement as a civil matter outside its jurisdiction. New Orleans Police Chief Anne Kirkpatrick said department policies barring immigration enforcement “are not in conflict” with state laws. Kirkpatrick said she met with ICE officials this week and her department will work with federal agents to ensure public safety. “Our support is to make sure they are not going to get hurt and that our community is not in danger,” she said. Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill, backed by the Department of Justice, has requested an end to federal oversight of the sheriff’s office, saying it impedes the state’s ability to enforce immigration law. The sheriff’s office, which operates the city’s jail, has a policy under federal mandate to not hold people for ICE unless they have committed a serious crime. Court filings show the U.S. government says that since 2022, the jail has only complied with two of its 170 detainer requests. Sheriff-elect Michelle Woodfork told AP she will comply with state law if federal oversight ends. ___ Cline reported from Baton Rouge, Louisiana."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/","dateOfPublication":"2111-01-01","timeOfPublication":"21:00:00Z","title":"Today's latest from Al Jazeera","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A collection of diverse global events includes legal accusations against a Grammy-winning rapper over alleged national betrayal, a surge of AI-generated music disrupting the music industry, intensified immigration enforcement in cities like Charlotte under the Trump administration, escalating violence in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, governance failures highlighted in the UK's pandemic response, trade disruptions due to US tariffs on Mexican exports, severe weather warnings leading to mass evacuations, and political efforts to address housing affordability in New York.

barely left the stage Wednesday night. “It takes a village,” she said in her acceptance speech. “We about to party.” She beat out Luke Combs, Cody Johnson, Chris Stapleton and Morgan Wallen, last year’s winner in the category . Earlier in the night, she won album of the year for “Whirlwind” — marking her second career win in the category — and earned the trophy for female vocalist of the year.

The legendary Vince Gill was presented with the Willie Nelson Lifetime Achievement Award, serenaded with his classic “When I Call Your Name” by Brandi Carlile and Patty Loveless. “His guitar playing is amazing. His songwriting is amazing. His singing is amazing,” said George Strait. He handed the award to Gill, his friend, and said there was none more deserving. “He’s just an immense talent. And oh, yeah, he plays with The Eagles.” Gill joked throughout his acceptance speech. First, about his high vocal tone, and later, that he might be the only person to win the award “that’s never smoked any weed,” a nod to its namesake and his friend Nelson.

Combs opened the show with a fiery rendition of his single “Back in the Saddle,” setting the stage for Wilson to launch into a spirited medley. She was joined by a star-studded crew of surprise collaborators, Little Big Town and Keith Urban among them. Performances arrived fast and fierce from there: Moroney, Stapleton, Kelsea Ballerini, The Red Clay Strays, Stephen Wilson, Jr. and Kenny Chesney shined, one after another. Old Dominion performed on a small stage in the middle of the audience, working their way through a medley of “Break Up with Him,” “Memory Lane,” “One Man Band,” “Hotel Key” and “Snapback.” Shaboozey brought some much needed depth; Wilson’s funky “Ring Finger” further proved she can do it all. Langley, Green, Tucker Wetmore and rapper BigXThaPlug held it down for a new generation of country music fans. The latter was especially noteworthy: Combs joined the Texas MC for their duet “Pray Hard,” further confirmation of country and rap’s crossover.

status – and could the US be next?\n\nAfter nearly 30 years, Canada has lost its measles “elimination” status, which, by default, has caused the overall Americas region to lose its status as well.\n\nIn a statement issued on Monday, the country’s Public Health Agency stated that Canada was experiencing a “large, multi-jurisdictional outbreak of measles” which began in October last year.\n\nOver the past year, the agency has recorded cases in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, Saskatchewan and the Northwest Territories. Overall, 5,000 positive cases of the illness and the deaths of two premature babies have been reported.\n\n“Canada can re-establish its measles elimination status once transmission of the measles strain associated with the current outbreak is interrupted for at least 12 months,” the agency said.\n\nBut Antony Black, a senior lecturer in life sciences at the University of Westminster in England, told Al Jazeera that Canada’s loss of its elimination status represented a “major backwards step on the path towards the control of this highly infectious and serious disease”.\n\nHere’s what we know about the loss of the elimination status:\n\nIt is a highly infectious virus which can be life-threatening if not caught early.\n\nThe illness, which is spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes, begins with cold-like symptoms, including a runny nose, high temperature and sore, red eyes.\n\nA few days after infection, small white spots can appear inside the cheeks and on the back of the lips. A rash then begins on the face and behind the ears before spreading across the body – the main telltale sign of the illness, according to information from NHS England.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, measles can cause pneumonia and become life-threatening. Babies and anyone with a weakened immune system are most at risk.\n\nMeasles is widely prevented through the use of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine, which is administered in two doses to children at one year old and three years old.\n\nAccording to the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), two doses of the vaccine are 97 percent effective in preventing a measles infection.\n\nThe “elimination” designation, which Canada has had since 1998, indicates that no locally transmitted infections or outbreaks have been reported in the past 12 months. This is no longer the case.\n\nMark Joffe, Alberta’s chief medical officer until earlier this year, blamed low take-up of vaccinations and told the Reuters news agency last month that more could have been done in the country to boost immunisation rates.\n\n“If the vaccination rates were high, this would never have happened. There may have been [some spread], but nothing like this,” Joffe said.\n\nAccording to the WHO and the US CDC, the main reason measles is spreading is that  fewer people are taking up vaccines  across the Americas region generally.\n\nOne contributing factor for low vaccination rates is a growing distrust of healthcare providers following the COVID-19 pandemic, in which anti-vaccine misinformation spread.\n\nAccording to Black, the pandemic became a “major challenge to health systems worldwide” whose facilities were overstretched meaning people missed opportunities to be vaccinated.\n\nVaccine hesitancy has also increased in many places, Black explained.\n\n“Vaccine hesitancy has been around in different forms for over 200 years, but the huge success of the COVID-19 vaccines in curbing the COVID-19 pandemic had given some hope that vaccine hesitancy would diminish. However, that has not happened,” he said.\n\n“Instead, we see the rise of mistrust of vaccines in general. The causes of mistrust are many and complex, but a main reason is the spread of misinformation and disinformation…there now needs to be a push to counteract this mistrust, for example by public health outreach and awareness campaigns, in addition to strengthening Canada’s vaccination registry system to allow better and more targeted interventions,” he added.\n\nOne of the most persistent myths driving MMR vaccine hesitancy was the claim that it causes autism. This belief stemmed from a 1998 study, which has since been discredited and retracted. There is no scientific evidence of any link between the MMR vaccine and autism.\n\nIn some US states and Canadian provinces, exemptions for vaccine mandates – giving non-medical reasons for declining vaccines, such as for personal or religious reasons – are becoming more common. This has led to the existence of clusters of unvaccinated people who are more vulnerable to outbreaks when exposed to the virus.\n\nSome communities, such as the Mennonites – Anabaptist Christians who have communities in the US, Canada and Mexico – have low vaccination rates, as conservative branches of the community do not believe in modern medicine.  Several outbreaks  in the past year have been traced to Mennonite communities.\n\nOverall in Canada, according to public health data, measles immunisation also fell during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, when lockdowns made it harder to access general healthcare, and continued afterwards.\n\nIn 2019, 89.5 percent of children in Canada received their first dose of the MMR vaccine. But by 2023, that figure had dropped to 82.5 percent.\n\nIn the US, during the 2024-2025 school year, 92.7 percent of children received the vaccine, according to the CDC.\n\nIn Mexico, according to World Health Organization (WHO) figures, 79.86 percent of children received the first dose of the MMR vaccine.\n\nAt least 95 percent of a population is required to be vaccinated in order to achieve “herd immunity” against measles. Herd immunity means enough people have been vaccinated to make it too hard for the disease to spread.\n\nExperts say the safest way to maintain herd immunity is through vaccination programmes.\n\nAccording to the WHO, measles vaccination prevented an estimated 31.7 million deaths globally between 2000 and 2020.\n\nThe MMR vaccine, widely used around the world, provides about 97 percent protection against the measles virus, according to public health agencies.\n\nThe vaccine is normally given to children in two stages: The first dose at 12 months and the second at about three years and four months of age (when the child is nearing pre-school age), as part of routine immunisation programmes in countries like  the United Kingdom .\n\nBreakthrough cases in vaccinated people are rare and usually mild.\n\nAccording to the Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO), part of the wider World Health Organization, Canada’s loss of its status means that “the Region of the Americas has lost its verification as free from endemic measles transmission”.\n\nOnce the MMR vaccine was approved for distribution in 1963, healthcare practitioners and school programmes were initiated in Canada, pushing for families to receive immunisation.\n\nBy 1998, Canada had achieved its measles elimination status. Two years later, the US achieved its elimination status, as well.\n\nBy 2016, the Americas region was declared free from measles, which meant that every country in the region had reached elimination status.\n\nFollowing an outbreak in Venezuela and Brazil in 2018, the Americas lost its regional elimination status, only to have it reinstated last year once the outbreak was brought under control.\n\nNow, the Americas region has lost its elimination status once again because of the Canadian outbreak. While many individual countries within the region still have their elimination status, measles cases are on the rise, generally.\n\nAs of November 7, the PAHO said, there were 12,596 cases of measles across the region, with about 95 percent reported in Canada, Mexico and the  United States .\n\nThe PAHO said this was a “30-fold increase compared to 2024″.\n\nTwenty-eight deaths have been recorded: 23 in Mexico, three in the United States, and two in Canada.\n\nJarbas Barbosa, director of PAHO, said the region’s loss of its elimination status was a “setback – but it is also reversible”.\n\n“Until measles is eliminated worldwide, our region will continue to face the risk of reintroduction and spread of the virus among unvaccinated or under-vaccinated populations. However, as we have demonstrated before, with political commitment, regional cooperation, and sustained vaccination, the region can once again interrupt transmission and reclaim this collective achievement,” Barbosa said.\n\nCurrently, active outbreaks are occurring in Mexico, the US, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Belize, which have been “mostly triggered by imported cases”, according to PAHO.\n\nMexico had reported 5,019 measles cases by October 31, according to  data  from PAHO. The cases are concentrated in the northern state of Chihuahua.\n\nJust seven cases were reported in the whole of Mexico last year. A 31-year-old unvaccinated man from Ascension, Chihuahua, died from the disease in early April this year and at least 14 deaths have been reported since then, according to PAHO.\n\nIn the US, since January, a measles outbreak has led to 1,681 confirmed cases, according to the CDC last week.\n\nIn February, it reported its first measles death in a decade after an unvaccinated child fell ill amid an outbreak in Texas. The school-aged child died overnight after being hospitalised in Lubbock, northwest Texas, the state’s health department said.\n\nOf those who have tested positive for the disease, 92 percent were unvaccinated or had unknown  vaccination status .\n\nDemetre Daskalakis, a former CDC official, told Reuters that the US has a deadline of January 20 to prove that it has curbed the outbreak if it is to retain its elimination status.\n\nYes. In late 2023 and early 2024, there was a surge in measles cases in the UK, particularly in England.\n\nIn 2024 as a whole, there were 2,911 laboratory-confirmed measles cases in England, the highest number of cases recorded in a year, since 2012, according to the UK Health Security Agency.\n\nIn comparison, there were only two confirmed cases of measles across the whole of the UK in 2021 and 54 one year later.\n\nThere was another surge in cases in April 2025 – particularly in London and the northwest of the country – the agency said, but cases have since been declining. In 2025 so far, there have been 811 confirmed measles cases in England.\n\nWestern Australia, where 54 cases of measles have been recorded since the start of this year, is currently experiencing its worst outbreak of measles since 1997, according to Australian media."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/20/chaotic-culture-in-uk-government-led-to-more-covid-deaths-inquiry-finds","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"17:34:59+00:00","title":"‘Chaotic’ culture in UK government led to more COVID deaths, inquiry finds","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A major government inquiry into the UK’s pandemic response found that a 'toxic and chaotic' culture in the central government, driven by indecisive leadership and internal failures under former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, led to a delayed response to the initial wave of the pandemic.

United Kingdom’s government led to a delayed response to the COVID-19 pandemic that resulted in about 23,000 more deaths across the nation, a damning report from an inquiry into the government’s handling of the pandemic has found.\n\nThe inquiry, which former Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered in May 2021, delivered a blistering assessment ( PDF ) on Thursday of his government’s response to COVID-19, criticising his indecisive leadership, lambasting his Downing Street office for breaking their own rules and castigating his top adviser Dominic Cummings. The inquiry was chaired by former judge Heather Hallett.\n\n“The failure to appreciate the scale of the threat, or the urgency of response it demanded, meant that by the time the possibility of a mandatory lockdown was first considered it was already too late and a lockdown had become unavoidable,” the inquiry found. “At the centre of the UK government there was a toxic and chaotic culture.”\n\nThe global pandemic, which began in 2020, killed millions of people worldwide, with countries enforcing lockdowns in an attempt to stop the spread of the virus.\n\nThe UK went into lockdown on March 23, 2020, at which time it was “too little, too late,” the inquiry found, revealing that if the nation had gone into lockdown just a week earlier, on March 16, the number of deaths in the first wave of the pandemic up to July would have been reduced by about 23,000, or 48 percent.\n\n“Had the UK been better prepared, lives would have been saved, suffering reduced and the economic cost of the pandemic far lower,” the inquiry found.\n\nA failure to act sooner again, as cases rose later in the year, also led to further national lockdowns, Hallett’s inquiry found.\n\nA campaign group for bereaved families said “it is devastating to think of the lives that could have been saved under a different Prime Minister”.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from Johnson on the inquiry’s findings.\n\nThe UK recorded more than 230,000 deaths from COVID, a similar death rate to the United States and Italy, but higher than elsewhere in western Europe, and it is still recovering from the economic consequences.\n\n“Mr. Johnson should have appreciated sooner that this was an emergency that required prime ministerial leadership to inject urgency into the response,” the inquiry found.\n\nFollowing the release of the inquiry’s findings, Sir Ed Davey called on Kemi Badenoch, the leader of the Conservative Party, to apologise on behalf of the Conservatives.\n\n“As this report is published, my thoughts and prayers are with all those who lost loved ones during the pandemic, and everyone who suffered,” Davey said. “This report confirms the abject failure of the last Conservative government.”\n\nEllie Chowns, a Green Party MP for North Herefordshire, said the British people were “let down” by their government.\n\n“Families and communities – especially children – are still living with the consequences. It’s vital to learn from this report, and invest far more seriously in pandemic preparedness, so that Britain can be secure and resilient if – or when – we are again faced with such a challenge.”\n\nThe first cases of COVID-19  were detected  in Wuhan, China, in late 2019, and information from the country is seen as key to preventing future pandemics. As late as June 2025, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it was working to uncover the origin of the pandemic, with its work still incomplete, as critical information has “not been provided”.\n\n“We continue to appeal to China and any other country that has information about the origins of COVID-19 to share that information openly, in the interests of protecting the world from future pandemics,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in June.\n\nIn 2021, Tedros launched the WHO Scientific Advisory Group for the Origins of Novel Pathogens (SAGO), a panel of 27 independent international experts.\n\nMarietjie Venter, the group’s chair, said earlier this year that most scientific data supports the hypothesis that the new coronavirus jumped to humans from animals.\n\nBut she added that after more than three years of work, SAGO was unable to get the necessary data to evaluate whether or not COVID was the result of a lab accident, despite repeated requests for detailed information made to the Chinese government."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/layoffs-economy-inflation-verizon-1a9aac0c6482d5a9b35d6e630de688af","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"17:07:22+00:00","title":"Mass Corporate Layoffs Amid AI Shifts and Economic Uncertainty in 2025","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In early 2025, a wave of corporate layoffs has swept across major industries, driven by economic uncertainty, rising operational costs, and increased investments in artificial intelligence.

2025-11-20T17:07:22+00:00\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — It’s a tough time to be looking for a job . Amid wider economic uncertainty, some analysts have said that businesses are at a “no-hire, no fire” standstill. That’s caused many to limit new work to only a few specific roles, if not pause openings entirely. At the same time, sizable layoffs have continued to pile up — raising worker anxieties across sectors. Some companies have pointed to rising operational costs spanning from President Donald Trump’s barrage of new tariffs and shifts in consumer spending. Others cite corporate restructuring more broadly — or, as seen with big names like Amazon , are redirecting money to artificial intelligence. Federal employees have encountered additional doses of uncertainty, impacting worker sentiment around the job market overall. Shortly after Trump returned to office at the start of the year, federal jobs were cut by the thousands . And the record 43-day government shutdown also left many to work without paychecks . The impasse put key economic data on hold, too. In a delayed report released Thursday, the Labor Department said U.S. employers added a surprising 119,000 jobs in September. But unemployment rose to 4.4% — and other troubling details emerged, including revisions showing the economy actually lost 4,000 jobs in August. There’s also growing gender and racial disparities. The National Women’s Law Center notes women only accounted for 21,000 of September’s added jobs — and that Black women over the age of 20, in particular, saw unemployment climb to 7.5% for the month.

The government says it won’t release a full jobs report for October. Here are some of the largest job cuts announced recently: Verizon In November, Verizon began laying off more than 13,000 employees . In a staff memo announcing the cuts, CEO Dan Schulman said that the telecommunications giant needed to simplify operations and “reorient” the entire company. General Motors General Motors moved to lay off about 1,700 workers across manufacturing sites in Michigan and Ohio in late October, as the auto giant adjusts to slowing demand for electric vehicles . Hundreds of additional employees are reportedly slated for “temporary layoffs” at the start of next year. Paramount In long-awaited cuts just months after completing its $8 billion merger with Skydance , Paramount plans to lay off about 2,000 employees — about 10% of its workforce. Paramount initiated roughly 1,000 of those layoffs in late October, according to a source familiar with the matter. In November, Paramount also announced plans to eliminate 1,600 positions as part of divestitures of Televisión Federal in Argentina and Chilevision in Chile. And the company said another 600 employees had chosen voluntary severance packages as part of a coming push to return to the office full-time. Amazon Amazon said last month that it will cut about 14,000 corporate jobs , close to 4% of its workforce, as the online retail giant ramps up spending on AI while trimming costs elsewhere. A letter to employees said most workers would be given 90 days to look for a new position internally. UPS United Parcel Service has disclosed about 48,000 job cuts this year as part of turnaround efforts, which arrive amid wider shifts in the company’s shipping outputs. UPS also closed daily operations at 93 leased and owned buildings during the first nine months of this year. Target Target in October moved to eliminate about 1,800 corporate positions , or about 8% of its corporate workforce globally. The retailer said the cuts were part of wider streamlining efforts. Nestlé In mid-October, Nestlé said it would be cutting 16,000 jobs globally — as part of wider cost cutting aimed at reviving its financial performance amid headwinds like rising commodity costs and U.S. imposed tariffs . The Swiss food giant said the layoffs would take place over the next two years. Lufthansa Group In September, Lufthansa Group said it would shed 4,000 jobs by 2030 — pointing to the adoption of artificial intelligence , digitalization and consolidating work among member airlines. Novo Nordisk Also in September, Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk said it would cut 9,000 jobs , about 11% of its workforce. The company — which makes drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy — said the layoffs were part of wider restructuring, as it works to sell more obesity and diabetes medications amid rising competition. ConocoPhillips Oil giant ConocoPhillips announced plans in September to lay off up to a quarter of its workforce , as part of broader efforts from the company to cut costs. Between 2,600 and 3,250 workers were expected to be impacted, with most layoffs set to take place before the end of 2025. Intel Intel has moved to shed thousands of jobs — with the struggling chipmaker working to revive its business. In July, CEO Lip-Bu Tan said Intel expected to end the year with 75,000 “core” workers , excluding subsidiaries, through layoffs and attrition. That’s down from 99,500 core employees reported the end of last year. The company previously announced a 15% workforce reduction . Microsoft In May, Microsoft began laying off about 6,000 workers across its workforce. And just months later, the tech giant said it would be cutting 9,000 positions — marking its biggest round of layoffs seen in more than two years. The company has cited “organizational changes,” but the labor reductions also arrive as the company spends heavily on AI. Procter & Gamble In June, Procter & Gamble said it would cut up to 7,000 jobs over the next two years, 6% of the company’s global workforce. The maker of Tide detergent and Pampers diapers said the cuts were part of a wider restructuring — also arriving amid tariff pressures."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/20/after-israel-pms-trip-to-occupied-syria-is-a-deal-off-the-table","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"17:59:52+00:00","title":"How far are Israel, Syria from a deal, after Netanyahu’s buffer zone trip?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s visit to illegally occupied Syrian territory, including Mount Hermon, has intensified regional tensions and raised serious doubts about a potential security agreement between Israel and Syria.

appearance with Israel’s troops in illegally occupied territory in southern Syria has angered Damascus, and raised further doubts over whether a security deal between the two countries can be agreed.\n\nNetanyahu’s  Wednesday visit  – accompanied by several of his senior officials – signals that he is not planning to shift from his hardline position on Syria, despite encouragement from the United States.\n\nIsrael seized territory in the Syrian Golan Heights following the 1967 war and has held it ever since. However, following the fall of ousted Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in December 2024, Israel violated a 1974 agreement and again invaded its neighbour’s territory, occupying more land along the border as part of a “buffer zone”, including the strategically vital summit of Mount Hermon.\n\nIsrael was already bombing Syria before the fall of al-Assad, an ally of its regional enemy Iran. But instead of seeking to start on a new path with Syria, Israel has doubled down on its bombing campaign and increased the number of strikes this year, including in the capital Damascus, leading to the deaths of several Syrian soldiers and hitting the Ministry of Defence.\n\nAfter the  visit earlier this month  of Syria’s new President Ahmed al-Sharaa to Israel’s key ally in the White House, US President Donald Trump, hopes were high that an agreement could be reached. Al-Sharaa  has previously confirmed  that direct talks with Israel were under way to secure a permanent settlement.\n\nBut earlier this week, Israel’s Kan broadcaster quoted an unnamed Israeli government official as saying the talks were at a dead end. So what went wrong and why? And does Netanyahu’s trip to the occupied Syrian territory signal that he has no intention to make a deal?\n\nWhen Israel’s tanks first entered Syria in December 2024, it  expanded  its territorial footprint within Syria by around 400 square kilometres (155 sq miles), including Mount Hermon, which offers a vantage point over southern Syria and northern Israel.\n\nNetanyahu described the incursion as a “temporary defensive position”. However, as time has worn on, both Israel’s position on the Golan Heights and its rhetoric have grown more entrenched, with Defence Minister Israel Katz saying in March that Israel would continue its occupation of parts of Syria for an “unlimited amount of time”.\n\nIsrael has also chosen to position itself as the defender of the Druze and Kurdish ethnic minorities against a government it has attempted to paint as “extremist”.\n\nNeither government has issued a statement on why the talks have stalled.\n\nHowever, citing anonymous government sources, Israel’s public broadcaster, Kan, has claimed that talks broke down after Israel refused to withdraw its troops from Syrian territory without what it called a “comprehensive peace agreement”.\n\nDetails of what Israel might mean by a “comprehensive peace agreement” aren’t clear.\n\nIn September, leaked reports suggested that, as part of any peace agreement, Israel was demanding that Syria establish a demilitarised zone southwest of Damascus all the way up to the border with Israel. This would encompass a vast territory, including the governorates of Suwayda, Deraa, and Quneitra.\n\nIn return, Israel would gradually withdraw its forces from Syrian territory, apart from those on the summit of Mount Hermon.\n\nBut since then, it appears that Israel has hardened its stance, and reports in Israeli media indicate that the government’s position is that it will not withdraw from territory seized since December without a full peace deal with Syria – which is not on the table.\n\nThe news agency Reuters also reported that, at the last minute, Israel requested what negotiators termed a “humanitarian corridor”, allowing access between Israel and the heavily Druze populated southern governorate of Syria’s Suwayda.\n\nAccording to one source, a central principle of the Israeli proposal was maintaining an aerial corridor to Iran via Syria, which would allow for future Israeli strikes on Iran.\n\nNetanyahu told Israeli troops that their presence within Syrian territory was of “immense importance”, adding that their purpose there was vital in “safeguarding our Druze allies”, he said.\n\nSyria’s Druze minority provided a  pretext  for Israel’s last deployment to Syria in July, when Israel was accused of using the conflict between the group and local Bedouins to empower minority factions within the country as rival power centres to the recognised government in Damascus.\n\nExpanding buffer zones with neighbouring states ahead of opening diplomatic channels or contributing towards reconstruction following the often devastating attacks by its military forces appears to have become a central tenet of Israel’s regional strategy.\n\nIn Gaza, where Israel has killed almost  70,000  Palestinians, Israel is seeking to establish an extensive  buffer zone  as part of the US-imposed stabilisation deal that would reduce the already drastically limited space available to the enclave’s post-war population even further.\n\nIn Lebanon, where it killed more than  4,000  people during its invasion of October 2024, Israel has been accused of laying the groundwork to create a buffer zone within Lebanese territory, similar to that it is trying to establish in Gaza.\n\nThe Syrian Foreign Ministry branded the visit “illegitimate” and “a grave violation of Syria’s sovereignty and territorial integrity”.\n\n“This visit represents a new attempt to impose a fait accompli that contradicts relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions and falls within the occupation’s policies aimed at entrenching its aggression and continuing its violations of Syrian territory,” a ministry statement read.\n\nOther nations, including Jordan, France and Qatar, have also condemned the Israeli prime minister’s visit, branding it a threat to regional stability.\n\nIn the UN, spokesperson Stephane Dujarric was also  critical  of what he called Netanyahu’s “very public visit”, adding that it was “concerning, to say the least”.\n\nDujarric noted that UN Resolution 2799, recently passed by the UN Security Council, “called for the full sovereignty, unity, independence, and territorial integrity of Syria”.\n\nIt looks to have set them back and, to a degree, left Israel isolated.\n\nOn Wednesday, a senior UN official urged Israel to halt its activity in the occupied Golan Heights, cautioning that its actions were stoking regional tensions.\n\nNajat Rochdi, the UN deputy special envoy for Syria, told the UN Security Council that Israel’s operations were weakening the 1974 agreement establishing the buffer zone.\n\n“I received a strong appeal from [Syria’s] Foreign Minister [Asaad] al-Shaibani for the UN to act to put an end to these violations,” she said, urging the UN Security Council to assume its responsibilities under the 1974 agreement.\n\nIsrael’s principal ally, the US, along with many of the region’s powers, appears to have rejected Israeli characterisation of Syrian extremism.\n\nReceiving al-Sharaa at the White House earlier this month, US President Trump  praised  the Syrian leader, saying, “We’ll do everything we can to make Syria successful, because that’s part of the Middle East. We have peace now in the Middle East – the first time that anyone can remember that ever happening.”\n\nSaudi Arabia, Qatar and other Gulf countries have also been providing economic  support  to Syria since al-Assad’s ousting, with Saudi Arabia, a key focus of Israel and the US’s normalisation efforts, announcing a reconstruction programme as recently as September.\n\nIsrael appears to be following its standard playbook when dealing with its neighbours – use force, ask questions later, and refuse to compromise.\n\nIt knows it is the strongest military power in the region, but also believes it faces existential threats, and therefore largely does not want to make agreements that it believes will benefit rivals. In essence, Israel prefers to conduct business through force of arms rather than deal-making.\n\nAs well as maintaining its illegal occupation of Syrian territory, Israel has continued to occupy Lebanese territory and launch attacks against its neighbour despite entering into a  ceasefire  in November 2024.\n\nSpeaking to Al Jazeera earlier this year, writer, researcher, and founder of The Fire These Times podcast, Elia Ayoub,  said  that “The Israelis believe that having weaker neighbours, as in states that aren’t really able to function, is beneficial for them because, in that context, they’re the strongest actor.”\n\nWhether that means dividing Syria, or simply retaining a large buffer zone, is unclear – and will perhaps be determined by how things pan out."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/20/mamdani-says-he-will-stand-up-for-new-yorkers-in-trump-meeting","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"18:12:01+00:00","title":"Mamdani says he will ‘stand up for New Yorkers’ in Trump meeting","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Zohran Mamdani, the newly elected mayor of New York City, will meet with President Donald Trump at the White House on November 21, 2025, to discuss affordability and economic policy.

People say this is a cage, as they’re being pushed and squeezed into the western parts of Gaza.”\n\nThe Israeli military has not publicly commented on the reports that it has gone beyond the yellow line in violation of the ceasefire.\n\nThe move comes amid a surge in Israeli attacks across the Gaza Strip that have sown fear across the war-ravaged enclave.\n\nThe Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza said on Thursday morning that at least 32 Palestinians were killed in Israeli attacks over the past 24 hours and another 88 were wounded.\n\nMedics said an Israeli air strike on a house in Bani Suheila, a town east of Khan Younis, killed three people, including a baby girl, and wounded 15 others.\n\nIsrael has violated the truce nearly 400 times since it came into force on October 10, according to an  Al Jazeera analysis .\n\nA displaced Palestinian man, 36-year-old Mohammed Hamdouna, told the AFP news agency that people are being killed daily in continued shelling.\n\n“We are still living in tents. The cities are rubble, the crossings are still closed, and all the basic necessities of life are still lacking,” he said.\n\nLina Kuraz, a 33-year-old from the Tuffah neighbourhood east of Gaza City, also told AFP that she was worried about the full-blown war starting up again.\n\n“Every time we try to regain hope, the shelling starts again,” Kuraz said. “When will this nightmare end?”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/20/funeral-held-for-former-us-vice-president-iraq-war-architect-dick-cheney","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"19:44:15+00:00","title":"Funeral held for former US vice president, Iraq War architect Dick Cheney","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A bipartisan group of former U.S. political leaders, including former presidents George W.

He died at age 84.\n\nHe is best remembered for helping to spearhead the  invasion of Iraq  and crafting key policies during the so-called “war on terror”, including some that led to human rights abuses.\n\nAt Thursday’s funeral, a range of top officials lined the pews to offer their respects.\n\nThey included former Vice President Kamala Harris, former President  Joe Biden , ex-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former Vice President Mike Pence, who served during President Donald Trump’s first term.\n\nNotably absent was Trump himself: He and the current vice president, JD Vance, were reportedly not invited.\n\nCheney’s former boss Bush was among the speakers to pay tribute to the vice president for his legacy.\n\n“It’s something to be cherished when a man of his calibre has been your colleague and friend,” Bush said in his remarks.\n\n“We’re grateful for his good life, we honour his service, and we pray that somewhere up the trail we will meet him again.”\n\nThe sombre memorial made little mention of the war in Iraq, which  Cheney  played a central role in advancing through a campaign of false claims and deception.\n\nBorn in Nebraska and raised in Wyoming, Cheney was only 34 when he became chief of staff to President Gerald Ford. He would later spend a decade in the House of Representatives and serve as defence secretary to Bush’s father, George HW Bush.\n\nBut it was his time under the younger Bush’s presidency that would define his legacy.\n\nFollowing the attacks on the US on September 11, 2001, Cheney leveraged the vice presidency to promote an expansive vision of executive power.\n\nHe also advanced the false narrative that Iraq held “weapons of mass destruction” as justification for the US invasion of that country.\n\nDuring the US’s “war on terror”, he repeatedly defended measures such as torture, detention without due process, and domestic surveillance in the name of national security.\n\nUnder Bush and Cheney’s leadership, critics point out the US invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan destabilised the Middle East, leading to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people.\n\nThe Iraq War ended in 2011, and the conflict in Afghanistan stretched on for two decades, closing in 2021.\n\nThe resulting violence across the Middle East caused 940,000 direct deaths, including 432,000 civilians killed in the fighting. Millions more died from indirect causes related to the conflict, including disease and lack of healthcare infrastructure.\n\nCheney has largely defended his track record as vice president, despite accusations from human rights experts that he oversaw a campaign of  torture  against US prisoners.\n\nWhen asked in 2014 about his support for “enhanced interrogation tactics” like waterboarding, he denied that they were torture at all.\n\nCheney added he would “do it again” and called those who carried out the interrogations “heroes”.\n\nDespite his role as one of the most influential vice presidents in US history, Cheney had largely fallen out of favour with the Republican Party over the last 15 years.\n\nHe became further estranged from members of his party as he emerged as a vocal critic of President Trump, calling the current leader a “threat to our republic”.\n\nCheney denounced, for example, Trump’s efforts to undermine the results of the 2020 presidential election, which he lost to Biden.\n\nIn 2024, Cheney supported then-Vice President  Harris , a Democrat, over Trump’s re-election bid.\n\nHis daughter Liz Cheney served as one of two Republicans on a congressional committee investigating the attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, which was led by Trump supporters in protest of his 2020 loss.\n\nShe was ultimately ousted from her seat in the House of Representatives in a primary challenge from a pro-Trump candidate. She later  campaigned  alongside Harris in the 2024 presidential race.\n\n“To be in my dad’s company was to know safety and love and laughter and kindness,” Liz said in her remarks at his funeral on Thursday.\n\n“He was a giant to the end, a lion of a man, who loved and served this great republic.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/20/north-carolina-officials-say-us-border-patrol-has-ended-charlotte-operation","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"20:56:58+00:00","title":"North Carolina officials say US Border Patrol has ended Charlotte operation","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"North Carolina officials, including Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles and Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden, confirmed that the U.S. Border Patrol has ended its five-day 'Operation Charlotte’s Web' immigration crackdown in Charlotte, which began on November 15, 2025.

down, ending five days of immigration raids and protests.\n\nOn Thursday, Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles said that the United States Border Patrol had seemingly ended its crackdown on the Democrat-led city.\n\n“It appears that U.S. Border Patrol has ceased its operations in Charlotte. I’m relieved for our community and the residents, businesses, and all those who were targeted and impacted by this intrusion,” she  wrote  on social media.\n\n“As we move forward, it is essential that we come together — not as separate groups divided by recent events, but as one Charlotte community.”\n\nThe Mecklenburg County Sheriff’s Office also said federal officials had assured Sheriff Garry McFadden that they had concluded “ Operation Charlotte’s Web ” and that no further operations would occur on Thursday.\n\n“It is important to clarify that while the ‘Charlotte’s Web’ operation has ended, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) will continue to operate in Mecklenburg County as they always have,” a statement from the sheriff’s department said.\n\n“ICE maintains full authority to detain, apprehend, and take into custody any undocumented immigrant in accordance with federal law.”\n\nThe operation began  on November 15, when the administration of US President Donald Trump announced it was “surging resources” to Charlotte.\n\nIt justified the surge by accusing local officials of embracing “sanctuary” policies that allow undocumented people to “roam free on American streets”.\n\nDuring an update on Wednesday, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said it had made more than 250 arrests as of Tuesday night.\n\nImmigration efforts had also expanded to the state capital of Raleigh and surrounding areas during the operation.\n\nBut “Operation Charlotte’s Web” had faced fierce pushback from residents in Charlotte, the state’s largest city and a centre for tech businesses. More than 911,300 people call Charlotte home.\n\nHundreds of protesters, for example, gathered outside businesses like Manolo’s Bakery, which temporarily shut its doors to protect employees and customers from being targeted by the raids. Another protest took place outside a Home Depot where Border Patrol agents had gathered.\n\nStudents at East Mecklenburg High School, Northwest School of the Arts and other schools also staged a walkout in solidarity with the immigrant community.\n\nLocal media reported that school attendance on Monday dropped by nearly 15 percent, but it was unclear how many absences were due to protests, concern over immigration enforcement activity or seasonal trends like the flu.\n\nThe spike in immigration operations in the Charlotte area also raised concerns about human rights abuses, with locals recording scenes of car windows being smashed and individuals being tackled to the ground and bloodied.\n\nAs the surge of federal immigration operations winds down in Charlotte, a fresh wave of Border Patrol operations is expected in another southern city, New Orleans. That operation has been dubbed the “Swamp Sweep”.\n\nOther Democratic-led cities have also faced heightened immigration enforcement operations, leading to widespread concerns about the tactics being used and  whether human rights  are being upheld.\n\nThose cities include Los Angeles, Chicago, Memphis and Washington, DC.\n\nThe number of people in immigration detention hit a record high of 60,000 in August, as President Trump, a Republican, carries out a campaign of mass deportation across the US."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/21/russia-ukraine-war-list-of-key-events-day-1366","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"00:26:06+00:00","title":"Russia-Ukraine war: List of key events, day 1,366","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As of November 21, 2025, the Russia-Ukraine war has reached its 1,366th day, marking a significant milestone in a conflict that began in 2022.

Pregnant women are advised to consult a doctor before taking the medication.\n\nThe World Health Organization reiterated the point in September, noting that “no consistent association has been established” between the medication and autism, despite “extensive research”.\n\nBut claims to the contrary have already prompted efforts to limit the availability of Tylenol, a popular brand of acetaminophen, a fever- and pain-reducing medication.\n\nOn Tuesday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton launched a lawsuit accusing Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue, the companies behind the over-the-counter pain reliever, of deceptive practices.\n\nIn doing so, he reiterated misinformation shared by President Donald Trump and government officials like Kennedy.\n\n“By holding Big Pharma accountable for poisoning our people, we will help Make America Healthy Again,” Paxton said in a statement, giving a nod to Kennedy’s MAHA slogan.\n\nThe suit alleges that Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue violated Texas consumer protection laws by having “deceptively marketed Tylenol as the only safe painkiller for pregnant women”.\n\nIt was the latest instance of scientific misinformation being perpetuated by top officials. Both Trump and Kennedy have repeatedly spread scientific misinformation throughout their political careers.\n\nTrump linked autism and the painkiller during a news conference in September, without providing reputable scientific findings to back the claim.\n\n“[Using] acetaminophen – is that OK? – which is basically, commonly known as Tylenol, during pregnancy can be associated with a very increased risk of autism,” Trump said on September 22. “So taking Tylenol is not good. I’ll say it. It’s not good.”\n\nKennedy has offered his own sweeping statements about Tylenol and its alleged risks, despite having no professional medical background.\n\n“Anyone who takes this stuff during pregnancy, unless they have to, is irresponsible,” he said in a cabinet meeting on October 9.\n\nKennedy also mischaracterised studies on male circumcision earlier this month. He  falsely  said the studies showed an increase in autism among children who were “circumcised early”.\n\n“It’s highly likely because they’re given Tylenol,” he added.\n\nKenvue stressed in a statement on Tuesday that acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women, noting that high fevers and pain are potential risks to pregnancies if left untreated.\n\n“We stand firmly with the global medical community that acknowledges the safety of acetaminophen and believe we will continue to be successful in litigation as these claims lack legal merit and scientific support,” Kenvue said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/21/lebanon-arrests-alleged-drug-kingpin-sanctioned-by-us-state-department","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"01:58:58+00:00","title":"Lebanese army arrests country’s ‘most wanted’ drug trafficking suspect","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Lebanese army has arrested Noah Zaitar, the country’s most wanted drug trafficker, in an ambush in Baalbek, two years after he was sanctioned by the U.S. government for ties to Syrian narcotics networks and Hezbollah.

There are contacts, of course, but there is no process that could be called consultations,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.\n\nWhile Zelenskyy has signalled he is willing to work with the Trump administration on a ceasefire, Kyiv’s European allies have expressed scepticism.\n\n“Ukrainians want peace – a just peace that respects everyone’s sovereignty, a durable peace that can’t be called into question by future aggression,” French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said during a meeting of European Union foreign ministers in Brussels. “But peace cannot be a capitulation.”\n\nEU foreign policy head Kaja Kallas  said any peace proposal  would need support from Europe and Ukraine to move forward, with Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski saying that Europe – whose security is “at stake” – expects to be consulted on any potential deal.\n\n“I hope it’s not the victim that has restrictions on its ability to defend itself put on, but it’s the aggressor,” he said.\n\nZelenskyy is facing pressure to join the US-backed diplomatic initiative as Ukrainian troops continue to lose ground to Russian forces in the country’s east.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin  claimed  in October that Russian forces had seized almost 5,000 square kilometres (1,930sq miles) of Ukraine this year.\n\nOn September 25, the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, independently assessed the real figure to be closer to 3,434sq km (1,325sq miles).\n\nRussia’s General Staff said Thursday that Moscow’s forces had seized the northeastern Ukrainian city of Kupiansk and controlled large sections of the towns of Pokrovsk and Vovchansk – a claim Ukraine vigorously denied.\n\n“The General Staff of Ukraine’s armed forces hereby announces that Kupiansk is under the control of Ukraine’s defence forces,” the Ukrainian General Staff said in a late evening bulletin.\n\n“Also untrue are statements suggesting that 80 percent of Vovchansk in the Kharkiv region has been captured and 70 percent of the city of Pokrovsk.”\n\nThis week, a devastating Russian aerial assault on Ternopil in western Ukraine  killed at least 26 people  and wounded dozens more, Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko confirmed Thursday.\n\nZelenskyy said on Thursday that 22 people were still missing at the site of Wednesday’s attack on Ternopil when Moscow unleashed 476 drones and 48 missiles across Ukraine. The attack damaged energy infrastructure across seven Ukrainian regions, prompting nationwide restrictions on power consumption.\n\n“Every brazen attack against ordinary life indicates that the pressure on Russia [to stop the war] is insufficient,” Zelenskyy said on Telegram.\n\nThe bombardment coincided with Zelenskyy’s visit to Turkiye aimed at reviving peace talks with Russia following his European diplomatic mission.\n\n“We count on the strength of Turkish diplomacy, on [how] it’s understood in Moscow,” Zelenskyy said after his meeting on Wednesday with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/21/frida-kahlo-painting-sells-for-54-7m-breaking-record-for-female-artists","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"03:43:39+00:00","title":"Frida Kahlo painting sells for $54.7m, breaking record for female artists","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 1940 self-portrait by Frida Kahlo, titled 'El sueño (La cama)' or 'The Dream (The Bed)', sold for $54.7 million at Sotheby’s in New York, becoming the most expensive work by a female artist ever sold at auction.

geomagnetic storms, which are set to hit Earth this week and will produce bright, stunning displays of light known as auroras over parts of the United States, Canada and Europe, while also temporarily disrupting some communications.\n\nOn Tuesday, forecasters at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said significant geomagnetic disturbances had been recorded in the past few days, specifically in the form of several “coronal mass ejections” (CMEs), which occur when the sun issues bursts of energy. The agency issued a “G4” geomagnetic storm watch signal on a five-level scale, implying that severe storms could be expected.\n\nSome US residents have already shared videos online of northern lights – also known as aurora borealis – which will continue to appear over several US states on Wednesday.\n\nDid you catch the light show between the breaks in the clouds this evening?  #NorthernLights\n\nSpace Weather Center:  https://t.co/M5cIvJxUr1   pic.twitter.com/RiDXgF3BqI\n\n— NWS Reno (@NWSReno)  November 12, 2025\n\nHere’s what we know about the geomagnetic storms and why they occur.\n\nSolar storms occur as a result of sudden, eruptive disturbances on the sun.  A solar storm becomes a geomagnetic storm when it reaches the Earth.\n\nSolar storms can occur in two ways. One way is in the form of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which are sudden swellings of gases on the sun that burst from the sun and travel at more than 1 million mph (1.6 million km/h) towards Earth. Depending on how fast they travel, these can reach the Earth anytime between 15 hours and several days.\n\nSolar storms can also emerge in the form of solar flares, which are sudden eruptions of electromagnetic radiation reaching the Earth from the sun. These travel at the speed of light, reaching Earth in approximately eight minutes, and can last for several minutes or even hours.\n\nBoth phenomena happen when magnetic fields on the sun realign. They often, but not always, occur together.\n\nWhile CMEs can appear through solar telescopes as immense clouds of particles being hurled in a single direction, solar flares appear as bright flashes of light moving in multiple directions. As NASA describes it, think of it as the difference between a cannonball shot in one direction and the flash of a muzzle.\n\nThe NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center said on Tuesday that at least three CMEs would pass over Earth, most likely between Tuesday and Thursday.\n\nIn an update early on Wednesday, the agency noted that two of the CMEs, which first erupted on November 9 and 10, had already impacted Earth. They “packed quite a punch”, Shawn Dahl, a scientist with the agency, said in a video update posted on X.\n\nDahl said the storms were “profoundly more strong than we anticipated” and that while the agency had initially forecasted a G2-level storm, the storms were two levels stronger, at G4.\n\nA third, energetic CME, moving faster than the others, is now set to hit Earth on Wednesday, approximately at midday Eastern Time (17:00 GMT), the space agency said. That one erupted early on November 11 and caused temporary radio blackouts across Africa and Europe, according to Space.com, a leading space exploration publication.\n\nWhen strong bursts of energy erupting from the Sun’s surface as solar flares or CMEs hurtle towards Earth, the highly charged particles they carry collide with gases in the Earth’s upper atmosphere and transfer energy to them, causing the gases to glow and resulting in stunning displays of colourful lights, from emerald greens to intense pinks.\n\nKnown as aurora borealis, those displays can be seen from the Northern Hemisphere, hence the term “northern lights”. “Southern lights” or aurora australis are displays which can be seen in the Southern Hemisphere, although far fewer people inhabit the areas from which they are visible. The lights are only visible close to the poles because the Earth’s magnetic fields, which are strongest at the poles, guide the sun’s charged particles towards them.\n\nLight displays have become more common in recent months because the sun is currently at the maximum phase of an 11-year activity cycle.\n\nEvery 11 years, the sun’s poles swap places, causing intense magnetic activity. This period, called solar maximum, can last for several months. Scientists speculate that the end of the current cycle began last year and will continue at least through to the end of this year.\n\nIn May 2024, the strongest geomagnetic storm in two decades hit Earth and caused dazzling light displays across the US, the United Kingdom and Germany.\n\nThe northern lights shot with my iPhone (just this second) in Boulder, Colorado. This is a very impressive event!  pic.twitter.com/vkHS00PMLt\n\n— Dr. Ryan French (@RyanJFrench)  November 12, 2025\n\nSeveral countries have issued aurora alerts, with some residents already reporting brilliant colours in the sky on Tuesday night.\n\nBrightness and visibility usually depend on what time of day the solar bursts arrive in the Earth’s atmosphere and how they interact with it. Experts recommend leaving brightly-lit areas to see the lights better.\n\nAccording to NOAA, the lights have already appeared or are likely to appear above several areas in the US, including the states of Illinois (Chicago), Colorado, Massachusetts (Boston), Washington (Seattle), California (San Francisco, Los Angeles), Oregon (Portland), Texas (Dallas), Georgia (Atlanta), North Dakota (Bismarck), New York, Wyoming (Cheyenne), North Carolina (Raleigh) and Iowa.\n\nJust keeps going and these are just holding phone in long exposure mode of 3 seconds. Amazing display of Northern Lights captured in Carlow.  pic.twitter.com/ws2JQWUcs3\n\n— Carlow Weather (@CarlowWeather)  November 12, 2025\n\nOther sightings are expected or have been reported in\n\nNot directly to humans, because Earth’s atmosphere protects us from radiation.\n\nHowever, the bursts of energy could temporarily disrupt communication systems, potentially affecting GPS navigation, radio communications, and satellites, including air traffic control radio and satellites in space. The intense activity could also temporarily disrupt power grids.\n\nOn rare occasions, solar eruptions can be damaging. A severe solar storm in September 1859 caused sparks and fires in telegraph stations across Europe and North America. Known as the Carrington Event, those storms were the most intense in recorded history.\n\nIn August 1972, powerful geomagnetic events caused widespread electric and communications disruptions in the US and accidentally detonated US naval mines positioned in Vietnam.\n\nAccording to Dahl of the NOAA, the agency has alerted US air traffic officials, and a planned space launch, the details of which have not been disclosed, is likely to be cancelled. Power grid officials have also been alerted, he said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/4/scientists-watch-flare-with-10-trillion-suns-light-from-massive-black-hole","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"15:09:09Z","title":"Scientists watch flare with 10 trillion suns’ light from massive black hole","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Scientists have observed the most energetic flare ever recorded from a supermassive black hole, which briefly emitted light equivalent to 10 trillion suns.

watch flare with 10 trillion suns’ light from massive black hole\n\nScientists have documented the most energetic flare ever observed emanating from a supermassive black hole, a cataclysmic event that briefly shone with the light of 10 trillion suns.\n\nThe new findings were published on Tuesday in the journal Nature Astronomy, with astronomer Matthew Graham of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) leading the study.\n\nThe phenomenal burst of energy was likely triggered when an unusually large star wandered too close to the black hole and was violently shredded and swallowed.\n\n“However it happened, the star wandered close enough to the supermassive black hole that it was ‘spaghettified’ – that is, stretched out to become long and thin, due to the gravity of the supermassive black hole strengthening as you get very close to it. That material then spiralled around the supermassive black hole as it fell in,” said astronomer and study co-author KE Saavik Ford.\n\nThe supermassive black hole was unleashed by a black hole roughly 300 million times the mass of the sun residing inside a faraway galaxy, about 11 billion light years from Earth. A light year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km).\n\nThe star, estimated to be between 30 and 200 times the mass of the sun, was turned into a stream of gas that heated up and shined intensely as it spiralled into oblivion.\n\nAlmost every large galaxy, including our Milky Way, has a supermassive black hole at its centre. But scientists still aren’t sure how they form.\n\nFirst spotted in 2018 by the Palomar Observatory, operated by the Caltech, the flare took about three months to reach its peak brightness, becoming roughly 30 times more luminous than any previously recorded event of its kind. It is still ongoing, but diminishing in luminosity, with the entire process expected to take about 11 years to complete.\n\nBecause of how far away the black hole is located, observing the flash gives scientists a rare glimpse into the universe’s early epoch. Studying these immense, distant black holes helps researchers better understand how they form, how they influence their local stellar neighbourhoods, and the fundamental interactions that shaped the cosmos we know today."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/tag/science-and-technology/","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00Z","title":"Today's latest from Al Jazeera – Science and Technology","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article covers a range of global developments in science, technology, and policy.

We are merely asking that they use that same technology to keep children safe online,” Wells said.\n\n“We have met with several of the social media platforms in the past month so that they understand there is no excuse for failure to implement this law,” Wells told reporters in Canberra.\n\n“We want children to have a childhood, and we want parents to have peace of mind,” she said.\n\nSocial media platforms have had 12 months to prepare for the ban since  Australia passed its landmark  online safety legislation in November last year.\n\nInitial discussions focused primarily around Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, X and YouTube, but the list was later expanded, and Wells said the list could continue to change.\n\nWhile more than 140 Australian and international academics signed an open letter to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese last year opposing the age limit ban as a “blunt” instrument,  Canberra’s move  is being closely watched by countries that share concerns about the impacts of online platforms on children.\n\n“Delaying children’s access to social media accounts gives them valuable time to learn and grow, free of the powerful, unseen forces of harmful and deceptive design features such as opaque algorithms and endless scroll,” eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said.\n\nInman Grant said she would work with academics to evaluate the impact of the ban, including whether children sleep or interact more or become more physically active as a result of the restrictions on using social media.\n\n“We’ll also look for unintended consequences, and we’ll be gathering evidence” so others can learn from Australia’s ban, Inman Grant said.\n\nCritics have questioned how the restrictions will be enforced because users cannot be “compelled” to submit government IDs for an age check, according to a government fact sheet.\n\nDiscussions are under way with platforms about how to comply with the new rules, the commissioner said, while failure to comply could lead to civil fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars (US$32.1m).\n\nNews that Australia would add more names to the list of banned platforms came as French authorities said they had opened an investigation into the social media platform TikTok and the risks of its algorithms pushing young people into suicide.\n\nParis prosecutor Laure Beccuau said the probe was in response to a parliamentary committee’s request to open a criminal inquiry into TikTok’s possible responsibility for endangering the lives of its young users.\n\nBeccuau said a report by the committee had noted “insufficient moderation of TikTok, its ease of access by minors and its sophisticated algorithm, which could push vulnerable individuals towards suicide by quickly trapping them in a loop of dedicated content”.\n\nTikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Paris police cybercrime unit will look into the offence of providing a platform for “propaganda in favour of products, objects, or methods recommended as means of committing suicide”, which is punishable by three years in prison.\n\nThe unit will also look into the offence of enabling “illegal transactions by an organised gang”, punishable by 10 years in prison and a fine of 1 million euros ($1.2m).\n\nWith more than 1.5 billion users worldwide, TikTok, owned by China-based ByteDance, has come under fire from governments in Europe and the United States in recent years.\n\nConcerns raised over the platform have included content encouraging suicide, self-harm or an unhealthy body image as well as its potential use for foreign political interference.\n\nA TikTok spokesman told the French news agency AFP in September that the company “categorically rejects the deceptive presentation” by French MPs, saying it was being made a “scapegoat” for broader societal issues."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/7/why-are-scientists-rushing-to-study-a-comet-from-deep-space","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"07:49:12+00:00","title":"Why are scientists rushing to study a comet from deep space?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Scientists are urgently studying 3I/ATLAS, the third interstellar comet to enter our solar system, which was first detected in July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope team in Chile.

star system that entered the solar system this year, and which has already swung past Mars.\n\nDubbed 3I/ATLAS, the comet poses no threat to Earth or its neighbouring planets, but has aroused immense interest as space agencies train their sights on what is only one of three interstellar objects detected by scientists.\n\nHere is what we know about the object that is intriguing scientists:\n\nThe comet is only the third interstellar object ever recorded to pass through Earth’s solar system from another star. Comets are celestial bodies made of ice, dust and gas which orbit the sun. They are considered remnants from when the solar system formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago.\n\n3I/ATLAS was first discovered in July by scientist Larry Dennau of the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope team, located in Rio Hurtado, Chile. The project is funded by NASA and is operated by researchers at the University of Hawaii’s Institute for Astronomy.\n\nBefore this, 1I/’Oumuamua, a rocky, cigar-shaped object, was discovered by Canada’s Robert Weryk using the Pan-STARRS telescope at Haleakala Observatory, Hawaii, in October 2017.\n\nIn August 2019, 2I/Borisov, a “rogue comet” – one that is not bound by gravity to any particular star system, so is travelling freely through space – was discovered by the Crimean astronomer and telescope maker Gennadiy Borisov at the MARGO Observatory in Crimea.\n\nComets are typically named after their human or station founders. The “I” in their names stands for “interstellar”, meaning that it has originated from another solar system.\n\nIt zipped past Mars earlier in October, coming within 29 million km (18 million miles) of the red planet at a breakneck speed of 310,000km/h (193,000mph).\n\nThe comet made its closest approach to the sun at the end of October and is expected to pass closest to Earth in December, when it will be about 270 million km (170 million miles) away, according to NASA. It will still be farther from Earth than the sun, which is 150 million km (93 million miles) away.\n\nA host of spacecraft and other assets have already set eyes on the celestial visitor, particularly as its current trajectory has hidden it behind the sun, making it untrackable from Earth for now. NASA notes that it will reappear on the other side of the sun by early December 2025.\n\nScientists are eager to understand more about the comet’s actual size and physical properties.\n\nAside from the Hubble telescope, other space assets owned by NASA will track, or are already tracking, the comet and relaying information about it, including:\n\nSeparately, the ESA’s Juice spacecraft, launched in 2023 and heading to Jupiter and its icy moons, will also keep an eye on the zipping interloper throughout November.\n\nUsing these multiple resources, researchers have been able to capture clear enough images of the object to determine that the object is indeed a comet, as indicated by the hyperbolic shape of its orbital path, that is, the fact that the object does not follow a closed orbital path around the sun, according to NASA.\n\nThe NASA Hubble Space Telescope first captured images in July showing that the comet has a teardrop-shaped cocoon of dust coming off its solid, icy nucleus, according to the agency.\n\nObservations by the Hubble Space Telescope put the comet’s nucleus at no more than 5.6 km (3.5 miles) across. It could be as small as 440 metres (1,444 feet), according to NASA.\n\n3I/Atlas’s coma – the fuzzy halo which appears around comets – is full of carbon dioxide, meaning it must have formed somewhere very cold, and therefore quite far from its star, Darryl Seligman, a planetary scientist at Michigan State University, told US Magazine, Scientific American."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/21/more-details-of-us-plan-for-ukraine-emerge-sees-territory-ceded-to-russia","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"03:32:30+00:00","title":"More details of US plan for Ukraine emerge, sees territory ceded to Russia","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 28-point peace plan backed by U.S. President Donald Trump has emerged, proposing significant territorial concessions to Russia, including the recognition of Crimea, Luhansk, and Donetsk as de facto Russian territories.

from a 28-point peace plan backed by United States President Donald Trump aimed at ending Russia’s four-year war on Ukraine, with several media outlets and officials confirming that the plan, which has yet to be officially published, appears to favour Russia.\n\nDetails of the plan also come after US ambassador to the United Nations, Mike Waltz, told the UN Security Council on Thursday afternoon that the US had offered “generous terms for Russia, including sanctions relief”.\n\n“The United States has invested at the highest levels, the president of the United States personally, to end this war,” Waltz told the council.\n\nThe AFP news agency reported on Friday that the plan, which the US views as a “working document”, says that “Crimea, Lugansk [Luhansk] and Donetsk will be recognised as de facto Russian, including by the United States”.\n\nThis corresponds with an  earlier report  from US media outlet Axios.\n\nThe Associated Press (AP) news agency also reported on Friday that the plan would require Ukraine to surrender the Donbas, which includes the Luhansk and Donetsk regions that Ukraine currently partly holds.\n\nUnder the draft, Moscow would hold all the eastern Donbas region, even though approximately 14 percent still remains in Ukrainian hands, AP reported.\n\nAFP and AP also confirmed Axios’s earlier report that the plan would require Ukraine to limit the size of its military.\n\nAccording to AFP, the plan specifically says that the army would be limited to 600,000 personnel. Ukraine is estimated to currently have just under 900,000 active duty military staff.\n\nUkrainian member of parliament Oleksiy Goncharenko shared a document showing what appeared to be the full 28-point peace plan with his 223,000 followers on the Telegram messaging app, late on Thursday, Ukraine time.\n\nRussia’s state TASS news agency also reported on details included in the document shared by Goncharenko, saying it “purportedly represents a Ukrainian translation of 28 points of the new American plan for a peace settlement in Ukraine”.\n\nNew details included in the document shared by Goncharenko include that “Ukraine has the right to EU [European Union] membership” and that the “United States will work with Ukraine to jointly restore, develop, modernise, and operate Ukraine’s gas infrastructure, including pipelines and storage facilities”.\n\nThe document also states that Ukraine’s “Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant will be commissioned under [UN nuclear agency] IAEA supervision, and the electricity generated will be shared equally between Russia and Ukraine in a 50:50 ratio”.\n\nThe text of the document shared by Goncharenko also states that “Ukrainian forces withdraw from the part of the Donetsk region that they currently control, and this withdrawal zone will be considered a neutral demilitarised buffer zone”.\n\nHanding over territory to Russia would be deeply unpopular in Ukraine and would also be illegal under Ukraine’s constitution. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly ruled out such a possibility.\n\nThe AFP news agency also reported that, according to the plan, European fighter jets would be based in Poland specifically to protect Ukraine.\n\nHowever, Kyiv would have to concede that no NATO troops would be stationed in Ukraine and that it would agree never to join the military alliance.\n\nAdditional details reported by AP include that Russia would commit to making no future attacks on Ukraine, something the White House views as a concession by Moscow.\n\nIn addition, $100bn in frozen Russian assets would be dedicated to rebuilding Ukraine, AP reported.\n\nRussia would also be re-admitted to the G8 group of nations and be integrated back into the global economy under the plan, according to AFP.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Thursday that both Ukrainians and Russians have had input into the plan, which she said US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and US special envoy Steve Witkoff have been quietly working on for a month."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/7/james-watson-who-co-discovered-dna-double-helix-dies-at-97","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"22:44:26Z","title":"James Watson, who co-discovered DNA double helix, dies at 97","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"James Watson, who co-discovered the double helix structure of DNA with Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins and shared the 1962 Nobel Prize in medicine, has died at the age of 97.

How will ‘limited’ US nuclear tests avoid any explosions?\n\nUnited States Energy Secretary Chris Wright says planned nuclear tests will be “noncritical” and will not feature any nuclear explosions for now.\n\nThis clarification on Sunday came three days after President Donald Trump announced he had instructed the Department of Defense to “immediately” restart  testing of US nuclear weapons .\n\n“I think the tests we’re talking about right now are system tests,” Wright said on the Fox News show The Sunday Briefing.\n\n“These are not nuclear explosions. These are what we call noncritical explosions.”\n\nWright explained that for now, only the components of nuclear weapons will be tested to ensure they work properly and can trigger a nuclear explosion. He said these tests will be conducted on new systems to ensure that replacement nuclear weapons are improvements on earlier models.\n\n“With our science and our computation power, we can simulate incredibly accurately exactly what will happen in a nuclear explosion,” Wright said. “Now, we simulate what were the conditions that delivered that and, as we change bomb designs, what will they deliver.”\n\nAccording to the website of the Washington, DC-based nonpartisan organisation Arms Control Association, several nonnuclear explosive techniques can be used for nuclear weapon development, monitoring and maintenance. These can also include “subcritical” experiments, which use plutonium but avoid nuclear chain reactions.\n\n“In this context, ‘noncritical’ nuclear tests involve testing of nuclear weapons delivery systems or components but not the detonation of a nuclear warhead,” Georgia Cole, a research analyst at the International Security Programme at Chatham House, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Noncritical tests typically take place in laboratories or testing facilities, often using advanced computer simulations to assess the safety and reliability of nuclear warheads without detonation. There are also ‘subcritical’ tests, which are nonnuclear explosions carried out underground, often in former nuclear test sites.”\n\nOn Thursday, Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform: “Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis.” Trump signed an executive order in September to rename the Department of Defense the Department of War.\n\nTrump added in his post that while the US has “more Nuclear Weapons than any other country”, China “will be even within 5 years”.\n\nTrump justified his testing decision by citing China’s rapid build-up of its nuclear arsenal. The announcement came minutes before Trump’s  meeting  with Chinese President Xi Jinping which resulted in a truce on tariffs and some Chinese export restrictions of rare earth metals.\n\nOn Sunday, during an appearance on the CBS News programme 60 Minutes, Trump said in reference to nuclear weapons: “Russia’s testing, and China’s testing, but they don’t talk about it. You know, we’re an open society. We’re different. We talk about it. We have to talk about it.”\n\nTrump added: “We’re gonna test because they test and others test. And certainly North Korea’s been testing. Pakistan’s been testing.”\n\nHowever, none of the countries Trump mentioned has openly conducted nuclear weapons tests in recent years, and he did not provide any evidence to support his claims. It is also unclear why he believes China could catch up with the far larger US arsenal of nuclear warheads in just five years.\n\n“There is no credible evidence that Russia, China or Pakistan are conducting explosive nuclear tests. The only country to have tested a nuclear weapon in the 21st century is North Korea, which has observed a self-declared moratorium since 2018,” Cole said.\n\n“While all nuclear-armed states routinely test their delivery systems, such as missiles, there is no indication that any have resumed nuclear detonations.”\n\nNine states have nuclear arms: the US, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel.\n\nAccording to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) yearbook report published in January, Russia has the highest number of total warheads at 4,309.\n\nRussia is followed by the US, which has 3,700 warheads. China has 600. France has 290. The UK has 225. India has 180. Pakistan has 170. Israel has 90, and North Korea has 50.\n\nA SIPRI report from June stated that China’s nuclear arsenal has been growing more rapidly than any other country’s, increasing by about 100 warheads every year since 2023. A report published by the Pentagon in December estimated that China would likely have 1,000 nuclear weapons by 2030.\n\nThe US has retired 1,477 nuclear warheads while Russia has retired 1,150. A retired warhead is one that has been removed from a country’s military arsenal and is awaiting dismantlement. According to a report published in March by the Federation of American Scientists, a US-based think tank, the retired warheads “are still relatively intact”, however.\n\n“In some cases, retired warheads could technically be restored, depending on how far they are through the dismantlement process. However, this can be a lengthy and resource-intensive process. More commonly, states may reuse components from older warheads in the production or refurbishment of a new weapon,” Cole said.\n\nThe US  began testing nuclear weapons  in 1945 with the first detonation taking place over New Mexico’s desert. The last time it tested nuclear weapons was more than 30 years ago in 1992. In total, the US has conducted 1,032 nuclear tests, according to the United Nations.\n\nThe Soviet Union conducted 715 nuclear tests – the last one in 1990. Russia, which inherited the Soviet nuclear arsenal, has not conducted any nuclear tests.\n\nChina has conducted 45 tests and last tested nuclear weapons in 1996.\n\nFrance last tested nuclear weapons in 1996. It conducted 210 tests from 1945 to 1996. The UK conducted 45 nuclear tests from 1952 with the last one conducted in 1991.\n\nMost countries  have ceased nuclear weapons testing after signing the global Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which was introduced in 1996.\n\nSince then, 10 nuclear tests have taken place: two by India and two by Pakistan in 1998 and six by North Korea in 2006, 2009, 2013, 2016 (twice) and 2017, according to the UN. India, Pakistan and North Korea have not signed the CTBT.\n\nThe US did sign the CTBT in 1996 but did not ratify it. Russia signed the CTBT in 1996 and ratified it in 2000, but in 2023, President Vladimir Putin withdrew Russia’s ratification of the treaty.\n\nWhen a country signs a treaty, it signals its general agreement with the treaty’s terms and its intention to adhere to it in the future. Only upon ratification does the treaty become legally binding for that country under international law.\n\nPolitical and scientific authorities in the US have asserted that the US does not need to conduct new nuclear tests.\n\nThe National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) is a semiautonomous agency within the US Department of Energy. The agency oversees nuclear weapons security, maintenance and stockpile stewardship. The NNSA has repeatedly made it clear that the US does not need new tests.\n\nThe agency’s new administrator, Brandon Williams, said during his Senate confirmation hearing in April: “The United States continues to observe its 1992 nuclear test moratorium and since 1992 has assessed that the deployed nuclear stockpile remains safe, secure and effective without nuclear explosive testing.”\n\nWilliams added that every year, national security lab directors and the commander of the US Strategic Command review the nuclear stockpile to decide if underground nuclear testing is necessary. Previous NNSA Administrator Jill Hruby also stated that new testing was not necessary, according to a 2023 interview with the Arms Control Association.\n\nIf the US breaks this moratorium on testing nuclear weapons – rather than just their components – other countries are likely to follow suit, experts said.\n\n“If the US were to resume explosive nuclear testing, other powers would almost certainly respond in kind. Russia has already stated that it would mirror any US tests, and such moves could prompt China and North Korea to follow. The result would be the collapse of a 30-year moratorium on nuclear testing, undoing decades of restraint and sharply increasing global nuclear risks,” Cole said.\n\nShe added that Wright’s clarification about the tests being noncritical is an important one. “Had [Trump] been referring to explosive tests, as many initially assumed, that would represent a dramatic policy shift and a serious escalation in nuclear tensions.”"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ceq0q3e2j17o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"01:50:48.881+00:00","title":"Vietnam: At least 41 dead as relentless rains flood central region","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Relentless rains have caused severe flooding in central Vietnam, killing at least 41 people and leaving over 52,000 homes submerged.

bid\n\nTurkiye will host next year’s COP31 summit in the city of Antalya, ending a long standoff with Australia over the location of the top United Nations climate meeting.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced on Thursday morning that Australia had reached an arrangement with Turkiye to host negotiations in the lead-up to the 2026 UN climate meeting along with Pacific nations while Turkiye will assume the presidency of the official meeting.\n\n“What we’ve come up with is a big win for both Australia and [Turkiye],” Albanese told the Australian public broadcaster ABC Radio Perth.\n\nThe announcement comes as  this year’s COP30 climate summit  in the Brazilian city of Belem is due to close on Friday.\n\nAustralia had been pushing to host COP31 next year as a “Pacific COP” alongside low-lying South Pacific nations, which are increasingly threatened by rising seas and climate-fuelled disasters.\n\nDespite Australia’s efforts, Turkiye refused to back down in its bid to host the summit.\n\nTurkiye had said that as an emerging economy, it would promote solidarity between rich and poor countries at its summit, which would have a more global rather than regional focus.\n\nTurkiye will now have just 12 months to plan the meeting at the Antalya Expo Center due to the unusually long process to secure hosting duties and the lack of procedures in place to handle a situation in which two countries wanted to host at the same time.\n\nThe presidency of the  Conference of the Parties (COP)  to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change traditionally rotates among five regions: Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, Central and Eastern Europe, and Western Europe and others.\n\nAustralia and Turkiye both fit within the latter category of Western Europe and others, meaning that Australia will now have to wait another five years until it can bid to host the meeting again.\n\nEthiopian Minister for Planning and Development Fitsum Assefa Adela announced last week that her country had already secured the support of African negotiators to host COP32 in 2027.\n\nPapua New Guinea (PNG) quickly voiced frustration with Australia for dropping its bid to cohost the COP with its Pacific island neighbours.\n\n“We are all not happy and disappointed it’s ended up like this,” PNG Foreign Minister Justin Tkatchenko told the AFP news agency.\n\n“What has COP achieved over the years? Nothing,” Tkatchenko said. “It’s just a talk fest and doesn’t hold the big polluters accountable.”\n\nAustralian Senator Steph Hodgins-May from the Australian Greens party said Australia’s withdrawal from hosting the meeting reflected the current Labor government’s “continued coal and gas approvals” as Australia continues to increase its exports of  fossil fuels .\n\n“This is extremely disappointing, but it shows that the world recognises Australia’s significant role in making dangerous climate change worse,” May said.\n\nAccording to the International Energy Agency, both Australia and Turkiye are heavily dependent on coal, oil and gas for energy, but both countries have also been making progress in renewable energy.\n\nAustralia’s federal Labor government had hoped to showcase renewable energy progress in the state of South Australia by hosting the conference in the state’s capital, Adelaide.\n\nHowever, the proposal was complicated by the city’s struggle to cope with a significant toxic algal bloom that has been taking place offshore for eight months.\n\nAlgal blooms are one of many complications caused by warming oceans, an aspect of climate change that climate scientists and other experts said can be improved only by rapidly reducing dependence on fossil fuels."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly1ypqlle0o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"03:42:02.958+00:00","title":"Zelensky ready for 'honest work' with US to end Ukraine war","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has expressed openness to engaging in 'honest work' with the United States on a draft peace plan aimed at ending the war with Russia.

We agreed that our teams will work on the points to ensure it's all genuine.\"\n\nThe statement came after a meeting in Kyiv on Thursday between Zelensky and senior US military figures, including US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll, army chief of staff Gen Randy George and top US army commander in Europe Gen Chris Donahue.\n\nDespite Kyiv's tepid reaction to the draft, Zelensky said he \"appreciated the efforts of President Trump and his team to return security to Europe\" – perhaps a way to keep the US president onside despite his administration's apparent soft approach to Russia.\n\nIn his nightly address on Thursday, Zelensky said Ukraine needs a \"worthy peace,\" and that the \"dignity of the Ukrainian people\" must be respected.\n\nWhen asked if Europe was involved in the process of drafting the plan, EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas, said: \"Not that I know of.\"\n\n\"For any plan to work, it needs Ukrainians and Europeans on board,\" she added.\n\nMoscow downplayed the significance of the plan, which is rumoured to include 28 points.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that while there had been \"contacts\" with the US there was \"no process that could be called 'consultations'\".\n\nPeskov warned that any peace deal would have to address the \"root causes of the conflict\" - a phrase Moscow has used as shorthand for a series of maximalist demands which, to Ukraine, are tantamount to surrender.\n\nUK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said: \"The future of Ukraine must be determined by Ukraine and we must never lose sight of that principle underpinning the just and lasting peace that we all want to see.\"\n\nSince starting his second term earlier this year, Trump has launched into various initiatives aimed at ending the war in Ukraine, including a bilateral summit with Putin in Alaska, several visits by his envoy Witkoff to Moscow, and rounds of talks with Zelensky and other Western leaders.\n\nBut as the fourth anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine nears, the two sides remain deeply at odds over how to end the conflict.\n\nWhile Ukraine has become adept at targeting Russian military infrastructure and energy facilities with long-range drones, Moscow's attacks on Ukrainian targets continue unabated.\n\nLate on Thursday, a Russian attack on the Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia killed at least five people, according to the regional governor.\n\nEarlier this week, at least 26 people were killed in a Russian missile and drone attack on blocks of flats in Ukraine's western city of Ternopil. Another 17 people were still missing at the site on Thursday, Zelensky said as he offered his condolences."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/20/india-says-cop30-should-be-about-climate-adaptation-but-dries-up-key-fund","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"05:08:16+00:00","title":"India wants COP30 to focus on climate adaptation, but dries up own fund","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article details how India is facing escalating climate-related disasters that are displacing millions of people across the country—from landslides in Kashmir to floods in Bihar and coastal erosion in Odisha.

night of September 2, Shabir Ahmad’s home was swallowed by mud and swept into the river after relentless rains triggered a landslide in Sarh village in Indian-administered Kashmir’s Reasi district.\n\n“I had been building my house brick by brick since 2016. It was my life’s work. Only less than a year ago, I had finished constructing the second floor, and now there is nothing,” the 36-year-old father of three children told Al Jazeera.\n\nAhmad’s was among nearly 20 houses in Sarh lost to the Chenab River that night, including one belonging to his brother, as dozens of families helplessly watched their farmlands, shops and other properties worth millions of rupees vanish without a trace.\n\n“We don’t even have one inch of land left to stand on,” said Ahmad from a government school in Sarh, where his family and other villagers were sheltering after the deluge.\n\nThe tragedy at Sarh was among the latest of increasingly frequent climate disasters across India that destroy lives and livelihoods, and displace millions of people to an uncertain future.\n\nAccording to the Geneva-based Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC), climate-related disasters forced more than 32 million people from their homes in India between 2015 and 2024, with 5.4 million displacements recorded in 2024 alone – the highest in 12 years. This makes India one of the three nations most affected by  internal displacements  due to climate change in that period, with China and the Philippines being the top two.\n\nMoreover, in the first six months of 2025, more than 160,000 people were displaced across India due to natural disasters, as the country received above-average rainfall, triggering huge floods and landslides, and submerging hundreds of villages and cities.\n\nTo help millions of people like Ahmad who are vulnerable to the climate crisis, India’s Ministry for Environment, Forest and Climate Change launched a National Adaptation Fund on Climate Change (NAFCC) in 2015. Its goal was to finance projects that help communities cope with floods, droughts, landslides, and other climate-related stresses across India.\n\nManaged by the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), the flagship scheme supported interventions in agriculture, water management, forestry, coastal protection, and climate-resilient infrastructure. Between 2015 and 2021, it financed more than two dozen projects, benefitting thousands of  vulnerable households .\n\nDuring a roundtable in Brazil’s Belem city last month – before the 30th United Nations climate change conference, or COP30, which officially opened on November 17 – India’s minister for environment, forest and climate change, Bhupender Yadav, said the global meet should be the “COP of adaptation”.\n\n“The focus must be on transforming climate commitments into real-world actions that accelerate implementation and directly improve people’s lives,” he said, according to a statement released by the Indian government on October 13. He highlighted “a need to strengthen and intensify the flow of public finance towards adaptation”, said the statement.\n\nIn another statement last Tuesday, a day after COP30 opened, India said climate “adaptation financing needs to exceed nearly 15 times current flows, and significant gaps remain in doubling international public finance for adaptation by 2025”.\n\n“India emphasised that adaptation is an urgent priority for billions of vulnerable people in developing countries who have contributed the least to global warming but stand to suffer the most from its impacts,” said the statement.\n\nBut the actions of the Indian government back home do not match those words at the climate summit.\n\nGovernment records show NAFCC received an average of $13.3m annually in the initial years of its launch. But the allocation steadily declined. In the financial year 2022-2023, the fund’s spending was just $2.47m. In November 2022, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change moved NAFCC from the category of a government “scheme” to a “non-scheme”, providing no clear outlay for funds.\n\nSince the financial year 2023-2024, zero money has been earmarked for the crucial climate adaptation fund.\n\nAs a result, several climate adaptation projects in areas prone to floods, cyclones and landslides have been stalled even as widespread climatic devastation continued to kill and displace people. While presenting the federal budget in parliament in February this year, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman did not even include the words “climate change” and “adaptation” in her hour-long speech.\n\n“Announcing lofty adaptation goals abroad while starving the fund that safeguards our own citizens is misleading and a moral failure,” Raja Muzaffar Bhat, an environmental activist in Indian-administered Kashmir, told Al Jazeera, calling Yadav’s statements in Brazil “a gross distortion of reality and a dangerous distraction”.\n\nAl Jazeera reached out to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change for their comments on cutting NAFCC funds, but has not received any response.\n\nAn official in the Environment Ministry, however, defended the government’s shift in funding priorities, claiming the authorities have not abandoned climate adaptation efforts.\n\n“Funds are now being channelled through broader climate and sustainability initiatives rather than standalone schemes like the NAFCC,” the official told Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media.\n\nMeanwhile, climate crises continue to kill and displace people across India.\n\nIn the Darbhanga district of Bihar, India’s poorest state, 38-year-old Sunita Devi has been displaced five times in seven years as floods in the nearby Kosi River repeatedly destroyed her mud house built on bamboo stilts.\n\n“We live in fear every monsoon. My children have stopped going to school because we shift from camp to camp,” she said, holding on to the family’s only lifeline: A government ration card that allows them to buy food grains at subsidised rates or get them for free.\n\nThis year saw one of the worst monsoons across India, as above-average rains killed hundreds and displaced millions. In Bihar alone, floods affected more than 1.7 million people, killed dozens and submerged hundreds of villages.\n\nIn Odisha, another impoverished eastern state, fisherman Ramesh Behera*, 45, watched his house in Kendrapara district’s Satabhaya village collapse into the Bay of Bengal in 2024, as rising seas continue to erase entire hamlets. “The sea swallowed my home and my father’s fields. Fishing is no longer enough to survive,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nBehera was forced to give up his family’s traditional livelihoods – fishing and farming – and was driven into distress migration to survive. He now works as a manual labourer in Srinagar, the main city in Indian-administered Kashmir.\n\nIn West Bengal state’s Sundarbans Islands, one of the largest mangrove forests in the world, rising seas and coastal erosion have consumed lands and homes, forcing thousands of families in the fragile ecosystem to relocate.\n\nIn the southern state of Tamil Nadu’s Nagapattinam district, 29-year-old Revathi Selvam says saltwater intrusion from the Bay of Bengal has poisoned her farmland and their paddy harvest has collapsed.\n\n“The soil is no longer fertile. We cannot grow rice any more. We may have to leave farming altogether,” she told Al Jazeera, adding that many in her village are considering migrating to the state capital, Chennai, to work as construction workers.\n\nIn the Himalayan state of Himachal Pradesh, 27-year-old hotel worker Arjun Thakur saw his livelihood vanish when a cloudburst in 2024 buried the small tourist lodge where he worked. “The mountain broke apart. I saw houses collapse in seconds,” he recalled.\n\nThakur now stays with his relatives in the state capital Shimla, unsure if he can ever return to his native place.\n\nYet, with funds for NAFCC gone, people like Devi, Behera, Selvam and Thakur have no access to a government scheme that helps them cope with their tragedies.\n\nA government official, who previously worked with NAFCC, told Al Jazeera several schemes approved by the government under NAFCC were never implemented after funds began to dry up as early as 2021, exposing thousands of households to a recurring climate crisis.\n\n“The fund was created to help vulnerable communities adapt before disasters struck, and to reduce the kind of repeated displacement we are now witnessing,” the official said on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media.\n\n“Once the allocations stopped, states lost a key channel to protect people living on the front lines of floods, landslides, and droughts. Now, these families are left to rebuild on their own, again and again.”\n\nActivist Bhat said the government’s attitude to the NAFCC “signals that adaptation is no longer a priority, even as India faces record internal displacement from climate extremes”.\n\n“People are losing homes, farms, and livelihoods, and the government has left them entirely to their fate. If this continues, the next generation will inherit a country where climate refugees are a daily reality,” he said.\n\n“This is climate injustice at its most blatant.”\n\nClimate Action Network South Asia is a Dhaka-based coalition of about 250 civil society organisations, working in eight South Asian countries to promote government and individual action to limit human-induced climate change. Its estimate says roughly 45 million people in India could be forced to migrate by 2050 due to the climate crisis – a threefold increase over current displacement figures.\n\n“We are a vast nation with hot and cold deserts, long coastlines, and Himalayan glaciers. From tsunamis on our shores to flash floods, cloudbursts, and landslides in the mountains, we face the entire spectrum of climate extremes,” Bhat told Al Jazeera.\n\nBhat said it is not just nature causing displacement, but also unchecked “development” of vulnerable areas.\n\n“Earlier, floods or cloudbursts were occasional, and population density was low. Now, haphazard construction around mountain passes, waterways and streams, along with rampant deforestation, has amplified these disasters,” he said.\n\n“People who once fled New Delhi’s air pollution to settle down in [the Himalayan states of] Himachal Pradesh or Uttarakhand now find themselves living under a constant threat of landslides. Migration is no longer a choice but a survival strategy.”\n\nBhat warned that neglecting people affected by climate-related displacement could cause the world’s largest climate migration crisis.\n\n“We are no longer behaving like the welfare state promised in our constitution. We pay taxes like a developed country but get services that leave people to die in a climate crisis… We are utterly unprepared for the mass migrations that will inevitably come from both our mountains and our plains,” he said.\n\nBack at the temporary government shelter in Kashmir’s landslide-hit Sarh village, Ahmad fears an uncertain future for him and his family.\n\n“If land and shelter are not provided, we will not merely be homeless; we will become refugees in our own land, cast aside without place or protection,” he said.\n\n“When the state neglects the consequences of climate change, it issues a declaration: You are free to drown, but not free to rebuild.”"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdege1867lno","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"03:23:18.098+00:00","title":"Frida Kahlo self-portrait sells for $55m, sets auction record for a female artist","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Frida Kahlo's 1940s self-portrait El sueño (la cama), depicting her asleep beneath a skeleton and dynamite, sold for $55 million at a Sotheby's auction, setting a new world record for the highest price paid for a work by a female artist.

artist.\n\nThe painting went for more than 1,000 times its original auction price in 1980, after a tense bidding battle between two collectors, according to the Sotheby's auction house.\n\nThe auction

Thailand as chaotic edition ends\n\nWhen the golden crown studded with diamonds and pearls is placed on the head of the new Miss Universe in Thailand on Friday, it will mark the end of an exceptionally chaotic edition.\n\nIn the days leading up to the glittering coronation in Bangkok, contestants alleging mistreatment walked out and two judges resigned with one claiming the contest is rigged.\n\nThe controversies, analysts say, underscore the cultural and strategic differences between the pageant's Thai and Mexican owners.\n\nThe crowning of the new Miss Universe, the 74th since 1952, also signals the resolve of an organisation to stay relevant and evolve from a once-a-year television spectacle to a media brand that is ready for TikTok.\n\nMiss Universe, founded in the US, is one of the longest-running beauty pageants on the planet, alongside UK-based Miss World.\n\nIt aims to provide a platform for women to promote global causes such as HIV and Aids awareness and education for children. The title can also be a springboard to become a local and international celebrity.\n\nThailand is hosting Miss Universe for the fourth time and its delegate this year is considered a frontrunner by fan websites. If Thai-Indian Praveenar Singh wins, she will be the country's third Miss Universe and the first since 1988.\n\nThe country's 2018 staging of the pageant is regarded as among the best in recent years, so expectations were high for Thailand to outdo itself and put on a show.\n\nThe pageant events are being organised by Thai media mogul Nawat Itsaragrasil, who is known to fans as the founder and owner of Miss Grand International, a smaller Thai-based contest that is known for its loud social media presence.\n\nMr Nawat holds the licence to host this year's Miss Universe pageant, while the organisation is being run out of Mexico by businessman Raul Rocha.\n\nNorth, Central and South American queens dominated the contest in its early years, but recent decades have seen the rise of fandoms in South East Asia, most especially in Thailand, the Philippines and Indonesia, where pageant crowns have become a way out of poverty or an express pass for girls dreaming of becoming a celebrity.\n\nBut things took a dramatic turn at a pre-pageant ceremony early this month, when  Mr Nawat told off Miss Mexico, Fatima Bosch , in front of dozens of contestants for failing to post promotional content.\n\nWhen she objected, Mr Nawat called security and threatened to disqualify those supporting her. Ms Bosch then left the room and others joined her in solidarity.\n\nThe Miss Universe Organisation condemned Mr Nawat's behaviour as \"malicious\" and Mr Rocha, speaking by video from Mexico, told his Thai business partner to just \"stop\".\n\nMr Nawat later apologised and claimed that some of his words were misunderstood - but a delegation of international executives were sent to take over running the competition.\n\nA week later,  two judges resigned  with one of them accusing organisers of rigging the selection process.\n\nLebanese-French musician Omar Harfouch, who announced his resignation from the eight-member jury on Instagram, alleged that an \"impromptu jury\" had pre-selected finalists ahead of the final on Friday. Hours later, former French football star Claude Makelele also announced he'd pulled out, citing \"unforeseen personal reasons\".\n\nThe Miss Universe Organisation rejected Mr Harfouch's claims, saying that \"no external group has been authorised to evaluate delegates or select finalists\".\n\nIt suggested that Mr Harfouch may have been referring to the Beyond the Crown programme - a \"social impact initiative\" that operates independently from the main Miss Universe competition, and has a separate selection committee.\n\nThen during the preliminary evening gown round on Wednesday night, Miss Jamaica accidentally fell onstage and had to be rushed out of the theatre in a stretcher. She is recovering in hospital.\n\nThe string of controversies comes as Miss Universe transitions to a new leadership after Thai transgender media mogul Anne Jakrajutatip resigned as CEO just before the pre-pageant events and was replaced by Guatemalan diplomat Mario Bucaro.\n\nMs Jakrajutatip acquired the pageant from US entertainment company Endeavor in 2022. She made sweeping changes towards inclusivity, allowing transgender women, married women and women with children to participate. She also scrapped the age cap for contestants.\n\nAs audiences declined over the years, she sought to monetise the Miss Universe brand, stamping it on merchandise such as bottled water and bags.\n\nIn 2023,  her entertainment company JKN, filed for bankruptcy, citing \"liquidity problems\" .\n\nBefore she resigned, Ms Jakrajutatip brought in Mr Rocha from Mexico as business partner and later tapped Mr Nawat to organise the 2025 pageant.\n\nIt has been a \"very rocky transition\" for the pageant's leadership, Dani Walker, an American beauty queen and pageant coach told the BBC. She said important roles were now split between leaders in Bangkok and Mexico.\n\nThe leadership structure was much clearer when the pageant was being run by Endeavor, and before that, Donald Trump, she said.\n\n\"For fans and outsiders, it's very confusing. No one knows who the real leaders are or who to ask when they have questions, and that's very damaging to the brand,\" Paula Shugart, who served as Miss Universe Organization president under the previous two owners, told the BBC.\n\nThitiphong Duangkhong, a scholar of women's and Latin American studies and an expert on beauty pageants, said those behind the pageant should be aware of their cultural differences.\n\n\"In our country, we use the Thai language to communicate with our fellow Thais. We understand the social context, we understand social structure, we understand the inequality of power in society, and we constantly try to negotiate with it using the Thai language,\" he told the BBC.\n\nMr Thitiphong said Ms Jakrajutatip being a transwoman might not have sat well with some Latin American fans who subscribe to macho culture.\n\n\"There's talk of women who aren't women suddenly buying a pageant that's supposed to be about women's entertainment. What's going to happen?\"\n\nFor years, audiences for the Miss Universe broadcast have been declining steadily as  fans to shift on social media. On TikTok and Instagram, former titleholders, even runners up, maintain accounts with millions of followers, transforming them into influencers.\n\nIt is in this e-commerce universe that Mr Nawat's Miss Grand International queens are expected to embrace - selling merchandise in live broadcasts - which he tried to introduce to Miss Universe.\n\nBut on the Latin American side, beauty queens are still regarded as glamorous television celebrities. A Miss Universe reality show was even staged for that audience and the winner - a Dominican crowned Miss Universe Latina - is competing in the main pageant in Bangkok.\n\nBut while the controversies highlight the business side of Miss Universe, former queens continue to use their platform to promote their causes. The 2018 titleholder, Catriona Gray, urged her 13.8 million Instagram followers to help a charity bring safe drinking water to thousands left homeless by back-to-back super typhoons in the Philippines.\n\nPageants also continue to face constant criticism for objectifying women. But while majority of contestants wore two piece bikinis for the 2025 contest, those from conservative countries were allowed to wear full-body covering in the swimsuit round.\n\n\"Of course, it won't be for everyone, and there will always be those who disagree. But as long as the core values ​​are intact, I think pageants will always have a role to play in society,\" said Ms Shugart, the former president.\n\nShe said empowering women should be at the organisation's core.\n\n\"Miss Universe is nothing if you're not empowering the women that compete.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn979g302l9o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"00:02:57.255+00:00","title":"South African women call purple protest at G20 over gender violence","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"South African women, led by the organization Women for Change, are demanding that gender-based violence be declared a national disaster ahead of the G20 Summit in Johannesburg.

Despite President Cyril Ramaphosa declaring GBV a national crisis in 2019, activists say enforcement and implementation remain lacking. The protest is backed by celebrities like Grammy winner Tyla, who changed their profiles to purple, symbolizing awareness and resistance. The campaign also highlights real-life experiences of violence, such as those of Prudence, who faced failed justice due to lost evidence. Some women have taken self-defense measures through the group Girls on Fire, founded by Lynette Oxeley, which promotes firearm ownership as a last resort. The National Disaster Management Centre has rejected the call to declare GBV a national disaster, citing legal constraints, underscoring the ongoing struggle for systemic change.","keyTakeAways":["South African women are calling for gender-based violence (GBV) to be declared a national disaster amid rising rates of femicide and sexual assault.","The G20 Women's

nationwide protests to demand that gender-based violence (GBV) be declared a national disaster in a country where attacks on women have become commonplace.\n\nThe campaign began with a viral social media movement and will culminate in a nationwide \"shutdown\" on Friday, ahead of the G20 Summit in Johannesburg.\n\nCelebrities, citizens and nations have shown their solidarity by changing their social media profile pictures to purple – a colour often linked to GBV awareness.\n\nSouth Africa experiences some of the world's highest levels of GBV, with the rate at which women are killed five times higher than the global average, according to UN Women.\n\nBetween January and March this year, 137 women were murdered and more than 1,000 raped, according to South African crime statistics.\n\nWarning: This report contains descriptions of sexual assault\n\nOn Friday, women are being urged to refrain from going to work or school, \"withdraw from the economy for one day\", and lie down for 15 minutes at 12:00 local time (10:00 GMT) in honour of the women murdered in the country.\n\nThey are also being urged to wear black as a sign of \"mourning and resistance\".\n\nThe protest, dubbed the G20 Women's Shutdown, has been organised by Women for Change, which has also been spearheading the online campaign.\n\nThere has also been an online petition, signed by over one million people, calling for the government to take an even tougher stance against the scourge.\n\nThe National Disaster Management Centre (NDMC) has rejected the calls to declare GBV a national disaster, saying it doesn't fall within the legal requirements.\n\nOn Thursday, President Cyril Ramaphosa told the G20 Social Summit that  South Africa had \"declared gender-based violence and femicide a national crisis\" in 2019 .\n\nHowever, activists say that little has changed and they want the government to take more action.\n\nWomen for Change spokesperson Cameron Kasambala lamented the enactment of \"so many beautiful acts and legislations\" over the years to try and tackle the issue, which are followed by \"lack of implementation and transparency\" on the government's part.\n\n\"We've integrated violence… into our culture [and] into our social norms,\" she told the BBC.\n\n\"Once the government truly reacts to this issue, I feel like we'll already be able to see a reaction on the ground. Because they set the precedent and the tone for how the country responds,\" she said.\n\nGrammy-award winning singer Tyla is among the thousands of celebrities and citizens who have rallied behind the call and changed their social media profiles. Some have gone further, posting pictures of purple hearts, nail polish and even clothing in what has since been dubbed the \"purple movement\".\n\nA South African professor who asked to remain anonymous told the BBC she had taken leave so she could travel to Johannesburg from Free State province to take part in the silent protest.\n\nIt's important for her because she said she had second thoughts about simple things like jogging and hopes that the protest will \"slow the scourge\" of GBV.\n\nHowever, some women have faced a backlash from employers for wanting to participate in the protest. One product designer who works for a major cooperation said they were strongly advised against taking part.\n\nSome women who feel the government is not doing enough have taken matters into their own hands.\n\nLynette Oxeley founded Girls on Fire to help women protect themselves through gun ownership.  It is legal to own a firearm in South Africa for self-defence if a person has a valid licence.\n\nMost of the women in her group have been raped, attacked, robbed, or experienced some level of violence.\n\nPrudence joined the group after she was raped in 2022.\n\n\"I said: 'No'. I screamed, I cried but he didn't take no for an answer,\" she told the BBC.\n\nTrying to find justice was an \"uphill battle\" as her case was withdrawn because her rape kit - the DNA they take after the crime - was lost.\n\nIt isn't a \"police problem, it is a nation problem,\" she said.\n\nAlthough the women are trained to shoot firearms, Ms Oxeley said using a gun was a \"last resort\".\n\n\"It's not about actually defending yourself with a firearm. I want ladies to change what they think about themselves. Stop being silent,\" she said.\n\n\"Even if you do not win the fight, at least you are fighting back.\"\n\nGo to  BBCAfrica.com  for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter  @BBCAfrica , on Facebook at  BBC Africa  or on Instagram at  bbcafrica"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8r08zmkjlzo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"00:46:01.888+00:00","title":"Ukraine: Teenage saboteurs paid to attack their own country","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ukraine is facing a growing threat from alleged Russian-backed recruitment of minors and teenagers through online platforms like Telegram and TikTok, with over 800 individuals identified, including 240 under 18.

17-year-old travelled 500 miles from his home in eastern Ukraine to collect a bomb and a phone hidden in a park in the western city of Rivne.\n\nHe says he was promised $2,000 (£1,520) to plant the bomb in a van used by Ukraine's military conscription service.\n\n\"When I was connecting the wires, I thought it could explode then. I thought I might die,\" he told the BBC.\n\nVlad is one of hundreds of children and older teenagers who the Ukrainian government alleges have been recruited online by Russia, and offered payment to carry out sabotage and other attacks against their own country. His name has been changed to protect his anonymity.\n\nHe says he was told to set up the phone to live-stream the scene to his handler so they could remotely detonate the device when somebody entered the vehicle.\n\nHowever, Ukraine's SBU security service had been watching and foiled the attack. Vlad - now 18 - is awaiting trial on terrorism charges that potentially carry a 12-year prison sentence.\n\nSitting in Rivne's heavily guarded detention centre with his lawyer beside him, he acknowledges that he could have helped kill somebody.\n\n\"I did think about it. But nobody likes conscription officers,\" he says. \"I thought: Well, I'll be like everyone else.\"\n\nThe SBU says that over the last two years more than 800 Ukrainians have been identified as having been recruited by Russia - 240 of them minors, some as young as 11.\n\nHowever, cyber security expert Anastasiia Apetyk, who teaches courses about internet safety in Ukraine, is aware of even younger cases. \"They tried to recruit children aged nine or 10,\" she says.\n\nAndriy Nebytov, Deputy Head of Ukraine's National Police, says there is a deliberate strategy to seek out the vulnerable who can be manipulated.\n\n\"Children do not always fully realise the consequences of their actions,\" he says.\n\n\"The enemy is not ashamed of using minors for making explosives out of household chemicals, planting them in various locations such as army recruitment offices or police stations.\"\n\nThe SBU says recruitment primarily takes place on the Telegram app, but also on TikTok, and even on video game platforms. Officials says those who are recruited are almost always motivated by money rather than pro-Russian sympathies.\n\nVlad says he does not support Russia and had no previous involvement with crime.\n\nHe had joined two Telegram channels and posted that he was looking for remote work. Within half an hour, a man calling himself Roman replied. When they later talked on the phone, Vlad says Roman spoke Russian with a street accent.\n\nVlad says he was initially reluctant but was persuaded to take on a series of increasingly dangerous tasks. First, he was told to collect a grenade but when he reached the designated location it wasn't there. He was paid $30 anyway.\n\nA few days later came another job - to set fire to a van belonging to a conscription centre, film it and run.\n\nFor that attack, Vlad says he received about $100 in cryptocurrency - much less than the $1,500 he'd been promised. Roman told him he would get the rest if he planted the bomb in Rivne.\n\nThe Telegram channels the BBC has seen where recruitment takes place are not explicitly pro-Russian, but they amplify anger felt by some Ukrainians towards the conscription service, which has been  dogged by allegations  of brutality and corruption.\n\nUsing a burner phone and an alias we joined several we were tipped off about.\n\nThe channels contained clips of fires and explosions which they claimed were carried out on their orders. But the BBC has not been able to verify the circumstances surrounding those videos.\n\nOne account we contacted immediately offered payment, either in cryptocurrency or via bank transfer, to carry out arson. We were told to contact a second account for more details and then received a message with a price list detailing how much they offered to pay for different targets.\n\nThe payments ranged from $1,500 for setting fire to a post office to $3,000 for a bank. Banks were worth more, they explained, because security glass made them harder to attack.\n\n\"You either need to pour petrol inside or throw a few Molotov cocktails inside,\" the account advised.\n\nBut even ordinary Ukrainians looking for employment can find themselves offered money to carry out sabotage.\n\nWe found adverts offering high pay for unspecified part time work posted in a variety of unrelated Ukrainian Telegram groups, including some geared at refugees and even beauty tips. When we followed one up, a recruiter again offered thousands of dollars for arson attacks and asked us to send videos as proof.\n\n\"I need all the arson I can get,\" they messaged. \"Finding a reliable person is far more difficult than parting with money. That's why I pay exactly what I say and I do it very quickly, usually within a couple of hours after receiving the video.\"\n\nThe BBC reported a number of these channels, accounts, chats and bots to Telegram, which removed a few but not most of them. One of the channels that is still active has grown by over 750 subscribers since we started monitoring it, meanwhile an account that we told Telegram had directly offered us payment for an arson attack is still live.\n\nIn a statement, Telegram said: \"Calls to violence or destruction of property are explicitly forbidden on Telegram and are immediately removed whenever discovered.\"\n\nUkrainian officials have publicly named members of Russia's intelligence agencies they suspect of acting as handlers to saboteurs.\n\nThe BBC has not been able to independently verify that the Russian state itself is responsible.\n\nHowever, several European governments have said that they have evidence of Russian agents recruiting young men to carry out acts of vandalism, arson, or even surveillance in their countries.  In the UK, six men were jailed  for their part in a Russian-ordered arson attack on a London warehouse providing aid to Ukraine.\n\nIn Ukraine, hundreds of alleged saboteurs are awaiting trial, but for some the consequences can be deadly. Several suspects have been killed by explosives they were carrying.\n\nThe SBU claims Russian handlers have deliberately detonated devices remotely, knowing their agents would be killed.\n\nIn March, a 17-year-old died and a 15-year-old was badly injured when a bomb they were believed to be taking to a rail station in Ivano-Frankivsk exploded.\n\nThe BBC put the SBU's allegations to the Russian Embassy in London. In a statement it accused Ukraine of a similar sabotage campaign  using Russian citizens .\n\n\"The practices that you mention have become a trademark of the Ukrainian special services. In particular: recruitment of civilians, including children, to carry out arson, sabotage or bombings against people, buildings or vehicles.\"\n\nThere have been reports attributing acts of sabotage inside Russia to Ukrainian recruitment on Telegram. But again, it is notoriously difficult to verify who exactly is behind these attacks.\n\nMeanwhile Vlad has a message for others tempted by the recruiters.\n\n\"It's not worth it. They will either cheat you, and then you will end up in prison just like me, or you can take a bomb in your hands and it will simply blow you up.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn8vnv3dk0vo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"23:03:36.178+00:00","title":"Nathan Gill: How WhatsApp messages revealed ex-Reform politician's pro-Russian bribes","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Nathan Gill, a former UKIP and Brexit Party MEP, is facing prison for accepting bribes from Oleg Voloshyn, a Ukrainian with ties to Russia's FSB, to promote pro-Russian media and events in the European Parliament between 2018 and 2019.

Gill  pleaded guilty to eight counts of bribery  in September.\n\nFarage, now leader of Reform UK, said he was \"stunned\" that Gill, a former Mormon bishop would have done this.\n\nFarage said he had no knowledge of his \"shameful activities\" and condemned them \"in every possible way\".\n\nGill was first elected as an MEP for the now defunct UK Independence Party in 2014 and rose through its ranks.\n\nHe led UKIP in Wales and was also elected to the Welsh Parliament in 2016.\n\nGill played a prominent role in the Brexit campaign in Wales and was one of only two MEPs who followed Farage from UKIP into the Brexit Party in 2019.\n\nHe had previously told the BBC he had responsibility for The Brexit Party's group of MEPs as its \"head of delegation\". He said that meant he told them where to sit and would \"keep them in line\".\n\nHis WhatsApp chat history reveals that by this point, Voloshyn had helped prepare two of Gill's contributions to parliamentary debates in December 2018 and March 2019.\n\nGill had visited Ukraine in May 2018 and was with Voloshyn at an event to commemorate the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany in World War Two.\n\nThat was four years after  Putin's forces had annexed Crimea  while Russia were also supporting separatists fighting in Ukraine's Donbas region.\n\nRussia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine happened in 2022.\n\nThat trip to Ukraine – the first of three in 2018 – was arranged by a Polish man called Janusz Niedźwiecki, who is awaiting trial in Poland on charges of spying for Russia.\n\nWhile Gill deepened his connections in Ukraine, his ties to UKIP frayed and in December 2018 he followed Farage out of the party.\n\nProsecutors say he committed his first offence around this time - and that Voloshyn used the codewords \"xmas gifts\" and \"post cards\" to refer to cash in WhatsApps to Gill.\n\nIn return for the bribe, Gill read from a script in a European Parliament debate, where he raised concerns about threats in Ukraine to close two TV channels - 112 Ukraine and NewsOne.\n\nBoth were connected to a man called Viktor Medvedchuk, a super-rich Ukrainian oligarch whose daughter has Putin as her godfather.\n\nGill had visited the TV channels with fellow MEPs David Coburn and Jonathan Arnott in October 2018, both of whom spoke up for the broadcasters in the same debate as Gill.\n\nCoburn and Gill were on an \"international editorial board\" for 112, together with Voloshyn.\n\nArnott said if Gill had offered him money, he would have gone to the police.\n\nHe also said he criticised Russia in his speech.\n\n\"I find the very suggestion that when I'm criticising Russia, that somehow I'll be in any way reacting to something Russia would have wanted me to do... it's provably nonsensical,\" Arnott told the BBC.\n\nThe TV stations were threatened with closure, Arnott said and added that Gill told him \"it was a freedom of speech issue\".\n\nThe BBC has tried contacting Coburn, the former UKIP leader in Scotland, but has not received a response.\n\nOver the course of seven months in 2018 and 2019, Gill and Voloshyn shared WhatsApp messages to arrange payment.\n\nIn emails with the BBC, Voloshyn said Gill was getting paid as part of an \"advocacy campaign\" and that he was \"helping the opposition TV stations to fight for survival\".\n\nOne of Gill's eight offences involved arranging a meeting with Medvedchuk, which was broadcast on Kremlin-controlled TV, at the European Parliament in July 2019.\n\nMedvedchuk presented a so-called peace plan that involved talks between the Kyiv government and Russian-backed separatists who then controlled parts of Ukraine.\n\nSome were payments for making supportive statements about Medvedchuk to 112.\n\nOn two occasions he was asked to get other MEPs, who have not been named by the prosecution, to do the same.\n\nVoloshyn promised combined payments of at least €10,000 (about £8,600) for the favour.\n\nTwo of those present at Medvedchuk's Strasbourg meeting were Brexit Party MEPs Rupert Lowe and James Wells.\n\nLowe said Gill had asked \"me and other MEPs to attend\" an event with a \"very pro-Russian slant\".\n\n\"Due to his position in the grouping, I agreed,\" added Lowe, now an independent MP who had a  public falling out with Farage .\n\nLowe said he had no idea of Gill's bribery, calling it \"treasonous\".\n\nWells said he was angry with Gill because he felt he had been \"using people around him, like me I guess, to put bums on seats\".\n\nThe former Welsh MEP said he \"left probably after half an hour, because I didn't know why I was there\" and added the event now sounds \"dodgy as hell\".\n\n\"I had no idea whatsoever that there was any money changing hands,\" added Wells, who said he visited Ukraine with Gill in 2020.\n\n\"He's not just risked the reputation of colleagues and the party but also the whole Brexit thing. It ties into the conspiracy that it was all about Russia... which is just a load of nonsense.\"\n\nAfter Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Medvedchuk was captured by the Ukrainians and swapped with Moscow in a prisoner exchange.\n\nIt is thought Voloshyn, elected to Ukraine's Parliament as a member of the pro-Russian Opposition Platform - For Life party in 2019, left the country for Belarus.\n\nIn his emails with the BBC, Voloshyn insisted Russia was not involved in the Gill case.\n\n\"We never reported to anyone in Moscow or were ever asked from there about anything related to our co-operation with Gill,\" Voloshyn wrote.\n\nVoloshyn said his phone was examined when stopped by FBI investigators at Washington DC's Dulles Airport in July 2021.\n\nThat month, the Speaker of the House of Commons warned MPs against talking to Voloshyn and Niedźwiecki as both allegedly had sought the support of UK politicians to \"promote Russian foreign policy objectives\".\n\nThe US government sanctioned Voloshyn in 2022 and called him a \"pawn\" of the FSB, Russia's security service, and accused him of undermining Ukraine's government.\n\nThat same year, the UK government also sanctioned Voloshyn and Medvedchuk, accusing both of \"destabilising Ukraine\".\n\nAnton Shekhovstov, an academic expert in Russian influencing campaigns, told the BBC that Voloshyn and his wife were active in building European networks for Medvedchuk.\n\nHe said the strategy of getting MEPs to defend the pro-Russian TV channels was effective and the investment in Gill \"returned with profit\".\n\nShekhovstov said when Gill was asked to speak up for them in 2018, they'd become \"instruments of Russian or pro-Russian propaganda\".\n\n\"President Petro Poroshenko at that time did not dare to sanction the channels,\" said Shekhovstov.\n\nThe channels were shut in 2021 under the presidency of Ukraine's current leader Volodomyr Zelensky.\n\nGill invited Farage to Ukraine in 2019, but he declined.\n\n\"I said 'you must be off your rocker',\" Farage told the BBC earlier this year.\n\n\"I said it's one of the most corrupt countries on Earth.\"\n\nVoloshyn also said Farage had \"absolutely nothing to do with it\".\n\n\"I never met him in my life and never passed any greetings, let alone requests,\" he said.\n\nVoloshyn's wife Nadia Sass was photographed with Farage outside the European Parliament, but all involved say it was a one-off.\n\n\"Nigel Farage meets thousands of people every single year,\" said a Reform UK spokesman.\n\n\"Many hundreds of them will ask to have a photo taken with him.\"\n\nIn a recent interview, Farage said  accusations that he is soft on Russia are \"just nonsense\" , added Putin was a \"really bad dude\" and said he would have Russian jets shot down if they entered Nato airspace.\n\nLord Beamish, chairman of the parliamentary intelligence and security committee, said the problem of Russian meddling is \"constant\" and that the Gill case was \"not unusual\".\n\n\"There are other examples in Europe where similar things have happened\", he said.\n\n\"It's not just the UK.\"\n\nA Russian-based \"propaganda\" network allegedly paying unnamed European politicians, called Voice of Europe, was  shut down in the Czech Republic  last year.\n\nMedvedchuk was accused of being behind it.\n\nThe head of the Met's counter terrorism unit said Gill's case \"goes to the heart of our democratic values\".\n\n\"We will not hesitate to investigate and disrupt anyone seeking to harm or undermine these values and our national security,\" said Commander Dominic Murphy.\n\nThe BBC went to Gill's home in Llangefni on Anglesey for a comment but he declined."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2e2p823rlo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"18:35:29.010+00:00","title":"Lawmaker's former staffer staged violent political attack, police say","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Natalie Greene, a 26-year-old former congressional staffer of New Jersey Republican Representative Jefferson Van Drew, is accused of staging a violent political attack by falsely claiming she was attacked by three gunmen on a nature trail in Egg Harbor Township, New Jersey.

platform Twitch added to Australia's teen social media ban\n\nTwitch, a streaming platform popular with gamers, has been added to Australia's  teen social media ban which starts next month.\n\nIt joins other platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Tik Tok and Snapchat that must ensure under-16s cannot open accounts and existing ones are closed from 10 December.\n\nAustralia's internet regulator overseeing the ban said Twitch - owned by Amazon -has been included as its main purpose was \"online social interaction\" where users were encouraged to chat to each other about posted content.\n\nA Twitch spokesperson said Australians under 16 will not be able to open a Twitch account from 10 December, and from 9 January, existing under-16s accounts will be deactivated.\n\nOn her reasons why Twitch had been included, eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said it was \"a platform most commonly used for livestreaming or posting content that enables users, including Australian children, to interact with others in relation to the content posted\".\n\nNo more platforms are expected to be added to the ban before the start date next month, Ms Inman Grant said.\n\nThe government has previously said the ban is aimed at  reducing the \"pressures and risks\" children can be exposed to on social media, including harmful content .\n\nFounded in 2007, Twitch is a popular livestreaming platform, where people typically play video games while chatting to viewers.\n\nLast year, it launched  plans to share more of its revenue with creators  as part of a shake-up, allowing streamers to make money through fans subscribing to their channel.\n\nThe revenue is split equally between Twitch and the creator, after fees are paid.\n\nTwitch's policy forbids anyone under 13 to use its platform and users aged between 13 and the legal age of adulthood in their country can join if they have permission from their parent or guardian.\n\nMs Inman Grant also said on Friday that Pinterest, where users compile online notice boards of images, would not be included in the ban because its core purpose was not about online social interaction.\n\nInstead, the platform was \"more commonly used by individuals collating images for inspiration and idea curation,\" she said.\n\nAustralia's world-first under-16s social media ban also includes YouTube, Reddit, Kick, Threads and X.\n\nThe ban means tech companies must take \"reasonable steps\" to stop under-16s from using their platforms or risk being fined up to $49.5m (US$32m, £25m).\n\nEarlier this week, Meta - which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads -  announced it would start closing accounts of teenagers under 16  from 4 December, a week before the official ban.\n\nIt's not clear how companies will enforce the ban but some possibilities included the use of government IDs, face or voice recognition and age inference. The latter of these uses online information other than a date of birth - such as online behaviour or interactions - to estimate a person's age."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyp9d3ddqyo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"01:09:08.794+00:00","title":"Australia's social media ban for kids under 16 - how will it work?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Australia has introduced a world-first ban on under-16s using social media platforms, effective from 10 December 2025, targeting platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, YouTube, Reddit, and others.

2025-11-21T01:09:08.794+00:00\n\nTitle: Australia's social media ban for kids under 16 - how will it work?\n\nFrom 10 December, social media companies will have to take \"reasonable steps\" to ensure that under-16s in Australia cannot set up accounts on their platforms and that existing accounts are deactivated or removed.\n\nThe government says the ban - a world-first policy popular with many parents - is aimed at reducing the \"pressures and risks\" children can be exposed to on social media, which come from \"design features that encourage them to spend more time on screens, while also serving up content that can harm their health and wellbeing\".\n\nA study commissioned by the government earlier this year said 96% of children aged 10-15 used social media and that seven out of 10 of them had been exposed to harmful content and behaviour. This behaviour ranged from misogynistic material to fight videos and content promoting eating disorders and suicide.\n\nOne in seven also reported experiencing grooming-type behaviour from adults or older children, and more than half said they had been the victims of cyberbullying.\n\nThe Australian government has so far named ten platforms to be included in the ban: Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, YouTube, Reddit and streaming platforms Kick and Twitch.\n\nIt is also under pressure to expand the ban to online gaming. Fearing they may be targeted, gaming platforms such as Roblox and Discord  have recently introduced age checks  on some features in an apparent bid to ward off inclusion in the ban.\n\nThe government has said it will continue to review the list of affected platforms, and will consider three main criteria when doing so.\n\nThese comprise whether the platform's sole or \"significant purpose\" is to enable online social interaction between two or more users; whether it allows users to interact with some or all other users; and whether it allows users to post material.\n\nYouTube Kids, Google Classroom and WhatsApp are not included as they were not deemed to have met those criteria. Children will also still be available to view most content on platforms like YouTube, which do not require an account.\n\nChildren and parents will not be punished for infringing the ban - it is social media companies who are charged with enforcing it, and they face fines of up to $49.5m (US$32m, £25m) for serious or repeated breaches.\n\nThe government says these companies must take \"reasonable steps\" to keep kids off their platforms, and use age assurance technologies - without specifying which ones.\n\nSeveral possibilities have been raised, including the use of government IDs, face or voice recognition and age inference. The latter of these uses online information other than a date of birth - such as online behaviour or interactions - to estimate a person's age.\n\nThe government is encouraging platforms to use multiple different methods. It has also said platforms cannot rely on users declaring their own age, or on parents vouching for their children.\n\nMeta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads,  has announced  it will begin closing teen accounts from 4 December. Those mistakenly kicked off could use a government ID or provide a video selfie to verify their age, the company said.\n\nThe other affected platforms have not yet said how they will comply with the ban.\n\nWithout a clear idea of what methods companies will be using, it's hard to say whether the social media ban will be effective - but concerns have been raised that age assurance technologies may wrongly block some users while failing to spot others who are underage.\n\nThe government's  own report  found that facial assessment technology, for example, is least reliable for the exact demographic it's needed to target.\n\nQuestions have also been raised as to whether the fines for infringement are big enough. As former Facebook executive Stephen Scheeler told AAP: \"It takes Meta about an hour and 52 minutes to make $50 million in revenue\".\n\nCritics argue that the ban, even if properly implemented, will not actually reduce online harm for children. Dating websites and gaming platforms are not included, and nor are AI chatbots, which have recently  made headlines  for allegedly encouraging children to commit suicide and for having \"sensual\" conversations with minors.\n\nOthers point out that teens who rely on social media for community will be left isolated, and argue that educating children about how to navigate social media would be more effective.\n\nCommunications Minister Annika Wells has conceded that the ban may not be \"perfect\".\n\n\"It's going to look a bit untidy on the way through,\" she said in early November. \"Big reforms always do.\"\n\nCritics have also raised concerns about the large-scale collection and storage of data that will be required, and its potential mishandling, as platforms try to verify users' ages.\n\nAustralia - like much of the world - has in recent years seen a series of high-profile data breaches, including several where sensitive personal information was stolen and sold or published.\n\nBut the government says the legislation incorporates \"strong protections\" for personal information. These protections stipulate that such information may not be used for anything other than age verification and must be destroyed once that has been done, with \"serious penalties\" for breaches.\n\nIt also says platforms must offer an alternative to the use of governments IDs for age assurance.\n\nSocial media companies were aghast at the announcement of the ban in November 2024. They argued it would be difficult to implement, easy to circumvent and time consuming for users, as well as posing risks to their privacy.\n\nThey also suggested it would drive children into dark corners of the internet and deprive young people of social contact. Snap - which owns Snapchat - and YouTube also denied being social media companies.\n\nYouTube's parent company, Google, is reportedly still considering whether to launch a legal challenge to the platform's inclusion. It did not respond to a BBC request for comment.\n\nEven as it announced that it would implement it early, Meta argued the ban would leave teens with \"inconsistent protections across the many apps they use\".\n\nAt parliamentary hearings in October, TikTok and Snap said they still opposed the ban but would implement it.\n\nKick - the only Australian company included in the ban - has said it will introduce a \"range of measures\" and continue to engage \"constructively\" with authorities.\n\nThe ban on under-16s using social media is a world first, and other countries will be watching closely. Different approaches have been tried elsewhere to limit screen and social media time for children and keep them from accessing harmful material, but nowhere has put a total ban on the platforms involved.\n\nIn the UK,  new safety rules  introduced in July mean online companies face large fines or even the jailing of their executives if they fail to implement measures to protect young people from seeing illegal and harmful content.\n\nOther European countries allow the use of social media under a certain age only with parental consent. In September, a  French parliamentary enquiry  recommended banning under-15s from social media, as well as a social media \"curfew\" for 15- to 18-year-olds.\n\nDenmark has announced plans to ban social media for under-15s, while Norway is considering a similar proposal. Spain's government has sent to parliament a draft law for under-16s to require their legal guardians to authorise access.\n\nMeanwhile, an attempt in the US state of Utah to ban under-18s from social media without parental consent was blocked by a federal judge last year.\n\nTeens interviewed by the BBC said they were opening new accounts with fake ages ahead of the ban - although the government has warned social media companies it expects them to detect such accounts and remove them.\n\nOnline, teenagers are also recommending alternative social media apps or giving tips they hope will help them bypass the ban.\n\nSome teens, including influencers, have switched to joint accounts with their parents. Commentators are also predicting a surge in the use of VPNs - which hide the country a person is accessing the internet from - as happened in the UK after the implementation of age control rules."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgmgddyjl0o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"16:22:10.568+00:00","title":"Trump to meet incoming New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Zohran Mamdani, the newly elected mayor of New York City, has secured a meeting with President Donald Trump at the White House, following months of public and political hostility.

You can refuse illegal orders.\"\n\n\"No one has to carry out orders that violate the law or our constitution,\" the lawmakers say in the video.\n\n\"This administration is pitting our uniformed military and intelligence community professionals against American citizens,\" it says. \"Like us, you all swore an oath to protect and defend this Constitution.

Each one of these traitors to our Country should be ARRESTED AND PUT ON TRIAL. Their words cannot be allowed to stand — We won't have a Country anymore!!!

For months, he had resisted unsealing many documents from the federal investigation into the late financier.\n\nCongress' lower chamber began debating the measure on Tuesday morning and voted within hours. Several of Epstein's victims spent the day on Capitol Hill advocating for the bill's passage.\n\nNearly all House lawmakers voted in favour of the resolution, which passed  427-1. Clay Higgins, a Louisiana Republican, was the only one who voted against the bill. Two Republicans and three Democrats did not vote. The Senate then passed the resolution.\n\nThe House Oversight Committee has already  made public thousands of documents  from the Epstein estate relating to the late financier, but the resolution covers material currently in the possession of the justice department.\n\nThose records could, in theory, include files about imprisoned Epstein co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell, as well as figures - including government officials - mentioned in the case. It could also include internal justice department documents.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the Senate confirmed that it had passed the Epstein bill and sent it to Trump.\n\nLater that evening, Trump posted on social media that he had signed it into law.\n\nWhile the press and others are often invited to witness Trump's bill-signings, this was done out of public view, and the announcement was included in a long post that also blasted Democrats he claimed were tied to Epstein, touted the president's record during this second term, and addressed the two impeachment trials of his first term.\n\n\"Perhaps the truth about these Democrats, and their associations with Jeffrey Epstein, will soon be revealed, because I HAVE JUST SIGNED THE BILL TO RELEASE THE EPSTEIN FILES!\" he wrote.\n\nHe added that because he had asked Republican lawmakers to support the measure \"the votes were almost unanimous in favor of passage.\"\n\nThe justice department now has 30 days to release its materials on Epstein.\n\nBut there are obstacles to the files being shared.\n\nThe House bill said the justice department can hold back any documents that \"jeapordise an active federal investigation or ongoing prosecution, provided that such withholding is narrowly tailored and temporary\".\n\nThat could potentially lead to delays, given that Trump has called for investigations into Epstein's links with prominent Democrats, such as Bill Clinton  and Larry Summers , \"to determine what was going on with them, and him\".\n\nClinton has strongly denied he had any knowledge of Epstein's crimes, whereas Summers has apologised for his \"misguided decision\" to continue communicating with Epstein until 2019.\n\n\"That's a potential hurdle,\" Jonathan Entin, a constitutional law professor at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio, told the BBC.\n\n\"If, in fact, this is a serious investigation, presumably the prosecutors will not want everything out there while they're sorting out whether they bring charges.\"\n\nFor those who have campaigned for the release of the files, anything short of full disclosure is likely to spark further questions and even outrage.\n\nSeveral Republican lawmakers have expressed worries that Trump's order to the justice department to investigate Epstein's ties could slow the release of the files.\n\nThomas Massie, a Kentucky congressman, vowed that he and fellow Republican dissident Marjorie Taylor Greene, of Georgia, would \"absolutely\" go to the floor of the House and read out the names of \"some of the men\" in the files if the records were not duly released by the justice department.\n\nIn addition to possible delays, the public is also likely to see lots of redactions in any release of new Epstein documents.\n\nIn the tranche of files released by the House Oversight Committee last week, names and phone numbers were frequently blacked out to protect privacy.\n\n\"Simply letting anything out could reveal a lot of private information that's not relevant or appropriate for public consumption,\" Prof Entin said.\n\nThe latest bill says the attorney general can \"withhold or redact\" records that include victims' names, medical files and other personal information that \"would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\".\n\nOne attorney who handles sexual abuse cases supported Congress improving the provision. But she said releasing the files still might impact Epstein survivors.\n\n\"I'm glad in the act itself they put specific language reinforcing the privacy rights of the victims here,\" said Christine Dunn, co-managing partner at Sanford Heisler Sharp McKnight's Washington, DC, office.\n\n\"I'm torn because I think transparency is almost always a good thing, I don't think things change until someone shines a light on them,\" she said. \"But at the same time for the victims, having to relive this in the media is going to be hard.\"\n\nThe attorney general can also withhold classified material and images of sexual abuse.\n\nThe justice department already said that a \"large volume\" of its 300 gigabytes of data from Epstein investigations includes images and videos of minors and thousands of downloaded videos and images of child sex abuse.\n\nOther information in the documents could be protected by grand jury secrecy rules, which the latest bill does not explicitly address.\n\nUS Attorney General Pam Bondi said on Wednesday morning when asked about the Epstein files during an unrelated news conference: \"We'll continue to follow the law with maximum transparency, while protecting victims.\"\n\nKayla Epstein contributed to this report."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7810w37vwdo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"19:09:00.870+00:00","title":"Where are US warships stationed near Venezuela and why are they there?","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United States has significantly escalated its military presence near Venezuela, deploying thousands of troops and major assets such as the USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier, guided-missile destroyers, amphibious assault ships, and intelligence-gathering aircraft like the P-8 Poseidon.

stationed near Venezuela and why are they there?\n\nThe US has deployed thousands of troops and significant military assets - including the world's largest warship - to within striking distance of Venezuela.\n\nThe military build-up is the largest US presence in Latin America in decades and has sparked speculation about the potential for some kind of military action against Venezuela.\n\nThis comes after a series of US airstrikes against alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific in recent months, which the Trump administration says are necessary to stem the flow of drugs.\n\nThe build-up in the Caribbean began in August with the deployment of air and naval forces, including a nuclear-powered submarine and spy planes  according to US officials.\n\nIt now includes a range of aircraft carriers, guided-missile destroyers, and amphibious assault ships capable of landing thousands of troops.\n\nBBC Verify has confirmed the locations of six warships in the region this month by cross referencing ship-tracking data and satellite imagery.\n\nThis includes the USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier, described by the US Navy as \"the most capable, adaptable, and lethal combat platform in the world\".\n\nThe ship, which travels in a strike group with other supporting vessels, is more than 330 metres (1,100 feet) long.\n\nBBC Verify has identified several other vessels in the Caribbean Sea - including a guided missile destroyer, an amphibious transport dock, a guided missile cruiser, and an amphibious assault ship.\n\nWe have also located a vessel which appears to be the MV Ocean Trader. This is the US Special Operations Command mothership which can serve as a base for 200 troops and has hangar bays for several helicopters.\n\nThe US has also deployed  F-35 fighter jets to its bases in the Caribbean,  according to pictures taken by Reuters, and has flown bombers and spy planes over the region.\n\nIn October, three B-52 bombers took off from an airbase in Louisiana and circled off the coast of Venezuela before returning, according to flight tracking data from FlightRadar24.\n\nAnd last month tracking data shows several P-8 Poseidon reconnaissance aircrafts flew south over the Caribbean from a US naval base in Florida.\n\nExperts say these flights suggest the US is trying to gather military intelligence from the region.\n\n\"We see activity by P-8As around the world anywhere the US Navy has an interest in boosting its marine domain awareness,\" says Henry Ziemer, an Americas specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).\n\nUS President Donald Trump has also acknowledged that he authorised the  CIA to conduct covert action in Venezuela , although the scope of what that might mean remains highly classified.\n\nThe build-up has prompted concerns that the US is preparing to directly target Venezuela, or potentially try to topple the socialist government of President Nicolás Maduro.\n\n\"The level of forces, and the fact that they are plainly not tailored for the purpose of pure drug interdiction has raised suspicions the US may be heading towards war with Venezuela,\" says Mr Ziemer.\n\n\"The escalation risks are significant, but I think that within the Trump Administration there is still considerable debate over what will come next,\" he adds.\n\nAsked if the US was going to war against Venezuela, the Trump told CBS' 60 Minutes on 3 November: \"I doubt it… But they've been treating us very badly.\"\n\nThe Venezuelan government has accused the US of stoking tensions in the region, with the aim of toppling the government.\n\nIn response in November they declared a \"massive mobilisation\" of troops, which saw 200,000 personnel sent across the country.\n\n\"Overall, I believe the pace of strikes against targets at sea will increase in the near future, while the United States tries to make up its mind about whether it can strike inside Venezuela,\" says Mr Zieman.\n\nBetween 2 September and 19 November, US forces hit at least 22 vessels in 21 separate strikes in international waters, both in the Caribbean and in the eastern Pacific.\n\nThe majority of these strikes have taken place off the coasts of Venezuela and Colombia.\n\nUS Southern Command  announced that its latest strike , conducted on Saturday in eastern Pacific international waters, killed three \"male narco-terrorists\" on board.\n\nCollectively, at least 83 people have been killed, according to statements from US officials.\n\nWhile US forces have not publicly identified the people killed, they have alleged they were all \"narco-terrorists\".\n\nAn  investigation from the Associated Press reported  that several Venezuelan nationals killed in the strikes were low-level traffickers driven by poverty to a life of crime, as well as at least one local crime boss.\n\nTrump and members of his administration have justified the strikes as a necessary to stem the flow of narcotics from Latin America to the US.\n\nIn a statement, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said that the campaign - which has been officially named Operation Southern Spear - is aimed at removing \"narco-terrorists from our hemisphere\" and securing the US from \"the drugs that are killing our people\".\n\nIn some cases, US officials have claimed that the targets were tied to Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang designated as a foreign terrorist organisation by the Trump administration at the start of the year.\n\nBut little information about the targets or what drug trafficking organisations they allegedly belonged to has been officially released by the Pentagon.\n\nThe Trump administration has insisted that the strikes are legal, justifying them as a necessary self-defence measure aimed at saving American lives.\n\nBut some legal experts have said the strikes could be illegal and violate international law by targeting civilians, with no due process afforded to the suspects.\n\nAdditional reporting by Tom Edgington and Bernd Debusmann Jr. Graphics by Leo Scutt-Richter."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8030m1g2ygo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"00:32:00.723+00:00","title":"Friday-night drug deals helping Russian war machine, UK crime agency warns","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The UK National Crime Agency (NCA) has warned that everyday drug deals in Britain—such as buying cocaine on a Friday night—can indirectly fund Russia’s war machine through a vast criminal ecosystem.

helping Russian war machine, UK crime agency warns\n\nBuying cocaine on a Friday night in Britain can indirectly help Russian arms factories, the National Crime Agency (NCA) has warned.\n\nThe NCA said a man linked to a Russian-led money-laundering network operating in the UK had bought a bank in Kyrgyzstan which was used to make payments on behalf of the Russian war machine.\n\nSal Melki, the agency's Deputy Director for Economic Crime, said it was a \"vast criminal ecosystem that is funding some really bad things all around the world\".\n\nThe NCA is trying to disrupt the network from top to bottom, even putting adverts in UK motorway service station toilets to warn couriers carrying cash for the money-launderers of the lengthy jail sentences they face.\n\nThe investigation into Russian money laundering is called Operation Destabilise.\n\nLast year  the NCA said it had identified two networks  called TGR and Smart that worked together to process cash for drugs gangs, suppliers of illegal firearms and people smugglers.\n\nInvestigators have now discovered that George Rossi, who heads up TGR, bought a bank in Kyrgyzstan.\n\nRossi bought the bank through his company Altair Holding SA. On Christmas Day 2024, Altair Holding SA took a 75% stake in Keremet Bank.\n\nFurther work showed that Keremet Bank was facilitating payments for a Russian state-owned bank called Promsvyazbank (PSB) which is  described by the US treasury as a \"sanctions evasion hub\".\n\nThe NCA says Keremet Bank was helping PSB make payments for \"Russia's military-industrial base\", in other words, for the arms factories making weapons for the Ukraine war.\n\nAt street level TGR and Smart provide a \"full spectrum of money-laundering services\", the NCA said.\n\nThey allow people like drug dealers and suppliers of illegal firearms to swap their cash for cryptocurrency.\n\nInvestigators say the money-laundering network was operating in at least 28 towns and cities across the UK \"sustaining an entire architecture that allows crime to pay in our country\".\n\nThe NCA's Sal Melki said: \"We can't ignore the sheer scale of this threat.\"\n\nHe said: \"We can draw a thread between somebody buying cocaine on a Friday night in the UK, all the way through to geopolitical events that are causing suffering across the world.\n\n\"It's not as simple as 'OK, I pay my drug dealer and that is the end of it'. This is actually a vast criminal ecosystem, that is funding some really bad things all around the world.\n\n\"We can say with certainty that laundering street cash is really critical to underpinning how serious crime works in our country.\"\n\nHe also said that his investigators had discovered that the Smart network run by Ekaterina Zhdanova had provided financial services to the  ring of spies led by Bulgarian Orlin Roussev , who tracked Russia's enemies across Europe. Zhdanova is currently in custody in France awaiting trial.\n\nOperation Destabilise began by tracking the activity of the  ransomware group Evil Corp , but ended up uncovering \"eye-watering scales\" of money-laundering, the NCA said. Smart and TGR were trading \"billions of pounds of criminal wealth\".\n\nThe money they collected was laundered through cash-rich businesses such as construction, or bundled up in \"stash houses\" and taken out of the country to be laundered overseas.\n\nSometimes the cash was smuggled out hidden in boxes of washing powder and baby formula.\n\nAmong those linked to the groups are  former Hibernian footballer James Keatings , and Semen Kuksov and Andrii Dzektsa, who the NCA say laundered money for the Irish Kinahan drugs cartel.\n\nTwo men convicted this year, Valeriy Popovych and Vitaliy Lutsak, were buying vehicles in the UK and driving them to Ukraine where they   sold the vehicles for cryptocurrency. One spreadsheet suggested they had laundered £6.63m of dirty British cash just between August 2022 and June 2023.\n\nAt the bottom rung of the ladders, the money-launderers need couriers to move criminal cash around the country.\n\nThe couriers typically earn a commission of 0.5%. So moving £100,000 earns them £500. But they can get prison sentences of five years or more.\n\n\"You own all the risk,\" Mr Melki warned them.\n\nAdverts have been placed above urinals in motorway service stations in Russian and English warning that \"moving money for organised criminal might seem like easy work. But it ends with hard time\".\n\nThe NCA's Mr Melki said: \"We're communicating with them directly in their own language to say: the walls are closing in.\n\n\"We know who you are, and we're coming for you.\"\n\nIf you, or someone you know, have been affected by addiction, support is available  via BBC Action Line"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8v8k8mlego","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"01:17:06.411+00:00","title":"COP30: India's delayed action plan raises eyebrows at UN climate summit","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"At COP30 in Belem, Brazil, India's delayed submission of its updated Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) plan has drawn widespread international criticism, despite India's claim of meeting its 2030 non-fossil fuel electricity target.

2025-11-21T01:17:06.411+00:00\n\nTitle: COP30: India's delayed action plan raises eyebrows at UN climate summit\n\nAt this year's UN climate summit (COP30), under way in Brazil's Belem city, all eyes are on India - the world's third largest carbon emitter.\n\nIndia has not yet submitted a key climate plan that countries are required to do every five years, even as international assessments have deemed India's climate action as being \"worryingly inadequate\". Delhi has argued otherwise.\n\nKnown as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), the updated plan from each member country to the UN Framework Climate Convention (UNFCC) is expected to have more ambitious carbon reduction targets as the world has failed to make the required level of cuts to avoid dangerous global warming.\n\nSo far, around 120 of the 196 member countries of the UNFCCC have submitted their updated plans and India is among the remaining ones.\n\nThe Paris climate agreement signed in 2015 has the goal of limiting average global temperature rise to well below 2C and to strive for 1.5C to avert drastic climate change.\n\nThe  United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) says  that by 2035, annual emissions will have to be reduced by 35% and 55%, compared with 2019, to align with the goals of the Paris agreement.\n\nBut emissions have continued to rise almost every year since then, and the  climate plans submitted  to the UNFCCC until 10 November show that there will be emissions reduction of only around 12% by 2035 – that too if countries fully implement their policies.\n\nUNEP warns that current emission policies put the world on track for 2.8C of warming this century, underscoring the need for far more ambitious carbon-cutting targets.\n\nThe first deadline for the updated climate plan (NDC3) was February, but it was extended until September as more than 90% of member countries failed to meet it.\n\nAll eyes were on top emitters like China, India and the European Union, also because US President Donald Trump once again announced his country's exit from the Paris agreement, leaving the world wondering if other major emitters would offer to plug the gap.\n\nBut many countries missed the September deadline too. While some began to submit their plans before COP30, there were expectations that the remaining would do so during the climate meet in Belem.\n\nSome have done so, but India kept the world guessing until environment minister Bhupender Yadav, who led the country's delegation in Belem, told the media this week that Delhi would submit its plan only by the end of December.\n\nSo, why has India delayed submitting its climate plan, even though it could mean inviting negative press during COP30?\n\nThough it has not explained its stance, Delhi appears keen to highlight a view shared by many developing nations: that rich countries bear historic responsibility to slash emissions and provide far greater financial support to the developing world.\n\nA week before COP30 kicked off, Yadav wrote an opinion piece in the Economic Times newspaper where he argued that \"global climate progress can't come from endless discussions alone\".\n\n\"For too long, the world has been caught in a cycle of negotiations, while the planet's distress signal grows louder. While dialogue is important, action is imperative,\" he wrote.\n\nWhile  delivering India's statement at COP30 , Yadav seemed to expand on this argument.\n\n\"Developed countries must reach net zero far earlier than current target dates and deliver new, additional and concessional climate finance at a scale of trillions, not billions,\" he said.\n\nIndian officials, like many negotiators from the developing world, argue that their updated climate plans with more ambitious carbon reduction targets will mean nothing if they do not receive financial and technological support from developed countries.\n\nThe Paris climate agreement requires developed countries to provide financial support to the developing world, but it has remained a contentious issue.\n\nThe last COP in Baku, Azerbaijan, saw angry reactions from the developing world when developed countries said they would provide $300bn (£229bn) annually as climate finance by 2035, while poor countries were demanding more than $1tn.\n\nDeveloping countries also say there has been no clarity and transparency on how the $300bn will be provided, and that developed countries are pushing for private finance which will burden poor countries with loans.\n\nMeanwhile, some developed countries have argued that fast-emerging economies like China and India should also contribute to the global climate finance pot.\n\n\"The best way to make sure that Europe can sustain that [the climate finance it has been providing] is by inviting others who have the ability to do so… to chip in,\" Wopke Hoekstra, climate commissioner at the European Commission, told a press conference at COP30.\n\nWithout naming any country, he said in many cases (such other countries) have far higher GDP per capita than a vast majority of European member states.\n\nIndia says it shouldn't be pressed for a more ambitious climate plan as it has already met a key pledge - to have 50% of its installed electricity capacity from non-fossil fuel sources - years ahead of the 2030 deadline.\n\nGlobal assessments praise this but also flag other challenges.\n\nClimate Action Tracker - an independent scientific project that tracks government climate action and measures it against the globally agreed Paris agreement - has rated India's climate targets and actions as \" highly insufficient \".\n\nIt has pointed out that coal's share in India's total electricity generation continues to be around 75%, while it must drop to at least 19% to align the country's climate action with the global goal of limiting temperature rise to 1.5C.\n\nAnother report released at COP30 has also underscored India's over-dependence on coal.\n\nIn the  Climate Change Performance Index , published by environmental think-tank GermanWatch, India slipped 13 spots over the past year to rank 23rd on the list of 63 countries and the EU.\n\n\"India's national pathway is still anchored in coal and there is no national coal exit timeline and new coal blocks continue to be auctioned,\" a report by the think-tank noted.\n\nAccording to the recent  UN emissions gap report , India saw the highest increase in greenhouse gas emissions in 2024 compared to the previous year, followed by China and Indonesia.\n\nBut the world's largest carbon emitter China, usually India's ally at climate negotiations to counter developed countries, has already submitted its updated climate plan.\n\nAnd now COP30 is also discussing whether there should be an announcement of a roadmap for the world to transition away from fossil fuels.\n\nIt remains to be seen if criticism around India's dependence on coal will influence its updated climate plan, which it has committed to submit before this year ends."},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/11/20/us/typewriter-repair-seattle-bremerton.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"05:04:50-05:00","title":"How to Fix a Typewriter and Your Life","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Paul Lundy, a former facilities manager in Seattle, discovers a dying trade — typewriter repair — after reading an article about 92-year-old Bob Montgomery, a master craftsman who had maintained typewriter repair in Bremerton for over 70 years.

Life\n\nPublished: 2025-11-20T05:04:50-05:00\n\nEleven years ago, Paul Lundy was dying a slow, workingman’s death under fluorescent light.\n\nFor three decades, he had worked in facilities management — an honest trade that ground him down until, in his mid-50s, he had money, an authoritative title and a soul that was being sucked dry. He managed buildings for Seattle-area biotech firms, where people in lab coats made discoveries that saved lives. He kept the infrastructure running. He was good at it, maybe great, but facilities managers are overhead, essential but invisible. Nobody notices until something breaks.\n\nLundy had reached a ceiling. No college degree meant no room to grow in a world that valued credentials above experience. Retirement at 65 stretched before him like a prison sentence. The three-hour commute was killing him — a ritual that thousands endure to afford living near Seattle.\n\n“Fun was not what you would call it anymore,” allows Lundy, a trim, neatly pleated man with a soft, welcoming face.\n\nOne Sunday morning in 2014, he opened The Seattle Times and found a feature story about Bob Montgomery, age 92, known to friends, customers and locals simply as Mr. Montgomery. The article read like an obituary for a vanishing trade — fixing typewriters — suggesting that when Mr. Montgomery went, seven decades of expertise would vanish into the digital ether.\n\nLundy read it once, then a second time. He had never given old typewriters much thought, but something stirred in him that he could not quite name. He showed the story to his wife, Lisa.\n\n“I think this might be it,” he told her. The next weekend, he drove to Bremerton, a weary naval town an hour’s ferry ride away and a world apart from gleaming, digitized Seattle.\n\nFinding Mr. Montgomery’s shop required determination. No sign marked the building; no indication that inside, five floors up, a master craftsman was keeping alive skills that predated the computer age. You took an elevator that groaned. When the doors opened, you knew immediately you were in the right place: a 1916 Royal Model 10 typewriter stood guard outside an open door, and the air smelled like oil. Once inside, you encountered a shop stacked and stuffed with typewriters — Underwoods and Coronas, Royal KMMs and Remington Portable 3s.\n\nHe was small, frail, bent by osteoporosis enough that “he had a right angle,” Lundy says.\n\nBut his hands moved across the typewriter before him with unconscious grace, removing screws without looking, adjusting linkages by feel alone.\n\n“Welcome to the crazy house,” Mr. Montgomery said, his standard greeting.\n\nLundy had planned to stay 20 minutes. He stayed four hours. What captured him was not nostalgia. What captured him was watching Mr. Montgomery work, the old man dismantling a machine while carrying on a conversation, barely glancing at the complexity beneath his fingers.\n\nMr. Montgomery had grown up in Depression-era Seattle, the son of a typewriter repairman who had a shop in the city’s downtown. When he was not learning the trade, he would sneak through alleyways into grand old theaters to watch rehearsals, developing a love for performance that would shape his life nearly as much as typewriters.\n\nThen came World War II. Drafted at 18, he expected to carry a rifle through Europe. But the Army discovered his skill and put him to work fixing typewriters at Supreme Allied Command. “Probably saved his life,” Lundy says. After the war, his family opened Bremerton Office Machine Company in 1947. For the next 70 years, Mr. Montgomery stayed within a few blocks of downtown Bremerton, always fixing typewriters, even as the world abandoned them.\n\nWhat Lundy discovered over the following months was that Mr. Montgomery knew how to patiently stretch everything — even a meal. Lundy began taking him to lunch every Saturday, and their meals became meditations. Mr. Montgomery would order a BLT with avocado and make it last 90 minutes, telling stories between bites and savoring every morsel as only someone who had grown up without much could.\n\nOther than a sister in California, he had no family. He slept in the back of his shop on an orange vinyl hide-a-bed couch. At 92, he existed almost completely outside the system.\n\nLundy had been a 20-minute lunch guy his entire career — eat fast, back to work, back to the grind. Now, somehow, he found himself slowing down, learning a different rhythm. Lunches became a practice in patience, a different way of being in the world.\n\n“Mr. Montgomery was such a nice guy,” Lundy says, emphasizing “such.” The old man made him feel seen. And listened to. Like everything mattered.\n\nAfter a few months, Lundy noticed typewriters stacking up faster than Mr. Montgomery could repair them. Business had surged after the article. “Can I help?” Lundy asked one day.\n\nMr. Montgomery said yes. Lundy started coming after his facilities job, heading straight to the shop. Mr. Montgomery set him up a bench with a typewriter and photocopied repair manual pages. He left him to figure things out.\n\nLundy’s hands, accustomed to managing air-conditioning systems, had to learn a new language — to feel the difference between correct tension and too loose or too tight. When he thought a repair was perfect, he brought it to Mr. Montgomery, who tested it with quick fingers dancing across the keys and, invariably, pronounced: “That is not what I would have done.”\n\nHe showed Lundy the right way. No anger. No frustration. Just quiet insistence that good enough was not good enough.\n\nSometimes Mr. Montgomery would partly disassemble a machine and leave it on Lundy’s bench — a test, a puzzle, a method of teaching as old as apprenticeship itself.\n\n“It’s like Zen,” Lundy says about those hours at the bench. “There are times when it is just very relaxing to be standing in front of the machine and slowly cleaning it, tweaking the adjustment so visually things start to really line up.”\n\nOne Saturday Lundy arrived at the shop to find men with clipboards pointing at Mr. Montgomery’s equipment. They were evicting him, readying everything for the dumpster; 13 months of unpaid rent had finally caught up.\n\nLundy could not abide the thought of all that knowledge lost, all that skill and history being tossed away. He called his wife. “They’re kicking him out!” he said. “My whole opportunity might be lost. I think this might be what I want to do.”\n\n“You’ve done crazier things,” she replied. “Do it.”\n\nThe building manager arrived next, spelling out the cost: 13 months at $200 per month, equaling $2,600 total. For Mr. Montgomery, who had maybe $200 in the bank, this was insurmountable. For Lundy, with his steady salary, it was doable.\n\n“I will pay his back rent if I buy his business,” Lundy told the manager. “I’ll pay monthly rent going forward.”\n\nThe eviction crew left. Mr. Montgomery, who had watched the chaos with the remote calm of an elder, looked at Lundy and said just one word: “OK.”\n\nLundy bought the business at the end of 2014. Soon, he quit his job and walked away from its stultifying steadiness, its salary and benefits. His colleagues were sure he had lost his mind. But Lundy knew he was trading security for meaning, predictability for possibility. “I was happy,” he says simply.\n\nFor the next few years, Lundy and Mr. Montgomery worked side by side in that cramped fifth-floor shop. Mr. Montgomery was still the master, but he was slowing, taking longer naps. More and more often, he would look at a typewriter that had come in for repair and turn to Lundy: “You do this one.”\n\nThe teaching continued, deeper now, Mr. Montgomery pulling tools off the pegboard — tools he had organized decades ago, many he had made himself, his initials etched in the handles. “He knew everything about every typewriter, just off the top of his head,” Lundy says. “I know maybe 10 percent of what he knew. Maybe.”\n\nEventually Mr. Montgomery would watch his student work and deliver his highest praise: “You are OK.”\n\nBy the time Mr. Montgomery reached his mid-90s, life was catching up with him. His friends had intervened, helping him sign up for the veteran and Social Security benefits he had never claimed and finding him subsidized housing at a nearby retirement home — his first real home in decades. But he kept coming to the shop regularly, taking the bus in the morning. The bus drivers knew Mr. Montgomery and seemed to have memorized his routine — if he was running a bit late, they would wait.\n\nMr. Montgomery fell and broke his hip. His health declined fast, the way it does when the very old finally succumb to gravity. One afternoon, Lundy visited him in his apartment and threw out uneaten food that had accumulated in the refrigerator. Mr. Montgomery watched for a while, then said quietly: “I’m glad you did this.”\n\nBoth men knew he was talking about Lundy continuing the tradition at the shop.\n\nMr. Montgomery died in September 2018, at age 96. Full military honors were held at the cemetery. Lundy gave the eulogy, his voice breaking as he tried to convey the sum of a man who had lived through the Depression and World War II, who had become an iconic community fixture and spent 70 years fixing machines the world had forgotten, who had worked until the very end because work was who he was.\n\nWhat neither man could have known was that they had been standing at the edge of the typewriter’s unlikely resurrection. The revival began quietly in temples of analog nostalgia — think Brooklyn coffee shops and Portland boutique hotels. Tom Hanks became an unlikely patron saint, writing a book about typewriters, collecting hundreds of them. Then came 2020. Everyone stuck at home, screens everywhere, Zoom fatigue setting in. People craved something tangible. Typewriter sales exploded.\n\n“The kids get it,” Lundy says. “They’re not trying to be nostalgic for something they never experienced. They’re trying to escape what they experience every day.”\n\nNow it is a Saturday morning. October 2025. Paul Lundy hunches over an IBM Selectric, a machine nearly 50 years old, probing its guts with the delicate touch he learned from Mr. Montgomery. The machine has taken its share of falls. Oil and dust have conspired over decades to form clogging sludge. Dog hair, too — there always seems to be dog hair.\n\nHe keeps solvent flowing, working back and forth through the brown muck, treating the dirt not as debris but as the accumulated record of life lived hunched over a keyboard — the residue of a marriage proposal, a first novel, a military order, a last will and testament.\n\nHis shop is different now. Brighter, airier, on the main floor of a building that was wasting away in downtown Bremerton until Lundy cobbled together enough savings to buy and renovate it, using all those facilities management skills he thought he’d left behind. He had kept the business in that cramped fifth-floor space for six years after Mr. Montgomery’s death. Management was planning apartments, Lundy says, so he wound up here — in a 1910 building that once housed a local electric utility’s headquarters.\n\nFrom the basement below his wooden floors comes the thump of bass guitar, the crash of drums. Rock bands practice during many of his working hours. The structure shakes with enthusiasm. He smiles, tugs on his workman’s apron, adjusts his black-framed glasses and does not lose attention.\n\nHe clicks a return button. The Selectric whirs. He listens.\n\n“The problems you see — and sometimes the problems you hear,” he says, wryly, as he adjusts the operational shaft, “are not always the real problem.”\n\nNow the stubborn machine is yielding its secrets at last. Lundy has flushed its brown sludge, freed its operational shaft, oiled the precise points where metal meets metal.\n\nMr. Montgomery’s soul fills this space. The 1916 Royal Model 10 that stood guard at the old shop stands here now. There’s his woolen hat. There’s a photo from Bremerton’s Bob Montgomery Day, which he bristled at because he didn’t like attention. There are his community theater awards — best director, again and again — testament to the love of performance that began in those old Seattle theaters. There sit his notes, repair manuals and tools: blue-handled wrenches, metallic probes, soft-bristled brushes. Mr. Montgomery’s bench is where Lundy works.\n\n“It’ll always be his,” Lundy says of the shop, now called Bremerton Typewriter Company. “I am just borrowing it.”\n\nLundy’s wife, Lisa, works at her own bench. She started learning repair work during the pandemic and became proficient, helping with the backlog.\n\nThe phone rings steadily; customers call from as far as Florida, New York and beyond. The novelist who needs an escape from the internet’s magnetic pull; the screenwriter convinced that only keys that fight back can force out good work; the teenagers who have just found a grandmother’s pristine Corona, a grandfather’s portable Hermes.\n\nIt is Lundy who takes on apprentices now. He teaches the way Mr. Montgomery did: patiently letting mistakes happen because mistakes educate best. It’s a steady transfer of knowledge, a careful passing of the seemingly arcane, a customer-is-always-right way of doing business.\n\nWant to come in and type a poem on a 1920s Underwood? Sure, take a seat, don’t rush.\n\n“Gotta lay out the red carpet for our elderly customers,” Lundy says. “People forget that when you were younger, you did things. You made a difference. Then you get old and society just sees an old guy waiting for the bus, and it’s almost like you don’t exist.”\n\nThis year, Paul Lundy turned 65. Had he stayed in his old job he would have retired, probably on his birthday. Instead, he is working six days a week and smiling through it: “I cannot imagine stopping.”\n\nProduced by Gray Beltran, Jenni Lee and Stephen Reiss. Audio produced by Jack D’Isidoro.\n\n"}]}
